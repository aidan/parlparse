On resuming&#151;
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. For the convenience of members of the Committee, I shall remind them where we were before we broke for dinner. We are discussing amendment No. 34 to schedule 6, which was proposed by Mr. Jack. Mr. Heathcoat-Amory had just finished speaking.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> One interesting aspect of working on the climate change levy has been that, in the midst of all the representations about its various aspects and how it can be improved and modified, there has been a steady flow of letters from ordinary individuals calling on their Members of Parliament to ensure that the Government did not back down on the levy. Those letters have been forwarded to me, and I have enjoyed reading them. On 8 October, the hon. Member for Ludlow (Mr. Gill) wrote to me attaching a letter from a constituent, who wrote:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> It is vital that the levy is not watered down.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I was able to reassure the hon. Gentleman that the levey would not be watered down, but that we would be sticking to our guns. No doubt my letter was forwarded to his constituent, although whether the hon. Gentleman told his constituent that his right hon. and hon. Friends might try to water it down, I do not know. Much concern has been expressed that the levy should go on the statute book, as a result of which benefits would be achieved for the environment.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Wells asked me for data. The best that I can do is to refer him to the figures under chapter 6 of the Red Book under the heading ``Protecting the Environment''. Chart 6.2 sets out our projections for greenhouse gas emissions and shows that we are on track to achieve the Kyoto objective in 2010, but only by a small margin. It also demonstrates that the emissions will at that point be on a rising trajectory. The chart incorporates the expected effects of lifting the stricter consents policy. I can answer several of the points made by Opposition Members by observing that, as far as I can establish, the impact of the three years that we have had of the stricter consents policy in 10 years' time&#151;in 2010&#151;will be so small that it will make no impact at all on chart 6.2.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> I am grateful to the Financial Secretary for drawing attention to chart 6.2. Will he go into a little more detail? He surprised me when he said that the consents moratorium that was being lifted was already factored in. It would be interesting to know when that information entered the equation. Given my earlier comments, how much of the target has been factored in from the lifting of the moratorium?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> There has possibly been a misunderstanding on the part of Conservative Members. The stricter consents policy was always presented as a temporary measure pending the introduction of the new electricity trading arrangements. That was made clear from the outset. The lifting of that policy is not a U-turn, as the right hon. Member for Wells suggested. It was always the case that it was to be lifted once the arrangements were in place and an announcement was made to that effect. The expectation therefore was that the policy would be lifted to allow new gas-powered stations to be built in the two or three years after the turn of the millennium. When that chart was put together, we were expecting that 2004 would be the first full year in which the effect of the new power stations would be included. But the other elements in this equation are not static. Other changes are going on. A significant increase in emissions is expected from the transport sector.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> The Department of Trade and Industry states that 42 billion kWhours of generating capacity is affected by the moratorium. How much of that moratoriumised capacity is factored into chart 6.2 on page 108 of the Red Book?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> All the extra gas-powered capacity that we expect to occur between now and 2010 is factored into that. I do not have the figures to hand. Our draft climate change programme that we issued for consultation in March assumed that the current consents policy would end in sufficient time for some new plants to be built to operate for the whole of 2005. I apologise; I think that I said 2004 a few moments ago. It was assumed that the new plant would operate for the whole of 2005 and, given that the policy is to be lifted later this year, that is broadly in line with what we now expect will happen. The DTI view is that the announcement on the stricter consents policy will have little effect on the level of emissions by 2010. I hope that I have been able to make that clear. Chart 6.2 shows that we are on track to meet the Kyoto objective, although not by a large margin. It fully reflects the lifting of the stricter consents policy. There is no alternative that would allow us to meet the objective without the other measures that we are taking.
<P>
Together with the negotiated agreements with the energy-intensive sectors, the levy is estimated to save at least 5 million tonnes of carbon a year by 2010. It is therefore an important part of our draft climate change programme. We have always made it clear that the stricter consents policy was a temporary measure. We have, and must have, a long-term goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving energy efficiency in business. That task will not be finished by 2005 or even by 2010. It must be a long-term commitment. We need to work together with business to achieve that. I hope that the Committee will reject the amendment and leave the schedule as it stands.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> I have listened carefully to the Financial Secretary. I thank him for his courteous reply. I have looked carefully at the words in paragraph 6.9 on page 107 of the Red Book, which is the descriptive precursor to the content of chart 6.2. There is no mention of the gas moratorium in that section of the report. I am always ready to admit to a sin of omission and of not seeing something that may be in another part of the document, but that section enunciates the principal areas of energy saving, which the Government believe will help them to be broadly on track to meet their Kyoto targets. The moratorium is not mentioned.
<P>
It is difficult to judge whether what the Financial Secretary said undermines the amendment, when we do not know&#151;and he is unable to supply the Committee with the figures at this stage&#151;how much of the 42,000 million kW hours represented by the 15 proposals for gas-fired capacity is factored in. As I told the Committee earlier, the 42,000 kW hours represents&#151;
<P>
<B>Mr. Clapham:</B> Six gigawatts.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> Indeed&#151;the hon. Gentleman is an expert in this field. It represents double the generating capacity of gas that would be required to meet the Government's own target for the climate change levy. We should remember that these 15 proposals were real proposals put forward by real business people who saw an opportunity to develop new sources of electricity generation. We are not talking about an airy-fairy, untried technology. Fifteen proposals were notified to the Department of Trade and Industry, so they were obviously the subject of its consideration when granting consents.
<P>
One proposal was for a station not far from my constituency in Fleetwood, which would have used a novel form of gas storage in the former salt mines of the ICI works. I know how far advanced that local project was. I am sure that many others caught by the postponement of the consents must be included as realistic projects among those before the Committee. I am not minded to leave matters where they are unless the Financial Secretary can give me more comfort about the numbers involved.
<P>
The Financial Secretary should, in a way, support me because his data related to gas coming onstream by 2005. I was heartened that I had chosen to include that year in my amendment. Given the complexity of the Bill&#151;as we shall see later, subsequent amendments probe aspects that are not yet specified, especially in the context of combined heat and power&#151;it may be in the Government's interest to buy themselves more thinking time. If they insist on pursuing this method of saving energy, they could then carry it out in a less burdensome, less bureaucratic, less complex and better thought out way. The lifting of the gas moratorium and the amendment would provide the Government with that opportunity.
<P>
The Financial Secretary went to some length in telling us what right hon. and hon. Members had written to him about. In his reply, he said that everyone was committed to achieving the objectives of the climate change levy. I share that view, but he did not read out any paragraphs from those letters that commented on the logic behind those statements. If all right hon. and hon. Members had seen some of the representations that Conservative Members had received, they would realise that many responsible members of British industry are arguing cogently about the drawbacks of the Government's approach.
<P>
The amendment is sensible, simple in application and would leave the Government the option of legislation while providing them with a moratorium on thinking, so that the gas-fired capacity coming on stream can start the process of reducing carbon-dioxide emissions in a much less complex way than under the schedule.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I support my right hon. Friend even more enthusiastically in the light of the Financial Secretary's wholly inadequate response to our specific questions. He drew our attention to chart 6.2, which remarkably shows that carbon emissions were falling steeply during the period of office of the previous Government, but about now they suddenly flatten out and then start to rise again&#151;even in the light of the Government's proposed tax. The Government therefore presumably recognise the failure of all their other energy efficiency programmes or are trying to justify the tax by showing, without any supporting documentation or figures, a sudden upturn&#151;or at least a flattening out followed by an upturn&#151;in carbon emissions.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> I draw the right hon. Gentleman's attention to the fact that during the period of the previous Government, the decline in carbon emissions was almost entirely accidental rather than policy-driven and had something to do with the loss of 2,750,000 manufacturing jobs and most of our heavy industry.
<P>
<H5>8.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> The hon. Gentleman is wrong about that. The more he speaks about the subject, the more I lose faith in the capacity of the Liberal Democrats even to analyse the problem, let alone advance any solution to it. He seems simply to want to make a partisan point. We had in place&#151;I had first-hand knowledge of it&#151;a programme of energy efficiency that was clearly successful. The hon. Gentleman fails to take account of the fact that manufacturing jobs are still being lost; why, therefore, does the trend not continue downwards?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clapham:</B> I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for making that point. As he knows full well, the fall in carbon dioxide is related to the fact that the coal industry was closed down and coal generation greatly restricted. Coal mining communities bore the brunt; in fact, the measure was almost a tax on them. It was imposed when the right hon. Gentleman was involved in the Government and in the energy sector. I am perplexed by his support for the right hon. Member for Fylde, who asked why the Government were taking those actions. It is clear from the explanation given on page 108 of the Red Book that the Government want to share out the burden much more fairly than in the past and that they want all parts of the community to share in the cost of the cutbacks.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I remind the hon. Gentleman that he is making an intervention.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</B><I> rose&#151;</I><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Member for Barnsley, West and Penistone may want to finish, although I repeat that he is making an intervention.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clapham:</B> I take your direction, Dr. Clark. My point is that the fall in CO2 has been shown. The Government's programme is also clear.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> The hon. Gentleman suggests that the burden should be shared more generally, but the tax is payable only by the business sector. One criticism is that it entirely exempts the domestic sector, in which emissions continue to increase. The hon. Gentleman referred to the switch from coal to gas. That occured under the previous Government and continues under the present Government, encouraged by the Government's lifting of the moratorium on gas. However, what is remarkable&#151;as my right hon. Friend the Member the Fylde said&#151;is that it does not appear in the description accompanying the chart and that no reference is made to the switch to gas-fired electricity generation. Yet we know that that process continues.
<P>
The Minister asserted that the lifting of the moratorium would have little effect on carbon emissions by the year 2010. That assertion needs to be supported by some facts and figures. It is no good the hon. Gentleman simply claiming that the switch to gas is irrelevant or too small to measure&#151;when we all know that a number of gas-burning power station schemes that were held up are now going ahead.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> Does my right hon. Friend agree that the detail that we have requested in terms of meeting targets will also be vital if the Committee is to adjudge the validity of subsequent amendments, which may also challenge other aspects of how the target will be achieved?
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I agree with my right hon. Friend. We will need that information if we are to debate such matters thoroughly. Many mysteries remain. We hear that the chart was drawn up on the basis that the moratorium would be lifted. Why, then, was it not announced earlier? It resulted in weeks and months of further damage to British industry. Among those damaged was Britannia Zinc&#151;a firm near my constituency that I discussed earlier&#151;which would have loved to have been told earlier that the Government were assuming that the relevant consents would go ahead.
<P>
We are in the dark on this matter. The Financial Secretary has refused my right hon. Friend's reasonable request that he should tell the Committee, and quantify, some of the relevant factors in chart 6.2, as well as justifying the need for the tax. That information has not so far been forthcoming. Unless he wishes to answer our request, I shall be inclined to support my right hon. Friend in pressing the amendment to a Division.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I did not say that the switch to gas would have an unmeasurable effect. I said that three years of stricter consents policy would not, by 2010, have a lasting effect on emissions levels. I am not saying that additional gas-powered plant coming on stream will not have an effect; it will. As I said, the assumption behind chart 6.2 is that plant will be in place in sufficient time for it to operate for the whole of 2005. My point is that that is allowed for fully in chart 6.2.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> Will the Financial Secretary provide, for the benefit of the Committee, a detailed breakdown of the assumptions and formula that were used to determine the scope of chart 6.2? I may be having difficulties in fully appreciating the weight of the argument that he is advancing. I would be aided in that task if I knew more precisely how the chart had come about.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> It might help if I tell the Committee that chart 6.2 is consistent with the content of the draft climate change programme, which was issued for consultation in March. Those figures were explained in more detail in the working paper on UK energy projections, which was issued by the DTI as work in progress on 9 March, and which will provide the right hon. Gentleman with more detail about how the chart has been put together. I must remind the Committee of the crucial point that an easy solution, which resolves the problem without causing difficulty to anybody, does not exist. Additional gas-powered plant coming on stream from 2005 does not mean that our problems with emissions will be magically solved, and chart 6.2 already fully takes account of that. As a former Secretary of State for the Environment in the previous Government said, it is a difficult process that requires long-term changes in behaviour. That is why the climate change levy is so imporant.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> I am sorry, Dr. Clark, but I am not satisfied that the Committee has heard a thorough answer. When Ministers fall back on dismissive remarks such as ``no easy solution'', I begin to think that those on the Treasury Bench have run out of ideas. The words of the Minister for Energy and Competitiveness in Europe in her parliamentary answer are interesting. When I tabled the question about the climate change levy and how much transfer between gas and coal would have to take place, which is the basis of the amendment, she said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> The climate change levy is expected to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by at least 2MtC&#151;<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I gather that that means 2 million tonnes of carbon&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>a year, before including the effect of negotiated agreements.&#151;(Official Report, 2 February 2000: Vol. 343, c. 605W.)<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Those negotiated agreements would also be factored in.
<P>
Is there an element of extra counting? A Department of Trade and Industry Minister tells me that the introduction into service of half the gas-fired power stations affected by the moratorium produces the climate change levy saving in carbon dioxide. However, the same answer advises me that there are additional negotiated agreements. That makes me begin to think that adding to the effects that the Treasury says come from the tax, even discounting any factoring in of gas, suggests that chart 6.2 may be in question or that there may be an element of double counting.
<P>
Until I know what the facts are, I accept that I may be wrong, but the Financial Secretary has done little to convince those of us in Opposition what the facts are. He owes it to industry, which will be burdened by the tax, to say exactly where the savings of carbon will come from and who will bear the pain that he talked about. Some people think that they will be disproportionately disadvantaged, because they will receive no gain in quid pro quo terms from the extra cost of the levy through the reduction in national insurance charges. If they learned about the simple allowance of the market to move forward the gas-powered generation on the timetable that I proposed and which the Financial Secretary suggested underpinned his thinking, they would be happy to leave it alone and would for now, in some cases, be absolved of having to pay business-breaking taxes.
<P>
Later, we shall discuss the horticultural industry. Judging by some of the data that I have seen on it, there are some real show-stopper numbers for little companies that will struggle as a result of the measure. If they found that the moratorium on the gas lifting and levy could deal with the problem at a stroke, the Government would owe it to them to give it a chance. It still achieves its environmental objective, but without almost 83 pages of complex legislation.

<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 79, in page 133, line 17, after `electricity', insert `except where generated from renewable sources.'.
<P>
The amendment is an attempt to persuade the Government to reconsider exempting from the levy electricity generated from renewable sources. The Financial Secretary made the passing remark in a previous sitting that there was some sort of exemption. It is important for us to understand what the 83 and a bit pages of the schedule say and do not say. If I have fundamentally misunderstood them, I am sure that Labour Members will be happy to point that out. The schedule seems to require that all electricity, regardless of how it is generated, be subject to the levy. There is a proposal to recycle some of the levy to support technologies that are renewable in concept and which will generate electricity, but there is no direct exemption of electricity generated renewably.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I may be able to help the hon. Gentleman. Paragraph 18 of the schedule is entitled
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> Exemption: electricity from renewable sources.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is a complete exemption for energy generated from renewable sources and it is plainly built into the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> Energy generated from hydro-electric sources is specifically excluded from that&#151;or, perhaps I should say, specifically not included. The amendment would deal with that defect by making it clear that where electricity is generated by means of a renewable technology it will, without exception, be exempted from the levy.
<P>
In broad terms, just over 30 per cent. of our electricity is generated from coal, just over 30 per cent. is generated from gas and just over 30 per cent. is generated from nuclear energy; 4 or 5 per cent. comes from renewable sources. Even green electricity suppliers, who guarantee to take electricity solely from renewable sources, will not have the whole of their product automatically exempted. If the Financial Secretary believes that I have got that wrong, I am sure that he will tell me.
<P>
<B>Kali Mountford </B>(Colne Valley): I have just read paragraph 18 again and I cannot find an exhaustive list of exemptions. I can find only general conditions. Does that not cover the hon. Gentleman's point?
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> It remains to be seen, when we have a careful look through the text and when Ministers explain the details, whether it is I or they who cannot read the 83 pages of the schedule. The fact is that, although micro hydro-electricity can qualify for exemption from part of the levy, traditional hydro-electricity does not. If the Minister tells me that all forms of renewable generation, including traditional hydro-generation, are included, I shall be delighted. I do not believe that that is the case, but if he says that it is, my point will have been met and I will be happy to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
The Financial Secretary emphasised the point for me somewhat when we discussed the electrical supply to the china clay industry. Of course, the same points would apply to any other industry that was receiving electricity and subject to the levy. His phrase was that it was impossible to disentangle the electricity and that there was a mix, or an average. Perhaps he inadvertently misled himself and the Committee. However, that rather tends to confirm my view that electricity as supplied to a customer will not be disaggregated into electricity from renewable and non-renewable sources. The contention in the amendment is that electricity from renewable sources should be so exempted. If the Minister can assure me that it is, that if fine. If not, an average or a mix factor is not a sensible way forward; it is not a way of achieving the objectives that the Government themselves have set out.
<P>
There is no doubt that if one wants to support and develop renewables, it is necessary to give them a price advantage. Things may change over the coming decade, but at the moment electricity generated from gas is cheaper than electricity generated from any other source&#151;coal, nuclear energy or renewables. Gas will drive every other fuel out of the electricity market without exception, unless the Government send a clear signal that they do not want that to happen. Whether my point has been met is obviously a matter of interpretation. If it has been met, I shall willingly withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> It is, of course, one of the great benefits of the levy that it will tilt the energy playing field in favour of renewable energy sources by exempting those sources, as set out in paragraph 18 of schedule 6. We will discuss the slightly different exemption to encourage the use of combined heat and power sources. A significant chunk of the carbon dioxide emission savings that will result from the levy's implementation will arise from that element by encouraging the take-up of renewable power sources.
<P>
I must clarify two points in response to what the hon. Member for Hazel Grove said. First, to qualify for the exemption, the electricity must be supplied under contracts containing renewable source declarations, as set out in paragraph 18(1)(b). There must be a contract directly between the consumer and the electricity supplier that says that the power is renewable, because when someone inserts a plug into a wall socket they do not know how the electricity was generated. There must a clear contract that contains renewable source declarations. 
<P>
Secondly, the hon. Gentleman asked what exactly would count as renewable energy. We intend to stick close to the work that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry is carrying out in connection with the Utilities Bill and the renewables obligation that is being developed. We intend the definition of renewables to be the same for both purposes&#151;broadly, sources of energy other than fossil fuel or nuclear fuel&#151;but excluding large-scale hydro exceeding 10 MW capacity. We want to incentivise new forms of renewable energy instead of simply providing a reduced rate of levy for existing forms. That can be achieved by framing the exemption in that way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> I thank the Financial Secretary for this comments, which confirm my point. Does he agree that about 50 per cent. of United Kingdom electricity that is produced from renewable sources is from traditional, large-scale hydro schemes? If so, half of the current UK renewable electricity output will have to pay the levy, and purchasing from that source will not lead to a reduction in the bill or avoidance of the levy. Does he think that that is a sensible way forward?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> Yes, I do. We need to increase substantially the proportion of the nation's electricity generated from renewable sources. We have set a target of 10 per cent. by the year 2010, which will require substantial expansion of current capacity. It will also require the implementation of lots of new sources of energy&#151;wind power, short rotational coppicing and other forms. That is why the exemption is targeted precisely on new forms of renewable energy. There is little point in giving the reduction to initiatives that are already under way, as nothing is gained. New incentives for new forms of renewable energy will substantially boost the UK's renewable capability.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> Is the Financial Secretary saying that all renewable forms of energy that are current on Budget day or a certain date will have to pay the climate change levy, but all renewable forms that are current after that date will be exempt?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> No, I am not. I described the Government's definition to the Committee. The hon. Gentlemen are right&#151;we are excluding large-scale hydro exceeding 10 MW. That capacity is already in place, so there is no point in providing incentives for it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> The Minister's argument is illogical. Either all existing renewable forms of energy should be subject to the climate change levy, and only future forms should be exempt, or all forms of renewable energy should be exempt. The Financial Secretary's halfway stance&#151;that some forms of existing renewable energy should be exempt and some should not&#151;is illogical and inconsistent. That reinforces the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Hazel Grove.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> No, it is entirely logical. There is already a fully matured large-scale hydro capability in the UK, which will not expand further, so there is no point in providing it with incentives. However, incentives must be provided for newer forms of renewable energy in order to boost capacity substantially.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell</B><I> rose&#151;</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I cannot give way on this matter again. I hope that our policy is now clear to the Committee. If the hon. Gentleman wishes to catch your eye, Dr. Clark, he will no doubt do so in a moment. The precise definition will be included in regulations to be published later this year. On the central point, the intention behind the amendment is already met by paragraphs 18 and 19 of the schedule.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> It transpired, during my first contribution, that confusion existed about who knew what about this part of the Bill. If I may say so, Dr. Clark, the position is exactly as I outlined. Half of the electricity that is currently generated from renewable sources in this country will not be eligible for exemption from the levy when it comes into force in the spring of next year. Having visited so-called traditional large-scale schemes, which certainly exceed the 10 MW barrier that the Financial Secretary mentioned, the issue is not whether new ones will come on stream; it is whether, when new electricity trading arrangements are in place and the difficulties are apparent, they will go out of business. Is the Minister happy to allow one or more of the schemes to close down and be replaced by gas output, which produces CO2 emissions, simply because he is not prepared to extend the exemption from the levy to all types of renewable power? If so, it means that he is introducing the wrong legislation in the wrong way.
<P>
<H5>9.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Kingston and Surbiton rightly argued that the argument is not logical; the Minister is taking an arbitrary decision to deny one source of existing renewable regeneration an exemption. A windmill will be exempt; photovoltaics will be exampted and so will tidal power. I could go on. These more recent technologies are exempted, yet traditional large-scale hydro, which is an existing technology, is not. It could be driven out of the market as a result, because price and market forces are what count.
<P>
I moved the amendment in a spirit of inquiry, rather hoping that the Minister would be able to shoot the arguments down with one bullet and that that would be the end of it. What I heard, however, was the worst confirmation of my initial fears. I strongly believe that the Committee should seriously consider the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 99, in page 134, line 2, at end insert&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``but paragraphs 21 and 22 have effect subject to any exceptions provided for under paragraph 19A.''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take Government amendments Nos. 100 to 103.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The need for this group of amendments arose as a result of a specific case of a commodity producer using gas to produce electricity, which is then used to clean dirty gas. Most of the cleaned gas is ultimately supplied to a utility, with some being retained to generate electricity. The double charge to taxation arises because, under paragraph 21(3) of schedule 6, the producer is deemed to have made a supply to himself of electricity, when he uses to clean the dirty gas. Such of the cleaned gas as is supplied to a utility for onward sale thus bears hidden climate change levy.
<P>
Rather than provide for that invididual case, it is preferable to take the power to make regulations to deal with instances of double taxation in case any more come to light after the Bill has completed its passage through the House. The amendments will achieve that purpose and I hope that the Committee will regard them as an improvement.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> The Government have considerable trouble with double taxation in the Bill. They have got themselves into a serious muddle over their attempt to remove double taxation provisions from certain multinational companies and have had to retreat. However, they have now found the need to bring in new provisions for double taxation relief. My main argument is that the Government are beginning to make up the tax as they go along. They have had more than a year since they first announced it to get it right. They have had a much-trumpeted consultation exercise. They have received a huge number of comments and complaints about it, but only now, after more than a year, have they suddenly discovered the problem of double taxation.
<P>
It is inconvenient that Opposition Members were given sight of the amendments and the explanatory note only shortly before the debate. The industries concerned have certainly not had enough time to comment on the issue. The regulations have only been signalled; they are not in draft form. Again, we are debating a matter that is to evolve at some future date when Customs and Excise or the Treasury can get round to producing the regulations to deal with the problem. It is a highly unsatisfactory state of affairs. When will the regulations be published in draft form and what will be the parliamentary procedure for approving them?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> Contrary to what the right hon. Gentleman said, the fact that we have been able to incorporate the amendments at this stage in our proceedings&#151;nearly a year before the tax will take effect&#151;shows what a throughgoing exercise has been carried out to expose a fairly well-hidden problem. It has been a valuable exercise and I am glad that we have incorporated the changes into the Bill. We expect to publish the regulations later in the summer and they will be subject to the negative resolution procedure.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<P>
No. 30, in page 214, leave out lines 15 to 32.
<P>
<B>Mr Jack:</B> This series of amendments takes us into an area of complexity. It deals with the impact of the climate change levy on surface electricity supplies that are generated by combined heat and power schemes and on the economics of such schemes.
<P>
I should say at the outset that I am indebted to the Brunner Mond company for its guidance and help in preparing the amendments in my name. Had I been able to, I would have tabled further amendments to deal more fully with the quality tests that will ultimately have to be applied to determine what are good-quality heat and power schemes. The present proposals are, however, probing amendments, which are intended to begin a dialogue.
<P>
On the issue of the climate change levy, my postbag has been dominated by companies that have sought to adopt a responsible position and to diminish their energy usage through combined heat and power. Companies such as Brunner Mond and British Sugar&#151;which we shall discuss in another context&#151;are major energy users. They have sought to deploy combined heat and power to counterbalance the rising cost of energy and to contribute to the overall efficiencies of their manufacturing processes. They would not be using combined heat and power if they thought that it was a bad idea. However, they are disappointed that nothing in the schedule deals with the problems that arise. There is no clear definition of good-quality, fully or partly exempt CHPs. Consultation is due to conclude shortly, but that is in the hands of the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions.
<P>
There is an important point of principle for us as legislators. We are being asked to approve the relevant provisions of the schedule, but they wander through it like a snake. Although I have heard of joined-up government, it is extremely difficult to join together all the bits of the schedule that deal with combined heat and power. None the less, we are being asked to approve these complex provisions without there being in place the clear definitions that industry thought it would get in the Bill. Amendment No. 26 is an attempt to address that point.
<P>
Brunner Mond and British Sugar would argue that they fall into the good category because they use good, modern combined heat and power techniques, but they are not entirely sure. It is perhaps worth putting on record the fact that Brunner Mond is the United Kingdom's only producer of soda ash, which is used to manufacture glass, pharmaceuticals and confectionery. Its representatives tell me that, from September, it will use a new gas-fired combined heat and power plant, which will produce 3 per cent. of the UK's installed CHP electrical capacity and supply all Brunner Mond's energy needs. That is a substantial proportion of CHP, which is why I hope that the Minister will take careful note of what the company has said.
<P>
Central to the economies of the new equipment is the company's ability to sell for wider consumption electricity that is surplus to the plant's needs. If I have understood the technology correctly, one of the problems that it and others face is that too much electricity sometimes seems to be produced for subsequent disposal. In other words, a company with a combined heat and power process that requires the generation of a lot of steam, but gives rise to a disproportionate amount of electricity that must be disposed of because the plant's use of electricity is low, runs foul of the climate change levy.
<P>
To put that in the real world context, &#163;150 million has been invested in this new environmentally sustainable technology at the plant that Brunner Mond will operate in partnership with PowerGen CHP Ltd., which is to build and own it. Interestingly, the plant will have an energy efficiency rating of 87 per cent. and will be a world benchmark for carbon dioxide emissions per megawatt hour of carbon-based fuels. Yet the economics of such a world-beating, benchmarking piece of technology are now put at risk because of the effect that the climate change levy has on the sale of electricity from such a venture.
<P>
<H5>9.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The amendments would simply exempt the electricity sold from the use of such systems from the climate change levy. If the Government are being true to their cause, I should have expected them to encourage such investment, not to bring its economic viability into question. Central to that is the fact that there is nothing in the Bill to deal with good quality. I should have liked to submit amendments to build on the three that I tabled to address that issue.
<P>
Brunner Mond is aware that there will have to be continuing assessments of the good quality threshold to ensure that such a plant can sustain its high-quality output. The maintenance cycle of plants runs over six years, so if there were to be an assessment it would strongly argue that it should follow the maintenance cycle. Companies such as Brunner Mond feel that the part of the schedule that deals with combined heat and power is a deterrent to the development of this form of high-quality energy utilisation.
<P>
It is rather perverse that, as we shall see when we discuss British Sugar in another context, the Government's proposals are causing major investment to be turned off. If these matters have been factored in to chart 6.2, as the Minister said, the financial impact of the proposals is to factor them out again. I shall be interested to hear what the Minister has to say about this world-beating company's investment, which is now put at risk by the Government's proposals.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> I am happy to support the right hon. Member for Fylde on amendment No. 25&#151;indeed, my name was added to amendment No. 26. This string of amendments addresses the same problem. I hope that the Financial Secretary will respond in the spirit in which the right hon. Gentleman tabled the amendments. I accept that more refinements might be needed, but it is absolutely clear that there is a glitch in the Government's policy making.
<P>
The right hon. Gentleman mentioned Brunner Mond. A few months ago, as part of an Industry and Parliament Trust visit, I went to the combined heat and power plant in Cheshire, where an impressive piece of kit is being installed and will shortly come on stream. It was clear that the uncertainty about Brunner Mond's trading arrangements would be a severe constraint on its proceeding with combined heat and power initiatives in the United Kingdom. Its decision, and that of PowerGen, which is installing the kit, will be strictly market based. There is no sentiment in these matters: if the plant is cheaper as a means of meeting needs, it will proceed; if it is not, supplies will be bought from the commercial electricity-generating market. Efficiency in the commercial electricity-generating market is lower than at the plant that I mentioned, and the problem for the Government is that CHP will be squeezed out and power will be generated from lower-efficiency fossil fuel.
<P>
Combined heat and power already meets about 15 per cent. of industry's heat and electricity needs, and there is a real possibility that it will reach a ceiling. British Sugar uses agricultural by-products, the availability of which is seasonal; at other times it uses gas to maintain its plant. That mixture appears to disqualify British Sugar's plant from being recognised as good value. It has suspended plans to introduce another plant, and yet again the Government are finding that uncertainty is undermining what they wish to achieve.
<P>
The director of the Combined Heat and Power Association, David Green, wrote to me and, no doubt, to other Members, stating:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``There is significant potential for growth in CHP, which is why the Government has an official target of 10 Gwe by 2010, up from 4.5 GWe today.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Mr. Green continues:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``I have to tell you frankly that the 10 GWe target cannot be met. This is not on the basis of special pleading by a trade association, it reflects the reality of current market conditions, the DTI's own analysis and the unfairness of only giving partial exemption to CHP at present.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
PowerGen submitted evidence that it had a number of CHP plants in national health service trusts, which, like the Brunner Mond plant, import and export power during the day. In balancing output and demand, it will have to include a levy for exports. The most likely consequence is that it will build smaller plants so that it never has a surplus. When there is a deficit, it will have to import more from the fossil fuel-generating sector of the national grid.
<P>
The Government have created a new slogan for CHP: export and die. If companies export they will pay the levy and put themselves at an uncompetitive disadvantage. At present, and in the immediately foreseeable future, the cheapest way of generating electricity is burning gas in gas turbines. CHP is more expensive but is viable in certain circumstances; if there is a levy, viable projects will not go ahead.
<P>
I ask the Government carefully to consider the amendments and, even if they feel unable to accept them now, give us some assurance that the door is not closed and that they will take another look at what they are doing as opposed to what they are saying.

<P>

<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> It is perhaps common ground in the Committee that combined heat and power has a valuable environmental and industrial role to play. First, it emits the double use of energy to generate electricity and, secondly, waste heat is used productively. There is a double benefit from a unit of fuel, which is why the technology has the support of all hon. Members. The hon. Member for Putney (Mr. Colman) is vice-president of the Combined Heat and Power Association, which is a responsible and progressive body. This group of amendments ought to have all-party support.
<P>
The amendment tabled in my name would drive forward CHP and exempt it from the levy, which is what the Government announced would happen. When the pre-Budget report was published in 1999, there was general rejoicing at the following sentence in paragraph 6.6 on page 104:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``It&#151;<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
the Government&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``therefore proposes to exempt electricity generated in `good quality' CHP plant from the levy.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That was unambiguous, so it was without qualification. As usual, there were cheers on the day but they turned to disillusionment when that did not happen.
<P>
The misleading nature of the announcement in the 1999 pre-Budget report was carried forward in ministerial correspondence but, at this point, became a little more serious. The Financial Secretary signed a letter to hon. Members on 13 December, again boldly asserting that CHP would be exempt. He wrote:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> The Chancellor therefore announced in the pre-Budget report that electricity generated in `good quality' CHP plan would be exempt from the levy.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He wrote at the bottom in manuscript:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> It is rare for me to be able to reply with such a clearcut `yes'!<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> Will my right hon. Friend note that the same message is included in HM Customs and Excise technical briefing No. 2, published on 9 November?
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> My right hon. Friend has added to the point. In another letter, dated 21 January this year, the Minister for the Environment wrote:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> I can confirm that, as announced by the Chancellor in his pre-budget statement, `Good Quality' CFP is also exempt from the Levy. This will provide a major boost for CHP. It will also bring new opportunities for CHP users to sell electricity to other uses at Levy free prices.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There is no suspicion or suggestion that there are any complications to the assertion that CHP schemes and electricity produced from them are exempt from the levy.
<P>
All that was completely misleading. It has now become apparent that electricity produced from larger CHP schemes will be caught by the levy. Many such plants export power from time to time to the national electricity market for onward sale to other consumers. For instance, CHP plants in the national health service regularly import and export electricity from the grid to balance output and demand from relevant hospitals.
<P>
To deny such electricity exemptions will be to add to the burden of costs on the NHS and will make no environmental sense whatever. This has contributed to the widespread disillusionment in the industries affected. They simply do not understand how the Government can, apparently in good faith, give unambiguous assurances that are later contradicted. The Combined Heat and Power Association said in a letter to me that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>giving only partial Levy exemption to CHP makes no environmental or economic sense.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I agree.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tony Colman </B>(Putney): The common sense is that of course CHP is not renewable electricity. It is important to realise that electricity produced in CHP plant is often produced from fossil fuels. There is a sort of logic in only partially lifting the levy.
<P>
<H5>9.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Mr. Heathcoat-Amory: Of course CHP is not renewable energy; everyone knows that it requires a fuel. That is not the point. The point is that, prior to the pre-Budget report, and in the report, the Government gave an assurance that CHP would be exempt, but that promise has not been kept. If the hon. Gentleman has other information, I should be glad to hear it, because he is in a position to validate what I have said. I have quoted from letters, and my right hon. Friend the Member for Fylde has another.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> My right hon. Friend may be interested in a sentence from a briefing sent to me by British Sugar:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> Contrary to the Government's repeated assertion, the CCL will apply to sales of CHP-generated electricity via the public network.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is another disillusioned customer of Her Majesty's Government.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> My right hon. Friend is correct to draw attention to British Sugar's case, which is particularly serious because two of its CHP projects, for which it had obtained permission, are now on hold, and may not proceed. The company has informed us that it will defer any further feasibility studies. So CHP is being checked, partially because it will not be exempted but mainly because the industry has been seriously let down. It was given the green light, which now has been switched to, at best, amber&#151;if not red.
<P>
Our amendments are important because they would exempt CHP completely. That exemption would be well earned. Doing so is technically feasible because the audit trail and the metering are in place, and it would also put CHP on a par with renewable energy. To pick up the point made implicitly by the hon. Member for Putney, the two must be treated similarly. The Government tend to say that they are giving renewable energy an advantage, by which they mean that they will tax everything else. That is a negative way of giving an advantage.
<P>
CHP schemes are not renewable and CHP does indeed release carbon dioxide&#151;but so does renewable energy. When a wind turbine is working, it is not producing greenhouse emissions, but over the entire life cycle of a wind farm, concrete must be poured, steel erected, overhead power lines provided and transmission losses suffered. So the entire project consumes energy and releases carbon dioxide.
<P>
Another point is that, under the Utilities Bill, which is being considered in another place, renewables have certain privileges. The utilities' use of energy will have to comprise first 5 then 10 per cent. renewable energy, and there is no quality threshold whatever. Renewables are privileged elsewhere in the Government's legislative programme. It is entirely right to treat them similarly in terms of tax, especially in view of the Government's early assurances. I look forward to the Minister's reply. I ask the Committee to support our amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> We have had a rather confused debate. It has focused on whether supplies of electricity from heat and power sources sold through the grid should be exempted from the levy. However, if I have understood them correctly, amendments Nos. 25, 26, 27, 87 and 30 do not deal with that issue; it is addressed only in amendment No. 88, which we shall reach in a few moments. It may be helpful, as we seem already to have debated amendment No. 88, if I deal with it now.
<P>
The exemption from the levy for combined heat and power has prompted a substantial upsurge of interest in the use of that technology. Some hon. Members have suggested that it has all ground to a halt because a more generous exemption was not in place. I can confidently tell the Committee that that is not the case. On the instigation of my hon. Friend the Member for Putney, I met David Green, the director of the Combined Heat and Power Association, who confirmed that, following the exemption announcement, there had been a substantial surge of interest in combined heat and power.
<P>
The latest issue of the CHPA bulletin for April 2000 makes it clear that CHP has not all ground to a halt&#151;quite the reverse. Headlines such as ``PowerGen to build 245 MW plant for ICI plant in Cheshire'', ``Michelin turns to CHP in Stoke'', ``Tile manufacturer switches to CHP'', ``Polyester plant to switch to CHP'' and ``Oil company studies plans for 475 MW CHP plant'' reveal a huge surge of interest in the technology in response to our announcements.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> The Financial Secretary has enunciated a list of forthcoming attractions. How many of those projects are done deals with contracts signed and construction under way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The headlines that I read out imply that several of them are&#151;PowerGen is building a plant at an ICI site in Cheshire, for example. I refer the right hon. Gentleman to the latest issue of the CHPA bulletin, a splendid publication, in which he can ascertain further details. It is wrong for any hon. Member to suggest that the combined heat and power phenomenon has juddered to a halt. That cannot be the case. Organisations' own use of electricity from combined heat and power and also the power sold on through direct contact to other users will be exempted from the levy. That confers a significant price advantage on combined heat and power in comparison with more conventional means of power generation, on which the levy will be applied. The announced exemption for combined heat and power&#151;constrained as it is and not including electricity sold on the grid&#151;has tilted the playing field in its favour, which explains the upsurge of interest.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Fylde suggested that we had changed our minds on this matter, but that is not the case. I have in front of me Customs and Excise technical briefing No. 2, to which the right hon. Gentleman referred in his intervention. It was published on 9 November when the exemption was first announced during the period of the pre-Budget report. Paragraph 6 clearly states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> Electricity sales via an electricity supplier will, as for all other electricity sold via a supplier, be subject to CCL at the appropriate rate.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It could not be said more clearly than that, and there has never been any confusion about it. That is not to say that some people have not pressed for a change; they have, but the Government's position has been clear from the outset. The exemption that we have introduced for combined heat and power has proved effective in increasing the level of interest in the application of that technology. We shall undoubtedly see more such plants introduced in future.
<P>
The amendments do not address the issue. Paragraph 5(1)(a) refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> The supply . . . made by an electricity utility.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The point is directly addressed by amendment No. 88, the next to be debated.
<P>
This group of amendments deals with what is meant by good quality combined heat and power. It has been clear from the outset that we propose an exemption for such good quality CHP. We want to encourage schemes that achieve the greatest energy efficiency improvements in order to achieve the largest climate change benefits. The principle underlying the Bill and our proposals for a combined heat and power quality assurance programme is that schemes will be rewarded in proportion to the environmental benefits that they bring.
<P>
The amendments would remove the distinction between good quality schemes and those that achieve fewer environmental benefits. That is contrary to the environmental policy objectives with which everyone has said they agree. We have consulted, as the right hon. Member for Fylde acknowledged, on proposals for a combined heat and power quality assurance programme to register, assess, monitor and certify all types and sizes of combined heat and power schemes. That will provide the route to reward good quality schemes with full benefit&#151;exemption for all heat-generated electricity used on site or sold directly to other users.
<P>
Schemes that do not meet the threshold for full exemption may nevertheless bring significant benefits compared with alternative energy supply options. My right hon. Friend the Minister for the Environment will shortly&#151;in fact, tomorrow&#151;announce special arrangements for such schemes, which will be reflected in regulations made under paragraph 15(2).

<P>

<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> May I suggest to the Financial Secretary that if he were to speak for only three further minutes, we would have a chance to hear the announcement before we conclude our debate on Thursday morning?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I am putting to the Committee the principle of the basis on which we propose to move forward, which will be welcomed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> Will the Financial Secretary respond to the previous point?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I do not think that I can.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> Will the Financial Secretary outline how the announcement is to be made?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I understand that a parliamentary question will be answered tomorrow.
<P>
Finally, I want to defend the principle of a hierarchy that is built into the levy arrangements. There is complete exemption for power from renewable sources, and a more limited exemption for combined heat and power, which does generate emissions. It is right to treat renewable sources more generously.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> We will need more time to consider and digest the Financial Secretary's first reply on a subject that will continue to command interest and attention in Committee. Having examined the detailed paragraph mentioned in technical briefing note No. 2, I am intrigued by the distinction between electricity consumed by a CHP producer on its own premises and electricity sold on the grid.

On resuming&#151;
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> Before the suspension, I was expressing concern and dissatisfaction about the Financial Secretary's response&#151;although I was pleased by his announcement that the outcome of the consultation exercise on the formula to deal with quality thresholds was due to be published tomorrow. I wish to respond to his criticsm of the amendments. Unless I misunderstood him, he seemed to attack us because we did not want to remove the distinction between fully and partially exempt plants&#151;but that is exactly what the amendments would do.
<P>
What concerned me about the line that the Government are taking on supplies sold on to the grid is the effect that it will have on the overall economics of combined heat and power plants. What will happen to other companies that use their own thermally efficient electricity? Their product will not find an easy place on the market. If electricity can be sold onto the grid without the benefit of the climate change levy, that will, almost by definition, displace other electricity generated by less efficient plants. Thermal power stations will have an operating efficiency of perhaps 38 or 39 per cent.&#151;not the high operating efficiency percentages, in the 80s or even 90s, of CHP plants. If the Government were genuinely interested in encouraging that area&#151;notwithstanding the Financial Secretary's quotations from a trade association designed to promote CHP&#151;one would have thought that they would be four square behind reconsidering a negative element in the availability of electricity supplies from CHP. We have been told by people like Brunner Mond and British Sugar that their commitment to invest means that plants will not be built; as my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells said, we know that two of British Sugar's plants will not be built.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> We are talking about issues that arise under amendment No. 88. However, let us compare the day before the levy is introduced with the day after. When an organisation uses a significant proportion of the energy generated for its own purposes, does the right hon. Gentleman accept that any CHP project will be economically more attractive than it would have been just before the levy was introduced? There would be a greater cost differential between the two than previously.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> For those who use a significant proportion of the electricity that their CHP system generates, what the Minister said is true. The point at issue for British Sugar and Brunner Mond is what happens if an industrial process leaves a substantial amount of electricity to export. What would happen if such companies had in all good faith configured their plant and investment plan to take into account the full value of the sale of the electricity, not a value affected by the climate change levy? That brings me back to the efficiency with which electricity is generated.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> Does the right hon. Gentleman agree that the decision whether to go ahead will be based on the overall economic, including the value of the electricty that can be exported? The ease with which it can be exported is clearly an important factor.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> I agree with the hon. Gentleman. That is why I referred to the terms on which people would have made their investment decisions. If they can get back the full value of the electricity, not influenced by the levy, they will go ahead with the investment because the rates of return are right. Some people who, because of the nature of their industrial process a lot of electricity to export, will be affected by the levy&#151;hence our amendments. I am still not convinced that the Financial Secretary has it right in overall energy terms. If electricity is available to export from a combined heat and power scheme based on a more efficient method of electricity generation, surely that should be encouraged. Our amendments would exempt such schemes from the effect of the levy. Surely they should be encouraged, not discouraged.
<P>
The Financial Secretary has not provided us with a definition of ``good quality''. He did not fully address that point. As the debate goes on, we may have to go into some of the minutiae of the types of exchanges that have taken place. If joined up government does happen, the hon. Gentleman will know that many companies were part and parcel of the consultation exercise and put forward coherent and well-argued cases about the formulae that were to be used when determining the quality of thresholds. It would be interesting if he told us about his personal views on the matter. As a Minister, he would have had to receive reports either from another Department or from the Treasury setting out the validity of the lines of argument about what industry had said about the various quality thresholds that are germane to the matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clapham:</B> Does the right hon. Gentleman agree that some of the poorer quality schemes could have been attracted by the way in which the pool operated on its systems marginal pricing, which was introduced by the previous Government?
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> If I knew the definition of a poorer quality scheme&#151;I am stuggling to find the definition of a good quality scheme&#151;I would engage the hon. Gentleman in discourse on the matter. The companies that have made representations on the matter feel intuitively, practically and technically that they are in the camp of good quality schemes, and in many cases want nothing to do with so-called bad quality schemes. At this stage, however, those are merely words, and we do not know what the definitions are.
<P>
The other points that were discussed in this context relate to the complexity of the proposals. Again, I am disappointed that the Financial Secretary has not taken the opportunity presented by this debate to tell the Committee that the Government would be willing at least to re-examine before Report some of the labyrinthine aspects of the inter-relationships involved in combined heat and power. It is difficult to follow some of the Government's arguments, and it would help the Committee and the industry if the Financial Secretary admitted that it might be necessary to reconsider whether the Bill could be clarified. I hope that he will have something else to say about the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I shall be extremely brief, because I have already made the points that I am about to make. The difficulty for some plants relates not to the levy but to the changes arising from the new electricity trading arrangements and the reduction in general grid electricity prices. Indeed, work is currently in progress with the Department of Trade and Industry and Ofgem to explore how, under the new electricity trading arrangements programme, to help CHP plants affected by those changes by, for example, encouraging them and other generators with unpredictable outputs to trade collectively.
<P>
The exemption to the levy that we have announced will clearly give an advantage to combined heat and power compared with conventional power generation. I realise that some people would like us to go even further in that direction, but we have already gone a considerable way. As I said, my right hon. Friend the Minister for the Environment will make an announcement about the quality index tomorrow. I did not say that he would be publishing the details, but I understand that he will be answering a parliamentary question on the subject tomorrow.
<P>
Amendment negatived.

<P>
I remind the Committee once again of my registered interest in these matters. As I have an interest in two companies, and as all companies in the country will be affected, directly or indirectly, by this wretched tax, I formally have an interest to declare.
<P>
We have already discussed the importance of a quality threshold for CHP schemes to qualify for an exemption or rebate. Like so much else, ``good quality'' has yet to be defined, but it is not a matter of dispute. We do not want schemes of low quality dressed up as CHP to have an advantage.
<P>
We are discussing high-quality, genuine CHP schemes in which the electricity is used or exported and the heat, usually in the form of steam, is used in a process on the site or for a variety of industrial purposes. It is a highly environmentally friendly way of turning fuel into a useful form, and the Government have persistently claimed to support the expansion of the industry. We gave instances earlier of the industry being told, without qualification, that CHP schemes would be exempt. The Financial Secretary now says that there is a technical document in which the matter is expanded upon. However, he was certainly under the impression that all CHP schemes were exempt, and in the letter from which I quoted he said so. In a manuscript comment, he also said that it was unusual for him to be able to give such an unambiguous ``yes'' to the question asked by the hon. Member for Clwyd, South (Mr. Jones).
<P>
<H5>10.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The industry and the Financial Secretary thought that the schemes were to be exempt in all particulars, which is no longer the case. The amendment would correct that and put the position back to what it was at the time of the announcement in November 1999. A direct supply of electricity should be exempt from the levy, and so should a supply that is sold to a consumer via the grid or the electricity market. That is a comparatively modest request, which ensures that the larger and most efficient schemes can all avail themselves of the exemption. Precisely those schemes often bring the most environmental benefits. It would be possible, technically, to put the proposal into practice, because the switching and metering all exists&#151;and it is to be done for renewables in any case.
<P>
Some hon. Members have talked of renewables in glowing terms, as if it was the answer to everything and the only genuinely environmental way in which to produce electricity. I am not so sure, because some renewable schemes have unfortunate side effects, and can cause environmental damage in the form of visual pollution. Those driving through central Wales will be startled by the number of large wind turbines, which are, by definition, located in the most beautiful areas such as the uplands, where they are most visible. Such schemes generate electricity&#151;again, by definition&#151;where it is not required. It must be taken by large high-voltage transmission lines to centres of population. The same is true of wind turbines in many parts of Scotland.
<P>
What I am about to say is a generalisation, but the north of Britain generates electricity and the south of Britain consumes it. Many of the renewable energy schemes in the north require large transmission systems to bring the electricity south, where most industry and consumers tend to be located. That is a massive generalisation, but it shows that one cannot say that all renewable energy is good and other means of producing electricity are inferior. A well-sited, well-designed CHP scheme is at least equivalent to a renewable scheme, and should be treated in the same way. That is what we are asking the Government to do, and it is what members and customers of the Combined Heat and Power Association thought that they had. Will the Minister regularise the position along those lines?

<P>

<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I should correct an error that I made earlier. I said that I had received a letter from the hon. Member for Ludlow. It was in fact from the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb), so I apologise for misleading the Committee about my correspondent's constituency.
<P>
We have had a full debate, as on the other amendments on combined heat and power. If I were to repeat my arguments, you would call me to order, Dr. Clark. I do not have anything to add to what I have said. We made it clear in the announcement in the pre-Budget report that we did not propose to exempt electricity from combined heat and power sources that were sold through the grid. That remains our position. It is right that there is an additional incentive for renewable power sources.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> Will the Financial Secretary explain why the Government were not prepared to exempt the supplies sold into the grid? He has not done so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I have attempted to explain it, but let me have a further attempt. The most environmentally benign forms of power generation are renewable, whether they are the right hon. Gentleman's short rotational coppicing, the wind power referred to by the right hon. Member for Wells, solar power or any other such method. They give rise to no direct carbon dioxide emissions. Combined heat and power gives rise to lower carbon dioxide emissions than conventional forms of generation, but the emissions are nevertheless significant. We think it right that the most favourable regime in the levy arrangements is reserved for renewable energy sources, but that combined heat and power sources should have a favourable regime because they have relative advantages. That is what the arrangements in the schedule achieve.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> I am disappointed by the Financial Secretary's line of argument. Electricity generation from non-nuclear or non-renewable sources delivers more carbon dioxide than high-quality CHP schemes. If the Minister says that there should be a complete removal of the levy on what he calls the most benign renewables, it seems logical that he ought to be prepared to assist those sources that are within 10 per cent. of their efficiency terms. In terms of sales to the grid, electricity from CHP schemes seems to fall into that category. As the Government's position has unfolded, it has become clear that they will not exempt the sale of surplus electricity from CHP on to the grid from the effect of the levy.
<P>
In the real world in which investors such as British Sugar operate, it is distressing to find that two schemes will go no further. That means that any electricity that plants use will draw on supplies from higher CO2 output sources. If the Government are to receive the gains that they desire, and if industry is to invest in its own highly efficient generating capacity, logic suggests that the route should be encouraged. We shall discuss the horticultural industry in detail later.
<P>
Certainly, high energy usage crop growth such as tomato and cucumber production is likely to become a thing of the past in the United Kingdom, unless combined heat and power becomes part and parcel of the method of operation. Given that there are times of the year when the CHP keeps going, but need for its output in the nursery context is low, the rate of return from exporting that electricity off the holding to the national grid will be crucial to the economic success of the types of system that we are discussing. As the industry already argues that it is carbon-neutral, there is a real gain to be made. However, the Financial Secretary's argument incontrovertibly penalises those people who wish to use their money to invest in a system that may not be as good as renewables, but has the potential to export electricity. That defies logic. The hon. Member for Barnsley, West and Penistone may correct me, but my understanding is that the best efficiency that can be achieved from a large coal-fired power station is 40-odd per cent. Combined heat and power could more than double that.
<P>
We have been told throughout the debate that the Government want to encourage improved environmetnal circumstances. However, as the examples of Brunner Mond and British Sugar show, they seem to want to make it ever more difficult for investment in that respect to realise a proper rate of return. I am not certain whether the Financial Secretary has been in business. If he has, he will understand the nature of the gestation period for investment. That is why I asked him about the content of the Combined Heat and Power Association magazine. Journalists love writing about forthcoming attractions, but are sometimes wide of the mark in terms of whether real commercial contracts have been signed, and investment decisions made. Some people made decisions because they believed, on the basis of their interpretation of Government policy, that combined heat and power electricity sales to the grid would be exempt from the climate change levy. To quote Shakespeare:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> Lo, they have been undone.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am disappointed that the Government, at this late stage, will not at least consider the validity of the arguments being put to them. Manufacturing industry&#151;which has just been debated in the House&#151;would benefit from the Government's encouragement of more combined heat and power plants, notwithstanding what the Financial Secretary told us in the context of the Combined Heat and Power Association magazine. I do not see much sign of conventional power station building, and we have discussed gas power. However, CHP provides a new area in which engineering can make its way. If only the Government would make sure that the rate of return was right, the benefits would accumulate.
<P>
I hope that the Financial Secretary will grace the Committee with a sentence or two in reply to my points.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I am disappointed by the Financial Secretary's reply. Some of my points, and some made by my right hon. Friend, were not addressed.
<P>
First, the Financial Secretary has not apologised or explained for the fact that he sent out letters, which I quoted, that clearly, baldly and unambiguously stated that CHP would be exempt. Being an honourable man, he clearly thought, at the time, that he was telling the truth. If he was not aware of the relevant side document&#151;or bit of small print&#151;how could he expect industry to be aware of it? That requires further explanation. I wrote to him on behalf of British Sugar and I think that I was the first to receive a letter, on 16 March, saying that not all combined heat and power plants would be exempt. The letter made it clear that the levy would be imposed when sales were conducted through another party or through the grid. Several industrial users told me that the first time that they saw the full picture in writing was when they read that letter. We and the industries are entitled to an explanation.
<P>
<H5>11 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Government talk all the time about being pro-business, wanting partnership and wanting to consult, but something has gone wrong. To prevent further breaches or allegations of unfair play, The Financial Secretary should tell us why hon. Members did not receive that explanation in letters. We asked specific questions. I did not write generally about CHP, which I have always supported. I wrote on behalf of people who wanted to know exactly what the situation on the levy and the exemptions was. We asked specific questions, some of which were almost drafted by people in the industry. They knew the exact phrases to use to got to the heart of the problem. The Financial Secretary's reply was misleading, and he needs to go into greater detail, because we tabled amendment No. 88 to return the position to that described in those earlier letters.
<P>
My second point is about the fact that many CHP schemes must export electricity. They do not plan to do that, and that is not how many of them will make money. It is simply a question of technology. Only in small schemes is the electricity generated by a plant likely to be exactly in tune with on-site requirements. On a small site, a factory might run a CHP scheme to match its energy requirement exactly, but in most cases, electricity will be exported at times and imported at other times. Few industrial processes run at a steady energy requirement level. Usually, electricity is imported from the grid to meet peak demands. Conversely, the electricity consumption by a process may drop away at times, and then it makes sense to export the electricity generated by the CHP plant to another customer through the grid. That is a necessary part of most larger schemes. I gave an example of schemes in the national health service, which I presume that the government wish to promote, so why are they inhibiting the extension of larger plants?
<P>
The question asked by my right hon. Friend the Member for Fylde is equally valid. The exported electricity will occasionally displace electricity from less environmentally benign sources, and will therefore be superior to it on carbon emission grounds. For that reason, it should be encouraged.
<P>
As far as I know, the Financial Secretary has not responded to the other point that I mentioned, which was about the comparison with alternative energy. Indeed, he just ignored my point that many alternative or renewable energy schemes are in many respects environmentally inferior. He ignored my examples and simply said that such schemes were somehow automatically superior.
<P>
However, I gave the example of remotely situated wind turbines, where a good deal of energy is lost between generation and consumption. There are also hydro schemes that have significant environmental downsides. When a river is dammed for a hydro scheme, navigation is inhibited and fish are frequently killed or deterred from passing through the turbines. There are very few ways of producing energy without some problems. It is a fact of physics that electricity cannot be conjured out of the air. The process of producing, generating, transmitting and using electricity has an environmental impact.
<P>
Therefore, it is simply incorrect to assert that all alternative renewable energies are superior to all CHP schemes, but that is the assumption made by the Bill. We are asking that CHPs be put back on the same par and given the same advantage as renewable energy schemes. So far, the Financial Secretary has given no reasons to challenge our arguments.

<B>Mr. Jack:</B> I want to probe the Financial Secretary about one further and important point. He said that the quality formula played a key part in determining the way forward. It has been drawn to my attention that there are examples of gas turbine-type combined heat and power plants that might&#151;following the Financial Secretary's line of argument&#151;struggle to be defined as good quality. Those would be CHP plants that were effectively in balance. They would be what is called fully matched in terms of their steam generating capacity and the plant heat load and electricity output. Unless the formula is spot on, it is possible that even those schemes&#151;notwithstanding the impact of the climate change levy on their economics&#151;could be ruled out.
<P>
I would like the Financial Secretary to assure me&#151;if he is paying attention to what I am saying&#151;that he will consider carefully the economic impact of tomorrow's announcement by the Minister for the Environment. I hope that he can also assure me that the Treasury has been fully involved in the announcement of the formula and that schemes such as the one that I mentioned&#151;which has an overall efficiency of some 91 per cent. using gas turbines&#151;will not be ruled out as a result of tomorrow's announcement.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The question is&#151;
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> On a point of order, Dr. Clark. It is certainly a courtesy that Ministers respond to points made, but I think that it is also a requirement. If we proceed as we have been doing, it will take a long time for the Bill to become law. May I, through you, ask the Minister to abide by the normal courtesies of Committee procedure?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I will respond briefly, but not to the points that the right hon. Gentleman has repeated. I think that we have heard about three speeches&#151;
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. May I just, out of a natural courtesy, reply to the point of order that has been put to me? Each hon. Member is responsible for his or her own courtesies in this House. I do not believe that it is incumbent on the Chairman to oblige a Minister to reply to any point at any time. Courtesies are a matter not for the Chair but for hon. Members.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The right hon. Member for Fylde made one new point. He asked me to assure him that the Treasury had been fully involved in the work on the combined heat and power quality assurance scheme. I can give him that assurance.

<P>
<B>Mr. Stunnell:</B> The amendment refers to the figures in the table on page 152 of the Bill that set the rate of the levy and are the basis for the calculation of its operation. It is designed to deal with the timing and implementation of the levy rather than the detailed figures that apply to different fuels. I am not seeking to make any point about the carbon content of fuels or to vary the proportions of the levy on fuels of different types under the Bill.
<P>
The history of the figures is extensive. When the original proposal was brought to light by the Chancellor, it was said that the levy was intended to raise &#163;1&#183;8 billion a year and that &#163;50 million a year was to be set aside for energy efficiency and renewable technologies. When the November statement was made, the figure was changed downwards; the levy was designed to generate &#163;1 billion, with &#163;150 million to be set aside for energy efficiency and renewable technologies. When we discussed clause 30 in the Committee of the whole House, I suggested that some of that was funny money, but the Financial Secretary said clearly and precisely that it was not; that it was all genuine money. That is encouraging, from the Treasury's point of view, at least.
<P>
<H5>11.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The aim of my amendment is to establish a timetable for the levy, which will be introduced at 50 per cent. of the level set out in the table in the schedule and rise to 100 per cent. by the financial year 2005 and to 150 per cent. by 2010. It will stay at a fixed rate beyond that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman envisage that the reduction in employers' national insurance contributions and the energy efficiency fund to which he referred will also be scaled back in the early years?
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> I read the 83 pages of the schedule carefully, but I could not see the national insurance figure or the recycled money figure, so I could think of no way to amend them. As a newcomer to Finance Bills, I look forward to the Financial Secretary explaining where&#151;either in the Bill or elsewhere&#151;those figures take effect. We can debate those issues if they arise in Committee or in the House in some other way.
<P>
As I have said elsewhere, the uprating of the amount for supporting energy efficiency and new technologies from &#163;50 million to &#163;150 million was welcome, and I would not want to reduce the figure. Later, we may discuss the way in which the national insurance rebate can achieve the balance that the Minister described in Committee on the Floor of the House between the charge and the refund within the manufacturing, commercial, and public services sectors. If that balance is to be maintained&#151;some of us are unclear about how we could calculate it or know that we had achieved it&#151;there would be pro rate variations to my amendment.
<P>
The essential point of the amendment is to help those who will be subject to the levy. The least attractive aspect of the proposals for industry is that a substantial tax will be imposed on it at comparatively short notice; that tax will then simply sit there operating. I am sure that the Financial Secretary will assure us that he has no intention to uprate the tax year by year.
<P>
The proposal in the amendment is that we should start at a lower level, which would be less potentially damaging in its start-up impact on industry and commerce. We make it clear that there will be a progressive rise so that investment decisions can be taken on the basis of certainty about the direction in which the tax is going. That will provide a clear signal for long-term investment.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> What about a company such as BOC, which I described earlier? It believes that it has achieved the maximum possible energy efficiency at many of its plants. What will the hon. Gentleman's amendment do other than defer the time when it will pay a much higher levy than was originally proposed for subsequent financial years? Indeed, after year three it will be penalised for the fact that it has already achieved the maximum efficiency that it can hope for. There is no relief for such companies in his proposal.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> The amendment, as I am sure the hon. Gentleman appreciates, deals with the tax rates. It does not deal with exemptions, which come in a later part of the schedule. An amendment that dealt with that would not be appropriate at this point. A number of paragraphs in schedule 6 deal with companies and types of companies for which exemptions are payable. Indeed, I have tabled an amendment in the next group that suggests what might be done in the horticultural sector of the industry.
<P>
I hope that hon. Members can focus on the intention of the amendment, which is to provide a phased and gradual introduction of the levy in such a way that it is less damaging to industry and provides it with the certainty and sense of direction that will allow it to make long-term investment decisions. Amendments Nos. 72 to 75 would leave industry in the UK in a more competitive position compared with the figures printed on page 152 of the Bill. They would safeguard employment better and would not hinder the achievement of high levels of energy efficiency and fuel conservation over the time scale that the levy is designed to operate.
<P>
The Financial Secretary made it clear when he was referring to table 6.1 that the Government have the achievement of objectives in 2010 very much in mind. Setting the tax at the rates described in the amendments will be the basis for doing that. The amendments are long and look complex, but I hope that their intention is straightforward and that they will find favour with the Committee.

<P>

<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> The hon. Gentleman has failed to answer the problem. He seems to be saying that a tax that is deeply flawed in many respects and has a scattergun approach to energy users will provide no relief for those who have already done all that they can to invest in energy efficency measures. He seems to assume that, without the threat of a tax penalty, companies will not try to improve their energy efficiency over the next few years. Energy costs have risen considerably in the past 24 months. The price of oil has more than doubled. Therefore, every company that wishes to maintain a competitive position is doing all that it can to reduce its energy costs.
<P>
The problem with the tax, which the clause does nothing to address, is that it makes no distinction between those who are working towards energy efficiency and therefore have little scope for further savings, and those for whom additional incentives may be needed. Many firms that are already far down the road of achieving energy efficiency will simply be burdened in the long term with a higher, inappropriate and deeply flawed climate change levy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> The main problem faced by firms confronted by the levy is not competitiveness in the United Kingdom but competitiveness overseas. That is especially the case for BOC. Given time, incentives and direction, the history of the industry shows that it can achieve increased efficiencies. I agree with the hon. Gentleman that the impact of the levy in its present form of one big step will damage BOC. The graduated approach that I suggest would help that problem.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I am afraid that the hon. Gentleman seems to be talking against himself. He seems to recognise that there is a competitive problem, as we are dealing with international competition. If the question were of competition from only other businesses in the UK, his proposing a trebling of the scale of charge would be a pity, as it would be another tax on business in this country. However, it would not have a competitive effect, because all businesses in the sector would be similarly affected.
<P>
The evidence from BOC Is a good example. Its competitors in places such as the Netherlands and Germany are already exempted from such a tax. The exemptions proposed under the regime are capricious. No assurance has been given to compaines such as BOC that they will be given the sort of exemption that they deserve. BOC's evidence is that its new plants have already reached the thermodynamic limits of efficiency savings possible in its environmentally friendly industrial process. The amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Hazel Grove will simply make the bad and ill-thought-out situation created by the Government three times as bad.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I shall deal with the substance of the amendment in a moment, as it achieves an effect that the hon. Member for Hazel Grove has not adequately exposed. Before I do so, I should mention the fascinating interchange between him and the Financial Secretary. The Financial Secretary taunted the hon. Gentleman to come up with the fiscal neutrality mechanism that would form a counterbalance. That was especially interesting because the official Opposition have never understood the claim of fiscal neutrality.
<P>
I suppose that the Financial Secretary could propose any number of additional taxes and explain that he and the Government were reducing or offsetting something elsewhere. He could say that they were to be accounted for alongside the increases that he currently advocates. The climate change levy is an extra tax, and national insurance contributions are to be linked to it by some invisible thread. As the hon. Member for Hazel Grove pointed out, there is nothing whatever to prevent the Financial Secretary from raising years later the NICs that he has so grandly diminished, and nothing to yoke the two together on any permanent basis that proves the measure's fiscal neutrality.
<P>
We reject the thesis that the measure is fiscally neutral. The climate change levy is a new tax, and that is a fact. Whatever else the Government may do, everything has to be added together to see whether, as a sum total, industry comes out fiscally neutral. We all know the truth, unfortunately, is that the Government have added about &#163;30 billion of extra taxes to industry, which is hardly neutral.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> The hon. Gentleman clearly shares the considerable doubts that I expressed on the Floor of the House, and thinks that the neutrality argument needs to be backed up by facts, figures and probably legislation. Does he share my view that those are not present in the 83 pages?
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> The hon. Gentleman right. They are not in the 83 pages, which is forgivable because they could not be in them as drafted. I do not think that any number of facts would help. As we have all learned from the Treasury, facts are appearance and appearance is fact. We need some Rooker-Wise legislation, mutatis mutandis, to yoke the levels permanently and irrevocably to offsetting changes in NICs or some such mechanism. I am certain that the Treasury will not be tabling amendments to that effect, because it does not have the slightest intention of ensuring permanent fiscal neutrality. That would compromise the discretion that it wishes to preserve and the flexibility that the Chancellor wants to have to raise and lower particular taxes. Alas, fiscal neutrality is not a runner.
<P>
<H5>11.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Given that we have all, unfortunately, accepted the climate change levy, we now come to whether it would be improved by the ramping schedules to which the hon. Member for Hazel Grove referred. It is interesting that in the early part of the year the levels on his ramping formulae would be lower than those proposed by the Financial Secretary. If we are to have the wretched tax, we have no objection to its being lower in the early part of the year. I am sure that no Labour member of the Committee would oppose that proposition. However, if it goes low enough, the absurdities of the tax would increase to the point at which it would become questionable whether anyone in his right mind could produce 88 pages for a low levy, the halving of which, roughly speaking, is welcome.
<P>
The sting is in the tail. The proposition made by the hon. Member for Hazel Grove is that, from 2009-10 onwards&#151;in perpetuity, I take it&#151;the levy rate would be triple the rate levied at the starting point and 50 per cent. higher than that proposed by the Financial Secretary. I regret that I have not calculated the value of that perpetuity at different levels of discount rate, but I shall venture a guess. I suspect that the Financial Secretary, with his lightning mathematical brain, would second that, too. The present value on any responsible discount rate of the ramped formulae proposed by the hon. Member for Hazel Grove is substantially in excess of the value of the Financial Secretary's proposal. There will be some pleasurable reduction in the shock effect in the first year, but if the hon. Gentleman's amendment was accepted, the total cost of the levy to industry and hence its impact on investment would be increased. We would not welcome that. We may even discover that Labour Members do not welcome it. It should certainly not be welcomed. Increasing a bad tax is likely to make it worse. It will get worse as it gets higher because, although it will have almost no effect on climate change, it will have a considerable effect on business costs. The higher it is, the higher the cost.
<P>
As the hon. Member for Hazel Grove conceded in an exchange with my hon. Friend the Member for Guildford (Mr. St. Aubyn), the essential effect would be to make our industries less competitive than those of other countries. Whether industry will become less competitive slightly slower or faster is less important than how much less competitive it will become. Under the amendment, it will be a good deal less competitive than it would be under the Financial Secretary's proposal. We cannot support the amendments and we look forward with eager anticipation to the Financial Secretary's rebuttal of them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> Like my hon. Friend, I am attracted by any amendment that would reduce the rates of tax. However, this amendment would not do that. It would increase the rates as time went on and compound the damage inherent in the Bill. It would add further complexity to a tax, when paying it leads people to adjust their bills each year. That will add problems to an already highly complicated tax. Perhaps it comes naturally to a Liberal Democrat to want high tax and exemptions to it. Indeed, the hon. Member for Hazel Grove is feeling his way towards such a structure. When we combine this set of amendments with others that his party has tabled to increase the exemptions for the horticultural industry, we arrive at the familiar Liberal Democrat formula of higher and higher taxes paid by fewer and fewer people.
<P>
The other point&#151;which was touched on in an interchange with the Financial Secretary&#151;is the recycling of the revenue. No one believes that the revenues will be recycled; the evidence for that is the history of the landfill tax. We brought in that tax and fully used the revenue from it to cut national insurance contributions. The Labour Government have adopted it and put it on an annual escalator so that not only has it doubled but it increases by &#163;1 a tonne every Budget. However, the revenue is not being used to cut national insurance contributions and it is not being recycled back to business in any way. Precisely the same thing will happen with this tax. In that regard, I ask the hon. Member for Hazel Grove not to give the Treasury ideas. If it gets hold of the notion of an escalator that increases the rate annually, we will soon see that the tax increase and the notion of returning to the industrial sector have been entirely forgotten.
<P>
All tax revenues are in a sense recycled. Governments raise money through taxes and give the revenue back in expenditure. This tax is not different; the money comes back in exactly the same way&#151;but it does so to different firms and businesses. That is, at root, the problem. The tax is not tax-neutral. On the continent, the tax is designed to be tax-neutral for sectors and companies, but for the tax that the Government propose the money is to be raised from one set of companies and returned to a different set in different sectors&#151;which leads to all the injustices that we have debated. For all those reasons, although I think that the amendments are ingenious, the official Opposition do not support them.

<P>

<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I agree with the right hon. Member for Wells that the amendment is ingenious, but it is not necessary. I understand that the hon. Member for Hazel Grove wants to avoid what he sees as damage and wants to phase the levy in, but the introduction of the levy is anything but abrupt. He himself made the point that the climate change levy has had a long gestation period. That was right. Business has been given two years to plan for the introduction of the levy and to make exactly the sort of investment plans that the hon. Gentleman wants to facilitate by introducing an escalator.
<P>
We designed the levy precisely to protect the competitiveness of UK industry. That has been a prime consideration, throughout the process of design. All the revenues will be recycled to business, through a 0.3 percentage point reduction in employers' national insurance contributions, as well as the additional support for energy efficiency measures. The hon. Member for West Dorset suggested that we would in any event have introduced the 0.3 per cent. reduction in employers' national insurance contributions. I assure him that that is not the case. When the levy was originally proposed, with a higher level of take, it was attached to a 0.5 per cent. reduction in employers' national insurance contributions. As we have reduced the levy, we have also cut the reduction in employers' national insurance contributions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Will the Financial Secretary table an amendment or a new clause providing automaticity so that any future increases in the levy are statutorily linked to specified reductions in national insurance contributions or other taxes?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> No. I would expect the rate of the levy to keep pace with inflation. An increase beyond that would necessarily reopen discussions with those sectors that signed up for negotiated agreements.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> The Financial Secretary says that it would ``necessarily'' create a basis for further discussion if there were increases beyond inflation. Does that mean that the Government are willing to oblige themselves to reopen discussions? If so, why not introduce legislation to make it clear that increases beyond inflation or revalorisation&#151;that takes us back to the question about the index&#151;will automatically be reflected in corresponding changes in NICs or other taxation? If the Minister means what he says, why not make it statutory?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> If there were such an increase, there would need to be further discussions with the sectors that signed up to the negotiated agreements because the basis of the discussion would have changed. I give the Committee an assurance that that would happen.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> I do not wish to detain the Financial Secretary, but he referred to the negotiated agreements. Is he saying that they include an assumed inflation increase in the levy that is built into the calculations?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> There is certainly an assumption that the rate of the levy would keep pace with inflation, as is normally the case.
<P>
The negotiated agreements that the energy-intensive users enter into will secure for them an 80 per cent. discount in the amount of levy that they pay. Those agreements are geared to the investment projects that characterise each sector and to how energy efficiency can be realised in practice in that sector. That is built into the way in which the targets are constructed; it is a firm basis on which sectors can plan how they will respond to the levy. An escalator is an ingenious idea, but it is not necessary and it will not help. I urge my hon. Friends to resist the amendment.

Amendment negatived.
