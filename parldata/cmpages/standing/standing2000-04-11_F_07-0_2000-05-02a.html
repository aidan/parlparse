<P>
Amendment proposed [this day]: No. 78, in page 4, line 25, leave out from `require' to end of line 28 and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`any person receiving financial resources from the Council to provide the Council with such documents as requested by the Council as relate to their application for that financial resource;'.—[Mr. Clappison.]<P>

<P>
<H5>4.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Question again proposed, That the amendment be made.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind the Committee that with this we are taking the following amendments: No. 104, in page 4, line 25, after `person', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(being either an individual or an institution)'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 105, in page 4, line 31, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(c) require the Council, in applying these conditions, to respect the confidentiality of the information supplied by the person providing the post-16 education or training'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. James Clappison </B>(Hertsmere): I hope that, with the benefit of reflection, the Under-Secretary of State, the hon. Member for North Swindon (Mr. Wills), will appreciate that the amendments are not a result of an ideological frenzy, but represent a moderate and helpful approach to the clause. I draw some assurance from what he said about amendment No. 104. I hope he accepts that our questions on the designation of persons were reasonable.
<P>
I am a little more troubled by the Under-Secretary's response to amendment No. 105. I understand what he said about the circumstances in which information from providers will not remain confidential after it comes into the hands of the Learning and Skills Council or the person designated by it. However, the powers are wide. He gave examples of cases in which information will not remain confidential. I am sure he would agree that providers will not want information that they supply to the Learning and Skills Council or to the designated person, or which the Learning and Skills Council and the designated person have uncovered, to become widely available for all the world to know, especially if it does not relate directly to funding.
<P>
I would be more satisfied with his response and less inclined to push the amendment to a vote if he undertook to write to me, setting out the circumstances in which information would not remain confidential and assuring me that information would be confidential except in such cases.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment (Mr. Michael Wills):</B> I can reassure the hon. Gentleman that I shall be delighted to write to him.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I shall not take that point further.
<P>
We got into the general territory of clause 6 and discussed whether the conditions could be imposed on school sixth forms. The Under-Secretary told us that the clause makes it possible for the Learning and Skills Council to impose conditions on local education authorities, but not on schools themselves. He is not dissenting from that view. However, I was slightly surprised to hear that response to questions from my colleagues and the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Allan), who came straight to the point. I have a letter dated 21 March from the noble Baroness Blackstone to my noble Friend, Lady Blatch. It arose from the debates in another place, of which we are both aware. It said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>You asked which of the conditions in Clause 6 would be pertinent to the funding of sixth forms. Clause 7 is needed to ensure that the LSC can apply proper conditions in relation to LEA funding of school sixth forms. It cannot use Clause 6 because part of that is formulated in terms of conditions on providers, and LEAs are not providers.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There is some difference between what the noble Lady and the Under-Secretary have said. He specifically said that the Learning and Skills Council could use clause 6 to impose conditions on LEAs, but Baroness Blackstone is clearly under the impression that it cannot be used in such a way. Clause 7 relates to the funding of school sixth forms, so I shall not pursue the matter. However, it is safe to comment in this debate that there has been some degree of inconsistency and misunderstanding between the Government's representatives here and in another place. My right hon. and hon. Friends were right to raise the issue, and we shall reach it in good time. Having received the Minister's reassurance, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 89, in page 4, leave out lines 43 and 44 and insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(3ZA) Where provision has been specified in a report of an assessment conducted under section 114 the Council must impose a condition on a person providing post-16 education or training (the provider) to make such provision for the person who is the subject of the assessment.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to consider amendment No. 90, in page 5, line 1, leave out `at specified intervals statements' and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`an annual statement'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I hope that there is not much ground between the Opposition and the Government on the amendment, and that we are seeking to achieve common objectives. Before I ask leave to withdraw it, however, I should point out that our proposals deal with an important issue. I say that now because I hope that the Minister does not think that I am erecting ideological barricades. Far from it; I am trying to tear them down and to be of assistance.
<P>
The amendments deal with an important point and an important group of people. Amendment No. 89 relates to clause 6(3), which enables the Learning and Skills Council to impose on a person providing post-16 education and training conditions requiring that person to make arrangements set out in paragraphs (a) to (f) of subsection (3). For example, paragraph (a) requires the provider
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>to charge fees by reference to specified criteria.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Amendment No. 89 relates to subsection (3)(f), which requires the provider
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>to make provision specified in a report of an assessment conducted under section 114.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Clause 114 applies to persons with statements of special educational needs. It requires an assessment of such people to be conducted in their last year of compulsory schooling, although such an assessment may also be undertaken between the time when the person in question leaves school and attains the age of 25.
<P>
We believe that it is highly desirable that special educational training should include provision recommended in such a report. If a report says that something is needed, then it is good common sense for a person to receive it. Persons with special educational needs in particular should obtain the education and training that meet their need. Amendment No. 89 is designed to strengthen the link between what is specified in the assessment and education and training that are delivered. It seeks to do so by placing a duty on the Learning and Skills Council to impose a condition on the provider to give the education and training specified in the assessment. It would therefore strengthen the Bill as currently drafted, and we believe that it is important for people with special educational needs in that respect.
<P>
Amendment No. 90 relates to conditions imposed by the council on those whom it funds to provide training and education for disabled people. Subsection (4)(b) enables the council to impose a condition on providers to require them to publish statements containing information about the training and education that they provide. The subsection enables the council to require such statements at specified intervals. We wonder whether it is possible to be a little more precise and to require such a statement every year, not least to ensure that the information is as up to date and as helpful as possible. That is a straightforward point, to which I hope the Minister will be able to respond.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment (Mr. Malcolm Wicks):</B> I assure the hon. Member for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison) that he has presented his case in a non-ideological and moderate way. Indeed, should he apply for asylum to a new political home—
<P>
<B>Mr. Richard Allan </B>(Sheffield, Hallam): Labour would keep the hon. Gentleman waiting for years.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> We are full up at the moment—the Liberal Democrats always have spaces—but we will certainly consider the hon. Gentleman's application. Indeed, I have sometimes felt during the past two weeks that, with one or two exceptions, we are dealing with a one nation Opposition, which is of some historical interest. We have heard a few quotations, but I hope that there will be yet more from Disraeli and Macmillan—``The Middle Way'' is always a useful text.
<P>
I am very grateful to the hon. Gentleman for raising in the amendment the issue of assessments of people with learning difficulties because it enables the Committee to consider this important new provision for the first time, which we would not have otherwise addressed until we considered clause 114. Despite making good progress this morning, we are a little adrift from clause 114.
<P>
This is a new initiative by the Government, which I believe is warmly welcomed. We are determined to improve the support that is available for young people with learning difficulties as they make the transition from school to post-16 education or training. Indeed, it is a current theme of social policy that the transitions for those with learning difficulties, whether from primary to secondary school or from secondary school to post-16 provision and into employment— sometimes supported employment—are considered to be of great importance. We are determined to improve the support available to such people, and the Bill relates to those over the age of l6.
<P>
For many young people, there has been uncertainty and confusion as they move out of the regulated schools sector and the specific arrangements for statements of special educational needs. There has been a perceived disincentive to leave school and undertake perhaps more appropriate post-16 education outside because of the limits of SEN statements. At worst, there has been a danger that people's learning difficulties may go unaddressed when they move into the post-16 world. Our proposed new arrangements for assessments are designed to help young people and their parents feel confident that they have a range of options to consider and that a decision on their post-16 education can be based on how the individual's needs will best be met.
<P>
In considering what arrangements to put in place for post-16 assessments, we were anxious to reflect the diverse and less regulated nature of post compulsory learning. That meant that it was appropriate to introduce completely new arrangements rather than to extend the existing arrangements in schools for pupils with special educational needs.
<P>
Collaboration and co-operation between the key parties in the assessment process over a prolonged period are central to the new arrangements. Those parties are likely to include the young person and their parents, the relevant school and LEA and, in some cases, social services. The local LSC is also a key feature, as are the new personal advisers under the ConneXions strategy. That collaboration is vital if assessments are to produce an outcome that both meets the needs of an individual young person and is supported by, and appropriate for, the provider identified to deliver the learning opportunity. A range of options may be considered before a final outcome is agreed. The central objective is to provide the best learning opportunity possible for an individual young person with learning difficulties.
<P>
Guidance on the detailed arrangements for assessments, including the LSC's expectations of providers to make their best endeavours in delivering the content of an assessment, will be crucial. It will be subject to consultation with interested groups, such as the Post 16 Disability Consortium, and providers. As with any new initiative, guidance and expertise will continue to develop over time. We want that to happen as the new arrangements become embedded.
<P>
As I implied earlier, I do not doubt the hon. Gentleman's good intentions but I am concerned that amendment No. 89 would take us a step too far. It would require the council to impose as a condition of funding that a provider must specify the provision in the report. The blanket arrangement, which would have to happen in every case, does not take into account that provision might be collaborative. A weakness of current arrangements is that funding systems and the infrastructure deter the development and delivery of integrated packages of learning for people with different learning difficulties. We must avoid building similar disincentives into our new arrangements. The amendment does not take into account the possibility that a provider might be better able to meet in other ways the needs identified.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
For example, the results of a disability assessment might set out a route of education and training that requires an extended collaborative approach. A young person might need specialist provision in a residential college, more general provision through a work-based training provider once their skills had been developed and finally, perhaps, direct work experience funded by the LSC. No one provider would be best placed to do all that. The LSC must be able to use its funding powers to put such a package together. It would be unreasonable to require a single provider to deliver the whole package.
<P>
Having as tight a compulsory regime as the hon. Gentleman's amendment proposes might have detrimental effects. In particular, it might make it more difficult to work with employers as providers of work-based opportunities—they might consider such requirements to be heavy handed or overly bureaucratic. We heard such concerns earlier with regard to another issue. We would not be serving that vulnerable group of learners well if we introduced blanket requirements that might limit the opportunities available to them.
<P>
I fully agree with the hon. Gentleman that we must ensure that the LSC can meet in the round the needs of the young person with learning difficulties and that it has the mechanisms to ensure that its providers deliver the provision to meet those needs. The powers already in the Bill give the LSC all that it needs. There will be major back-up from the new ConneXions service, with a personal adviser responsible for ensuring that young people's needs in that respect are met. As I have said, we are consulting closely with disability organisations on the most effective mechanisms for delivering the new service.
<P>
I shall deal more briefly with amendment No. 90. I am again sympathetic to the hon. Gentleman's amendment but I hope that I will be able to reassure him that it is unnecessary. The Bill has been drafted to enable the current requirements in the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 on further education institutions' provision of disability statements to be carried forward. We have followed the approach of not specifying in the Bill the intervals at which statements are required; instead, we have allowed flexibility for the specification of the intervals. Regulations have been used to specify precise times, suitable for the sector concerned, for the production of the statements. I continue to believe it sensible not to be specific on the face of the Bill so that we can retain that flexibility.
<P>
I must also say to the hon. Gentleman that his amendment is open to different interpretations. Even simple terms such as ``annually'' are never so simple when one considers them properly. Under the amendment, a college or local education authority might, for example, be able to provide a statement in June in one calendar year and November in the following calendar year, thus completely missing out one academic year. Such confusion helps me to make the case for an ability to stipulate when disability statements should be produced more specifically. I expect the LSC to require statements at annual intervals just as the current regulations specify. That requirement is not in doubt.
<P>
I hope that, with those reassurances and my earlier points about disability assessments, the hon. Gentleman will feel able to withdraw his amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I have listened carefully to the Under-Secretary's response. I am grateful to him for responding in a considered and thoughtful way to what he recognised were helpful amendments, which covered an important area and important provisions under clause 114, which we shall come to later. I am not entirely convinced that the stress that the Minister placed on collaborative ventures is at odds with the effect of the amendment on the clause. The amendment is not designed to require one particular provider to provide all that is required. It could be applied to a number of different providers, each making some of the provision required under clause 114.
<P>
The amendment would ensure that each provider delivered the provision stipulated under clause 114. However, the Under-Secretary said that it was crucial for people in this position to receive the education and training specified in the statement. I take the Under-Secretary's point about the need for flexibility, especially in the case of some employers, and the need to consider this issue in the round to ensure that people receive the education and training they need.
<P>
I am broadly happy with the Minister's statement. However, I leave him with this thought. Given that a statement of a person's needs will be made, one would hope that if any departure from that statement is made, it is not in order to make a provision that is different in nature or lesser in standard. The Minister suggested that that was his intention. I urge the Government to consider this issue carefully to ensure that, when people receive a statement of special educational needs, they receive the help, the education and the training that they need according to that statement. I am broadly satisfied with the assurances that the Under-Secretary has given me.
<P>
Equally, I am satisfied by his remarks on the timing of the statements. I was a little perplexed by the Under-Secretary's perception that there would be problems with the use of the word ``annual'' in legislation. This is another of those statements by Ministers that we may come to later in our debates or even in other Bills as to when such a provision is included in a Bill. However, I am not prepared to start a long debate about the meaning of the word ``annual'' at this point. I think the Under-Secretary has taken my point about the need for regular and up-to-date assessments. On that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 50, in page 4, line 44, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(3A) the Council shall not exercise the power conferred under section (3)(a) above in such a way as to
<P>
(a) discriminate between different classes of providers, or
<P>
(b) discriminate between different courses at the same or comparable levels on the basis of areas of study or mode of delivery, or
<P>
(c) require providers to charge tuition fees in respect of persons aged under 19, or
<P>
(d) require providers to charge fees for persons over the age of 19 pursuing courses in basic literacy or numeracy, including courses in English for those whose first language is not English, or
<P>
(e) require providers to charge fees for persons over the age of 19 who are unemployed or who are in receipt of a means-tested state benefit or who are unwaged dependants of such persons, or
<P>
(f) require providers to charge fees in respect of any course leading to a qualification at level 3 for a person under age 25 not already in possession of a qualification at or above that level, or
<P>
(g) require providers to charge fees in respect of any course leading to a qualification at level 2 for a person not already in possession of a qualification at or above that level.
<P>
(3B) in determining any conditions under subsection (3) above the Council shall have regard to the economic and social conditions in the area served by any person providing post-16 education and training to whom the conditions will apply.
<P>
(3C) in securing the provision of financial resources under section 5 above the Council must have regard to the requirements set out in subsection (3A) above and to any conditions it imposes on persons providing post-16 education and training under this section.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 91, in page 4, line 44, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(3D) The Council must publish an annual statement setting out any criteria and exemptions specified under sub-section 3.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> This is an important amendment for our policy of targeting when we intend to query the Government on their intentions in the Bill. The Association of Colleges has raised this issue. I am sure that the Government are aware of it as the association is sure to have made representations to them about it. I hope that the Government will give us a response as this is a critical area for colleges, especially as it will give them some idea of how their future finances will work.
<P>
In subsection (3), the Government grant themselves a new power to set fees within this sector. Historically, the Further Education Funding Council and the Secretary of State have allowed colleges to set their own fee levels in response to local markets and conditions. Although the Government have always indicated what they are prepared to pay, the colleges have maintained their independence in respect of what they have chosen to fund. With this clause, the Government take on themselves the power to specify fee levels as part of the criteria for the learning and skills councils offering funding in the first place. That is a novel development. We can understand why, as we bring together a whole range of providers under the clause, the Government are seeking in some sectors to be able to do that. However, in the college and further education sectors in particular concern has been expressed about how far the Government intend to go. To provide some context, I should point out facts about college fees. Currently, 90 per cent. of all such fees are less than £200, so we are discussing relatively modest charges that are very different from those which apply in the higher education sector. Two thirds of the £220 million in tuition fees that is collected by colleges comes from individual learners and one third comes from businesses.
<P>
We should also consider the flexibility that is currently in place. My attention has been drawn to a policy adopted by the City of Sunderland college to widen participation. It remits 100 per cent. of tuition and other course fees for students enrolling on part-time level 1 and 2 courses that consist of no more than 120 taught hours during no more than 18 weeks. This approach will provide free access to introductory courses in information technology, which all hon. Members would agree is a critical area. Such initiatives are to be welcomed in areas of high unemployment such as the north-east. There is concern about any move by local learning and skills councils to set fees centrally, especially if fees are being dealt with by the Learning and Skills Council at the national level, which seems to be the intention and which may have an impact on the operation of such initiatives.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hilary Benn </B>(Leeds, Central): I recognise the hon. Gentleman's argument. Will he also accept that the clause gives the Learning and Skills Council power to require providers not to charge fees? Is not that welcome?
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> Certainly. That is what we are seeking to explore. If the hon. Gentleman considers our amendment, he will see that it seeks to fence round the provision to do precisely what he suggests: to require the Government not to charge fees in particular circumstances. I shall explain in a moment why we have chosen the specific criteria contained in the amendment.
<P>
We are seeking to explore the Government's intentions, especially in the context of comments made by Baroness Blackstone in another place. She said that there would be detailed consultation on these and other funding issues in May. We have now reached May, so we are interested to hear about what sort of consultation is occurring. Baroness Blackstone said in another place that she hoped that my noble Friend Baroness Sharp of Guildford agreed that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>fee exemption arrangements for the disadvantaged and vulnerable should not be a matter for local discretion but rather national policy—[Official Report, House of Lords, 13 March 2000; Vol. 610, c. 1373.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Government have restated that aim, which we share. They have continually spoken about exemption and reducing fees, but there is concern that the provisions could work the other way and reduce local flexibility, especially as the new power is being given to the Learning and Skills Council at a national level, which is a novel concept.
<P>
I was going to mention another example. Colleges that seek to gain additional funding may feel that national policy could prevent them from doing so. I am told that the North East Surrey college of technology is able to levy both tuition and registration fees for most of its part-time and short courses while offering the possibility of remission for those in hardship. Tuition fees are typically set at about £60 for an introductory short course in information technology and at £90 for a single GCSE. Colleges are responding to local conditions and trying to deliver the maximum amount of further education appropriate to the needs of people in their area by charging differential fees.
<P>
As I said, I agree that fees should be brought down to the lowest possible level and that the highest possible amount of education should be delivered. However, such an approach may mean setting fee levels that differ according to the area in which they apply. That is what the amendment seeks to tease out.
<P>
We are concerned about the suggestion given by Ministers in another place that the Learning and Skills Council would operate its power under the Secretary of State's direction. In common with many of the powers in the Bill, the power in question will come directly from the Secretary of State and could work against local flexibility. Of course, that depends on the identity of the Secretary of State in question. I am sure that the Minister will say that the current Secretary of State will give particular assistance to people in deprived areas and will remit fees as far as possible. Indeed, I know that that is his policy, but we must be careful that primary legislation does not open up a gateway that enables a future Government to seek to do the reverse or to be given powers that they can exercise inappropriately.
<P>
The safeguards that the amendment seeks to introduce touch on some of the key issues raised with us. New paragraph 3A(a) talks about not discriminating between different classes of providers. As we open up the field, some providers may feel that the way in which the fees are being set discriminates against them and puts them at a competitive disadvantage in an important area of provision. In new paragraph 3A(b) we touch on discriminating between different modes of courses and different subjects where the powers to set fees could be used as a fairly crude form of moving funding between different study areas, again limiting the power of local providers to engage in the way that they have done in the past and which they feel is appropriate to local needs. We note that that is explicitly ruled out in the higher education sector. 
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
New paragraph 3A(c) clarifies in statute the fact that tuition fees should not be charged to those under 19. We are talking about broadening out the courses that are offered to those under 19. That is important and it would be helpful if it were stated explicitly. Otherwise, as far as we can see, an attempt could be made to charge fees for those who are under 19. New paragraph 3A(d) talks about specific courses that we understand are also Government policy priority, such as courses on basic literacy, numeracy and English as a second language. We think that it would be helpful if the Bill stated that fees would not be charged in those areas.
<P>
New paragraph 3A(e) talks about the cases where there is currently remission for those who are over 19 but who are unemployed or in receipt of benefit. Most colleges have sought to remit fees as a matter of policy and there has been some movement, but in keeping with the noble Baroness's comments we feel that it should be a matter of national policy rather than local discretion where people are identified as disadvantaged and vulnerable because they are in receipt of benefits.
<P>
New paragraphs 3A(f) and (g) are perhaps a cheeky attempt to return to earlier subjects in response to the national skills task force report. We are trying to introduce the suggestion that fees should not be charged for those seeking to qualify up to level 3 at under 25 years of age and those seeking to qualify to level 2 at any age. Again, we believe that that is worth restating continually. We always enjoy hearing the Minister respond by stating that the Government share the objectives of the national skills task force, even if they are not prepared to commit at this stage to bring them forward within the Bill, but prefer to see how things develop over time.
<P>
We hope that the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment can clarify what consultation is taking place in this sector, in individual colleges and the Association of Colleges. We want it to be clear that we are talking about a merged system in respect of a range of training and education providers: the colleges are being brought into the same framework as other private sector and independent training providers.
<P>
We want to give reassurance to the kind of people who have contacted us such as Richmond adult and community college, which wrote to my hon. Friend the Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable). More than half its income comes from fees and other charges which have enabled it to survive and prosper despite Government cuts. I think that it is referring to the previous Government, but there is no certainty that any future Government of whatever party, will not seek to put a squeeze on colleges. The Association of Colleges has asked us for some clarity on this. I hope that the Minister will take the opportunity to set out the Government's intention in respect of the categories and issues that I have described, as well as around the issue in general.

<P>

<B>Mr. David Chaytor </B>(Bury, North): I should like to make one or two comments on the amendment. I understand exactly what the hon. Member for Hallam is trying to do. In many respects, his objective of widening participation and ensuring that fees are not a barrier to education or training opportunities is wholly admirable. Although it would start an interesting and complex debate, I shall resist the temptation to comment at length on the anomaly whereby the Liberal Democrats seem happy to accept that fees should be paid in further education but seem to oppose fees for higher education.
<P>
However, I observe that the amendment contains one or two anomalies. For example, subsections (3A)(f) and (g) clearly contradict what I believe was amendment No. 20 to clause 2, which concerned the concept of entitlement that we debated just before Easter. The hon. Member for Hallam will recall that we tried to press the Liberal Democrats to say exactly what they meant by extending the entitlement up to the age of 25. At the start of the debate, they defined entitlement as free tuition up to level 2 for all. By the end of the debate, it was free tuition up to level 3 for all. Paragraph (f) shows that they are now restricting that to free tuition up to level 3 for all under the age of 25 who do not possess a qualification at or above that level. That contradicts what the Liberal Democrats said on amendment No. 20 just the other day. I now look forward with even greater interest to their conference and to finding out what policy emerges there.
<P>
There is also an obvious anomaly in paragraph (d) of the amendment, which ties together basic literacy and numeracy courses with English courses for those whose first language is not English. For many years, there has been general support—although recently not in all local authorities—for free tuition in basic literacy and numeracy. However, paragraph (d) would entitle a senior BMW executive, whose first language was not English and who came to the United Kingdom, to free tuition. I do not think that the hon. Member for Hallam intended that, and if he presses the issue he should be aware of that limitation.
<P>
The clause gives the LSC the power to make arrangements
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>for the provider to charge fees by reference to specified criteria.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
My understanding is that the criteria will be published in the fees document that we heard about this morning and that is due in the next eight or 10 days. There will be a two-month consultation period on the criteria, which will include references to the circumstances in which fees can be charged or remitted. That is the appropriate time to consider the matter further. The amendment is premature, although, as I said, I understand the objectives behind it and the principles underlying it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Brooke </B>(Cities of London and Westminster): I, too, shall be brief When we spoke to amendment No. 78, I referred to amendment No. 50 and its foreshadowing as a Liberal Democrat amendment to be moved by the hon. Member for Hallam.
<P>
I received correspondence on the clause from the Association of Colleges and Westminster college, which is run from Battersea. Since the abolition of the Inner London education authority, the college has fallen to Wandsworth rather than Westminster, but three of its four institutions are in my constituency. In the circumstances, it was a little surprising to receive from the principal of Westminster college a letter that started, ``Dear Mr. Brooke, hon. Member for Battersea.'' Whether it is more offensive to the hon. Member for Battersea (Mr. Linton) not to be identified as the Member of Parliament for his constituency by an institution within it or to me for being treated as a Labour Member of Parliament for a constituency other than my own is open to question.
<P>
The letter from the Association of Colleges arrived on the previous day and it provided the wording of the amendment. The Westminster college letter, which arrived subsequently, contained exactly the same briefing and exactly the same amendment. It had obviously passed through the hands of the principal, en route, as it also contained manuscript annotations—including an exclamation mark—so it was perfectly clear that she felt even more strongly about it than the Association of Colleges.
<P>
In debating amendment No. 78 and again on amendment No. 50, I mentioned our concern that the Government should demonstrate how the provisions will work from the bottom up rather than from the top down. The logic behind the section to which the hon. Member for Hallam wishes to add is clearly centralist. It confers a centralising power on the Learning and Skills Council. Undermining the relationship between colleges and their local hinterlands and detracting from the sensitivity with which they can respond to local circumstances can have a real effect, as the briefing shows.
<P>
It is generally agreed that under the old travel arrangements between 1962 and 1984, students could go to any higher education institution in the country without having to worry about the travel costs, which contributed to a spreading out of students in particular institutions around the country. Some universities that had previously looked to their industrial hinterlands began to look to them less frequently; and there is evidence that since the 1984 changes to travel arrangements, those universities have started to look more to them again. More students are attending particular universities from reasonably local points of origin. That shows how these matters can have a marked effect.
<P>
I look forward to hearing the Minister's explanation for why these powers, which the hon. Gentleman's amendment seeks to modify, are being sought by the Government. The letter from the Association of Colleges states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Association believes that this Clause provides unprecedented powers, so far not subject to any public debate, for the LSC to control the ability of colleges and indeed any other provider . . . to set the fees they wish to charge their end users, whether students or employers.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The briefing made a further reference:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>At no stage in the consultations leading up to the publication of the Learning and Skills Bill has it been indicated that the Government would be seeking new powers in this area.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In responding to the debate on amendment No. 78, the Minister slightly chided the Opposition for having raised the matter at all because he believed that it had been adequately discussed in the other place. However, we secured rather more information from our debate than had been secured in the other place. I hope that, on this occasion and with regard to the views of the Association of Colleges, the Minister will provide a full account of the Government's intentions and explain why he believes that they do not increase the centralising powers in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> My right hon. Friend has made some important points once again about the centralising character of the Bill and the top-down structure that is being enacted. I, too, will listen with interest to the Minister's response to my right hon. Friend's concerns. I shall speak briefly to amendment No. 91, which is a slightly different subject, but chimes in well with views expressed on both sides of the Committee.
<P>
My hon. Friend is absolutely right about the centralising tendencies. As clause 6 stands, conditions are imposed on providers by the Learning and Skills Council and there is no mechanism whereby anyone else can establish what conditions were imposed. The Minister may assure me that there is such a provision elsewhere in the Bill, perhaps that it is implied in clause 6. I look forward to hearing his response, but as it stands now, there is no provision for making the information available to the public. It would be in the public's interest and in the interest of openness and transparency for all concerned if the council were required to publish an annual statement setting out the criteria and exemptions specified under subsection (3).
<P>
<B>Mr. Jim Boswell </B>(Daventry): I defer to my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere, given that he is a lawyer and I am not. Is it not relevant that Ministers have certified that the Bill is compliant with the European convention on human rights? Clearly, it is most important that restrictions on the power of individuals to charge, for example, should be established on a principled basis.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> My hon. Friend is right. He does not need to defer to me on the matter. It does not need a lawyer to comment on the way in which the Government's Bills are rubber stamped with the provision concerning the European convention on human rights, when it really means that a rubber stamp has been applied and Ministers will give reassurances that the European convention has been complied with until the courts say otherwise. We anticipate a flood of such cases when the provisions of a particular Bill are found to be in breach of the convention.
<P>
It is in the interests of openness and transparency for the information to come within the public domain. Can the Minister explain how that may come about? This is yet another example of the need to chip away for freedom of information under the Bill and for everyone to know what the important conditions and exemptions are. The implied wishes of the hon. Member for Leeds, Central (Mr. Benn) may be fulfilled. We may find that more exemptions and conditions are imposed to prevent charges from being levied on individual users. We shall wait and see about that. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will agree that it is in everyone's interests that we should all find out about such matters and that the information should not just be kept between the providers and the Learning and Skills Council.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> I have mentioned on a couple of occasions the competition that I am running for the country's oldest learner. The right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Brooke) noted several past examples of oldest learners and it made me want to change the regulations, so that merely being deceased would not disqualify someone from the competition. However, I have not got around to that yet. I am not running a competition for the longest amendment, but clearly this is the front-runner to date. Because amendment No. 50 contains a wide range of different issues, I shall need to dissect its various components at some length if I am to offer a proper response to it. I welcome it in the sense that it raises some important issues that it is proper for the Committee to scrutinise.
<P>
I shall first make a few general points as I know that several colleges and other bodies have expressed concern about clause 6(3). We have heard of colleges and the Association of Colleges lobbying members. It is not for me to offer any apologies to the right hon. Gentleman for his being mistaken for a Labour Member. I am sure that that was a greater insult to him than to my party, but perhaps I am being too chivalrous. The fact that his local FE college made such a mistake renews our determination to drive up standards in further education.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I should make it clear beyond peradventure that the letter that I received came from Battersea.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> An up and coming area, I am told, but obviously not sufficiently up and coming in political science.
<P>
I am aware that some providers are concerned that the power under clause 6(3) could be used to prohibit their policy of waiving or reducing fees for people who may be under some form of disadvantage or who have a low income, but who do not come under the formal fee exemption categories. We shall be addressing that issue directly in the funding consultation that is planned for later this month. My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary said this morning that that document will come within days rather than weeks, which is absolutely right. I can only promise, by addition, that May will come early this year in that respect.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> It has already come.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> I understand that.
<P>
We are proposing no new change to colleges' current powers to waive or reduce those fees for individual learners. I want to emphasise that. Currently, several colleges in this country exercise that power as part of their social policy to meet local social and economic needs—a strength of the current system—and they will be able to do in the future. We have heard an example of that happening in Sunderland. Our endeavour in respect of further education is to increase participation by many sectors of the community. We have, of course, a special passion and commitment in relation to those from disadvantaged backgrounds. It would therefore be extraordinary if anything in the Bill, either explicitly or implicitly, were to interfere with that objective.
<P>
The other side of the coin is protection for the learner, and ensuring that excessive charges do not price provision out of reach. When the LSC contributes 75 per cent. of the costs, the learner's contribution must be capped at 25 per cent. I do not want such simple arithmetic—which, I believe, adds up to 100 per cent.—to be treated like the question of whether an annual statement occurs annually. However, it raises an important point. I remind the Committee that the LSC funding arrangements apply not just to the further education sector, where much of what we are concerned about is almost second nature, but to several thousand private sector providers, some of which operate on a for-profit basis. It would be wrong if some of those providers were to charge the learner more than 25 per cent.
<P>
Paragraph (3A)(a) would, in effect, require level fee rates for all types of providers. Even if the amendment were entirely desirable, it is likely to be a practical impossibility for some time. The LSC will bring together the further education fee system, the various arrangements applied by training and enterprise councils, and all the LEAs' arrangements for further education. The LSC starting point, in April next year, will therefore show great inherited variations in the fees charged by different providers up and down the country for similar provision. We want a more transparent and coherent approach to funding, but forcing that to happen so bluntly and immediately is unrealistic. The fee regime in the area of LEA-maintained adult and community education, for 2001–02 and 2002–03, will continue to be determined by each LEA. That is consistent with the two-year funding guarantee given to LEAs. The LSC will need to review fees for 2003–04.
<P>
Paragraph (3A)(b) will also impose a straitjacket on the fees that could be charged for similar provision. In broad terms, that is the position that obtains in the further education sector following the years of convergence since the sector's creation. There is some merit in the basic concept that lies behind that part of the amendment, but it has taken seven years to reach the current position in further education. There is no way that the same position will be achieved across all LSC-funded provision overnight. Bearing in mind the much greater variety of provision that the LSC will be funding, such a rigid approach may not be fully desirable. It would rule out the prospect of local discretion. Paragraphs (3A)(c), (d) and (e) seek to replicate in legislation what is currently a matter of FEFC policy in relation to fees. It is difficult to see what benefits follow from such an amendment, which would make inflexible what can currently be dealt with, and should be dealt with, flexibly.
<P>
Currently, the FEFC has various fee remission categories. Hon. Members will be aware that we will be extending free tuition to all 16 to 19-year olds, not just in full-time but in part-time provision. Further categories are unemployed people in receipt of jobseekers allowance and those in receipt of means-tested benefit. The categories include the unwaged dependents of these last two categories that I mentioned and those taking programmes where the primary goal is adult basic education, or English for speakers of other languages.
<P>
The approach of paragraphs (c) to (e) of the amendment would be to freeze the current approach to a continually changing situation. If the purpose of the amendment, however, is simply to probe our intentions, I am happy to assure hon. Members that we propose no change in the categories. Indeed, current well-established FEFC fee exemption categories apply only to schedule 2 courses.
<P>
A question arises about our future approach in this area. The schedule 2/non-schedule 2 divide will disappear as a result of the Bill. We have no intention of reintroducing this distinction by the back door. That is what would happen if we applied one set of fee exemption categories for one type of course and another set of categories for another type of course. I assure hon. Members that we shall not do that. One set of categories will be applied uniformly to all LSC funded provision, whether it leads to a qualification or not.
<P>
Let me go further and declare that we want the LSC to fund more first-rung provision of a type that would currently be labelled non-schedule 2. People taking such courses often tend to be from disadvantaged communities. As a result, they tend to fall squarely within the current fee exemption categories. Indeed, for some such people this is their gateway to further further education. Some colleges, of course, will wish to use the new flexibility to run what we currently call non-schedule 2 provision to cater for other learners as well as the disadvantaged. The key point, however, is that it would be for colleges to agree with their local LSC that such provision will attract LSC funding. If it is within the LSC funding agreement with the college, people taking a course will either get fee exemption paid for by the LSC if they are in one of the current fee exemption categories that I have detailed, or they will pay up to 25 per cent. if they are outside those categories. I hope that reassures hon. Members.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for spelling out the Government's clear intention to retain the fee exemption categories. Will he further help the Committee by explaining the process that he envisages for any reconsideration of the fee exemption categories? What is the role of the national LSC, of the Secretary of State and of the local LSCs? What parliamentary scrutiny is there of the fee exempted categories, which are very important in terms of public expenditure?
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> They are very important. It is difficult for any Government or any Committee exactly to foresee educational need for lifelong learning in five or 10 years' time and to predict what categories might be regarded as a priority, so it would be wrong to put that on the face of the Bill—it could lead to inflexibility.
<P>
We will have our consultation document in early May and it will give more details. It will be for the LSC to make judgments about the applicability of categories. The Secretary of State, who is accountable to Parliament, will always be able to issue guidance to the LSC. We want to ensure some flexibility, therefore, to meet needs that perhaps we cannot foresee at the moment. I hope that I have reassured hon. Members about the application of current categories and that my comments about the implications of the end of the schedule 2/non-schedule 2 divide show our good intentions.
<P>
We must retain the flexibility of the FEFC to ensure that the LSC can react quickly to changing circumstances in future. If we take a legislative route, we will have to wait for suitable legislation to ensure that, when it is considered appropriate to alter the fee remission categories, the new category is accorded the same status as existing ones. The LSC will want to consider fee policy carefully, and it will be poorly served if it has its work on the matter circumscribed by primary legislation. 
<P>
<H5>5.30pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
We believe that parts of the amendment are unnecessary, although I understand the good intentions behind them. The effect that they would have is secured flexibly and appropriately by FEFC action and will be similarly secured in future by LSC action.
<P>
Paragraph (f) of the amendment draws on a recommendation of the second report of the skills task force that all people should be entitled, up to their 25th birthday, to publicly-funded education and training to the level of their capability, up to and including their first level 3 qualification. As the hon. Member for Hallam was fair enough to mention, we have another opportunity to rehearse some of our earlier discussions. We have debated the point at length and shall not do so again now.
<P>
We recognise that the skills task force makes a compelling argument on the importance of level 3 qualifications for young people. However, we believe that tackling the low achievement of some of our youngest people is our highest priority, and that will begin with the raising of 16 and 17-year-olds' participation in learning and the improvement of achievement of level 2 qualifications by age 19.
<P>
The Government are seriously considering the implications of the recommendations of the skills task force. Our initial work suggests that a significant proportion of its implementation cost would cover fees that would have been paid anyway by the young person or his employer. Around half of those aged 19 or over are already contributing in some way to their fees.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Gordon Marsden </B>(Blackpool, South): Will my hon. Friend the Minister confirm that the benefit of not adding that paragraph of the amendment to the Bill is that future Governments will be able to consider and enact in legislation the extension recommended in the report, possibly through the comprehensive spending review? That would avoid the situation in which something had been dismissed once and for all in the Bill and so could not be considered in future.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> For those reasons, Governments are often reluctant to put too much detail in Bills. The pace of economic, technological and social change, which gathers every week in relation to the subject, means that when we have the precious opportunity of parliamentary time we must be especially careful to produce a Bill that will stand the test of time. I am grateful to my hon. Friend for making that point.
<P>
The amendment would have significant cost implications without proportionately increasing numbers of new young learners working towards a level 3 qualification. We cannot adopt what is, in effect, a back-door approach to giving a level 3 entitlement. Those issues would need to be weighed carefully before we could commit to the skills task force's recommendation.
<P>
I shall deal now with paragraph (g) of this long amendment. Hon. Members will know that we welcome the contribution that the skills task force has made to the debate on developing the skills of our post-16 young people and on the upskilling of lower-skilled members of the adult work force. In its second and third reports, the task force made important contributions to the analysis of the current situation, and it proposed possible measures to deal with it.
<P>
We sympathise with the needs of both the groups covered by the task force's entitlement recommendations. We are seriously thinking about the task force's proposals but, given the related public spending implications of the entitlement approach, it is only right that we should consider the proposals alongside other key spending priorities and consider the most cost-effective methods of tackling the issues. Again, we cannot accept a backdoor approach to an entitlement.
<P>
I have no great objection to the penultimate subsection—(3B)—but it is unnecessary. The LSC must already take into account a wide range of factors in discharging its main duties, including the needs of learners, the location and character of facilities, sectoral employment needs and so forth. There will be 47 local LSCs with considerable discretion in their communities precisely to give the LSC the ability to respond to local economic and social conditions and other local matters.
<P>
Subsection (3C) would apply everything in subsection (3A) to clause 5, which deals with what the LSC may fund. It would apply the same constraints across the board, not just to provision for education and training. On a technical point, I am not sure whether it would always make much sense, given that fees policy is not relevant to, for example, the provision of work experience or the funding of research. More generally, however, even where it made technical sense, it would be completely inappropriate for the reasons that I set out in relation to subsection (3A).
<P>
The amendment takes the top-down, inflexible and rigid approach that Opposition Members accuse us of taking from time to time. For that reason alone, I cannot accept it and ask the hon. Member for Hallam to withdraw it.
<P>
I must confess to not having been 100 per cent. clear as to the meaning and perhaps the intention of amendment No. 91. I think that the hon. Member for Hertsmere is seeking to ensure that the LSC makes an annual statement of the general criteria and exemptions that it will apply when using its condition-setting powers in relation to charging fees, making grants to individual learners or recovering some of the costs of learning from an individual or an employer.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The Minister has got it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> Thank you. Excellent. It is a great benefit to my lifelong learning that I have understood the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
The LSC will set out the details of its policies on the matters that I mentioned, taking account of any guidance from the Secretary of State. It will do that in its annual guidance, much as the FEFC does now without a legislative requirement. We would expect no less of an organisation whose operations will be coherent and transparent. I can give the hon. Gentleman a firm assurance on that matter, and I hope that that will satisfy him.
<P>
I hope that, with those explanations—I am sorry for their length—and reassurances, the hon. Gentleman will not press amendment No. 91.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> The intention behind the amendment was to explore the Government's views on all the key issues, and I am grateful to the Minister for his comprehensive response, which was helpful. We await the results of the consultation with anticipation.
<P>
There are still some serious question marks. For example, there is the issue of fee remission by individual institutions, which is related entirely to the level that is set for fees. Some people will be concerned that, although local colleges still have the discretion to remit fees, the cost to them will depend entirely on where the fee level is set. If that is done nationally rather than by the colleges, they will continue to have concerns about the impact on their local social programmes, because they will no longer have the same direct control as before.
<P>
As ever, the hon. Member for Bury, North (Mr. Chaytor) has made some helpful suggestions. We make no apologies for continuing to return to the recommendations of the second national skills task force. There are clearly questions about the levels at which one sets entitlement, but we are trying not to return to the same point on every occasion; we want to test the Government in several ways to see how far we can push them on entitlement. If I simply repeated amendments that offered the same entitlement, the Minister would criticise me for not being inventive in Committee, not seeking to explore the options and for banging on the same drum. Entitlement to training will continue to be an important theme to which we shall want to return. I shall certainly extend an invitation to the hon. Member for Bury, North to observe the debate at our party conference, which might assist deliberations in the Government about how to move forward. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will want to take up that offer.
<P>
The responses have been helpful. The Minister was careful to put the record straight, and we will study his remarks. We will continue to talk to colleges as they go through the consultation process. As I said, whether colleges feel comfortable working in the new environment will affect the extent to which local discretion is maintained. The Minister referred to local discretion for local learning and skills councils. In the light of his statement that they will have discretion over only a small proportion of the budget, that the fee levels will be set nationally and much of the budget delivered nationally, such local discretion may, if the fee policy is wrong, be insufficient to allow them the creativity to match their past achievements. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Amendments made: No. 43, in page 4, line 47, leave out `post-16' and insert `or proposing to provide'.
<P>
No. 44, in page 5, line 1, leave out `post-16'.—[Mr. Wicks.]
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ken Purchase </B>(Wolverhampton, North-East): I thank the Minister for his comprehensive response to the amendments. However, with regard to consultation on the charges and local determination, I seek his absolute assurance that he will speak to colleges with an open mind, recognising that many good practices have been developed over a number of years and that we ought not to throw babies out with the bath water. Will he also give an undertaking that the consultation will be wide enough to take note of the college's view in regard to the remission of charges in those other important areas of local discretion?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I did not involve myself in the detail of the amendments. The Minister's assurances have been broadly helpful and reassuring. I make two points. First, we should not overestimate the role of fees in the overall funding of further education, I quoted an answer from the Minister that stated that only eight per cent. of the total income of colleges is derived from that source. A policy built on the collection of inordinate levels of fees would therefore be unlikely to succeed.
<P>
Secondly, given what the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, North-East (Mr. Purchase) said, I think of the agonies that the west midlands is undergoing in relation to Rover—however, I do not intend to open that general issue. The Minister responded helpfully to my questions on apprentices. However, if a region or national industry is under severe difficulties, it is particularly important that colleges and the learning and skills councils supporting them should have maximum discretion to deal with the problems of not only individuals but large groups who have suffered what might be called a collective setback and need all the support that they can get in returning to education and training to re-establish themselves.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> I wish to respond particularly to the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, North-East—I always want to say for Wolverhampton Wanderers. The burden of my response was to give the reassurance that he seeks. Much of the good practice that one sees in colleges, often music colleges, is impressive. They find very imaginative ways of digging deep into local community concerns and needs—as I witnessed on my recent visit to Wolverhampton college. We should pay tribute to that work. The Bill and the new strategy of learning and skills councils will do nothing to undermine that. Indeed, our policy intention is to further that work.
<P>
I hope that my comments about what we currently call non-schedule 2 work will encourage the hon. Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell). Local colleges will still be able to respond to local needs in those important ways, because they are at heart local institutions. I hope that my hon. Friend and other members of the Committee will accept that reassurance.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 106, in page 5, line 17, leave out `by schools'.
<P>
This is a small amendment designed to probe several related matters, and is a precursor to our more seriously political anxieties, about which my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere will speak in a moment. It is designed to probe the inclusion in subsection (1)(b) of the words
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the provision by schools of education.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Given that the provision relates to a power to set budgets through LEAs as part of their schools budget, why is it necessary to include the word ``schools''? Might its inclusion be unduly limiting? For example, the reference to schools might mean maintained schools—state schools—but it does not say that. Other activities that are part of the business of schooling, such as the provision of school transport or educational welfare, for example, might, because they constitute purposes connected with provision by schools, be held to be covered.
<P>
The Minister will be able to reply briefly. I am anxious to ensure that the best and most suitable provision will not be ruled out by those two words ``by schools''. For example, the education authority might as part of its school budget be empowered to—and might sensibly want to—conduct some experimental activity. We referred earlier to collaboration with further education colleges, and I do not want that to be precluded by that phrase.
<P>
I shall return to another, slightly more substantive point in a moment, but in discussing whether such education must be delivered by schools, I should point out an apparent anomaly—which I did not notice until I re-read the clause—in that subsection (3) refers to the ``local schools budget'', which appears in the clause, and to the phrase ``maintained school'', which is defined as having the same meaning as in part II of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998. The Committee will notice that the clause contains no other reference to the words ``maintained school''. The only place in the Bill that I could find to hang it was in schedule 7, where no doubt that is its meaning. The reference seems to be an architectural or drafting untidiness, as the phrase is referred to here without, apparently, another reference.
<P>
The other point of substance that the amendment is designed to probe is the relationship of the money that LEAs will receive under the clause with other moneys made available to LEAs or for LEA activities through the LSC. We are discussing post-19, or adult, education and, to use the old phrase to which the Minister referred in the previous debate, non-schedule 2 education. As I understand it, that will continue to be made available through the LEA, but funding may come directly from the council. The clause relates to schools, but can the Minister explain why the grants given to LEAs to conduct community learning will come through a different route? That may be a good idea, but we must be clear whether it is possible for moneys to cross over between one funding stream and the other—albeit that they are both received by the LEA or by LEA-maintained institutions? There might be no difficulty, but it would be helpful to receive the Minister's reassurance and explanation of such concerns.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> When I first read the amendment, I was surprised by it given the interest of the hon. Member for Daventry in the welfare of school sixth forms. There may simply be some confusion, however, in which case I hope that I can clarify it.
<P>
Clause 7 enables the LSC to provide funding to LEAs for school sixth form provision. We are discussing the funding of schools, not the funding of adult or community education. The clause specifies that the grant will form part of the local schools budget for the area and that it will be used to fund provision in schools for pupils over compulsory school age or provision connected with post-16 education at schools. It means that the LSC must require the LEAs to pass on all the funding that they receive to the schools or to spend it on connected matters and, in so doing, ensure that they are not allowed to top-slice the money for other unconnected purposes.
<P>
If LEAs were to be allowed to spend the grant that they receive from the LSC for sixth forms on matters other than post-16 education delivered in schools and matters connected to it, that would be to the detriment of pupils in school sixth forms and to the schools themselves. The amendment would seriously—unintentionally, I am sure—undermine the guarantee that we have given school sixth forms on funding. We have pledged that their budgets should not be reduced in real terms provided that pupil numbers are maintained. Given what the hon. Member for Daventry said about maintaining the important role of school sixth forms in post-16 education, I cannot believe that he would want to allow such a situation to come about. I hope that he will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
As for the definition of maintained schools, I refer the hon. Member for Daventry to amendment No. 27, which will delete that unnecessary definition.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I thank the Minister for his final point as I do for his clarification and the fact that the two funding streams are to be kept separate. Although we consider that his assurances about school sixth forms are somewhat flimsy, it would not be our wish to weaken them further. In fact, our views are very much to the contrary.
<P>
We are clearly establishing that there will be two mechanisms, one of which concerns specifically the sixth form budget going to schools and which has nothing to do with the general powers of the LSC to fund local authority conducted adult education. The assurances that we have received are satisfactory and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 79, in page 5, line 19, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(1A) Where an education authority has existing sixth form provision the Council must make a grant per sixth form pupil consistent with the real terms value as defined by the average of the three financial years 1998–2001.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment follows on from our debate on the funding conditions for school sixth forms. My hon. Friend the Member for Daventry used the word ``flimsy'' to describe the Government's assurances, which is an apt description. In fact, it might have been over-generous in its description of the amount of security that it is giving school sixth forms. We believe that the new structure that will replace the funding of school sixth forms is fraught with implications. It is also a circuitous way in which to find sixth forms and one that involves more bureaucracy than is presently the case. It will do that because it introduces another institution into the picture for the funding of school sixth forms—that of the Learning and Skills Council.
<P>
The LSC decides on the sixth form funding which then goes to the schools via the local education authorities. That method of funding school sixth forms has profound implications. We worry about the Government's intentions and why schools sixth forms are being dealt with in this way. In my relatively brief experience of these matters, when a Minister speaks about bringing greater coherence to overall funding, it means only one thing: one had better reach for one's wallet. We suspect that this may be the case here.
<P>
Amendment No. 79 deals with just one aspect. It seeks to define a three-year period—1999-2001—as the baseline against which the real-terms funding for schools sixth forms will be set. We think that it is fairer to take an average over three years as a baseline rather than a single year. We are concerned about the nature of the guarantees that the Government have given. We are concerned about school sixth form funding, but the amendment would be one small improvement on the Government's proposals.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chaytor:</B> What interests me about the amendment is not the three-year period, but the definition of the grant per sixth form pupil. How does the hon. Member for Hertsmere understand the grant? At present, school sixth form funding is dependent on the definition of a sixth form pupil, or rather on the numbers of sixth form pupils recorded on the form 7 return in year 12. It is generally accepted that there is a large discrepancy between the numbers of pupils recorded on the form 7 return and the number of pupils who continue their course and are entered for the final examination. Would not the amendment continue the system whereby schools can over-claim money for pupils who have left? Does the hon. Gentleman support a funding system in which schools sixth forms can continue to over-claim as that is the inevitable consequence of his amendment?
<P>
<B>Mr. Graham Brady </B>(Altrincham and Sale, West): I cannot, of course, speak for my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere. What particularly attracts me to amendment No. 79 is another aspect of the point that the hon. Member for Bury, North sought to highlight. It is not the potential problems of abuse in the system, but the fact that it has the merit of drawing out from the Minister in a little more detail the pledge that he says has been given. The Minister was at pains to say that the expenditure on schools sixth forms will be maintained in real terms, but the question of per pupil or per capita funding is crucial to discovering the Government's intentions.
<P>
If a school has a successful sixth form, as most of the secondary schools in my constituency do, there is always a pressure for it to be expanded. That is particularly true of the New Wellington school which has a sixth form that is only a couple of years old. It has developed and taken root and is a successful and thriving part of a successful and thriving school. I am pleased to say that the Minister's Department has just approved a further tranche of technology college status for it. It is a successful school with a successful small, but growing sixth form. The amendment would guarantee not only that funding for existing sixth-form provision would be maintained, but that where there is growth in sixth-form provision, the same advantages and funding levels would be maintained. I look to the Minister for some assurance that, even if the Government are not prepared to accept the amendment, they intend, through funding for school sixth forms, to make allowance for growth in numbers in existing sixth forms and to provide for the creation of new sixth forms.

<P>

<B>Mr. Purchase:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman accept that all is well and good where there is a growing sixth form—the next layer of money is welcome and helps to expand existing provision? However, does he recognise that there is also a downside to his formula because when one pupil leaves, the loss is greater than the effect of the mere marginal cost of that pupil and can undermine a whole course? There is a difficulty in trying to specify what the precise funding should be on a per capita basis because other matters often have profound effects on the provision of sixth forms in different areas in the same borough.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes an entirely valid point, although that is not a problem for schools in my constituency, which are so popular that they are fighting off new applicants all the time, both from within and outside the borough. However, I accept that there could be a problem for schools in many other areas. That does not release the Minister from the need to address the point, which is whether the Government's assurance is simply a way of avoiding controversy about the future of school sixth forms or whether they genuinely embrace existing school sixth forms and accept that there is real merit in sixth-form provision and a strong case for its expansion.
<P>
<B>Dr. Phyllis Starkey </B>(Milton Keynes, South-West): Will the hon. Gentleman clarify the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, North-East? Is he suggesting that the amendment is intended to relate only to areas in which the sixth-form population is increasing? If not, is he able to answer the point raised by my hon. Friend about the disproportionate effect of pupils leaving at a time when the school-age population is decreasing?
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I thought that I had answered that question openly and honestly by accepting that the hon. Gentleman had raised a valid point. Of course there is a difficulty. I hope that what the Minister said is an assurance from the Government that adds up to a little more than the literal words used and is not a limited guarantee that relates only to existing provision. I want the Government to demonstrate that they accept and understand the benefits of school sixth forms, and that where there is growth in sixth forms, funding in real terms will increase proportionately to those increases in numbers.
<P>
There are limitations in the Opposition amendment
—which proves that I am not an ideologue, very like my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere—because, as I understand it, the amendment would apply only to LEAs with existing sixth-form provision, and I should like it to be extended to those LEAs that might wish to create new provision. That is a simple point, on which I hope the Minister can give me an assurance.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I reassure both my hon. Friends that I speak as a Back Bencher on this matter because I want to raise with the Committee a specific experience that I have had. Before doing so, I should perhaps say that I, too, would join the non-ideological stakes. I refer to my previous ministerial experience in the area. When considering proposals for schools to have sixth forms, I tried to take a view based on the merits of the case relating to factors including quality, convenience and the specific details of the offer. We might wish to return to those matters when we debate the principle of the clause during the stand part debate; I do not propose to open the subject now.
<P>
We have referred to earlier ministerial experience from time to time. In this case, I must go back a little further. The case has no relevance to education although it has precise relevance to interventions that the administrative system can make when understandings are reached in relation to provision. The case relates to when I was special adviser at the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. I entered the role with the specific purpose of trying to work out common sense decisions regarding milk quotas, and I encountered two problems that have arisen in the debate.
<P>
The first and greatest problem that we had in trying to work out what was a fair milk quota for farmers was that one year was too narrow a basis from which to take the measure. There are huge natural variations over a three-year period—a field might change from being grass to being ploughed, for instance. If one decides the quota on a one year base, one considers more or less any biological organism—and I would include a school sixth form as being, in a sense, that—
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman is just about holding the line.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am watching carefully, Mr. Hancock. It is important to raise the matter because it constitutes relevant official experience. We were obliged, incidentally by a European decision, to take a single year for calculating the base and we had to wrestle with the consequences. We found it difficult to account for all the different cases.
<P>
There might be a decline in numbers in a sixth form because there had been a bad year for GCSE and fewer people were staying on, because a beloved teacher had left or because people had decided that they could do better in the local further education college. We might start with a historically low level. If that established itself as a trend over three years, there would be a case for the Minister attenuating the guarantee. If there were a purely contingent case because of a low base year, the Minister's guarantee would not be worth a great deal because it would be confined to that low sixth form number, which would be perpetuated as the baseline for the guarantee. That demonstrates the relevance of the first problem.
<P>
The second problem with which we had great difficulty when introducing milk quotas related to what we learned to call development cases. A farmer might wish to expand his herd or activities, incurring capital investment or other commitments to do so. As my hon. Friend the Member for Altrincham and Sale, West (Mr. Brady) said, there will be natural surges in sixth form numbers. People might want to go to a school because it is popular, successful and achieving results. If that happened and the guarantee were tied to a historically low baseline, that possibility could not be catered for.
<P>
The cases are examples in which an unnaturally low number, or an historic number that was no longer appropriate, was used to determine a baseline. I mentioned them to suggest that my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere is on to a good point in seeking a wider basis on which the guarantee might be given.
<P>
The Minister might, in his wisdom, go away and think about a three-year period. With the longer period, the effects of the variation between one year and another would be dampened down; a better basis and a clearer understanding would be provided and the Minister would be in business with his guarantee, as he claims to wish to be.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I would not normally intervene at this stage, but I do so to answer the points made by the hon. Member for Bury, North. I am not sure whether the hon. Gentleman thought that he was intervening but I had concluded my speech. For the assistance of the Committee, I am happy to deal with his comments and answer his question before the Minister responds in case the Minister wants to dwell upon the same point.
<P>
I accept the hon. Gentleman's reasonable point. The amendment's purpose is not to fund non-existent sixth-form pupils but to set a baseline of three years instead of one. That will iron out possible differences and avoid the problems that might arise if the baseline results are derived from a year in which numbers are unusually small.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chaytor:</B> I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman's clarification. That may be the amendment's purpose, but its consequence would be to continue to fund schools on the basis of pupils who are no longer there. It is irrelevant whether we base that on a one-year period or a three-year period. Sixth-form funding, whether it be for this year, last year or the preceding year, is based on some pupils who are no longer present. Other sixth-form providers—sixth-form colleges, tertiary colleges and general further education colleges—are funded on the basis of the FEFC methodology that partly recognises students who have been recruited, their continuation and their achievement. That is why there is a 20 to 25 per cent. difference between the funding for sixth forms and other providers. The difference is unjustified because it is based on pupils who are no longer present.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I am not prepared to go to the stake for ideology or for the technical precision of my amendments. The hon. Gentleman succinctly identified the purpose behind the amendment, which is ad idem with my description of it. If his eloquence in warming to its purpose and my modest words have helped to persuade the Under-Secretary of the case for the amendment, perhaps they could produce a better version of it that embodies its intention. We can all help in the great process of improving the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hilary Benn:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I will, but I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not spoil the growing consensus.
<P>
<B>Mr. Benn:</B> I fear that I might. Given that the level of expenditure on school sixth-form pupils is determined by decisions of the governing body and not by the LEA's age-weighted pupil allocation, is not the amendment meaningless? It would not fetter the decision that governing bodies make about how they allocate LEA funding within a school and therefore could not guarantee that it would achieve its purpose.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes a fair point, and he understands the amendment's purpose, whatever its technical defects.
<P>
I hope that the Under-Secretary responds to the good point that my hon. Friend the Member for Altrincham and Sale, West made about what would happen if the numbers increased.
<P>
<B>Dr. Starkey:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman clarify his point? Is he saying that we should not worry too much about the detail, but vote instead on the broad-brush idea behind the proposal?

<P>

<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> It is a good job that the hon. Lady was not on the Conservative Benches during the previous Parliament because such a comment would have received considerable rebuttal. We stand not on the technical precision of our amendments, but on the broad objectives. She will get used to the idea if she considers more Bills in Committee.
<P>
I hope that the Under-Secretary will be able to respond in a warm way to what has been a useful debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> I suspect that substantial amendments sometimes give rise to small debates. Today, however, a not unimportant but technical amendment has been used as a peg for a large, although not necessarily great debate. Some hon. Members are thinking more about the ballot box than the school sixth form. We may need to wait until after Thursday for the moderation that characterised our proceedings this morning to return.
<P>
I am disappointed that Opposition Members should refer to our assurances on school sixth forms as flimsy. Politics are afoot here. We exposed on Second Reading the fact that the Conservative party is running a political campaign, including the sending of Tory party letters to schools, falsely asserting that the Government are against school sixth forms. Nothing could be further from the truth. We are concerned that all young people should have first-class education and training. However, we recognise that much that is good takes place in school sixth forms, sixth form colleges and in the FE sector. We are concerned about all sectors, and do not wish to single out one sector for political purposes.
<P>
<H5>6.15pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I stress that point with some urgency, because I am aware that a false assertion that is repeated often enough can gain currency. I want to hit that false assertion firmly on the head. In response to the hon. Member for Altrincham and Sale, West, we are very much in favour of the school sixth form, and we wish it well. In answer to the hon. Gentleman's question, we intend that increased numbers would mean increased funding for schools with more pupils. That is sensible, and I am happy to give that assurance.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I am grateful to the Minister. Will he go a little further and make it clear that that increased funding would be proportionate to the increase in numbers?
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> Whether it is fully pro rata will depend on the availability of resources. A sixth form that was already enjoying unit funding well above the level suggested by LSC national rates would obviously have less of a case for pro rata additional funding than a growing sixth form that was receiving well below national unit funding levels. It would be sensible to consider each case, but I am happy to give the broad assurance that when numbers increase, funding will increase.
<P>
<B>Mr. Phil Willis </B>(Harrogate and Knaresborough): Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> I welcome and give way to a Liberal Democrat latecomer.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis :</B> I apologise to you, Mr. Hancock, and to the Committee for my late arrival. I had an appointment near Southampton that lasted for most of the day.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I hope that it was worth while.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I found it interesting, given some of the Minister's recent comments that I found in the literature that I have been reading today. I hasten to add that the hon. Member for Daventry would not dare to put his name to it, because he is such an honourable Gentleman.
<P>
We have reached the kernel of the matter. I have no reason to believe that the Minister has a hidden plot for sixth forms, but what he said is important. We have had no clarification as to exactly how sixth forms will be funded after the two-year moratorium. The Minister's response was important; he said that the additional funding will be pro rata only if it meets the criteria in place at the time.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Hon. Members must remember that interventions should be exactly that. If the hon. Gentleman had been here earlier, he could have taken part in the debate. He still can, possibly on clause stand part. However, the present intervention should now be brought to an end.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I am suitable reprimanded, Mr. Hancock. I merely ask the Minister whether he has any intention of writing to the Committee to make the mechanism for funding absolutely clear.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> On point of order, Mr. Hancock. Is the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough (Mr. Willis) allowed to speak after the Under-Secretary?
<P>
<B>Mr. Chairman:</B> Yes, he can if he chooses to. I hope that I have not encouraged to him to do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> He will, Mr. Hancock, he will. I was not concerned by the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough's intervention, although I understand why you should be. I assumed that the intervention was one of his medium-sized speeches. There will be opportunities to air this issue in the next clutch of amendments—if that is the right word—as well as on clause stand part.
<P>
I assure the Committee about the funding for expanding school sixth forms. However, one must have regard to equity when comparing one school's circumstances with those of another. We heard some interesting agricultural analogies from the hon. Member for Daventry. Given that this is an era when historic apologies are often made for past deficiencies, I thought, when he was talking about milk, that we were at long last going to receive an apology from the one-nation Tories for the sins of Maggie Thatcher the milk snatcher. Unfortunately, although we enjoy his capacity for lateral thinking, it does not stretch that far. It occurs to me that, although the milk was never asked to give its view about the size of the milk quota, we have asked schools their view about the substance of this technical amendment. I will come to that in a moment.
<P>
I am aware that a similar amendment was discussed in another place when my noble Friend Baroness Blackstone explained that the baseline period for the funding guarantee was the subject of consultation. I can now say that, following that consultation, with effect from 2002-03, we propose to transfer to the LSC, out of the education standing spending settlement, an amount representing the funding delegated to schools for sixth-form provision. The baseline year for that calculation will be 2000-01. I can assure hon. Members that that figure will be uprated in real terms for 2002-03 when the LSC assumes its responsibilities for sixth-form funding.
<P>
Schools were divided in their response to the consultation on the appropriate baseline year. Some respondents favoured a baseline of 1999-2000 or 2001-02. A small number favoured an average of the three years from 1999 to 2002. By far the largest body of replies, including those from a variety of schools and LEAs, supported our proposal for the baseline year 2000-01. That is also the most recent year for which full data will be available to enable us to introduce the funding changes for school sixth forms from 2000-03. For those reasons, we think that the year 2000-01 is the most appropriate baseline to adopt for 2002-03 when the LSC's sixth-form responsibilities begin. In view of that explanation and given the extended debate that we have had about many different matters, including from time to time the amendment, I hope that the hon. Member for Hertsmere will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I am not at all satisfied with the Minister's response, despite the care he has taken in making it. For those members of the Committee who are concerned about the broad brush being brought out, I think that I was painting with great finesse compared with the broad brush that the Minister used when he came to explain how schools will be funded in the future, especially when he came to expound the numbers. The way in which the Minister dealt with that provided little reassurance for schools.
<P>
The Minister explained that he would not go along with a three-year baseline and that he would take only a single year. That is his decision and we believe that there is a lot to be said for taking a three-year period. However, following our extended debate and the fact that we are about to discuss some even more important amendments, I shall not press the amendment, but will simply register our dissatisfaction with the Minister's response and the fact that we may wish to return to the matter. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 119 in page 5, line 19, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(1B) In making a grant to a local education authority, the Council must take account of a maintained school's choice to provide minority subjects or to provide mainstream subjects to low numbers of students, when the consent of governors and parents is established'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> with this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 92, in page 5, leave out lines 20 to 22.
<P>
No. 88, in page 5, line 22, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(2A) In attaching conditions to a grant under subsection (2) the Council shall have regard to any guidance issued by the Secretary of State.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I hope that we shall have a slightly warmer response from the Minister to these amendments, and particularly to amendment No. 119, which speaks for itself in calling for greater local flexibility. When a positive decision has been made, which parents and governors support, to teach minority subjects or to teach small groups, that decision should be respected. We hope that the Minister will respond positively to the need to respect those decisions and to protect the teaching of minority subjects and to small groups of pupils.
<P>
Amendment No. 92 is a probing amendment, the need for which has become greater following the disjunction that occurred during an earlier debate between the interpretation of Ministers in this place and Ministers in another place on the interaction of clauses 6 and 7 and whether clause 6 applies to schools or local education authorities.
<P>
Clause 7(2) allows the Learning and Skills Council to impose other conditions on the funding that it grants to local education authorities besides the condition in subsection (1) that the funding be applied in the local schools budget for sixth forms. Subsection (2) particularly provides that the conditions should include the sort of conditions that the council might impose on other sorts of provider under clause 6. We know that the conditions in that clause cover a wide variety of matters and we accept from the letter from Baroness Blackstone that the sorts of conditions under clause 6(3) are not intended to be invoked. It may help the Committee if I briefly refer to the part of the letter that deals with subsection (3) in which Baroness Blackstone states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We would not . . . expect the kind of conditions listed in Clause 6(3) to be invoked with regard to grants to LEAs for the funding of school sixth forms. In particular, let me make it clear that there is no possibility of us expecting LEAs to charge fees to sixth formers for their education.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We accept that, but it leaves open other conditions that could be imposed under clause 6, including conditions under clause 6(2). It may help the Committee if I briefly remind it that those are sweeping conditions which allow the council or person designated to have access to accounts, documents, computers, associated apparatus and material and also to make requirements to give the council information.
<P>
We would like to know whether the Government intend that those conditions should be imposed on local education authorities and whether they should be imposed on individual schools. It seems to be open to the LSC under clause 7 to impose conditions not only on local education authorities, but, through that, on schools. If the LSC can impose such conditions only on local education authorities and not on schools directly, that is far from evident in the Bill. Even if they could, the conditions that they might require of local education authorities could result in greater burdens being placed on schools. For example, the LSC might decide to require the provider—the local education authority—to give it more information. An obvious next step would involve the LEA requiring schools to give it more information, so that it can provide the LSC with the information that it seeks.
<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Committee members may share my experience in this context. One of the most frequent complaints—if not the most frequent—that I hear from head teachers of schools in my constituency involves the amount of information that they are required to provide and the additional regulations that are placed on them. They have to provide more information for LEAs and the Government. Head teachers have told me that they spend half their time filling in forms. We are discussing a further source of the need to provide information. How will the conditions affect our schools in practice?

<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> We have already discussed a similar amendment in another place. Baroness Blackstone gave a clear and comprehensive answer to a question about small classes and minority subjects. It might be helpful if I explained the situation again.
<P>
I remind Committee members that under the new arrangements LEAs will still have an interest in planning school sixth form provision. They will have to consider ways of providing a wide choice of options for pupils when planning sixth form provision. Small classes are not the only, or necessarily the best, solution to offering minority subjects.
<P>
There will, naturally, be some circumstances in which small classes are the only realistic method of provision. I accept that that may be inevitable, for example, in a rural area where there is only one isolated secondary school and few, if any, other providers of post-16 education.
<P>
When a sixth form cannot offer sufficient curriculum breadth, or pupils are being taught in isolation, there is a risk that they may miss out on an important element of sixth form education—namely, the opportunity to share ideas and to develop their own thinking. We therefore believe that, where it is possible for them to do so, LEAs and schools should be able to explore other, more appropriate means of provision. For example, there are many parts of the country in which two or more educational establishments are located close to each other—there can be considerable benefits from working together. We should also be mindful of the possibilities that information and communication technology offers in relation to collaboration for the future learning of some sixth formers. Increasingly, that is common practice. ICT will never be a substitute for human contact, but it is a useful complement to future learning in this context.
<P>
There are already many examples of successful collaboration or co-operation agreements between one or more schools, or between schools and further education colleges. We want to encourage that approach, which can help to broaden the range of provision that is available, and raise standards. I am sure that all Committee members share those goals.
<P>
Such co-operation agreements might be large or small in scope and they might involve a few, or many, subject areas. Those on the ground must take such decisions, and they must take into account local needs and circumstances.
<P>
That approach can help to ensure that the widest possible choice of options is available, and that school sixth forms remain dynamic and attractive to potential pupils and their parents.
<P>
It would be wrong for the LSC to be tied by a requirement to bow to the wishes of individual schools in the way that the amendment dictates. The LSC must not be forced to allow the provision of small sixth form classes in all cases, regardless of whether that is the best way to meet student needs. We recognise that in many cases there could be much greater benefit for the wider learning community through the development of collaboration or co-operation agreements.
<P>
The hon. Member for Hertsmere explained that amendments Nos. 92 and 88 offer alternatives, but both of them are misguided. Let me explain why.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman's arguments for amendment No. 88 reflected his concern that the LSC might use its powers under subsection (2) to set unreasonable and unduly onerous conditions on local authorities in return for a grant in respect of sixth-form education. I hope that my earlier remarks on amendment No. 106 have gone some way to reassuring him that the Government do not intend that to happen. However, where a problem arises, the Bill gives the Secretary of State the power under clause 25 to issue directions to the council and under clause 27 to append conditions to the grant that he makes to the council. In the unlikely event that the LSC behaved in a manner that the Secretary of State felt to be unreasonable, he could use the powers to stop it doing so.
<P>
I cannot put the argument against amendment No. 92 any better than Baroness Blackstone did in speaking to a similar amendment in another place, when she said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>By accepting the amendment and leaving subsection (2) out of Clause 7, we would be leaving the door wide open for LEAs to receive or spend their grant without reference to entirely reasonable guidance or rules of propriety.—[Official Report, House of Lords, 13 March 2000; Vol. 610, c. 1377.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Subsection (2) is needed to ensure that the LSC can apply proper conditions on the way in which local education authorities use the funds given to them in respect of sixth-form education. It will allow the LSC to require LEAs to provide proper access to their accounts and respond to reasonable requests for information. I emphasise that this power relates to LEAs and not to individual schools.
<P>
For example, the LSC may wish to require LEAs to supply evidence about pupil numbers and related data for their areas and to ensure that the council is put in a position to check such data. The conditions that might be made under subsection (2), therefore, will be those that should rightly attach to any spending of public funds in the interests of protecting their proper use. No reasonable member of the Committee should or could object to that. In addition, any conditions that the council imposes must be consistent with the regulations that the Secretary of State makes about use of the local schools budget under section 46 of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998.
<P>
Hon. Members would rightly be concerned if we allowed the LSC to exercise undue control over LEAs, but I assure them that that will not be the case. Baroness Blackstone wrote to Baroness Blatch on 21 March to reassure her that we do not intend the LSC to impose conditions on LEAs of the kind set out in clause 6(3), as the hon. Member for Hertsmere has accepted. As rumours may spread, I want to put it on the record that there is no possibility that the LSC will expect LEAs to charge fees to sixth formers for their education. That would run counter to sections 450 and 451 of the Education Act 1996, which prohibits the charging of fees for education at maintained schools.
<P>
Moreover, we set out in another place the circumstances in which the LSC will use the power. We have said that we intend the LSC to require LEAs to ensure that funding for pupils with special educational needs statements in mainstream school sixth forms and special schools does not end on their 19th birthday, but continues until the end of their course.
<P>
I hope that, in view of the assurances that I have given, the hon. Member for Hertsmere will not press his amendments to a vote.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I listened carefully to the Minister's response and do not draw a great deal of reassurance from it. His response to amendment No. 119 was all well and good in a way, but it ignored the point of the amendment, which was the need for a lengthy decision-making process and, where schools, parents and governors had reached a decision about the teaching of minority subjects, to respect that decision. The Minister's reply made it clear that any such decision could be overridden and not taken into account.
<P>
It was a good example of the way in which the Bill has been constructed using a top-down approach that does not allow for decisions to come from the bottom upwards: they can be overridden in the interests of what the Minister chooses to describe as a collaborative approach. That phrase is beginning to have a certain ring to it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Purchase:</B> I rise to express sympathy with the view about small classes being maintained in certain circumstances. However, is the hon. Gentleman cognisant of the fact that in some circumstances classes may be too small to be educationally viable? Taking notice of the views of schools, parents, pupils and teachers means that it is inevitable that the arguments against funding a certain sixth-form activity are sometimes greater in weight than those in favour of it. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that consultation must be a two-way process, and that those who consult have to abide by the decisions that are taken?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes an entirely reasonable point: it is possible to have classes that are too small. However, the people who are in the best position to make a judgment about that are parents and governors. If we cannot trust governors to take a decision on such matters, with what decisions can we entrust them? They are much better placed to know about the position of the school than are remote bodies imposing conditions on local education authorities.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I seldom want to rush to the defence of the Government, but does the hon. Gentleman not realise that very small classes in sixth forms are often funded by a cost elsewhere within the school?
<P>
<B>Mr. Benu:</B> Cross-subsidisation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> The hon. Gentleman is right. It is cross-subsidisation. There is nothing in the framework of the Bill to say that that will not be allowed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I take the hon. Gentleman's point, but my response to the intervention by the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, North-East pre-empted him. Parents and, especially, governors will be well aware of any element of cross-subsidisation and in the best position to take a decision about it. Once again, top-down decision making is being imposed on schools.
<P>
<B>Dr. Starkey:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman accept that the logic of his position is that governors would be able to take a decision—for example, in relation to a minority subject—without any financial discipline being imposed? If the amendment were to be passed, they could decide that Serbo-Croat should be taught in every school in a locality, with one pupil in each school taking the subject, secure in the knowledge that they would receive the necessary money. The difference with cross-subsidisation is that governors have to exercise a certain degree of responsibility about financial resources, and their choices are therefore informed by financial rectitude as well as responding to the needs of pupils.

<P>

<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Even where governors exercise such a responsible kind of decision making, they may be overridden.
<P>
<B>Dr. Starkey:</B> No.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The hon. Lady is not doing justice to the position of governors. Of course they are aware of the financial constraints on the school, and they are best placed to take decisions on how the school's budget will be organised within those constraints. They are much better informed about the needs of the school and its pupils than someone who is in a more remote position. Strangely enough, the Government seem to have a similar lack of trust in the role of local education authorities. In his response, the Under-Secretary implied that they go about their business without any regard to costs, better book-keeping and the need to police resources.
<P>
We are suspicious that yet more burdens will be imposed on head teachers. The Under-Secretary gave some good examples of the burdens that will result from the requirements of the Learning and Skills Council—on top of all the other requirements and burdens from local education authorities and the Government. New organisations constantly seek to justify their existence by inventing new areas of activity. What effect will that have in terms of placing greater bureaucratic requirements on schools?
<P>
We are not happy with the Government's response, which, once again, is indicative of their centralising tendencies. Unless the Under-Secretary can provide some better assurances, I am minded to press the amendment to a vote.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> I confirm that, in future, a school with a sixth form may continue to cross-subsidise. The mainpoint is that, as my hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West (Dr. Starkey) implied, the amendment would require the LSC to pay for uneconomic provision, with no local constraints on the budgetary implications. That is why I urge my hon. Friends and all members of the Committee to reject the amendment, should it be pressed to a vote.
<P>
<H5>6.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I am very tempted to press the amendment to a vote, and I wish to register my dissatisfaction with this state of affairs. In view of the stout defence that Liberal Democrats have uncharacteristically offered the Government, my good will perhaps diminishes, but I will nevertheless make a gesture of good will. To show how moderate and un-ideological I am, to gainsay some of the Government's suggestions and so that we can progress to yet more important debates, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Amendment made: No. 27, in page 5, line 23, leave out `and ``maintained school'' have' and insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`has'.—[Mr. Wicks.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Purchase:</B> On the question of distributing grant from the council to the local authority and from the local authority to schools, does the Under-Secretary envisage that the local authority will be compensated for its administrative time from that block of grant, or a separate source? Such transactions are never cost-free.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> Given comments made in debates on other amendments, and given the Under-Secretary's slightly weak assurances on a number of points, it is important to state certain reservations about the clause. It was noticeable that the Under-Secretary appeared at first to give generous and full assurances about the expansion of sixth forms. He said that expanding numbers would be accompanied by expanding resources, but that was quickly qualified as he sought to make it clear that such expansion would depend entirely on existing funding levels. Having guaranteed an increase in funding if numbers increase, the Under-Secretary described a scenario in which a sixth form could increase its numbers but receive no extra funding, either because of the overall constraint on resources or the current level of resources compared to other areas.
<P>
The Under-Secretary commented on minority subjects. I accept that there are inevitable constraints, and it will not always be possible to guarantee that a minority subject will be taught in every school that seeks to do so, but there was a slightly worrying undercurrent in his comments. He appeared to suggest that there would be a shift in the balance in this regard. Schools frequently go to considerable lengths and, as other Committee members have said, often have co-operative arrangements with other establishments to ensure that minority subjects are provided. However, the Under-Secretary appeared to suggest that there might be planned provision, possibly throughout the whole area of the LSC, which could be larger than the current LEA area. That suggests a worrying transition to a world in which the provision of minority subjects is downgraded and pupils have to travel considerable distances to study those subjects. In relation to my constituency, one could say: ``It is perfectly possible to travel into central Manchester to partake of a particular course of study.'' The Under-Secretary must be aware that the timetable imposes real constraints—it is not easy to give pupils a full and free choice of A-level subjects in the sixth form. Inevitably, there will be constraints—it is not possible for every sixth former to choose the combination of subjects that he or she wants to study. Regrettably, the Under-Secretary's comments on amendment No. 119 left open the possibility that there may be a far greater constraint on the choice of subjects and on the combination of subjects that are available in sixth forms.
<P>
I seek to draw a comment from the Under-Secretary on one further point, which involves sixth formers who have not attained the age of 16. Admittedly, it is uncommon for someone who engages in sixth-form study in the sixth form to be under 16, but in that situation, would the relevant funding route be via the LSC or through the LEA, as is currently the case?
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I, too, am disappointed—not by the Under-Secretary's response, but by what he did not say: he did not explain the future funding of post-16 education. Unlike many other Committee members, I have direct experience in this regard. The hon. Member for Daventry expressed concerns about the two tiers of funding in further education colleges—funding is provided through the FEFC and, in sixth forms, through LEAs and the block grant system. Further education has been under-funded for many years. Most of us share the hon. Gentleman's concerns.
<P>
The Under-Secretary implied that we shall have a national funding system for the whole of post-16 education after the two-year period, which will end after the next general election. That is an excellent idea, and we may share it. However, how will the formula be calculated? It might involve the current FEFC formula, which basically involves three parts—recruitment, retention and completion—or, as was pointed out in an intervention, the way in which schools are currently funded. There are fundamental differences between the two systems. Schools are fairly generously funded at sixth-form level by most local authorities because they accept the point that has been made by several Committee members about small groups and minority subjects. Most further education colleges do not cater for groups of less than 12 because it would be impossible to run them in the current climate. If the new national formula system drives out the small minority subjects from sixth forms, will small groups continue to study, for example, Serbo-Croat, Latin or classics? That is a genuine rather than a party political concern that raises real issues about the funding system. Again I plead with the Minister to tell us the Government's thinking on how and at what level they expect the units of funding for post-16 education to be given after the trial period.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I shall be brief because I have already made some germane arguments on the matter. There is a view that much of the Bill embodies change for change's sake, and that that applies to these provisions. We strongly suspect that there is another agenda. We would have liked to hear far more than we have from the Government about their intentions, and how the arrangements will operate in the longer term. We suspect that the measures will inevitably result in a thinning out of school sixth forms after the general election—although we hope to be in a different position then, of course. We do not like the provisions for that reason. We also think that they illustrate clearly the top-down approach that seems to run throughout the Bill; it takes decisions away from the local level and puts them in the hands of the remote body. The Government have not justified the creation of that additional layer of bureaucracy, which gives us the gravest suspicions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> Once upon a time I studied one of the minority subjects that has been discussed in the debate, and one of the imperatives of that subject was that one should pay attention to the original texts. My hon. Friend the Member for Altrincham and Sale, West, drew attention to the fact that the encouragement given by the Minister when he spoke about additional funding for sixth forms was rapidly tempered by a look at the text of the Bill.
<P>
I draw the Committee's attention to the fact that Baroness Blackstone in another place said
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We intend that a rise in pupil numbers should give rise to additional funding. Whether the admission could be on a fully pro rata basis—the key point—would depend on the availability of resources at the time.—[Official Report, House of Lords, 8 February 2000; Vol. 609, c. 639.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Minister's letter to me, which we discussed at the beginning of the Committee and which was undated but reached me on 11 April, stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We intend that a rise in pupil numbers will give rise to additional funding but you will appreciate that the extent of any increase in funds will depend on the availability of resources at the time.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There is no conflict between what the Minister wrote and what Baroness Blackstone said. However, the Minister's sentence somewhat modifies the commitment that Baroness Blackstone gave in the Lords, and it sounds as if we are receding rather than advancing in terms of the quality of admission. I do not doubt the Minister's good faith, but it sounds as if
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the availability of resources at the time<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
is becoming the deciding factor.

<P>

<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> We have had a useful discussion. I start by dealing in no particular order with some of the specific questions that have been put to me. The hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough spoke about his concern that minority subjects should be protected, and I agree with that. That is not the same as saying that resources should always be available. Let us take the hypothetical case of one small school where one student is studying one subject. None of us would agree with that—or certainly not in a non-ideological moment.
<P>
I would argue that through better co-operation and collaboration, aided in part—but only in part—by information technology, we will enable a diversity of subjects to be taught at the level that we are discussing. There are all sorts of possibilities. It would harm that ideal if we put our heads in the sand and assumed that the only way of ensuring that pluralism was to guarantee that every subject was taught in every school because the school wanted it. That is not the way to guarantee that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The Minister might like to give some thought, in response to the powerful points made by the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough about the need for minority subjects, as to whether we could impose some kind of general duty on the LSC. That duty would ask it not merely to provide for the needs of young persons and persons over 16 or 19, but to have regard to the importance of a broad range of subjects and curricula. It might, as an alternative, be appropriate to put that duty on the local councils. Clearly, without reference to party politics, there is an interest in continuing those subjects somewhere.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> Indeed, and we all share that as a wish and aspiration. The Secretary of State spoke with passion about the need to safeguard a range of subjects, including some that are not the most popular these days. However, we must be sensible about how to ensure that that happens in practice, not just in rhetoric. In an age when more of our young people will be in education and/or training after the age of 16—I hope that there will be a mix—and when the population group studying such subjects will be expanding, it would be extraordinary if, through collaboration and co-operation using new technologies, we were not able to ensure that a rich mix of subjects can be studied in any local community.
<P>
<H5>7 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
In response to the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough—who is shaking is head, I am sure, because he is thinking of something else and not because of what I said—our thinking on funding generally will be set out in the forthcoming consultation document. Before he arrived, I indicated that that would be published shortly, early in May. I hope that he will be able to wait for that.
<P>
The hon. Member for Altrincham and Sale, West, raised a specific but not unimportant point about who will fund those children who study A-levels in sixth forms before the age of 16. When we were on the Select Committee, he and I had an interest in the highly able child, and how it is sometimes appropriate for the young teenager to study at a more advanced level. I therefore understand his concern. The answer is that funding for the pre-16s will come from the LSC.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> Does that mean that a 15-year-old, at key stage 4, who studies A-levels as part of his or her course, would be double-funded? They would be funded through the LEA formula of key stage 4, and then receive additional funding in the sixth form.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> I am happy to write to the hon. Gentleman with a specific answer to that specific question. However, I should like to provide a general assurance to the hon. Gentleman that my colleagues in the Department, and, when appropriate, the LSC, will be clever enough to ensure that there is no such double funding. Sensible arrangements will be in place to enable a 15-year-old who is partly doing A-levels and partly GCSEs to be funded in the round—properly funded but not over-funded. That matter shall be given further consideration.
<P>
The hon. Member for Altrincham and Sale, West, made points about students having to travel to study. I understand the importance of that in certain rural areas.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> Not just in rural areas.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> Yes, I understand the importance of that.
<P>
Nothing in the Bill will force students to travel further. Local LSCs will have no role in deciding the school curriculum, and, therefore, no bearing on that—albeit important—issue. The hon. Member for Wolverhampton, North-East, asked whether LEAs will be compensated financially. Only the delegated part of school funding will be transferred. It would not be fair to top-slice for LEA costs, and we do not intend to do so. I am happy to discuss the matter outside the Committee if I have missed the hon. Gentleman's point or if he needs a more detailed response.
<P>
We have debated the clause thoroughly today and it was debated in another place. In developing their proposals for sixth forms, the Government have listened to the views not just of other politicians but of those involved in sixth-form education. Our consultation paper on school sixth forms last year invited views on two options for future sixth-form funding. One option was for LEAs to be funded by the LSC; the other was for LEAs to continue to be funded through the current local government finance system.
<P>
In the light of comments received, in particular from head teachers, we decided that the LSC should fund LEAs for their sixth-form provision. For 16 to 19-year-olds, schools and colleges tend to provide a similar curriculum. We are trying to move towards a more coherent and consistent approach to the funding of 16-to-19 provision across the country, while taking into account local needs. It would be inconsistent with that objective to leave school sixth forms entirely outside the funding system for other 16-to-19 providers.
<P>
I believe firmly that our chosen approach will boost our objective of greater coherence for the 16-to-19 age group and will lead to increased local collaboration and better local planning. The Government want a successful and effective sixth-form sector. The Secretary of State has made a commitment to maintaining each school's sixth form funding level in real terms where pupil numbers do not fall. That commitment has been repeated many times here and in another place during earlier discussions on the Bill, and I repeat it today. Where pupil numbers fall, funding will be reduced on a pro rata basis—no more or less. Where sixth forms are popular, the Government have no intention of limiting their scope for expansion. That would be inconsistent with the new 16-to-19 entitlement enshrined in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am puzzled by something that the Minister said, which I should like him to clarify. If the reduction is to be pro rata in the case of diminishing sixth-form numbers, why is he not prepared to give the commitment that, where sixth-form numbers are increasing, the increase in funding will also be pro rata?
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> We must have regard to the particular circumstances. Hon. Members often instance a certain school in their arguments, but if in any of our constituencies there were two schools, both expanding in numbers, but one had traditionally been well funded and the other had been funded rather meanly, the common sense judgment would be to look at each case rather than fund pro rata. The local situation will require local decisions, and I am confident that they will be sensible. I give the assurance that, where schools increase in numbers, extra resources will be made available.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> During the speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere, the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, North-East asked: ``Are you prepared to see a reduction in pro rata funding, if you are seeking pro rata funding for increases?'' He argued that the disadvantage of being on a pro rata basis as the numbers go down is worse, and the marginal cost incurred is much smaller. Therefore, it seems slightly curious that the Minister should pray in aid that argument now.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> I have sought to give the assurances. Opposition Members, for whatever reason, are trying to run a scare story, particularly this week, to the effect that we are against the school sixth form. That is not true. We are very much in favour of school sixth forms as part of the provision for 16-to-19 education in this country. I am aware that sometimes a misleading statement can run more quickly than the truth, but the truth is that we are committed to school sixth forms. As I said in an earlier sitting, a few months ago there was argument over whether a school in Sutton— Liberal Democrat territory—should be able to have a sixth form for the first time. My judgment, made on the evidence, was that it should because it suited local circumstances.
<P>
I am not addressing my remarks to the intervention of the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster, but to the general mood across the Committee, and I strongly resent the idea that we are somehow against school sixth forms, which is simply not true.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> The Minister must surely accept that even if he and his ministerial colleagues were committed to sixth forms, it would be possible under the Bill for local learning and skills councils to take a particular view on the allocation of local resources, which might be detrimental to school sixth forms. Unless concrete guarantees are written into the Bill, that must remain a serious worry.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> On other occasions, the hon. Gentleman argues about the importance of local decision making. The balance will be struck on this and other matters between the strong centre and clear strategy represented by the national Learning and Skills Council and the local learning and skills councils. Guidance will be provided by the Secretary of State. The Government—and the Bill—are not in the business of enabling local discrimination to take place against school sixth forms, sixth-form colleges or FE colleges. We shall ensure that that does not happen.
<P>
Some people may criticise the Government for failing to provide guarantees about increases in the extent of future public funding, but we have made our intention clear that expansion should attract extra funding. No Government could, in all honesty, provide a cast-iron guarantee about whether increases could be provided on a fully pro rata basis. It would depend on the resources available at the time. Indeed, we need to ensure a rational and coherent system and therefore consider the needs of one school and another, so that we are constantly levelling up.
<P>
The clause specifies that the grant will form part of the local schools budget for the area, and that it will be used to fund provision in schools for pupils over compulsory school age or provision connected with post-16 education at schools. That means that the LSC must require LEAs to pass on all the funding that they receive to the schools or to spend it on related matters, and in so doing ensure that LEAs are not allowed to top-slice the money for other unconnected purposes.
<P>
We ruled out the approach of direct funding of school sixth forms by the LSC because we did not want the schools themselves to have to deal directly with two entirely separate funding bodies. These changes should impose no significant additional burdens on schools. They will continue to receive their funding from the LEA, just as they do now. It is true that the new funding mechanisms may require extra pupil data from schools—for example, three pupil counts rather than two—but the experience of schools that have taken part in recent sixth-form funding pilots has shown that need not be onerous. Of course, under the new arrangements, schools will retain their ability to vire funds between pre-16 and post-16 education, where they choose to do so.
<P>
There has been a good deal of debate about clause 7(2), which allows the LSC to impose conditions on the way in which local education authorities use the funds that are allocated to them for school sixth forms. That is an entirely proper measure to preserve the accountability for public funds. Those conditions will, for example, allow the LSC to require that LEAs provide proper access to their accounts, respond to reasonable requests for information, and repay any overpayments—hardly controversial stuff.
<P>
I have already said that the conditions that the LSC will be able to impose under clause 7(2) must be consistent with the regulations that the Secretary of State makes under section 46 of the Schools Standards and Framework Act 1998. Clauses 25 and 27 give powers to the Secretary of State to ensure that that is the case. We have already given assurances about the way that the powers in subsection (2) will be used. Baroness Blackstone wrote to Baroness Blatch on 21 March to say that we do not intend that the LSC should impose conditions such as those listed in clause 6(3) on local education authorities and that, in particular, there is no possibility that the LSC will expect LEAs to charge fees to sixth forms, as we discussed earlier.
<P>
More positively, on Third Reading in another place, we showed that the powers will be put to good use, as the LSC will require LEAs to ensure that funding for pupils with SEN statements—in mainstream school sixth forms or in special schools—will not end on their 19th birthday. Instead, it will continue to the end of their course. Hon. Members will agree that such a safeguard for a vulnerable group of young people is important and that it represents an appropriate use of the powers.

We have consulted carefully on our proposals for sixth forms. We have provided firm assurances to schools about their financial position, and have made our commitment to sixth form education clear—no reasonable person could doubt it. For those reasons, I believe that the clause should stand part of the Bill.
