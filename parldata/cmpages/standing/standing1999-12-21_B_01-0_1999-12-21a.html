<H3><center><A href="/pa/cm199900/cmbills/005/2000005.htm">Freedom of Information Bill</a></center></H3>
<P>
<H5>1.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before I call the Minister to move the sittings motion, it may help the Committee to know the arrangements for tabling amendments during the recess. Amendments that are received in the Public Bill Office before 4.30 pm on Friday 7 January will appear on the blue paper on Monday 10 January. They will be unstarred and therefore selectable for our next sitting on 11 January. Amendments that are tabled on Monday 10 January will be starred for the sittings on Tuesday 11 January.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department (Mr. Mike O'Brien):</B> I beg to move,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>That, during proceedings on the Freedom of Information Bill, the Committee do meet, with effect from Tuesday 11 January, on Tuesdays at half-past Ten o'clock and at half-past Four o'clock and on Thursdays at half-past One o'clock.
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I welcome you, Mr. O'Hara, and your colleague, Dr. Clark, to the Chair. I am sure that during our consideration of this important Bill, your expert guidance and tutelage will ensure that we make progress and have a full and proper discussion of the issues.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Greenway </B>(Ryedale): It is a great pleasure to find that you, Mr. O'Hara, and Dr. Clark will be chairing our deliberations. We look forward to your helpful comments. I also thank you for your guidance on tabling amendments during the recess. I am sure that the Committee will benefit from that.
<P>
However, there is one matter on which I am unclear. My hon. Friend the Member for North Dorset (Mr. Walter) was appointed to the Committee by the Committee of Selection, but such is the Government's legislative work load for Home Office Bills that my hon. Friend will now sit on the Standing Committee considering the Political Parties and Referendums Bill. As that Bill will have its Second Reading on 10 January when we return from the Christmas break, the Committees may overlap. I am not sure that a substitute can be appointed, but, whether the official Opposition are a team of four or three, I assure the Committee that we shall approach the Bill in a constructive frame of mind.
<P>
In outlining the matters that we will debate at half-past 10 and half past 4 on Tuesdays and half-past 1 on Thursdays, I hope that—
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Before the hon. Gentleman moves on, I can give him some guidance. Unfortunately, the hon. Member for North Dorset can be discharged from the Committee only by reason of incapacity or appointment to the Front Bench, so, as does sometimes happen, he will have a heavy work load.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I rather feared that that was the case, but I sought a courteous way of giving my hon. Friend's apologies to the Committee for his non-„attendance. Whether or not he can attend other sittings will depend on the sittings of the Standing Committee considering the Political Parties and Referendums Bill. I know that the Under-Secretary is similarly placed in respect of many of the important Bills due for consideration.
<P>
I do not want to detain the Committee when the House is about to go into recess for the Christmas break. It may help the Under-Secretary, however, if I outline briefly the concerns expressed on Second Reading by hon. Members on both sides of the House who saw a need for at least four elements of the Bill to be strengthened. I suspect that those concerns are shared by hon. Members on both sides of the Committee Room, notwithstanding the work of the hon. Member for Weaver Vale (Mr. Hall). They include the questions whether a purpose clause is necessary and whether degree of harm should be a factor in discretionary disclosures, which are dealt with in clause 13. The other concerns relate to factual information that has advised and informed ministerial decision making and to general enforcement and appeals.
<P>
Those are four elements of the Bill that the Opposition want to discuss. We also want to debate other matters, but I do not anticipate that we shall seek to delay proceedings with vexatious amendments. We shall instead seek your help and forbearance, Mr. O'Hara, in important and lengthy debates on the key issues in the Bill, some of which I have mentioned. Given the concern expressed on Second Reading about the four elements that I have outlined, I hope that the Minister will inform us of the extent to which he is prepared to accommodate the concerns of the Committee and of the House before the Bill reaches its Report stage in a few weeks.
<P>
We hope that by taking that approach we shall achieve a constructive outcome and that the Committee will not be unnecessarily detained. We hope also that at the end of our proceedings there will be the prospect of a stronger and better Bill. I wish you, Mr. O'Hara, the Clerk and all of those who will serve us in the new year a happy Christmas and an enjoyable millennium.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heath </B>(Somerton and Frome): I, too, welcome you to the Chair, Mr. O'Hara, along with your colleague, Dr. Clark. I apologise for the absence of my right hon. Friend the Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross (Mr. Maclennan), who is unavoidably detained in the north but who would have wished to be present.
<P>
I do not wish to detain the Committee. I mean it no disrespect, but I would have preferred our proceedings to take place in the House, as Second Reading showed a breadth of interest in the Bill that stretched far and wide across the Benches. I hope that the Liberal Democrats will be able to express our support for the Bill's basic principle, which, as the Under-Secretary knows, we have long advocated. We are disappointed that the Bill falls short in many key respects of what was anticipated in the White Paper and of parallel measures that may be the subject of current discussion in another Parliament. We shall follow that debate with interest and try to adduce to the present proceedings, where possible, the elements of the Scottish provisions that it seems appropriate for us to discuss.
<P>
As I said, we do not need to detain the Committee long this afternoon. We shall attempt to persuade hon. Members on both sides of the Committee of the need to strengthen the Bill. We will not put forward vexatious amendments—that is not our business. It is our business to make the Bill a genuine freedom of information measure which meets the demand for a climate of freedom of information that not only affects the mechanics of government but can renew and reinvigorate our democracy. That is the task that the Committee has been set. It is a great task and we shall attend to it seriously.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mark Fisher </B>(Stoke-on-Trent, Central): Before you, Mr. O'Hara, and Dr. Clark are buried under an avalanche of good wishes, I should like to say what a pleasure it is to serve for the first time under your chairmanship in a Standing Committee.
<P>
Reference has already been made to Second Reading, which I thought was a constructive and positive debate, notable for the contributions of my hon. Friend the Under Secretary and my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary, both of whom showed open minds about the Bill and an intention to examine in a constructive light suggestions from the Committee about how to improve it. Their approach is a welcome and intelligent one to a Bill of huge historic importance. As the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath) said, the Committee's task of scrutinising and improving, where necessary, the Bill, before reporting to the House, is a serious one. The attitude of my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary and my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary on Second Reading and their response to the two excellent reports of the Select Committee on Public Administration is a sign that we can make progress, improve the Bill and ensure its historic importance.
<P>
The hon. Member for Ryedale (Mr. Greenway) identified two matters which are of particular interest to the House and, I hope, the Committee—the powers of the commissioner and the distinction between factual information and advice to Ministers. I expect that every Committee member recognises that the latter should be confidential, in the interest of the good working of Government. To those I would add the question of class exemptions that are not subject to a harm test—an issue that we shall want to explore with the Government—and the benefits of a purposes clause such as exists in some other countries' legislation.
<P>
In addition, some fine tuning will be needed, but I suspect that the four issues that I have mentioned will command much interest in the Committee, as they did on the Floor of the House. I look forward to an interesting debate in the forthcoming session.
<P>
<H5>1.45 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> We are fast approaching the season of good will, and I can see that there is much good will in the Committee. I hope that in the weeks to come that sense of good will and understanding will persist. I particularly thank the hon. Member for Ryedale for the constructive approach to the Bill that he has suggested will be adopted by the Conservative party. I am grateful to him for flagging up the issues that he wants to raise. I share his hope that we shall be able to make fast progress on the less controversial aspects of the Bill, while properly considering the issues that Members regard as substantial and as requiring further development. I thank the hon. Member for Ryedale for the approach that he has taken. He and I go back a long way—we served on the Select Committee on Home Affairs and I greatly valued his knowledge and experience. I am sure that we shall be able to find other areas of consensus as we proceed.
<P>
I also thank the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome for assuring us that there will be no vexatious amendments. I hope that he is as anxious as I am to ensure that we enact the Bill. It is important that we have time to discuss what will be an important change to our constitutional arrangements and the way in which we operate government.
<P>
We inherited a culture of secrecy in government that goes back 200 years or more; we intend to change it. We want a new culture of greater openness. The Bill, the data protection legislation and a process of change in the culture of government will enable the Government to be more open with the electorate. The opportunity to explore how that might be achieved is important.
<P>
As clause 76—the key clause—says, nothing in the Bill requires secrecy. The objective of the Bill is the creation of a culture of greater openness. I hope that, during our discussions, we shall have the time to show how the Bill will achieve the necessary balance between greater openness in government and a respect for the privacy of individuals, the proper confidentiality of commercial interests and the efficient running of government.
<P>
We intend to listen. I assure my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central (Mr. Fisher) that we shall listen with care to the points that he and others put. I am grateful to him for notifying us of the areas about which he is especially concerned. We shall have the opportunity to examine the Government's reasoning on those issues.
<P>
As we are in the season of good will, I wish all my colleagues on the Committee, including you, Mr. O'Hara, and Dr. Clark, a happy Christmas, a prosperous new year and a good millennium.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Resolved,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>That, during proceedings on the Freedom of Information Bill, the Committee do meet, with effect from Tuesday 11th January, on Tuesdays at half-past Ten o'clock and at half-past Four o'clock and on Thursdays at half-past One o'clock.
