English body is eligible for
registration&#148;.</div><a name="080129152000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
implies a voluntary element in the case for registration, whereas until
now the assumption on which I was working was that social housing

that</div><a name="080129152000451"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
review has also adopted two principles underlying the design of the
regulatory system...to apply the same approach, where possible,

words, all providers will have to be registered rather than those who
are eligible and who choose to be
registered.</div><a name="080129152000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">Page 16
of the report
states:</div><a name="080129152000452"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;As
noted above, an independent social housing regulator...should be
established by statute, with specified duties and powers relating to
the ownership and management of social
housing.&#148;</div><a name="080129152000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">It seems that
the Government adopted the same approach to the main regulation. Let us
consider page 114 of the impact assessment, which states:</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column582" />Column number: 582</div><a name="080129152000453"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The Cave review
recommended that the regulator&#146;s responsibilities should be
cross domain (i.e. cover all social housing providers&#151;Registered
Social Landlords, Local Authorities, Arms Length Management
Organisations (ALMOs) and private
sector).&#148;</div><a name="080129152000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">The key
sentence is that the Government were clear in
their</div><a name="080129152000454"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;response to Cave
that tenants should be able to expect the same minimum standards of
service and have similar opportunities for empowerment, to influence
delivery and to seek redress regardless of their social housing
provider.&#148;</div><a name="080129152000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">That means
that the social housing provider should not be able to opt in or opt
out of the system.</div><a name="080129152000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
was therefore slightly surprised when the voluntary element entered the
debate just before stumps were drawn on Thursday. The Minister
said:</div><a name="080129152000455"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;No, in
respect of the earlier point about the philanthropic organisation, it
would have a choice as to whether to register voluntarily. I hope that
is clear.&#148;</div><a name="080129152000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">He then
repeated his
argument:</div><a name="080129152000456"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It
would be entirely for that philanthropic organisation to make the
strategic decision as to whether it wished to be
regulated&#148;.<i class="I">&#151;&#151;[Official Report, Housing and
Regeneration Public Bill Committee, </i>24 January 2008; c.
570-71.]</div><a name="080129152000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">Against the
background of an earlier debate on the definition of social housing, I
took quite a lot of stick from both sides of the Committee for
suggesting that a social housing provider who had not received any
public funds should not be obliged to come within the ambit of the
scheme. The Minister made it clear that what really matters is not who
provides the house, but the characteristics of social housing. He
said:</div><a name="080129152000457"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I
believe strongly that this philosophical policy point&#151;that
social housing should be defined by means of its
characteristics&#151;is the right
approach.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;[Official Report, Housing and
Regeneration Public Bill Committee, </i>24 January 2008; c.
538.]</div><a name="080129152000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is why he was not
sympathetic to my amendment, which defined social housing as being in
receipt of public funds.</div>
<a name="080129152000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">Perhaps the Minister will
explain whether we are going to have two types of social housing: that
which comes within the ambit of the Bill&#151;I assume that those
currently registered with the Housing Corporation will automatically
register with the regulator&#151;and, possibly, future providers of
social housing whose stock meets all the requirements that we discussed
in relation to clause 67 but who choose not to register. As I
understand it, the tenants will be social housing tenants, because they
come within clause 67, but the body in charge of them would not need to
register, because the Minister has said that that is voluntary. What
has happened to the Cave principle of single domain regulation, if
there is a voluntary element to whether people
register?</div><a name="080129152000079"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129152000517"></a>Mr.
Wright:</b> That is an important point. I will set out the
current regulatory regime, which has been in place for around 30 years.
With the current system, there is a clear divide between housing
associations, which almost exclusively developed social housing for
rent, and private developers, who had almost no involvement in social
housing whatsoever. The world has moved on. It has become somewhat
murkier, in a positive sense, than the system established by the
regulatory regime 30 years ago, particularly with the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column583" />Column number: 583</div>development of mixed tenure housing, which is central to the development
of mixed communities and is something that I would like to see
accelerated in years to come to secure high numbers of social houses
and better standards.</div>
<a name="080129152000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">In support of that, many
non-profit providers are now developing market homes and using the
proceeds to cross-subsidise their social homes. I suggest to the right
hon. Gentleman that the Bill ensures that standards relating to social
housing apply only to providers of social housing. On his specific
question about those who are currently registered, I can tell him that
those who are currently registered with the Housing Corporation will
automatically be registered with the regulator. The Bill places exactly
the same requirements on profit-making providers in respect of housing
standards and standards for tenants, and the requirements are similar
in other areas.</div> <a name="080129152000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
propose tabling amendments to enable the regulator to set standards for
financial management and governance of all providers, rather than
current housing associations only, as well as amendments that will
apply the moratorium regime to all providers. I do not think that there
is a split or a two-tier system. We will have a single domain regulator
in respect of social housing, with a clear intention, in terms of local
authorities and ALMOs, that we will be moving towards that in two
years&#146;
time.</div><a name="080129152000082"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="080129152000518"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Nick Raynsford</b> (Greenwich and Woolwich) (Lab): I agree
with my hon. Friend on the objective of having a framework that covers
all providers, and I fully understand that existing housing
associations will be required to continue to register under the new
arrangements. What is not clear, which is the point that the right hon.
Member for North-West Hampshire has raised, is what obligation there
will be on private sector providers who choose to provide social
housing as part of these mixed communities to register. If they simply
decide not to register, will there be any sanction? If they do not
register, how can the objective of a common domain set of standards
irrespective of the landlord be
achieved?</div><a name="080129152000083"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129152000519"></a>Mr.
Wright:</b> In the previous sitting, we discussed the case of
a philanthropic organisation that chose not to register. Such a
decision might be strategic, because, for example, if the organisation
provides houses for its employees, it might feel that it did not need
to. All existing housing associations will be automatically registered,
as per clause 241. Others may choose to register, and they are required
to register if they wish to receive grant from the Homes and
Communities Agency for rented housing. That relates to the Liberal
Democrat amendment on being in receipt of public grant, which I
resisted. The key point on receiving HCA grant for rented housing and
the retention of ownership is that it may well be that an organisation
builds houses and then passes on the ownership to a registered provider
in order to manage them. That is the key
test.</div><a name="080129152000084"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129152000520"></a>Mr.
Raynsford:</b> I accept that entirely. Where
a housing association is engaged in that process, it will, as under the
current arrangements, undoubtedly be required to register. However, I
cannot see any obligation on a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column584" />Column number: 584</div>private sector provider. As the Minister has suggested, we could get a
more fluid market, with some private sector providers possibly
providing an element of the social housing required under section 106,
cross-subsidised by the profits from outright sale. In that case, there
is no obligation in terms of a capital grant from Government, so what
sanction or obligation is there to require the landlord to register? If
a landlord does not register, how can we be sure that the tenants, who
are effectively tenants of social housing, get the same protection and
standards that are the objectives of the Cave report, which they would
get if they were tenants of a landlord who was required to
register?</div><a name="080129152000085"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129152000521"></a>Mr.
Wright:</b> It depends on what the provider wishes to do. I
reiterate that if they want to retain ownership of those homes, they
will be required to be registered under the regulator. I hope that that
clarifies the point. In a fluid situation in which we are moving away
from the regulatory regime where housing associations provided social
houses to a market for profit developers to provide market housing and
greater fluidity, the regime that we propose will provide stability. I
do not think that I have convinced my right hon. Friend so I will give
way
again.</div><a name="080129152000086"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129152000522"></a>Mr.
Raynsford:</b> I understand that if a private provider
receives a capital grant&#151;a social housing grant, as it is now
designated&#151;for the provision of social housing, they will be
required to register, which is absolutely right. What I do not see is
what will happen if the private provider provides an element of social
rented housing as part of a development that does not receive any
capital grant in the form of a social housing grant, and where the
subsidy comes either as a requirement of the local authority under
section 106 or as a cross-subsidy from housing for outright sale. In
those circumstances, housing for rent would, as I understand it, be
occupied by people who were, to all intents and purposes, social
housing tenants, but they would not get the same degree of protection,
because the landlord would not be required to register with the
regulator. I am unsure about that point, and I think that the right
hon. Member for North-West Hampshire is equally
concerned.</div>
<a name="080129152000087"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129152000523"></a>Mr.
Wright:</b> I reiterate the point that new profit making
providers can enter the market as a strategic organisational decision,
because they receive a grant from the HCA. Certainly, if they wish to
be the landlord, they must be eligible for registration. I would like
to go away and consider the important question whether section 106 can
be dealt with through planning policy and guidance. New profit making
providers are not yet required to register, because they would benefit
from section 106. However, the right hon. Gentleman has made an
important point and I will look at it and write to the
Committee.</div>
<a name="080129152000088"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129152000524"></a>Sir
George Young:</b> This brief debate has raised an important
issue. There will be two types of social housing tenants: those who
come under the umbrella because of section 106 or because their
landlords have registered, and those whose landlords have chosen not to
register using the discretion mentioned on Thursday 24 January,
<i class="I">Official Report,</i> column 571, and who are 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column585" />Column number: 585</div>in receipt of no public funds, either directly through capital grant or
through section 106. It is clear that there will not be a single domain
regulator for social housing tenants, which is perfectly acceptable,
because there are perverse consequences to obliging everyone to
register. However, it should be understood that one of the objectives
of the Cave review will not have been
achieved.</div><a name="080129152000089"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129152000527"></a>Mr.
Raynsford:</b> We now come to the extremely important issue of
the registration of profit-making organisations as opposed to
non-profit-making organisations. Clause 111, as currently drafted,
enables the register to designate a body as either a non-profit
organisation or a profit-making organisation. There is no problem with
that approach, which I entirely welcome. It is absolutely right that
profit-making organisations can contribute towards housing needs, and
if so, in my view, they should be registered, which was, of course, the
subject of the debate on the previous clause.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column586" />Column number: 586</div><a name="080129152000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is important for the public
to be aware of which category specific providers are in. That is
provided for at the start of the registration process, because
organisations have to designate themselves as either profit-making
organisations or non-profit-making organisations. However, what will
happen when an organisation changes its status? That issue is not
purely theoretical, because subsection (9) clearly provides for a
change in status. It
states:</div><a name="080129152000458"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;If
the regulator thinks that what was a profit-making organisation has
become a non-profit organisation, the regulator must change the
registered designation
accordingly.&#148;</div><a name="080129152000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is
explicit provision for circumstances in which a profit-making body
changes to a not-for-profit body, but the Bill does not include a
provision to cover circumstances in which an organisation changes, or
seeks to change, its status in the opposite direction, from
not-for-profit into
profit-making.</div><a name="080129152000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">When

December, <i class="I">Official Report</i>, column 40, the chief executive of the
National Housing Federation pointed out that, because of the rules
governing industrial and provident societies, it would be difficult for
organisations to transfer from not-for-profit status to profit-making
status. However, the possibility still exists, even if it is not easy,
and Mr. Orr made it clear in his evidence that he thought
that it would be a good thing if there were greater clarity. I agree,
which is one of the reasons for this
amendment.</div><a name="080129152000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">The other
reason why I tabled the amendment is the speculation that we are
increasingly hearing about the possibility of housing associations
converting into profit-making organisations. This is mainly a subject
of the rumour mill, as David Orr said in his evidence to us in that
session, but nevertheless, there are other straws in the wind
suggesting that that might come about.</div>
<a name="080129152000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">I recently read the annual
report of one of the country&#146;s largest housing associations,
which opens with a clear description of how the organisation would like
to be seen by the outside
world:</div><a name="080129152000459"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We are
a property development and management
company.&#148;</div><a name="080129152000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is no reference whatever to registered social landlords or to
not-for-profit; it is a property development and management company.
Another of its publications is its &#147;Corporate Social
Responsibility Report 2007&#148;, which is admirable. It includes
lots of references to doing things in the wider social interest, but it
is written exactly as a company would produce its corporate social
responsibility report and does not refer at any stage to its different
status as a registered social landlord.</div>
<a name="080129152000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">Straws in the wind suggest
that some organisations would welcome the opportunity
to transfer to a profit-making status, or at least to have a corporate
structure that would allow them to do so. In those circumstances, it is
in my view essential that there is absolute clarity about the status of
organisations and the procedure to be followed, if there is to be any
change in status. The situation must be transparent, because it would
be quite wrong for there to be scope for an organisation to change its
status and for the process to involve no explicit recognition that that
change of status has taken place. That is the purpose of the
amendment.</div>
<a name="080129152000103"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="080129152000528"></a><b class="B">Lembit
&#214;pik</b> (Montgomeryshire) (LD): My
understanding is that the right hon. Gentleman believes that there is
no restriction on an organisation that starts 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column587" />Column number: 587</div>off as a non-profit organisation becoming a profit-making organisation
yet retaining the beneficial status that it began with as a
non-profit-making organisation. Am I right in my understanding of what
he thinks the legislation would
allow?</div><a name="080129152000104"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129152000529"></a>Mr.
Raynsford:</b> Clearly, a great deal would depend on the
formal status of the organisation. Most registered social landlords are
either industrial and provident societies or companies limited by
guarantee rather than companies that distribute shares, so there would
have to be a change of company status. We are dealing with a much more
complex world, where some large housing associations have stocks of
50,000 or 60,000 properties and have clear distinctions between
different divisions. Some of those are doing outright work for sale,
some are doing shared ownership and low-cost home ownership and others
are focusing purely on social housing. It is not difficult to foresee
the creation of a structure in which some parts of an organisation are
clearly profit-making. There is definitely a restriction in the case of
charities, as charity law would preclude that, but not all housing
associations are charities, so one of the issues would be the status of
the organisation. David Orr, in his evidence to the Committee, said
that it is not easy for an industrial and provident society to change,
which I recognise, but he acknowledged the element of doubt, which is
why he agreed on the need for clarification.</div>
<a name="080129152000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment would require
the regulator, in the event that the regulator believes that an
organisation is either contemplating changing its status or has
actually done so, to require the organisation to deregister and to
apply again to re-register as a profit-making body. That would achieve
clarity and certainty, and it would ensure that all interested
parties&#151;tenants, partners and the local authorities in whose
area the association operates&#151;were aware of the change. Those
parties would have an opportunity to comment, and the regulator would
obviously take account of those comments before deciding whether to
re-register the body. That would provide a proper safeguard, which is
the purpose of the amendment.</div>
<a name="080129152000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">Since the amendment was
tabled, the Minister has introduced a group of amendments that seek to
address the issue, albeit in a different way, and that in some ways go
further than my amendment. Amendments Nos. 196, 219, 257 and 258 would
prevent a registered body from deregistering or disposing of its
assets, if the regulator believes that the purpose is to allow it to
distribute profits, which is an important safeguard. Similarly,
amendments Nos. 257 and 258 would prevent the regulator from agreeing
to a change of rules, either for an industrial and provident society or
a company, if it believes that that would make the organisation a
profit-making company.</div>
<a name="080129152000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I have said, the Government
amendments go further than mine in some respects, and I welcome the
Government&#146;s recognition that there was a lacuna in the Bill.
However, the Government amendments do not appear to allow an
organisation registered with the regulator to change from
not-for-profit to profit-making status, although the Bill allows the
move in the opposite direction, as I have described. If the Government
amendments will prevent any possibility of a move from profit-making to
non-profit-making 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column588" />Column number: 588</div>status, the safeguard is satisfactory, in which case I will willingly
seek the Committee&#146;s leave to withdraw my amendment.</div>
<a name="080129152000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not want to leave any
element of doubt around the subject. As I stressed on Second Reading,
any suggestion that housing associations may easily convert from their
current not-for-profit status into profit-making and
profit-distributing companies could have a profound and unhelpful
impact on the development of the pluralist framework of social housing
providers that the Bill supports and that has contributed enormously to
the improvement and condition of the social housing stock in recent
years.</div><a name="080129152000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Welwyn Hatfield has repeatedly criticised the Government
about the number of new social homes that are built, but he has been
silent about the huge improvement in the condition of the social
housing stock in the past 10 or 11 years. When the Government entered
office, there was a shameful and huge backlog&#151;&#163;19
billion-worth&#151;of substandard council housing, which was the
product of years of neglect and underfunding. Tackling that backlog
through the decent homes programme, the stock transfer programme and
the creation of ALMOs, thereby securing huge improvements in the living
conditions of millions of people and improving the quality of
properties available for letting, has been one of the
Government&#146;s proudest
achievements.</div><a name="080129152000110"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="080129152000530"></a><b class="B">Grant
Shapps</b> (Welwyn Hatfield) (Con): The right hon. Gentleman
has referred to something that I never spotted in our
debates&#151;the idea that we believe that less social housing should
be built. In fact, he knows that my point is that more social housing
was built under us than in every single year under this Government. The
argument is not about the quality of social housing, although if he
wants to debate that subject I can produce figures showing a 15 per
cent. improvement through the decent homes standards, when the amount
of money spent suggests a far better outcome was possible. Will the
right hon. Gentleman accept that the problem with the approach of
target-driven decent homes standards, is that in some cases the wrong
standards have ended up being the outcome?</div>
<a name="080129152000111"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129152000531"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. That was a terribly
good speech. The hon. Gentleman and the right hon. Gentleman may think
that I have not noticed that we are drifting away from the substance of
the amendment; I have noticed.</div>
<a name="080129152000112"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129152000532"></a>Mr.
Raynsford:</b> I shall not rise to the bait. I was making the
point that in his repeated comments about the number of social housing
units produced, the hon. Member for Welwyn Hatfield has fallen into
same trap as many politicians in the 1960s, &#146;70s and &#146;80s
of forgetting the issue of quality. Poor quality social housing has
been a real problem, and it has been addressed by RSLs, ALMOs and the
decent homes programme. The relevance to the amendment is that that
pluralist framework is threatened by the campaigning of those who say
that any change in the status of council housing, from council housing
to an ALMO or an RSL, is essentially privatisation, which generates
fear and anxiety on the part of tenants. There 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column589" />Column number: 589</div>must be clarity, and there should be no allowance for that kind of
propaganda, which can have a damaging effect on the programme for
improving the quality of the housing stock.</div>
<a name="080129152000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is why I have moved the
amendment. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will give me the
assurance that I seek, in which case I shall be happy to withdraw
it.</div>
<a name="080129152000114"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129152000533"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. As this is a matter of written record and
written records do not convey inflection, when I said that it was a
very good speech, I should make it plain that I was commenting on the
longevity, not the content.</div>
<a name="080129152000115"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129152000534"></a>Mr.
Wright:</b> My right hon. Friend raised the issue on Second
Reading, when he highlighted the importance of not opening the door to
existing RSLs converting from not-for-profit to for-profit status. He
asked us to re-examine the matter, which, as he is aware, I have
done.</div> <a name="080129152000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">My right hon.
Friend has graciously said that I have gone further than his amendment.
Currently, only non-profit bodies can become RSLs, and they are largely
limited in their ability to pay dividends. They cannot distribute
profits and, importantly, they cannot ensure that valuable assets and
lucrative revenue streams are not diverted away from the social
objectives of the organisation. This morning, we have already discussed
how we want to see a plurality of different providers to ensure that we
have a well-maintained and greater number of social
houses.</div><a name="080129152000488"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11
am</div><a name="080129152000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was very
struck by what David Orr, chief executive of the National Housing
Federation, said during his oral evidence session. He said that
the</div> <a name="080129152000460"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Bill as written
makes it clear that private sector providers of social housing will be
regulated only in respect of social housing. That is
proper.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;[Official Report, Housing and
Regeneration Public Bill Committee, </i>11 December 2007; c.
33.]</div><a name="080129152000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">I absolutely agree with
that, but I would go further and suggest that the position of the
existing regulator for social stock is very different. As I said, such
stock is almost wholly owned by registered social landlords, and grant
has been provided in the full knowledge that they are bodies primarily
concerned with housing, and that surpluses will be re-invested for the
purposes of more social housing. That has been a very clear
understanding when grant has been applied for, and we need to ensure
and establish arrangements that protect and maintain that historical
understanding.</div><a name="080129152000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me
make it plain that I do not want non-profit providers to be able to
distribute surpluses from past investments. I want to see the
charitable or social character of RSLs&#151;now called in the Bill
non-profit providers&#151;maintained. I would suggest that the
amendments that I have tabled today bring that about and ensure strict
separation from profit-distributing organisations. I recognise the very
great temptations that some RSLs will have to convert to
profit-distributing organisations. However, that seems to me, in policy
and moral terms, to be wholly wrong. I have 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column590" />Column number: 590</div>nothing against partnership working with regards to for-profits, and I
have mentioned time and time again, not least this morning, that I am
keen to see a greater degree of for-profits involvement in the
provision and delivery of social housing. However, that new and
exciting era must be based on rigorous grant conditions and rigorous
regulation, rather than it being incumbent on RSLs trying to exploit
changes in legislation for their own personal gain. I think that
members of RSLs and their staff clearly have no right to expect to be
able to benefit in this way from asset or product distribution, and I
have introduced these amendments to prevent that from happening in
future.</div> <a name="080129152000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me put
it on the record that I agree with the sentiments expressed by my right
hon. Friend in amendment No. 61. I think that they try to achieve
exactly the same objectives that I am trying to achieve. However, with
the greatest of respect&#151;I am tentatively trying to chide my
right hon. Friend here&#151;I do not think that they go as far as I
do, and I do not think that they have the intended effect. Let me point
out to the Committee the phrase in amendment no.
61:</div><a name="080129152000461"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;If the
regulator thinks that
what&#151;</div><a name="080129152000462"></a><div class="hs_brev">(a) is a
non-profit organisation is considering becoming an profit-making
organisation, or</div><a name="080129152000463"></a><div class="hs_brev">(b) was a
non-profit organisation has become a profit-making
organisation,&#148;&#151;</div><a name="080129152000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">this
is the key
point&#151;</div><a name="080129152000464"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;it
shall remove the body from the register and direct it to reapply for
registration&#148;.</div><a name="080129152000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think
that that could bring about loopholes in the system, and I do not want
to take the risk, even if it is a temporary risk, of where a body is
deregistered, we thereby lose the powers to regulate it before it comes
back to be re-registered. In that respect, I understand my right hon.
Friend&#146;s intentions, but I ask him to withdraw his
amendment.</div><a name="080129152000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments tabled in my name are aimed at reducing the pressure that
the regulator might otherwise come under from non-profit registered
providers to allow them to turn into profit-making, profit-distributing
bodies, by removing the discretion that the regulator would otherwise
have to permit such
changes.</div><a name="080129152000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
Nos. 196, 219, 257 and 258 amend clauses 115, 162, 188 and 190
respectively. They thus amend the key powers that ensure that social
housing is managed in line with a social and charitable objective by
registered providers that are charities, industrial and provident
societies, and other companies, and continue to meet these objects,
especially housing objects. In particular, it should not be possible
for non-profit providers to distribute assets, especially those that
have been funded by contributions from the taxpayer through
grants.</div> <a name="080129152000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under clause
115, the regulator has discretion to allow a registered
provider&#146;s request to deregister. I would suggest that the first
subsection in amendment No. 196 prohibits the regulator from agreeing
to deregister a non-profit registered provider if he thinks that
distribution of the assets is the reason why deregistration is being
sought.</div> <a name="080129152000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second
subsection of amendment No. 196 would apply whenever the regulator was
considering whether to grant a request to deregister by a registered 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column591" />Column number: 591</div>provider. It requires that any conditions that the regulator has placed
on disposals of land, for example, relating to the use of disposal
proceeds, and any conditions of grant made by any grant funder, such as
the Homes and Communities Agency, should be taken into account before
deciding whether the organisation can be outside the scope of
regulation.</div><a name="080129152000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">If a
registered provider has not used disposal proceeds as required by the
regulator or failed to repay grant as required, the regulator might be
more reluctant to permit it to deregister and escape further regulatory
intervention. In that respect, I hope that I have gone further than my
right hon. Friend
suggested.</div><a name="080129152000128"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129152000535"></a>Mr.
Raynsford:</b> As the Minister has said, and as I conceded in
my opening speech, his amendments would go further than my amendment in
a number of respects. However, I seek clarification in one area of
uncertainty. Is it possible, even with the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
amendments, particularly the latter two in respect of the rules and
status of industrial and provident societies and companies, to convert
from being a profit-making body to a non-profit-making body? As
drafted, the Bill clearly allows the
opposite.</div><a name="080129152000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection
(9) provides explicitly for circumstances in which a profit-making body
becomes a non-profit-making body. Even with the amendments, would it
still be possible for a non-profit-making organisation to change status
and become a profit-making organisation? Would it be able to get
through all the hoops that my hon. Friend has set? Moreover, could the
organisation do so if it argues that the purpose of that change is not
to distribute profit but enable it as a private company to raise money
more effectively on the open market than it could as a non-profit
body?</div>
<a name="080129152000130"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129152000536"></a>Mr.
Wright:</b> I am aware that the Committee wants to make
progress and I am tempted to give my right hon. Friend the Member for
Greenwich and Woolwich the short answer. However, at the risk of
incurring wrath, I shall give the long
answer.</div><a name="080129152000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">I come to
amendments Nos. 219, 257 and 258. The short answer is yes. I am certain
that the amendment would close the loopholes. Amendment No. 219 has the
same purpose as amendment No. 196, but could be used to prevent a
disposal of assets. It would have the effect that disposal consent may
not be given to a non-profit registered provider if the regulator
believes that consent is being sought to enable disposal of assets to
members.</div><a name="080129152000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clauses 188
and 190 require the regulator&#146;s consent for changes to the
constitutions of non-profit providers that are either industrial and
provident societies or companies. Amendments Nos. 257 and 258 prohibit
the regulator from agreeing to any such changes that would turn a
non-profit provider into a profit-making body that could thus
distribute significant dividends and/or profit. Clauses 188 and 190
render such rule changes or changes of articles without the
regulator&#146;s consent ineffective. I can confirm that the
amendments would prevent non-profit organisations becoming for-profit
organisations. However, going the other way, I am happy for for-profit
organisations to become not-for-profit organisations if that is the
strategic objective of a particular
organisation.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column592" />Column number: 592</div><a name="080129152000133"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="080129152000537"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Andrew Love</b> (Edmonton) (Lab/Co-op): I thank my hon. Friend
the Minister for his explanation. He dealt with the constitutional
arrangements and the discussions between the regulator and the
particular RSL that wants to convert to profit. However, as my right
hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich and Woolwich said, tenants have
expressed considerable concern about transfer. Hon. Members have tried
to reassure tenants that, when they transferred to an RSL, they were
not transferring to the private sector. If my hon. Friend the Minister
allows such proposals to go ahead, we would, in effect, be breaking the
promise that was made to the tenants that they would not end up in the
private sector. Can he give those tenants some
reassurance?</div><a name="080129152000134"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129152000538"></a>Mr.
Wright:</b> I hope that I can. As I said, I do not want RSLs
to convert to profit-distributing organisations, whereby people can
have good share options. I find that absolutely abhorrent in the social
housing sector. People could get flash cars as part of the share
options, and so on. We must be careful and make sure that RSLs, or
not-for-profit providers under the Bill, have a clear status. They are
not public sector bodies for the purposes of public sector
classification. They will be able to provide and draw on loans and
borrowings from the private market to improve and facilitate the
building of social housing. That is clear and it is important that we
get that message across. I would like hon. Members on both sides of the
House to ensure that it is clear to tenants, who may be worried about
terminology such as profit and for-profit, that we are ruling out
categorically the idea that chief executives and chairs of such
organisations can have stock options. That is abhorrent, we do not want
to see it and I hope that the hon. Gentleman will take that message
from the
Committee.</div><a name="080129152000135"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129152000539"></a>Mr.

converting from their current not-for-profit status to
profit-distributing companies, and I note his assurance that with his
amendments there would be no scope for RSLs to convert to profit-making
and profit-distributing status. With that reassurance and the
reassurance that he has given my hon. Friend the Member for Edmonton

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129152000540"></a>Sir
George Young:</b> This clause gives the regulator power to
levy fees. Before I go any further, it would be helpful if the Minister
would indicate whether this is modelled on any existing legislation. My
understanding is that the Housing Corporation does not require housing
associations to register, so the costs involved in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column593" />Column number: 593</div>clause 113 are not costs that housing associations currently have to
bear. If one was unkind, one could call this a stealth tax because
housing associations are not-for-profit social businesses, as we have
just heard; they re-invest their surpluses into the community and their
rents will be controlled by the Government and the regulator. That
means that rents paid by tenants would either have to increase in order
to pay the fees that are proposed under clause 113, or existing income
would be moved away from service provision to pay for regulation, or
associations might build fewer homes. The estimated cost of &#163;20
million amounts to a charge of about 20p per week per property, which,
I am advised, could be used to build 7,000 homes a
year.</div><a name="080129152000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">I looked
through the comprehensive impact assessment for the Housing and
Regeneration Bill to see whether I could find where the impact of the
clause was dealt with. I now know what the Minister was doing on 9
November. On 9 November he was reading every page&#151;there are 248
of them&#151;of the impact assessment and then
signing:</div><a name="080129152000465"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I
have read the Impact Assessment and I am satisfied that (a) it
represents a fair and reasonable view of the expected costs, benefits
and impact of the policy, and (b) the benefits justify the
costs.&#148;</div><a name="080129152000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">Confident that
the Minister is more than familiar with the document, I wonder whether
he will indicate where the impact of clause 113 appears. I looked on
page 104, which has the impact assessment for implementation of the
Cave review of social housing regulation, and a wide variety of impacts
are assessed, including competition, small firms, legal aid,
sustainable development, carbon assessment, other environment, health
impact, race equality, disability equality, gender equality, human
rights and rural proofing, but nowhere could I find where it said what
the impact would be on tenants. I may have overlooked it; it may be on
a page that has escaped my attention. I see that the Minister is doing
just what I have been doing over the last 20 minutes, which is trying
to find it. Will the Minister say whether this is a new power, how the
housing associations will pay for it and how it meets the obligations
of the regulator? I see that, on page 122, those obligations include

the burden of
regulation&#148;.</div><a name="080129152000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">This seems
to be a new burden on housing associations. Will he say where, in the

of clause 133 appears?</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129152000541"></a>Lembit
&#214;pik:</b> I have one slightly different concern. Once
fees are introduced, that introduces the prospect of a body being
regarded as a profit centre rather than an administrative organisation.
There is precedent for that. The Civil Aviation Authority is required
by the Exchequer to make a return on its activities. Given that the
Civil Aviation Authority is primarily there as a safety regulator, it
has often struck the general aviation community as unreasonable that
the CAA returns what amounts to a profit to the Exchequer for its
safety work. What assurance is there that the Government or the
Exchequer will not be tempted to require some kind 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column594" />Column number: 594</div>of return from this organisation, thereby making its entirely valid and
justified regulatory activities into an unjustified profit
centre?</div><a name="080129152000144"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129152000542"></a>Mr.
Wright:</b> I confirm to the right hon. Member for North-West
Hampshire that this is modelled on modern regulatory regimes. It is
fair that the costs of regulation should be borne by those who are
regulated. That happens in the utilities sector and we propose a change
in the current regulatory regime so that it also happens in the social
housing sector.</div>
<a name="080129152000145"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129152000543"></a>Sir
George Young:</b> The Minister has mentioned that it is
modelled on what happens at the moment. Do housing associations pay a
fee like that to the Housing Corporation?</div>
<a name="080129152000146"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129152000544"></a>Mr.
Wright:</b> No they do not. We are moving away from the
current situation to take into account the wider regulatory principles
that are, as I said, that the costs of regulation are borne by those
who are regulated. That is consistent with the Cave review. Martin Cave
proposed that the regulator should raise money to cover its running
costs from regulated bodies, and I will return to the point made by the
hon. Member for Montgomeryshire with regard to that matter.</div>
<a name="080129152000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am anticipating a debate on
this issue during this sitting, and I suggest that the approach will
make the new regulator more independent from Government, as it will be
responsible for its own funding. It will help put pressure to make
costs move downwards and be more efficient. Those who are being
regulated will want to ensure that it is providing real value for
money. The right hon. Gentleman has said that at the moment, regulation
costs about &#163;20 million per year. That is the regulatory part of
the Housing Corporation and it amounts to about &#163;10 per social
home per year. That is good value for money, and the new regulator will
probably drive down costs even further.</div>
<a name="080129152000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">I draw the attention of the
right hon. Gentleman to clause 113, in particular subsection (7) where
it says that the regulator must prepare and publish the principles
under which fees must be set and consult on them. It says:</div>
<a name="080129152000467"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In preparing (or
revising) the principles the regulator shall
consult&#151;</div><a name="080129152000468"></a><div class="hs_brev">(a)
the Secretary of State,
and</div><a name="080129152000469"></a><div class="hs_brev">(b) persons
appearing to the regulator to represent the regulator to represent the
interests of fee-payers.&#148;</div>
<a name="080129152000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">That point is important and addresses
the issue raised by the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire. This is not
meant to be some sort of profit centre. The Treasury will not expect a
rate of return from the regulator. It is meant to cover costs of
regulation as opposed to the regulator&#146;s other activities.
Clause 113(6)
says:</div><a name="080129152000470"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
principles may provide for specified expenditure or potential
expenditure under section 94 or otherwise to be disregarded for the
purpose of subsection
(5)(a).&#148;</div><a name="080129152000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is not
supposed to provide revenue for the Treasury; it is to cover the costs
of the regulator.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129152000545"></a>Lembit
&#214;pik:</b> For the avoidance of doubt, can the Minister
confirm that there is no intention, and that it will never be an
intention of his Administration to seek to secure return for the
Treasury from the activities of the
regulator?</div><a name="080129152000155"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129152000546"></a>Mr.
Wright:</b> It is difficult to say never Mr. Gale.
Should a circumstance arise whereby the Treasury wanted to make some
sort of return&#151;I draw on my earlier point about the
regulator&#151;given that we are trying to minimise unnecessary
regulation and bureaucracy, and make sure that costs are driven down so
that more resources are available for the provision of higher standards
in social housing, I imagine that a huge hue and cry would be made. I
cannot anticipate circumstances in which the Treasury will want a rate
of return because the whole point is that the regulator will be
covering costs.</div>
<a name="080129152000156"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129152000547"></a>Lembit
&#214;pik:</b> I will not pursue the matter further, but
that is exactly what I was afraid of. The CAA has to deliver a return
to the Treasury. I am concerned that the regulator will also have to do
so. I accept that the Minister does not want to cause himself trouble
with the Treasury, so it seems best if I pursue the matter through a
series of parliamentary questions to the
Treasury.</div><a name="080129152000157"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129152000548"></a>Mr.
Wright:</b> I reiterate what I said earlier. It is not our
intention that the provision will be a revenue-raising exercise. It is
meant to cover costs. I am disappointed that I cannot reassure the hon.
Gentleman further, but the principle is clearly such that the regulator
receives its income from those that it is regulating and, at the
moment, there are absolutely no plans to make sure that there is a rate
of return in that
regard.</div><a name="080129152000158"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129152000549"></a>Sir
George Young:</b> I asked the Minister a specific question
that he has not as yet answered. Whereabouts in the impact assessment
does the impact of the measure feature, given that it is of importance
to
tenants?</div><a name="080129152000159"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129152000550"></a>Mr.
Wright:</b> I draw the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s attention
to page 117 of the impact assessment, where reference is made to the
costs to regulated bodies in terms of the Housing Corporation currently

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129152000553"></a>Mr.
Wright:</b> The amendments clarify the general processes of
compulsory deregistration under the clause or requests for voluntary
deregistration under clause 115. Provision for deregistration under the
clause is based on that in sections 4 and 5 of the Housing Act 1996,
which allows the Housing Corporation to deregister RSLs. Amendment No.
191 requires the regulator to inform a body that it has been
compulsorily deregistered. It should be remembered that compulsory
deregistration is at the regulator&#146;s discretion. It may take
place only if the provider has effectively ceased operation as a social
landlord, having either ceased to carry out activities or ceased to be
eligible for registration&#151;if it no longer provides or intends to
provide social housing in England, for example. If the provider does
not already know that, it would be informed by the regulator as a
result of amendment No. 191 that it no longer has to comply with
regulation.</div><a name="080129152000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">When a
provider seeks deregistration, amendments Nos. 192, 193 and 197 replace
paragraph (c) of subsection (2). Rather than the regulator being able
to deregister a body simply on some other grounds that seem to the
regulator to make deregistration appropriate, the regulator will be
able to permit deregistration if the provider meets relevant criteria
set by the regulator. That has the effect that the regulator must
establish a policy in advance of considering cases rather than
responding to each on an ad hoc basis. Amendment No. 197 requires the
regulator to publish such
criteria.</div><a name="080129152000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
addition, amendments Nos. 194 and 195 introduce a degree of discretion
about consultation with local authorities on requests for
deregistration. It would not generally be necessary for the regulator
to consult each local authority in whose area the registered provider
acts. The amendments mean that the regulator need not consult all local
authorities in whose area the registered provider acts, only those that
it considers appropriate. For example&#151;and this is
important&#151;if a registered provider owns only two or three homes
in each of several districts, and the vast majority of its stock is
elsewhere, the regulator may decide that it would be appropriate to
consult only those local authorities where the provider has a more
significant presence.</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column597" />Column number: 597</div><a name="080129152000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment Nos. 106 and 107
would remove the regulator&#146;s discretion to deregister a body on
the grounds that it is regulated by another authority whose control is
likely to be sufficient.</div>
<a name="080129152000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under the current regime, only
a few, very small RSLs have deregistered, such as some alms houses. I
would suggest that regulation can be a major burden on bodies that
operate on a very small scale, and we are committed, as I have said
time and time again, to reducing regulation for good providers.
Deregistered bodies remain subject to restrictions on disposals, and
tenants must have access to the local housing ombudsman. These are the
basic tenants&#146; protections, but the regulator is perhaps more
likely to retain such bodies as providers and to set a very low level
of regulation for them because of the greater emphasis on a light
touch, and on risk assessment in terms of regulation.</div>
<a name="080129152000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">In short, the circumstances
are limited, and likely to be used only rarely. It is implicit that the
effect of deregistration on this test would be very largely
deregulatory, and that there should be no loss of tenants or stock
protection. If there were, that would be unlikely to meet the
regulator&#146;s fundamental objectives. On that basis, I hope that
the Committee will accept the Government&#146;s amendments and not
insist on amendments Nos. 106 and
107.</div><a name="080129152000175"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129152000554"></a>Lembit
&#214;pik:</b> Our amendments are designed to test the
working of the Government&#146;s approach to the matter. I have two
questions to raise. I accept that I am busking a little, but I was not
paying particular attention to my own thoughts. My two macro-questions
relate to two matters. First, the perennial concern of the housing
associations is one of potential over-regulation. Secondly, the
relationship between profit and non-profit making organisations is a
recurring theme. To some extent, we have covered some of that already,
so I shall reduce my questions to one point. Can the Minister provide
some assurance&#151;given that we have referred to the regulatory
impact assessment before&#151;that the burdens that have been put on
organisations that are necessarily very small-budget and do not have
huge administrative resources, have been considered in the
round?</div><a name="080129152000176"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129152000555"></a>Mr.
Wright:</b> I hope that I made it clear, when I moved my own
amendments, that we are very keen to ensure that the new regulatory
regime has a light touch: it is focused on areas of major concern.
Those small RSLs would be, I imagine, not classed as high-risk, and the
level and burden of regulation would be shared accordingly. On that
basis, I understand what the hon. Gentleman is saying, but I hope that
he will not press his
amendment.</div><a name="080129152000177"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129152000556"></a>Lembit
&#214;pik:</b> It is not clear exactly who decides what is
high-risk and what is not. If one looks at how these are phrased, my
madness scenario is something that we see time and time again. When
something goes wrong out there and there is a scandal or financial
irregularity that occupies the Sunday papers, and a few weeks&#146;
worth of headlines, the Government feel an obligation to react. I could
see a dramatic response, on a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column598" />Column number: 598</div>wholesale basis. If the problem relates to housing, the response would
be, &#147;We, the Government, have now decided to tighten this
up&#148;, or &#147;We have issued an edict to the regulator that
all of these individual organisations have to provide a certain
additional body of evidence.&#148; That is expensive, time-consuming
and probably not very cost-effective. My personal judgment is that we
ended up with gun regulation legislation in this country as a knee-jerk
reaction to what happened in Dunblane. No one is likely to get killed
in the housing environment, but one can perceive the same kind of very
high-profile issue resulting in the over-importance of regulation. The
Minister needs to give me an assurance that there is not, in his
judgment, a risk of a knee-jerk reaction in the same way. That is what
I meant to say earlier
on.</div><a name="080129152000490"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.30

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129152000557"></a>Mr.
Wright:</b> I disagree with the circumstances that the hon.
Gentleman outlined because I do not think that a scandal, to use his
words, emerges or flares up without any warning. One of the true
strengths of the regulatory regime that the Bill will put in place is
that the risk factors, the traffic lights&#151;for want of a better
term&#151;will be used appropriately and we will not have any heavy
enforcement of regulation; it will be based on risk, loss to the public
purse and risk to reputation. On that basis, I do not accept the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s premise. The regulator will have a light touch and
will intervene where necessary, but these things do not flare up
immediately. In terms of what the regulator will have to do with regard
to objectives in clause 86, which we have already discussed, there must
be a balance and we have got it about right. I cannot anticipate what
the hon. Gentleman is suggesting, so I hope that he will not press his
amendment.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129152000560"></a>Lembit
&#214;pik:</b> That was not very nice of the Minister, but I
am sure that he said it with the warmth I normally associate with his
rapier-like wit.</div> <a name="080129152000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
purpose of the amendment is to probe the potential cost of a body
appealing through the High Court against the decision of the regulator,
when it has decided to refuse to register that body, to de-register it
or to refuse to de-register it. In other words, are we entering a
situation of overkill by requiring the High Court to be the arbiter of
an appeal? That will be fine for large organisations with a
multi-million pound turnover and organisations with their own legal
advice, but many of the organisations we are discussing are collections
of individuals with an altruistic intent to resolve local housing
problems. It would be colossal expenditure for them to appeal to the
High Court against the decision of the regulator, a regulator that
necessarily will have extensive resources at its command and will
effortlessly be able to mount a defence of the decision that is taken.
For smaller organisations, which amount to no more than a couple of
individuals on occasion, the decision of the regulator is likely to
stand because the organisation will be unable to afford to mount a
defence through the High Court.</div>
<a name="080129152000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have not proposed an
alternative appeal process. There are of course a number of different
ways of doing it, but I suggest that either the Government make it
clear that those organisations will in some way be financially
supported in making their appeal, or that we should seek a less
expensive way of doing it. We all want an appeal process and we want to
it to be fair. In my judgment, using the High Court is de facto unfair
for small organisations because they cannot afford to launch a
defence.</div> <a name="080129152000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
let us think about a situation in which a body appeals against the
regulator, spends many thousands of pounds in that appeal and loses.
That would involve tremendous opportunity costs in terms of the money
spent on the appeal, so it is very likely that those who make the
financial decisions within such organisations will be loth to take the
risk. They will say, &#147;We don&#146;t like this decision, but it
is cheaper and less risky to go with it than to find alternative ways
of doing what we want to do, even if that restricts our room for
operation.&#148; In conclusion, will the Minister  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column600" />Column number: 600</div>tell us why he feels that an appeal to the High Court is a proportionate
system and one that is affordable to the many small organisations under
consideration?</div><a name="080129152000195"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129152000561"></a>Mr.
Wright:</b><b class="B"> </b>I disagree with the amendment on two
grounds. From the hon. Gentleman&#146;s comments,
it sounds as if this is a new power, but it is not. Section 6 of the
Housing Act 1996 provides for an appeal to the High Court against the
Housing Corporation&#146;s decision on registration and
deregistration. Clause 117 similarly provides a right of appeal. A body
may be unhappy with the regulator&#146;s decision not to register it.
On that basis, therefore, it is right and proper that we have an
appeals process. As the hon. Gentleman said, he is not proposing an
alternative body to which such an appeal should be made, so I was not
entirely certain what he was trying to achieve with the amendment,
other than a general cutting down of costs.</div>
<a name="080129152000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">The appeals procedure is very
important for the deregistered provider. On that basis, I cannot accept
an amendment that would leave providers&#146; right of appeal so
unclear. However, I feel sorry for the hon. Gentleman and somewhat
guilty that I criticised his membership of the Liberal Democrats so I
want to make amends. If the hon. Gentleman&#151;I am trying to tempt
him&#151;wanted to suggest that the appeal process should be linked
to some sort of tribunal, as suggested in the Cave review, that is
something that I could take away and discuss with the Tribunals
Service, the Ministry of Justice and others. I hope, therefore, that
the hon. Gentleman will withdraw his amendment and allow me to make
progress in the manner I suggest.</div>

&#214;pik:</b> We see once again, writ large before us, a
Minister who is the exemplary form of an iron fist in a velvet glove.
His fundamental disagreement sounds more like a practical objection. He
rightly assumes that I envisage some kind of tribunal process. No doubt
he is also aware from where my probing amendment is derived.</div>
<a name="080129152000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am grateful for the

I honestly think is a much better approach whether or not there is a
precedent in past legislation. Had he and I been doing business in 1996
in this same Committee, I would have made the same point, so given his
assurance, I do not feel any need to move the amendment to a vote. More
than anything, if we can achieve a constructive outcome from the
discussions about the tribunal, that would be appreciated not just by
me but by the handling organisations whose concerns I have put forward.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129152000564"></a>Grant
Shapps:</b> This morning, the right hon. Member for Greenwich
and Woolwich referred to the extent to which housing associations have
the capacity almost to morph into a different type of organisation. He
may have been reading from the annual report for &#147;Places for
People&#148; when he said that the particular housing association did
not refer to itself as a social provider, but as a developer or
builder, possibly from a large corporate background with all the
associated culture.</div>
<a name="080129152000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause 4 would recognise
that housing associations are in a special category of their own and
that when the Bill considers payments for members, it should take into
account the aims and objectives of the housing associations. In
particular, it should consider setting up a code of conduct that the
Secretary of State would invoke, under the new clause, by getting
together with the relevant parties, in particular bodies such as the
Charity Commission. Through consultation with the social regulator, it
would come up with a code of conduct to ensure that the
slippage&#151;the movement to which the right hon. Member for
Greenwich and Woolwich referred&#151;does not become a tidal
wave.</div> <a name="080129152000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is possible
to envisage a situation where there would be a shift towards corporate
housing associations&#151;we are already seeing housing associations
gain upwards of 100,000 properties and become super-development
companies. The Committee has rightly expressed concern that if that
process continues we may have a very different form of housing
association in years to come. The purpose of new clause 4 is to provide
some limits and an additional framework in those circumstances. I hope
that the Minister will carefully consider the Secretary of
State&#146;s ability through the legislation to consider payments and
benefits to officers, to try to prevent an avalanche of housing
associations turning into nothing more than corporate developers
operating as they do in the private sector.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129152000565"></a>Mr.
Wright:</b> I have a lot of sympathy with what the hon.
Gentleman is trying to do. I pay tribute to the manner in which he has
outlined his case. As he said, the new clause would provide for a code
of conduct covering payments and benefits to officers in place of
existing statute. The Government share his aim, which they agreed to
following the 2006 Elton review. However, I suggest that the same
outcome could be achieved in the Bill without the new clause, and
arguably in a less centralised
manner.</div><a name="080129152000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">With clause
118, we are repealing paragraphs 2 and 3 of schedule 1 of the Housing
Act 2006, for England. Clause 63 ensures that schedule 1 will apply
only to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column602" />Column number: 602</div>Wales. The Bill reintroduces some parts of the schedule; for example,
paragraph 1 comes in as clause 118, but paragraphs 2 and 3 do
not.</div>
<a name="080129152000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">The regulator may set
standards on payments and benefits in clause 174, following
consultation. It could choose not to do so if it trusts the sector to
get it right and wants to minimise burdens. The Secretary of State will
not be able to direct on those measures, and I anticipate a fierce
debate about the role of the Secretary of State with regard to
directions and standards when we debate clause 173. We do not think it
necessary or appropriate to give the Secretary of State a role in
relation to such standards, given the greater independence we envisage
for the new regulator. That is a fundamental point and we must protect
the regulator&#146;s independence as much as possible.</div>
<a name="080129152000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">The regulator will be
explicitly permitted by amendment No. 238 to clause 178 to set
standards referring to documents produced by others, such as a code of
conduct produced by the sector. If the regulator wanted the standards
to follow a code of conduct, it could set standards accordingly, but
that would be a matter for the regulator not the Secretary of
State.</div> <a name="080129152000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new
clause leaves an unfortunate gap in regulation in Wales, as it would
repeal paragraphs 2 and 3, which are concerned with Wales, without
providing for an alternative. I doubt that is what those tabling the
amendments, including the hon. Gentleman and the Welsh Assembly
Government would want. I have sympathy with the argument, but I hope
that the hon. Gentleman will recognise the central thrust of my
argument&#151;that we are trying to move away from centralised diktat
from the Secretary of State that is in nobody&#146;s interests with
regard to the new regulatory regime. On that basis, I hope that he will
not move new clause 4.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129152000571"></a>Sir

ombudsman, and we are all pleased to see that. What will happen,
however, when we reach our goal of having a single domain regulator,
and local authority housing comes under the regulator&#146;s remit?
Will complaints by local authority tenants continue to go to the local
government ombudsman, while complaints by housing association tenants
will go to the housing ombudsman, or does the Minister envisage some

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129152000575"></a>Lembit
&#214;pik:</b> We have discussed the possibility of treating
profit-based registered providers in the same way as non-profit
registered providers on several occasions. The amendments would simply
create a level playing field between the two in terms of accounts and
regulation. It is important that the regulator can address the accounts
of profit-making registered providers in the same way as those of
non-profit-making registered providers. I seek the Minister&#146;s
perspective on that view.</div>
<a name="080129152000234"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129152000576"></a>The

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129152000579"></a>Mr.

reading the clauses of the Bill. <i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Laughter.</i><i class="I">]</i> Can
we move swiftly
on?</div><a name="080129152000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 230
will amend clause 174, which will allow the regulator to set standards
for profit-based organisations. As we have said, we need to make it
clear that given the absence of shareholders, and with the real
economic interest in the activity of a business, the non-profit sector
should have regulation to fill the gap and make what is going on
transparent. That is essential, which is why we propose that the
regulator should be able to direct non-profit providers as to the
preparation of their accounts, just as the Housing Corporation does at
present under the Housing Act 1996.</div>
<a name="080129152000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given the assets with which
profit-making registered providers will be entrusted, we will consider
whether it is sensible to extend the regulator&#146;s powers in
relation to accounting directions to profit-making providers in the
interests of transparency, as proposed by amendments Nos. 77 and 78.
The hon. Member for Montgomeryshire has made a good case for amendments
Nos. 77 and 78.</div>
<a name="080129152000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having said that, amendments
Nos. 79 and 80 do not make much sense. The clauses that they seek to
amend apply to industrial and provident societies, which are referred
to under clause 125, and registered charities, which are referred to
under clause 126. By definition, such organisations cannot be
for-profit. Clause 111(2) explicitly provides
that</div><a name="080129152000476"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A body
is a non-profit organisation if it is a registered or non-registrable
charity.&#148;</div><a name="080129152000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">So even if
amendment No. 80 were accepted, it would have no practical effect,
because there would not be any registered providers that were
registered charities and profit making. As I have stated, I want to
consider the appropriate role for the regulator in relation to
accounting requirements for profit-making providers. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column605" />Column number: 605</div>On that basis, I hope that I have moved some way towards the hon.

swiftly back to the amendments, Government amendment No. 230, which

not realised that that is the case. It seems that the Government are
giving the regulator the powers that I am trying to provide under
clause 123 in a different way. When we get to clause 174, I hope that
the Minister will expand on how Government amendment No. 230 relates to

framework in the Bill differs from the current position, as defined by
the Housing Act 1996. Amendment No. 200 will remove the Secretary of
State&#146;s role in agreeing to accounting directions that apply to
more than one registered provider. That position is much more in
keeping with an independent regulator bound by statutory objectives. It
would be wrong for the Secretary of State to be involved in such
day-to-day regulation. That is a change from the position as defined in
schedule 1 to the 1996 Act and fundamentally further emphasises the new
regulator&#146;s greater independence from central Government. I am
keen to highlight that, and no doubt we will touch on it later

page 53, line 8, leave out &#145;social housing&#146;
and insert &#145;its housing
activities&#146;.</div><a name="080129152000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
were on a roll, which I have chosen to
stop.</div><a name="080129152000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 131
covers the powers of an auditor or reporting accountant undertaking
either a normal audit or producing an accountant&#146;s report under
clause 127 or an extraordinary audit under clause 130 in relation to a
registered provider that is a charity. The charity must grant the
auditor or reporting accountant access to its records, and its officers
must provide such information or explanations as the auditor or
reporting accountant think
necessary.</div><a name="080129152000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
triggers for what is termed a normal audit are when income or assets
from a charitable registered provider&#146;s housing activities, as
opposed to social housing activities alone, exceed certain thresholds.
The amendment enables the auditor to access information about all
housing activities. If the income or assets from the body&#146;s
social housing activities are below the specified thresholds, an
accountant&#146;s report is required under clause 127(3), although an
extraordinary audit can be ordered under clause
130.</div><a name="080129152000259"></a><div class="hs_Para">An
auditor&#146;s report must state whether the revenue account gives a
true and fair view of the charity&#146;s income and expenditure, so
far as they relate to its housing activities. Amendment No. 201 is
needed simply because the social housing activities of a charity may
not encompass all its housing activities; for example, student hostels,
which are explicitly excluded from the definition of social housing.
The effect of the amendment is to enable access to a sufficiently wide
range of information. Otherwise, only a partial picture would be given,
and a comprehensive audit or accountant&#146;s report would be
inhibited. The amendment aligns the access to information with matters
to be examined by the reporting accountant or auditor. It applies the
current position in schedule 1(18) to the Housing Act 1996. I hope that
hon. Members accept my explanation of the
amendment.</div><a name="080129152000260"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment

an important process for protecting social housing stock. It is
triggered only when a registered provider is in the most serious
financial difficulties. The amendments simply add the Homes and
Communities Agency to the list of interested parties that must be
notified when a moratorium is triggered, extended or concluded. As has
been said throughout consideration of the Bill, the HCA, as the major
investor in the sector, clearly has an important interest. On that

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129152000594"></a>Mr.

for which the regulator&#146;s consent is not required. Clause 141
covers disposals during a moratorium, while clause 163 covers disposals
at any other time. Exempted disposals fall into two main types: those
of the ordinary type of tenancy that a registered provider offers to
its tenants, and those to tenants under statutory schemes such as the
right to buy and the right to acquire. Those exemptions will allow
registered providers to carry on their day-to-day business without
requiring the regulator&#146;s consent, and they will be an important
part of minimising regulation as much as
possible.</div><a name="080129152000285"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments will add a further set of tenancy types that were omitted
from the original draft. They are family intervention tenancies, which
the Committee has discussed, accommodation for asylum seekers and
accommodation for displaced persons with temporary protection. It is
important that the list of exemptions is correct, otherwise registered
providers will be required to seek consent for their day-to-day
business. I therefore hope that hon. Members will accept the
amendments.</div><a name="080129152000286"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment

technical, and its intention is clear. It provides the power to
amalgamate as well as to transfer engagements in circumstances in which
it is necessary for a society to do so. We were not sure whether the
process of transferring would allow the opportunity for amalgamation.
The amendment tries to make it clear that the clause would allow that
to happen when amalgamation, rather than any other route taken by the
regulator or the manager appointed by them, appears to be the answer. I
would be grateful if the Minister were to say whether amalgamation was
originally considered as part of the clause and whether the amendment
is a helpful clarification that can easily be added to the

advantages to giving a manager appointed under clause 145 a further

allow me to consider the proposal in more detail, particularly to
assess whether unforeseen circumstances or consequences could arise
from such a widening of a manager&#146;s powers. I hope to come back

non-profit organisations. There is no benefit to be had from repeating
those arguments. The Minister knows what they are, and I seek his
perspective, which I can guess, on
them.</div><a name="080129152000329"></a>

discussed the matter earlier. The approach that we have tried to take
in the Bill is to recognise as much as possible the different

and to acknowledge the wider statutory environment of governance and
control. I hope that I have made it clear that it is essential that the
regulator maintains the current level of regulatory vigilance, for want
of a better term, in respect of existing social landlords. We need to
secure an orderly transition to the new system, while retaining the
confidence of lenders to the sector. At the same time, we want the new
system to be open and flexible, which is why we have proposed that
certain requirements and regulatory powers apply only in relation to
non-profit
providers.</div><a name="080129152000331"></a><div class="hs_Para">The group
of amendments would extend to all registered providers that are
companies the requirement to obtain the regulator&#146;s consent for
dissolution and restructuring, as industrial and provident societies
must do. On that basis, and from what I outlined earlier, the
amendments are not necessary. They would be too onerous, bearing in
mind the various balances and flexibilities that we need to achieve. I
believe that the hon. Gentleman anticipated that approach, and I hope

&#214;pik:</b> That was a predictable and reasonable answer.
It is evident to me that Government amendment No. 230 is becoming
increasingly important in relation to this group of amendments. When we
debate clause 174, will the Minister tell us how amendment No. 230 will
impact on the restructuring, dissolution and accounts of profit-making
registered providers? The inference on this and previous clauses to
which I have moved amendments is that non-profit registered providers
will be under a greater onus to conform to the clauses than
profit-making registered providers. It would be helpful if the Minister
were to clarify that matter when we discuss Government amendment No.

96 is even more interesting, because it would insert &#147;of social

&#147;Disposal of social housing without consent&#148;. We are
perennially concerned about the disbandment and reduction of social
housing, and we felt that it would be useful to highlight social

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129152000615"></a>Mr.
Wright:</b> The amendments would require non-profit and
profit-making providers of social housing to seek consent from the
regulator for the disposal only of social housing, not of other land.
The requirement to seek consent to dispose of land has been a
fundamental part of the system of social housing regulation since at
least 1974. It has allowed central Government and others to invest in
RSLs in the full confidence that they cannot dispose of their homes and
other assets without the consent of the Housing Corporation, which is
right and proper.</div>
<a name="080129152000355"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under the new investment and
regulatory regime that the Bill establishes, as we have said on several
occasions this morning, the system will be preserved for non-profit
providers such as current RSLs, but profit-making providers will have
to seek consent for disposal of social housing only. The purpose is to
ensure that a for-profit organisation, which we hope to help to build
the required numbers of social housing in order to maintain their
quality, may own only a small amount of social housing among a wider
stock of the property, including perhaps property for sale on the open
market and other pieces of land. I know where the hon. Member for
Montgomeryshire is coming from with the amendments, but it would not be
appropriate for the regulator to have any control over those other
assets. On that basis, I do not agree with the amendment, and I hope
that he will withdraw it.</div>

regulator&#146;s consent is required for a disposal, and consent is
not given, any attempt at disposal is void. The current regime,
however, provides for two exceptions that we intend to replicate in the
new regime. The first, which is set out in clause 165(2), covers an
ordinary individual home buyer who purchases a single dwelling from a
registered provider that the latter reasonably believes is for use as
their main home. I suggest that such disposals are not void because it
would place an excessive burden on the home buyer to establish whether

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129152000620"></a>Mr.
Wright:</b> These are technical amendments tying up the
accounting requirements in relations to the disposals proceeds fund and
the HCA&#146;s new powers to make grant payments. The Bill will make
no change to the right of certain RSL tenants to acquire their homes,
provided for under the Housing Act 1996. When a tenant exercises their
right to acquire, the RSL is required to sell the home to the tenant at
a discount, which is currently of between &#163;9,000 and
&#163;16,000. The Housing Corporation then has a statutory duty to
reimburse the RSL for that discount. The RSL is required to account for
both the disposal proceeds and any grant received in respect of
discount in a separate disposals proceeds fund, which can be spent only
on purposes determined by the Housing Corporation. That ensures that
when a home is sold under right to acquire, the proceeds are invested
in new homes for social rent.</div>
<a name="080129152000372"></a><div class="hs_Para">This Bill replicates those
provisions in their entirety for registered providers and makes no
substantive changes. The amendments simply make technical changes to
ensure that the system continues under the new funding arrangements of
the HCA. Amendments Nos. 223 to 226, therefore, add references to the
funding powers of the HCA in clause 22, under which the agency will pay
grants to RSLs for discounts in respect of disposals.</div>
<a name="080129152000373"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments Nos. 227 and 228
make technical changes to ensure that requirements to account
separately for disposals proceeds are met by for-profit providers. The
Bill refers to the regulator&#146;s powers to make directions in
relation to accounts under clause 123. However, clause 123 applies only
to non-profit providers. The amendments, therefore, make it clear that
the regulator&#146;s direction-making powers under clause 123 and the
sanctions under clauses 132 and 133 also apply to profit-making
providers in relation to the disposals proceeds fund.</div>

registered providers to operate a disposals proceeds fund, as is
currently required under the 1996 Act. The new clause will put in place
the final part of the system by giving the regulator the power to
determine the purposes on which disposals proceeds can be spent. It
also allows the regulator to require the registered provider to pay
sums to the HCA, if the provider has not used them as required by the
regulator in a specified period. The agency would then be able to
re-invent the proceeds, for example, in more social housing stock. On

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129152000626"></a>Mr.
Raynsford:</b> We now reach a critical series of clauses that
define the regulator&#146;s powers. This is fundamental not just to
ensure that we have an appropriate, effective and proportionate
regulatory regime, which provides reassurance to tenants and safeguards
in respect of public finance, but one that avoids unduly burdensome
regulation or red tape. We also need to be absolutely confident that
this regime, and specifically the chain of command that runs from the
Secretary of State through the regulator to the regulated body, does
not put at risk the non-public sector status of housing
associations.</div> <a name="080129152000396"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
referred to both those issues in my Second Reading speech of 27
November, at column 176, and they came up again on a number of
occasions when we were taking evidence in the four evidence sessions on
11 and 13 December. In particular, we heard from David Orr, the chief
executive of the National Housing Federation; from Mr.
Julian Ashby of Tribal, and perhaps even more importantly, a major
contributor to the Cave review; and Lord Best, a well known expert on
housing matters&#151;all of whom voiced concerns that the regulatory
regime as defined in these clauses of the Bill might have the perverse
consequence of putting at risk the non-public sector status of housing
associations, so jeopardising their ability to raise finance to
supplement the public finance put into social housing provision. The
scale of the private finance that is currently available is enormous:
between &#163;30 billion and &#163;35 billion has been raised to
date, and without that capacity, the whole Government programme for
expanding social housing in Britain will undoubtedly be unachievable.
We are talking about something hugely important, and an obvious area of
risk.</div> <a name="080129152000397"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have
subsequently taken a delegation comprising the individuals whom I have
mentioned, as well as other representatives of concerned housing
associations to meet my right hon. Friend the former Minister for
Housing, now the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, to expand on our
fears and to suggest ways in which the Bill might be amended to address
those concerns. I pay tribute to my right hon. Friend, as I do to my
hon. Friend the Minister here in the Committee, for their very
constructive engagement in discussing these issues, and their
willingness to work through what are a number of very complex and
difficult issues to ensure that we achieve the objectives that I
believe that we all share of having an effective and proportionate
regulatory regime that does not threaten the non-public sector status
of housing
associations.</div><a name="080129152000398"></a><div class="hs_Para">I noted
my hon. Friend&#146;s clear statement this morning, when we were
considering clause 118, that he did not want to see an unduly
burdensome regime of regulatory diktat; I think that I got those last
two words&#151;&#147;regulatory diktat&#148;&#151;right. I hope
that I did not misrepresent his position. In that instance, he was
opposing an Opposition amendment, and I hope that he will adopt a
similar stance in responding to these 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column618" />Column number: 618</div>amendments, which I have tabled in order to achieve the objectives that
I have just
outlined.</div><a name="080129152000399"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me run
briefly through the amendments. Amendment No. 345 would leave out the
word &#147;compliance&#148; in subsection (b) of clause 172, and
substitutes the word &#147;performance&#148;, so rather than
reading</div><a name="080129152000479"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;gives the
regulator powers to monitor performance&#148;,</div>
<a name="080129152000400"></a><div class="hs_Para">the clause would
read</div><a name="080129152000480"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;gives the
regulator powers to monitor
performance&#148;.</div><a name="080129152000401"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not
need to elaborate on the significance of that change. I am talking
about a regulatory regime that is concerned not only with compliance
with standards set, which can often produce a tick-box mentality and
lead to unduly burdensome regulatory regimes, but one that aims to
ensure high performance and to avoid unnecessary interference when the
organisation is meeting those standards. However, it enables the
regulator to take action when there is worry about the performance of
an individual body subject to
regulation.</div><a name="080129152000494"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.30
pm</div><a name="080129152000402"></a><div class="hs_Para">The recent
unhappy affairs of the Ujima housing association, whose performance was
clearly lamentable in many respects, has highlighted the importance of
a regulatory regime that allows effective intervention when a housing
association has not been managing its affairs well. I have absolutely
no hesitation in endorsing such action. Indeed, the existence of a
regulatory regime that has given confidence to lenders, tenants and
members of the public has been fundamental to the success of the
housing association movement over the past 30 or so years. In the event
of problems, they will be dealt with effectively and tenancies will not
be put at risk.</div><a name="080129152000403"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
transfer of Ujima&#146;s properties to the London and Quadrant
Housing Association Trust, a large and well-run association with a
strong track record of taking over other associations in difficulty and
improving on their performance, gives me optimism for belief that, with
Ujima, we will see something similar&#151;and I hope that we do. I
also know that London and Quadrant wishes to maintain the specific
character of Ujima, which was established specifically to serve the
black and ethnic minority community. I hope that that character can be
maintained under the new
arrangements.</div><a name="080129152000404"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
represent an area in which Ujima held about 140 properties and I was
struck over the past year and a half by the increasing number of
complaints from its tenants about the poor standard of service from
their landlord. It contrasted with the much higher standard of service
that London and Quadrant gave to tenants living in
literally neighbouring properties. The two associations were both
involved in a recent development, the Rubicon development at Greenwich,
which I am proud to say received an award at the London Planning
Awards. It is a model of high-quality development of social housing.
The London and Quadrant part of it has been exemplary. I have no doubt
about the importance of monitoring performance, and that is why I am
proposing the amendment that substitutes &#147;compliance&#148;
with &#147;performance&#148;.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column619" />Column number: 619</div><a name="080129152000405"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 44 is technical,
so I shall pass straight on to amendment No. 41, which would leave out
&#147;as&#148; in line 3 on page 68 of the Bill and insert the
words</div><a name="080129152000481"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;for the purposes
of protecting investment in social housing or protecting the interests
of tenants and residents in social
housing.&#148;</div><a name="080129152000406"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is the
nub of my objective. It sets out what regulations should be about. I
want to protect public investment in social housing and the interests
of tenants and residents. That is absolutely fundamental to a good
regulatory regime, and that it why it is important that it should be
made clear at the outset that those principles are the purpose of the
regulator&#146;s
activities.</div><a name="080129152000407"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
Nos. 42, 43 and 47 deal with the environmental, social and economic
well-being of an area. We have touched on that already, so I will not
say much more now other than that it is right for the regulator to take
account of that aspect of the performance of a registered social
landlord&#151;a body registered by the new regulator&#151;but it is
difficult to operate a regulatory regime that does not fall into the
trap of becoming either tokenistic, involving a tick-box mentality, or
unduly burdensome. The proposal emphasises the importance of looking at
the contribution that registered landlords make rather than imposing
standards and monitoring how far those standards have been complied
with. It has a similar objective to the earlier
amendment.</div><a name="080129152000408"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments would clarify the key purposes of regulation, which is about
protecting tenants&#146; interests and public finance. That would
ensure that we had a proportionate, non-burdensome and non-bureaucratic
style of regulation and, above all, avoid putting at risk the
non-public sector status of housing associations by creating an
unbroken chain of command from the Government to the regulated body.
That is the purpose of the amendments, and I hope that my hon. Friend
the Minister will be able to respond sympathetically, even if he cannot
accept them, as I suspect will be the case.</div>
<a name="080129152000409"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129152000627"></a>Mr.
Wright:</b> I would argue that this is potentially the most
serious and important group of amendments that we have discussed so
far, certainly in terms of the possible consequences if we get things
wrong. I vividly remember Lord Best&#146;s evidence to the Committee
in December, when he said that it was simply not worth getting public
sector classification wrong, and I absolutely agree. As became clear
from the excellent speech made by my right hon. Friend the Member for
Greenwich and Woolwich on Second Reading and from contributions by Lord
Best and others in our oral evidence sessions in December, this part of
the Bill is arguably the most controversial of the lot. I am, however,
satisfied that the changes that we are introducing in the Bill do not
affect the sector classification of RSLs and I shall come on to that in
some detail when I respond to my right hon. Friend.</div>
<a name="080129152000410"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before I do, however, I should
tell the Committee that I spent the weekend on the internet
looking&#151;sad man that I am&#151;at the report of the Committee
stage of the Health and Social Care (Community Health and Standards)
Act 2003. My right hon. Friend was an excellent member of that
Committee, which discussed 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column620" />Column number: 620</div>foundation hospitals, and I remember with great interest his comments
about public sector classification. He also contributed to an
Adjournment debate about public sector classification in July 2004. I
have done my research quite well over the weekend and I am extremely
apprehensive about discussing public sector classification with at
least two fantastic experts on the issue&#151;my right hon. Friend
and the right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire. However, I will do
my best.</div>
<a name="080129152000411"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129152000628"></a>Alistair
Burt:</b> I have just stepped in to give the Minister a break
before what will probably be among the most difficult 10 minutes of his
career, as he faces my right hon. Friend the Member for North-West
Hampshire and the right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich. In case
he did not notice, however, this weekend was an FA cup weekend, and if
he is saying as a representative of the alleged party of the people,
that he spent his weekend on the internet checking the issues before
us, instead of following the fortunes of our various teams, I am very
surprised.</div>
<a name="080129152000412"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="080129152000629"></a><b class="B">Ms
Angela C. Smith</b> (Sheffield, Hillsborough) (Lab):
Hartlepool was not playing.</div>
<a name="080129152000413"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129152000630"></a>Mr.
Wright:</b> As my hon. Friend says from a sedentary position,
Hartlepool United was not&#151;it pains me to say
this&#151;involved in the FA cup on Saturday, although I will leave
it to hon. Members to work out the reasons why.</div>
<a name="080129152000414"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that you will not rule
me of out order, Mr. Gale, but I should pay tribute before I
go on to my right hon. Friend the Member for Pontefract and Castleford
(Yvette Cooper), who has been promoted to Chief Secretary to the
Treasury. She was an excellent Housing Minister, who pushed social
housing to the very top of the political agenda. She was also a great
boss and she will do a fantastic job as Chief Secretary to the
Treasury. In addition, I think that the Minister for Housing, my hon.
Friend the Member for Don Valley (Caroline Flint) will prove to be a
fantastic successor. In paying tribute to her, however, I should point
out that Hartlepool United is tonight playing Doncaster Rovers, which
is her team, so I do not want her to have too good a start in her new
ministerial position.</div>
<a name="080129152000415"></a><div class="hs_Para">That said, let us move on to
the extremely serious issue before us. I pledge to my right hon. Friend
the Member for Greenwich and Woolwich that we are considering the
entire structure of this part of the Bill, particularly in relation to
directions and the standards system. That is largely in response to the
concerns that he has raised, and I pay tribute to him for what he has
done on the issue. I shall certainly consider the points that have been
raised in these very thorough amendments when we table our own
amendments at subsequent stages in our consideration of the
Bill.</div> <a name="080129152000416"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some of the
arguments relating to the powers given to the regulator in clauses 173
and 174 suggest that the regulator should not be able to set binding
standards with which providers must comply. At present, the Housing
Corporation issues guidance to registered social landlords, which, if
approved by the Secretary of State, can be taken into account by the
corporation in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column621" />Column number: 621</div>considering whether mismanagement or misconduct has occurred, or in
exercising its powers to secure the proper management of the
landlord&#146;s affairs.</div>
<a name="080129152000417"></a><div class="hs_Para">My right hon. Friend the
Member for Greenwich and Woolwich and others believe that the
regulator&#146;s standards should merely be a matter to be taken into
account in assessing whether there has been misconduct or
mismanagement, rather than being directly enforceable. Indeed, the
proposed amendment to clause 178 would achieve precisely that
result.</div> <a name="080129152000418"></a><div class="hs_Para">I realise
that this is not a stand part debate, but I want to go back to first
principles and set out what we are trying to achieve. It is important
to set out to hon. Members that the regulator will be operating in a
different environment to that currently operated by the Housing
Corporation. The Housing Corporation is responsible for paying
significant amounts of grant&#151;billions of pounds. While not
explicitly described as an enforcement power in the Housing Act 1996,
the possibility of withholding grant if the corporation has serious
concerns about the management or performance of a registered social
landlord is arguably the most important weapon in its enforcement
armoury.</div> <a name="080129152000419"></a><div class="hs_Para">Mere
guidance may have a much stronger effect on an RSL&#146;s behaviour
under the current Housing Act system, where non-compliance could have
serious financial consequences. That particular unstated enforcement
power will not be available to the new regulator, since, as we are all
aware, the Housing Corporation&#146;s grant and investment functions
are to go to the HCA instead.</div>
<a name="080129152000420"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129152000631"></a>Mr.
Raynsford:</b> I am following my hon. Friend&#146;s argument
closely. He rightly focuses on the fact that the new regulator will not
have any direct power to withhold grant, unlike the Housing
Corporation, but from an earlier series of debates, when we were
considering linkages and liaison between the HCA and the regulator, we
established that it would be proper for those two bodies to talk to
each other. I would hope that in the event that the regulator had
concerns about the performance of an RSL, it would draw them to the
attention of the HCA, which could then have the effect that he has
described under the current regime, of leading the HCA to withhold
grants. While I hear his point, I do not think that it is going to be a
completely black and white issue of powers that used to exist no longer
existing and the sanction of withholding grant no longer being in any
way available.</div>
<a name="080129152000421"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129152000632"></a>Mr.
Wright:</b> I absolutely agree with my right hon.
Friend&#146;s comments. Clause 102(3), on the terms of direction that
the regulator can provide to the HCA, will be important. Nevertheless,
I return to the point about the splitting of the regulatory and
investment functions, which are currently under the one roof of the
Housing Corporation. Although I fully understand where my right hon.
Friend is coming from, I would suggest that the circumstances in which
the regulator will be able to prevent the agency from paying grant are
possibly narrow, although there will be discussions. Arguably, that is
the implicit point of the split between regulation and investment. On
that basis, the regulator 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column622" />Column number: 622</div>may need a stronger basic framework of standards with which registered
providers must comply, although I am clear that the regulator must be
able to enforce compliance with its
standards.</div><a name="080129152000422"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am also
clear about the role of the Secretary of State. In the context of the
Bill, the Secretary of State should and would only ever issue strategic
directions on standards. As Martin Cave pointed out in his review, the
emphasis should be on rents, on physical maintenance and conditions,
and on tenant engagement and consultation. I envisage that those will
be the topics where the weight of Government interest&#151;I use that
phrase carefully&#151;would lie.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129152000633"></a>Alistair
Burt:</b> I am following the Minister intently. Yes, that is
where the weight of Government interest may be. However, the Government
are subject to other swathes of opinion. The problem with the clause as
it is drawn is that there is no guarantee that there may not be other
matters&#151;beyond the regulator&#146;s stated
objectives&#151;that the Government might press on the regulator in
order to force direction under clause 177. That is what the right hon.
Member for Greenwich and Woolwich is getting at. I am not sure if he is
making a clear enough distinction between the powers that the regulator
should be using and the drive that will come from the
Government.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129152000634"></a>Mr.
Wright:</b> I have put on record my intention to look at the
matter again. Although I am very keen to engage with my right hon.
Friend the Member for Greenwich and Woolwich, with stakeholders and
with others to reassure them as much as possible, a balance needs to be
struck. The whole point of our proposed regulatory regime is to
maintain and improve standards for tenants. Cave has suggested that
that will take place in three broad areas: rents, physical maintenance
of the estate and tenant consultation and engagement. That is
important. I used my words very carefully, and I think that that is
where the weight of Government interest will lie. Amendments will be
brought forward to that effect. I do not want to pre-empt what I will
do or pre-empt discussions that I am going to have with my right hon.
Friend the Minister for Housing, and with stakeholders, but I think
that I am hinting, as much as I can, what I intend to do.</div>
<a name="080129152000425"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not want to seek to
direct very detailed standards. That is the job of the regulator. I do
not wish to see or intend to use the power to secure detailed
management control of registered providers on the part of the Secretary
of State. We do not want to achieve that. I still maintain, regardless
of all the concerns that have been raised, that it would not be
possible to have any such detailed management control from the
Secretary of State or the regulator.</div>
<a name="080129152000426"></a><div class="hs_Para">In a previous sitting, we
discussed the fundamental objectives of clause 86, which are a very
important part of the Bill. Clause 86(11)
states:</div><a name="080129152000482"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Objective
10 is to regulate in a manner
which&#151;</div><a name="080129152000483"></a><div class="hs_brev">(a)
minimises interference,
and</div><a name="080129152000484"></a><div class="hs_brev">(b) is
proportionate, consistent, transparent and
accountable.&#148;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column623" />Column number: 623</div><a name="080129152000427"></a><div class="hs_Para">That important objective should not be
disregarded. The whole basis on which standards are set will be based
on that 10th objective. I hope that that reassures the
Committee.</div> <a name="080129152000428"></a><div class="hs_Para">Bearing
in mind my commitment to look again at this whole area, I now come on
to the extremely important issue of public sector classification, which
gave me nightmares over the weekend. I am aware of the great concern
over the private sector status of registered social landlords and
Office for National Statistics classification, and I want to clarify
the Government&#146;s position. David Orr of the National Housing
Federation and Lord Best mentioned their concerns in the oral evidence
sessions. They do not want to see a change in the status of RSLs.
Frankly, neither do the Government and we do not want to seek direct
management control. What I hope to do is to liberate from the burden of
regulation well-performing, viable RSLs, which have satisfied
tenants.</div> <a name="080129152000429"></a><div class="hs_Para">As regards
current powers and current ONS classification, let me make it very
clear that ONS has already classified RSLs as being in the private
sector for the purpose of national accounts. That classification was
there before any changes in the Bill. It is true that the Housing
Corporation already has certain strong powers. For example, it can
already put directors on the boards of RSLs, it can hold an inquiry and
transfer assets to another owner. It can also require consents to
disposals of social homes. Such powers exist already and do not affect
classification and we have no intention of changing
them.</div>
<a name="080129152000430"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129152000635"></a>Mr.
Raynsford:</b> My hon. Friend is perfectly right to say that
the Housing Corporation has significant powers. As I said earlier, that
is appropriate and necessary, and is compatible with the non-public
sector status and classification of housing associations. The important
distinction is that under the existing regulatory framework, the
Secretary of State does not have the powers in clause 177 to give
direction to the Housing Corporation on standards to be complied with.
That is the nub of my anxiety. The new legislation will create a direct
chain of command: the Secretary of State can direct the regulator who
can in turn impose standards on regulated bodies and require compliance
with those standards. That is a new element that will&#151;informed
commentators have considered this&#151;put at risk the non-public
sector
status.</div><a name="080129152000431"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129152000636"></a>Mr.
Wright:</b> I accept my right hon. Friend&#146;s point.
Under the Bill as it is currently drafted&#151;I stress &#147;as it
is currently drafted&#148;&#151;the regulator&#146;s
standard-setting powers could be subject to direction from the
Secretary of State. We are reconsidering that, and I pledge to keep the
Committee and in particular my right hon. Friend informed on that
issue.</div> <a name="080129152000432"></a><div class="hs_Para">My right hon.
Friend made an important point about the Bill containing additional
powers, but those powers are limited. They enable the regulator to
impose fines and obtain compensation for tenants, and they require the
transfer of management of poorly performing RSLs. The additional powers
are much like those for normal, private sector utilities, and are
modelled&#151;to use the word of the moment&#151;on the current,
modern regulatory regime. They bring regulation into line with other
regulated industries and are not, in any sense, management
control.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129152000638"></a>Mr.
Wright:</b> I vividly remember that the right hon. Gentleman
responded by saying something like, &#147;Not half.&#148; If he
will allow me, I shall come to that important point in a moment or
two.</div> <a name="080129152000436"></a><div class="hs_Para">First, let me
explain the general thrust of my argument. The additional powers are
similar to those for private sector utilities and are part of the
regulatory regime. Nothing is changing in that regard. The powers bring
regulation into line with other regulated industries and are not in any
sense management control. I want to stress that
point.</div><a name="080129152000437"></a><div class="hs_Para">The regulator
setting standards and fining bodies for transgressing them is no
different from the water regulator fining a utility, or the Health and
Safety Executive imposing fines. No one is saying that the bodies that
are subject to that sort of regulation are public bodies. Let me give a
few examples. Ofwat has powers to fine water and sewerage companies if
they breach statutory duties or licence conditions or if they do not
meet required standards of performance. The areas for which they are
subject to licence conditions and standards of performance and for
which they have statutory duties include breaching rules on training
arrangements and providing substandard services to customers by failing
to meet guaranteed standards of
service.</div><a name="080129152000438"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129152000639"></a>Mr.
Raynsford:</b> I accept entirely the Minister&#146;s
analogy. He will know from what I argued earlier that I have no
difficulty with standards being set for the core functions of
protecting public finance and the interests of tenants. However, I do
not know of any power requiring private utilities such as those
delivering water to make a contribution to the environmental, economic
and social well-being of an area. If there is such a power, I would be
interested to hear about it. That is the worry about the formulation in
the Bill&#151;there is scope for mission creep. That point was raised
by the hon. Member for North-East Bedfordshire, but I am also concerned
that because of the wide range of issues on which the regulator can
specify standards, and the ability of the Secretary of State to direct
the creation of standards, there is the risk of a wider chain of
command that might put the classification at
risk.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129152000640"></a>Mr.
Wright:</b> I fully understand and appreciate the point raised
by my right hon. Friend. We have already discussed issues about
environmental and social well-being. Can I give notice to the Committee
that, following my point about the utilities, I will go on to address
the points made by the right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire with
regard to what we have done about getting clarification from the ONS. I
will then come on to the specific point about environmental, social and
economic well-being.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column625" />Column number: 625</div><a name="080129152000440"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Health and Safety Executive
is another example of a regulated body. It regulates and can impose
fines for breaches of the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974&#151;for
example, a failure to ensure the health, safety and welfare of
employees. Again, private companies remain classified as private sector
for the purposes of national accounts. Ofgem regulates the gas and
electricity networks and has powers to take enforcement action
including imposing financial penalties for breaches of requirements
imposed under various Acts&#151;the Gas Act 1986 for example, or
issues of unfair customer practices. The private sector classification
of utilities such as the gas and electricity networks are not in any
doubt. I am reluctant to mention this point, as I know that the right
hon. Member for North-West Hampshire has a whole range of knowledge
with regard to it. However, in terms of Network Rail and the whole rail
infrastructure, the Office of Rail Regulation has a range of statutory
powers under the Railways Act 1993. It issues licenses with a number of
conditions or provisions with which the licence holder must comply.
Given those important examples, the message is clear. There can be
significant obligations placed on companies with regard to their
regulations, without any question of their private sector status. I
hope that reassures hon. Members.</div>
<a name="080129152000441"></a><div class="hs_Para">The point
raised by the right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire is important
in terms of dealing with the ONS and the Treasury. There has been
considerable discussion with the Treasury about the matter. During his
review, Martin Cave discussed his emergent thinking with Treasury
officials, to understand the implications for the classification of his
proposed changes to the regulatory system. My own officials have
discussed the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column626" />Column number: 626</div>changes proposed in present legislation with the Treasury during the
detailed drafting and development of the Bill. A meeting took place on
2 October 2007. After the introduction of the Bill to the House, my
officials again considered the changes in the Bill with the Treasury.
That took place on 21 December 2007 after the oral evidence
sessions.</div> <a name="080129152000442"></a><div class="hs_Para">Earlier
this month on 7 January, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, my right
hon. Friend the Member for Pontefract and Castleford,who was then
Minister for Housing, and I met with departmental and Treasury
officials. We asked the Treasury at that meeting about the arrangements
for taking advice from the ONS&#151;precisely as my right hon. Friend
the Member for Greenwich and Woolwich said in response to the question
put by the right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire. We asked the
Treasury in its capacity as experts on the production of the public
finances, and, for want of a better term, the owner of the
Government-ONS relationship&#151;</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129152000641"></a>Mr.
Love:</b> I am listening intently. As the Minister has
indicated, this is a complex area. However, he will be aware of the
recent Statistics and Registration Service Act 2007, which gives the
ONS and statistics generally much greater independence from the
Treasury. I wonder whether he has sought reassurance from the Treasury
that his view would be reflected in the new ONS and statistics
structure.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129152000642"></a>Mr.
Wright:</b> My hon. Friend has no idea how grateful I am for
that intervention.</div>
