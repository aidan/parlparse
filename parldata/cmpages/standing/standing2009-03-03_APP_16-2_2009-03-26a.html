<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000775"></a>The
Chairman:</b> With this it will be convenient to discuss
amendment 408, in
clause 187, page 106, line 9, at

achievements of disadvantaged children as defined in the relevant
Children&#146;s Trust Board&#146;s Children and Young
People&#146;s
Plan.&#146;.</div><a name="09032759000041"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000776"></a>Mrs.
Miller:</b> These are the final amendments to
clause 187. They address two of the most important issues
facing Sure Start children&#146;s centres: having health as a true
partner, and focusing on giving children from the most disadvantaged
families the best possible opportunity to achieve their potential. On
health being the elephant in the room, amendment 407 clearly places
health on the inspection report that Ofsted will produce. I am sure
that the Minister will argue that health is a subset of well-being, but
if our language were a little more direct in legislation we might
achieve better outcomes for
children.</div><a name="09032759000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
final amendment would ensure that children&#146;s centres have a
pivotal role in helping the most disadvantaged children, and any Ofsted
report regime would have to have the outcomes for disadvantaged
children at the heart of what they are doing. This is an important
opportunity to send clear signals about the outcomes that we expect
from Sure Start children&#146;s centres. The purpose of these two
amendments is to probe the Government&#146;s intentions, because the
information about how the new Ofsted inspection regime will work is
patchy.</div><a name="09032759000043"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000777"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> The hon. Lady has anticipated some of my
comments. I certainly agree that it is important that Ofsted
inspections and reports cover health outcomes, and they are already
covered by new section 98B(2)(c), which requires Ofsted reports on
children's centres to assess the contribution they make to improving
the well-being of young children. Under the Childcare Act 2006, which
the clause amends, &#147;well-being&#148; is defined explicitly as
including</div>
<a name="09032759000680"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the physical
and mental health and emotional
well-being"</div><a name="09032759000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">of
children.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column760" />Column number: 760</div><a name="09032759000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are well
aware of the greater gain to be had from effective support for the most
disadvantaged families, and I agree that Sure Start children&#146;s
centres have a particular role to play in raising the achievements of
children from disadvantaged backgrounds. We have been very clear from
the beginning that local authorities must improve the well-being of
young children in their area while reducing the inequalities that exist
between them. It follows, therefore, that in asking Ofsted to inspect
children's centres, we want to understand the impact that they are
having on the outcomes for the poorest children. I expect Ofsted to
draw on a variety of sources of information and evidence when coming to
their opinion of how effectively a centre is
performing.</div><a name="09032759000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">Officials
and Ofsted are currently working to design an inspection regime for
Sure Start children&#146;s centres that will work within the current
inspections frameworks. The finer details will be settled following a
range of pilot inspections that Ofsted plans to conduct shortly. We
will certainly consider whether any specific provision for
disadvantaged children should be made within the regulations governing
the inspection framework. I hope that the hon. Lady will be satisfied
with
that.</div><a name="09032759000047"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000778"></a>Mrs.
Miller:</b> I thank the Minister for her comments. I am
reassured that she will bring the matter to Ofsted&#146;s attention.
It is important to establish ways of ensuring that the most
disadvantaged children receive the support that they need and deserve.
At the moment, the system is not doing what it could to support them,
and raising the matter with Ofsted and perhaps addressing it in
regulations with a specific requirement to examine the work of
children&#146;s centres in supporting disadvantaged children will
achieve a better result for them. I await further information on how
Ofsted intends to take the matter forward. I beg to ask leave to
withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="09032759000048"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

England</div><a name="09032759000051"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000779"></a>Mrs.
Miller:</b> I beg to move amendment 526, in clause
190, page 109, line 25, leave out
subsection (1) and
insert&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;( ) A local
education authority in England must allocate funding for free of charge
early years provision for a funding period outside a maintained school
out of the authority&#146;s individual schools budget for the
period.&#146;.</div><a name="09032759000052"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000780"></a>The
Chairman:</b> With this it will be convenient to discuss
amendment 525, in
clause 190, page 110, line 18, at
end insert&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;( ) The Code of
Practice on the provision of free nursery education places for three-
and four-year olds shall cease to apply in a local authority area until
that local authority has introduced a single funding formula for free
of charge early years
provision.&#146;.</div><a name="09032759000053"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000781"></a>Mrs.
Miller:</b> Many organisations have been battling for
consistency and funding throughout the maintained and PVI sectors in
child care for many years, and the Bill recognises that there has not
been a level playing field in funding since the early years entitlement
was introduced in 1998. Amendment 526 is important and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column761" />Column number: 761</div>would ensure that all local authorities allocate funding for that
entitlement through the individual schools budget, thus helping to
ensure a fair and sustainable approach to that important funding
stream. The Bill could be open to interpretation, and perhaps the
Minister will help us with that. If there is to be a consistent
approach to funding&#151;I am sure that she wants that as much as I
do&#151;amendment 526, which is a probing amendment, might provide
the necessary clarity. I hope that the Minister will respond positively
to the intention of the
amendment.</div><a name="09032759000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">An
important change in early years funding is tucked away in the Bill. I
heard what the Minister said about some sort of thread holding that
together, but I am finding it difficult to see that thread. With so
little time for debate in Committee, perhaps those who have been
battling with the issue for some time could be forgiven for thinking
that the Government want to make the changes as inconspicuous as
possible.</div><a name="09032759000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">Ensuring
that maintained nurseries are paid in the same way as the PVI sector,
based on participation, is a long-overdue change, and the need for
clause 190 raises concern about the Government&#146;s previous
analysis of the financial pressures on PVI providers over the past
decade. Back in 2005, my right hon. Friend the Member for Maidenhead
(Mrs. May) highlighted this issue for the Minister who was
then responsible for the matter, and is still responsible for it, the
Minister for Children, Young People and Families, the right hon. Member
for Stretford and Urmston (Beverley Hughes), and received the response
that the facts do not stack up and that her analysis was incorrect. I
assert that the facts do stack up and that some nursery funding has
shown signs of inequity for years. The Government&#146;s own analysis
underlines that point, because the DCSF&#146;s benchmarking data on
early years expenditure, which was collected rather late in the day and
included in the Library&#146;s excellent briefing note for this Bill,
clearly shows a stark funding difference between maintained nurseries
and the PVI sector. Indeed, funding for a maintained nursery place is
&#163;6.90 an hour versus &#163;3.72 an hour in the PVI sector. In
87 per cent. of local authorities, the funding level for the PVI sector
was between &#163;3 and &#163;4. I fail to see how the Government
can assert that there was a level playing
field.</div><a name="09032759000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
should come as little surprise to the Committee that as a result of the
problems with finance the number of child care places that have closed
has increased by 48 per cent. since 2003. Indeed, in 2007-08, for the
first time ever, more child care places closed than opened. More than
190,000 places closed, which is an indictment of the financial
situation in the
sector.</div><a name="09032759000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
526 would help to ensure a level playing field in future, and would
clear some of the Bill&#146;s ambiguity on whether local authorities
have a choice to pay PVI providers from the independent schools budget.
The amendment would oblige local authorities to do so, and if they are
obliged to have a single funding formula, they should be obliged to pay
the nursery grant from the ISB. Without doing so, local authorities
would not be able to meet their requirement to have a single funding
formula, so I hope that the Minister will respond positively to the
amendment.</div><a name="09032759000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
525 offers a practical way of ensuring that PVI nurseries are given the
help that they need now. I have outlined the inequity that has been in
the system, so the Committee should not be surprised that in a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column762" />Column number: 762</div>Laing and Buisson survey in 2008 almost two out of three nurseries said
that the free entitlement funding did not cover their costs of
delivery. Two out of every three nurseries in the survey said that, and
that has been the situation for some time. Indeed, in 2006 the National
Day Nurseries Association found that one third of all nurseries lost
more than &#163;5 per session. A single funding formula to address
those issues is not due to be in place in all local authority areas
until 2010. The Government do not need me to point out that if that
trend continues, the cost of replacing lost places will be
considerable.</div><a name="09032759000059"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000782"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> Will the hon. Lady clarify whether
amendment 525 would allow top-up fees to be
charged?</div><a name="09032759000060"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000783"></a>Mrs.
Miller:</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman for his intervention.
The intention behind amendment 525 is to allow nurseries to ensure that
they cover their costs. If that includes charging a supplementary fee
before the new funding regime is in place, we must consider whether
that is preferable to allowing nurseries to go out of business, which
the figures that I gave suggest would happen. The financial pressure
has been increasing over time, and has been made worse by the
recession. A report in January from the NDNA showed that 40 per cent.
of nurseries have bad debts. The report also highlighted that occupancy
is down in one third of nurseries with one in 10 reporting a drop of 11
per cent. or more. Further work by the Federation of Small Businesses
shows that about 200 PVI nurseries could close in
2009.</div><a name="09032759000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman asked whether top-up fees were involved, and no hon.
Member wants that, but we must ask whether we want those organisations
to go out of business because the Government have ignored the core
structure of the financing for far too long, or whether we want parents
and children to have the stability that they need in child care and to
help nurseries to stay in business. We would all like entitlement to be
free, but the evidence is that the money is not going to the providers
as intended, and there is a gap between now and when the single funding
formula comes into place to fix the
problems.</div><a name="09032759000062"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000784"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> Is the hon. Lady not concerned that the consequences
of her policy, which seems to be to allow top-up fees, could undermine
the universal entitlement for some youngsters in particular parts of
the
country?</div><a name="09032759000063"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000785"></a>Mrs.
Miller:</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman for his contribution. I
believe that that is already the case. The evidence suggests that some
organisations already charge incremental costs to try to keep their
businesses together. We can either ignore the problem, or try to give
them some practical help. I am concerned that the funding stream has
not worked as it should have done. The recent research into the true
cost of delivering child care in the PVI sector should have been done
years
ago.</div><a name="09032759000064"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000786"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Lady, who has been very
patient. Is she implicitly rejecting the option of slowing down the
roll-out of the increase in the number of hours that are allowed free,
and saying that the top-up mechanism would be her preference in
relation to that other option?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column763" />Column number: 763</div><a name="09032759000065"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000787"></a>Mrs.
Miller:</b> No, that is not what I am saying. The two issues
are linked, but not entirely mutually inclusive. Other issues
concerning increased flexibility cause far more of a problem for some
providers than others. I am not saying that we would delay the roll
out, but if the hon. Gentleman were to read some of the parliamentary
questions that I have asked on that point, he would be aware that the
Government are less than sure how to finance it. Some of the more
ambitious statements made at the Labour party conference last year by
the Prime Minister may not necessarily be achievable in a reasonable
time
frame.</div>

pm</div><a name="09032759000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">Temporarily
suspending the 2006 code of practice, which forbids parents to be
charged, would help by recognising the extreme pressure that some
nurseries are under. As I said earlier, we could bury our heads in the
sand, or we could face up to the reality of helping those people. After
all, those nurseries provide the lion&#146;s share of the nursery
places that the Government have relied upon to deliver their free
entitlement. Suspending the code of practice will allow us to help keep
them in business in these difficult times. The amendment would give
private nurseries breathing space to ensure that they can deliver the
free hours and the stable child care that parents and children need and
deserve. The code of practice could come into force once a single
funding formula has been adopted by all local
authorities.</div>
<a name="09032759000067"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000788"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> As the hon. Lady said, amendment
525 seeks to disapply the code of practice for the provision of free
nursery education places to three and four-year-olds in a local
authority area until the local authority has introduced a single
funding formula. Although I share the view that we want the single
funding formula implemented quickly, and all local authorities will
come under that obligation from April 2010, I am concerned that the
amendment would have some unintended and undesirable consequences by
affecting children&#146;s ability to benefit from the free
entitlement and the safeguards provided by the code of practice. Free
entitlement is just that; it is free at the point of delivery. Top-up
fees would bar some children from gaining access to provision because
of unaffordable costs&#151;in particular, disadvantaged children, who
would have the most to gain from the offer.</div>
<a name="09032759000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">Independent
research in 2008 showed that funding at national level is sufficient.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000791"></a>Mr.

entitlement from the individual school&#146;s budget. We want local
authorities to do that. The current separation of funding for PVI
providers from that of the maintained providers leads to unjustifiably
different levels of funding, and a perception that the education
received is not the same. We want to ensure that the funding provisions
for PVIs are integrated with the funding provisions for the education
of pupils in maintained nursery schools and classes and the rest of the
school funding system.</div>
<a name="09032759000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall
explain the difference in funding between maintained nursery schools
and PVIs. Nursery schools get higher funding because they are schools
and must therefore have head teachers. The rates between maintained
nursery classes and PVIs are fairly comparable.</div>
<a name="09032759000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">We believe
that the requirement can be better achieved through regulations, which
would allow for the necessary flexibility to make changes to the
funding framework without the need to change primary legislation. We
have already shared indicative regulations with the Committee, setting
out our intentions in that regard. I therefore invite the hon. Member
for Basingstoke to withdraw the amendment.</div>
<a name="09032759000076"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000793"></a>Mrs.
Miller:</b> I thank the Minister for her reply. I note that
she did not refer to her analysis of the cost of delivering child care
and to the work done by the Department showing the difference in
funding between the PVI and the maintained sectors&#151;or the data
on the shortfall in funding faced by so many providers to which I drew
her attention. We will want to come back to the matter.</div>
<a name="09032759000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although I am
reassured by the Minister&#146;s comments on the need for local
authorities to ensure that all local authorities are using the
independent schools budget as a way of distributing the money, thus
removing that flaw in the system, she ignores at her peril the
significant issues faced by the PVI sector. The Government made their
policy on free entitlement work through the tenacity and hard work of
the private and voluntary sectors, but Ministers fail to appreciate
that the cost structures the PVI sector has to deal with are
significantly different from those in the maintained sector.</div>
<a name="09032759000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall not
press the amendment to a Division, but many Members will want to return
to the matter at a later stage because it is causing great concern to
many parents and providers in our constituencies. I beg to ask leave to
withdraw the amendment.</div>
<a name="09032759000079"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000794"></a>Mrs.
Miller:</b> I beg to move amendment 524, in clause 190,
page 109, line 30, at end
insert&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(2A) The
regulations made under subsection (2) must promote the maintenance of a
range of different types of providers of services, including those from
the private and voluntary
sector.&#146;.</div><a name="09032759000081"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000795"></a>The
Chairman:</b> With this it will be convenient to discuss
amendment 523, in
clause 190, page 110, line 18, at

<div class="Column"><a name="Column765" />Column number: 765</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(4A) Regulations made under subsection (4)
must specify that consultations about the determination of the amount
of financial assistance must include a requirement for private,
voluntary and independent early years providers outside a maintained
school to be
consulted.&#146;.</div><a name="09032759000082"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000796"></a>Mrs.
Miller:</b> These are two final amendments on nursery funding.
All families have different child care needs. The range of child care
options in the country reflects the fact that parents want to care for
their children in different ways. Evidence suggests that far from
increasing the diversity of child care, which one would expect given
the Government&#146;s rhetoric on flexibility and trying to meet the
needs of parents, choice has declined significantly. Between 2003 and
2006, the proportion of privately owned nurseries has declined from 78
to 65 per cent. Indeed, the number of child minders has decreased by
nearly 40 per cent. since 1997. The latest statistics from Ofsted show
that nearly 1,600 child minders left the profession between September
and December 2008; there have been two years of continuous
decline.</div>
<a name="09032759000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
would ensure that local authorities have to take into account the
importance of diverse provision of child care. Yes, they have to ensure
the necessary amount of child care in the area, but there is no
requirement to ensure diversity. It is important that we do not drift
into only one form of child care being available, because parents have
differing needs, live in very different circumstances and have
differing work responsibilities. Choice must be available to ensure
that children get the care they need.</div>
<a name="09032759000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">Child minders
have an invaluable role in providing specialist care for disabled
children. I have seen at first hand child minders with special training
dealing with children who have particularly challenging needs; they do
so in ways that centre-based nurseries may find difficult. Looking
after those children will allow their parents to get back to the
workplace&#151;the Minister will be aware of the correlation between
poverty and parents who have children with disabilities. It is
important to protect and nurture diversity in child care.</div>
<a name="09032759000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">Parents who
are cautious about leaving a child in a centre-based nursery may be
able to build a relationship with a child minder. That choice must be
available. The amendment tries to embed the importance of a diverse
cross-section of child care into local authorities&#146; thinking in
a way that does not happen at the moment; the figures certainly suggest
that it does
not.</div><a name="09032759000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
amendment 523, so many of the problems that we have faced in the
funding of the early years entitlement could have been avoided if there
had been effective consultation with the PVI sector. I apologise for
yet again mentioning the importance of effective communication with
that sector; I do so because communication has been so ineffective in
the past. There are no provisions in the Bill to acknowledge the
importance of involving the PVI effectively in future. The sector is
now involved in local schools forums, but despite its overwhelming
importance in providing early years places, its voice in those forums
is merely one of many. If the Minister spoke to some of the PVI
providers who are representatives on local schools forums, as I have
done, she would understand that point clearly. It is simple: the
Government could not have delivered the free entitlement without the
PVI sector, because 65 per 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column766" />Column number: 766</div>cent. of full day care provision is owned by the private sector and 24
per cent. is owned by the voluntary sector. The Government are on a
knife edge and they ignore it at their
peril.</div><a name="09032759000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment requires local authorities actively to engage and consult PVI
providers when determining the allocation of funds. PVI providers are
the most knowledgeable about the costs relating to the service they
provide, so it is only right that they are engaged in the costing
process.</div>
<a name="09032759000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
the Minister will consider the amendments positively. I am only sorry
that there is not more time to discuss nursery funding in the
Committee, because it is of great concern to so many people, both
parents and providers, throughout the
country.</div><a name="09032759000089"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000797"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> I shall deal first with amendment
523, which would specify that private, voluntary and independent
providers must be consulted about the determination of financial
assistance for the free entitlement. We already have in place a
consultative process for the funding of all education, including the
free entitlement, through the local schools forums that the hon. Lady
mentioned, which must include representation of private, voluntary and
independent
providers.</div><a name="09032759000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
current regulations for schools forums state that all local authorities
that include non-school members on their schools forum must have
appointed one or more persons to represent private, voluntary and
independent providers. That is bolstered by section 165 of the
Education and Skills Act 2008, which requires all schools forums to
have non-school members and, by implication, PVI representation. Draft
regulations are about to go to consultation, which, when laid, will
require the remaining schools forums that do not have PVI
representation to have it from January 2010. However, that is likely to
apply to less than 10 schools
forums.</div><a name="09032759000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
expect all local authorities as a matter of good practice to consult
all stakeholders where significant changes are made that are likely to
affect their interests. Guidance on the creation of the single funding
formula specifically stresses the need to work in partnership with all
providers. We expect that good practice to continue for the single
funding formula and early years providers from whichever
sector.</div><a name="09032759000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
524 would require local authorities, in building their funding formulae
for the free entitlement to early years provision for 3 and
4-year-olds, to support and promote a range of different types of
provider, including those from the private and voluntary sector. That
already happens and is clearly set out in the statutory
guidance&#151;in paragraph 5.1 on page 16 of the code of practice.
Local authorities should ensure that a suitably diverse range of
providers, including schools, nursery schools and classes, private and
voluntary sector providers, independent schools and accredited child
minders, can deliver the free entitlement in line with parental choice.
The guidance is currently being revised to reflect the flexible
extension to the offer but that element will not change. Indeed, the
intention behind the changes we are making in the Bill is to strengthen
that diversity, and we think that the best way to achieve that is
through the single funding
formula.</div><a name="09032759000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">With
those assurances I hope that the hon. Lady will ask leave to withdraw
her
amendment.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000798"></a>Mrs.
Miller:</b> I think that I have made my point by raising these
two issues. Although I am sure that the Minister is happy with the
reply she has given me, I am sure she understands that if things were
quite as rosy in the garden and all the provisions were in place
already, we would not be experiencing
problems.</div><a name="09032759000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
figures speak for themselves. We are seeing a decline in the number of
child minders and the number of PVI providers in the nursery sector. We
cannot ignore the hard facts. We also cannot ignore the fact that
although the Minister is entirely right to say that, in theory,
provision is already in place to ensure that the PVI sector is
consulted about the funding regime, it is not effective. I hope that
having raised these points and having elicited the Minister&#146;s
response, it reinforces for her the fact that we all have to work even
harder to make the existing provisions effective for people who are
providing an important
service.</div><a name="09032759000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will not detain the Committee at present, but it may be necessary to
address the issues again in future. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the

patience and for taking all the interventions. I congratulate her on
not necessarily hitting a huge number of sixes, but on staying at the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000803"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000808"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> As clause 191, which we have debated, makes clear,
schedule 13 makes provision for schools that are causing concern in
England. Under the schedule and the clause that follows it, important
powers fall to the Secretary of State in particular to intervene
through local education authorities to tackle school performance and to
address teachers pay and conditions warning
notices.</div>
<a name="09032759000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have some
questions about the intention behind paragraph 4 of the schedule, which
inserts a new section 60A in the Education and Inspections
Act 2006. The new section introduces a system of teachers pay and
conditions warning notices, as the explanatory notes make clear, which
allow LEAs to issue notices to the governing body of maintained schools
when the LEA is satisfied that the governing body has failed to comply,
or failed to secure compliance by the head teacher, with the provisions
of an order under section 122 of the Education Act 2002. The
explanatory notes also make it clear that new section 60A provides that
if a teachers pay and conditions warning notice is given and after a
compliance period the governing body has not complied with it or
successfully made representations to the LEA against it, the school
will become eligible for
intervention.</div><a name="09032759000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">Rather
than hearing from the Minister that the schedule speaks for itself, I
want to know why the Government think it important to introduce such
powers, what evidence they have that the powers are needed, what
problems the Department has identified in the implementation of the
teachers pay and conditions document over the past couple of years, and
how those cases have been dealt with. In other words, is the power
really necessary, is use likely to be made of it and is it worth
legislating
for?</div><a name="09032759000119"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000809"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> Local authorities will for the first time be able
to intervene in schools that do not comply with the statutory
provisions in the school teachers pay and conditions
document&#151;the STPCD. The document sets out school
teachers&#146; conditions of employment and places a number of duties
on head teachers and others, including that of carrying out the
induction performance management of teachers in accordance with
relevant regulations.</div>
<a name="09032759000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those
conditions are incredibly important to the standards agenda for a
number of reasons. First, we cannot expect our teachers to raise pupil
attainment if they have not been inducted into the profession properly.
Secondly, if we want schools to play their full part in the heart of
the 21st-century system of children&#146;s services they will need a
highly skilled and motivated work force who are well led, effectively
deployed and able to engage effectively with a range of professionals
from across the children&#146;s service spectrum. Thirdly, they are
important because statutory requirements are just that&#151;statutory
requirements. They are not optional extras that schools can choose to
disregard, just as key stage 2 standard assessment tests are not
optional extras.</div>
<a name="09032759000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
there is evidence that some schools do not comply with all the
document&#146;s statutory requirements relating to teachers
conditions of employment. Although arrangements exist to resolve
non-compliance, they are cumbersome and slow. For example, discussions
between one school and the local education authority took more than a
year, which was extremely burdensome for the local authority and
frustrating for the staff. It is for those reasons that we seek new
powers for the local education authority and the Secretary of
State.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000810"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I hope that I am not pre-empting the next part of
the Minister&#146;s speech, but as it seems that he might be nearing
the end of it will he specify what non-compliance issues there have
been over the past couple of years, and whether any of them are ones
from which academies would be
exempt?</div><a name="09032759000123"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000811"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> On the hon. Gentleman&#146;s last point, the
STPCD does not apply in academies, so the question does not
arise.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000812"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I was exploring whether any of the non-compliance
issues demonstrate a use by maintained schools of some of the
flexibilities given by the Government on a statutory basis, and
therefore whether the Committee might have a different attitude to
those flexibilities than to other abuses of the pay and conditions
document from which academies might not be
exempted.</div>
<a name="09032759000125"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000813"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> I am sorry, but there are aspects of the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s intervention that I may have missed. It might help
if I tell him of some of the non-compliance of which we have
evidence.</div>
<a name="09032759000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">In March
2008, the National Association of Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers
did a work-load audit of its members; it reported that 5 per cent. of
respondents had been denied planning preparation and assessment time,
and 37 per cent. said that they were directed to do activities not
related to planning, preparation and assessment in PPA time. In
particular, there have been problems with invigilation
roles.</div><a name="09032759000127"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000814"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000815"></a>Jim

innovate in relation to employees&#146; terms and conditions; they do
not have to abide by national pay and conditions. That is a key plank
of academy policy, and one that academy teachers most frequently cite
as contributing to transformational change. Academies are exempt from
all aspects of the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000818"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> No, I do not think that I should give way again,
although for one moment I was tempted. Through the device of
interventions, I have adequately explained the elements referred to
under the schedule. The Committee will note that there are also
measures for intervention on the basis of performance, in respect of
the power to direct local education authorities to consider issuing a
performance warning notice, and for an expansion of the Secretary of

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000819"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> Given the number of important issues under the next
clause that we are to discuss, I shall not hover too long over the
schedule other than to note that the Government seem to be taking
additional powers to direct schools to do things from which some
schools are exempt. That raises the same issue that we discussed
earlier about the way in which academies have greater 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column771" />Column number: 771</div>curricular freedoms. My questioning of the Government is not because I
want to take away those powers, but because of their policy between
different types of schools and whether that inconsistency is based on a
rational analysis of the needs of
schools.</div><a name="09032759000133"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000820"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> I will not labour the point long, but when I and
my predecessor who had responsibility for academies looked at the
individual case for an academy in particular circumstances, one of the
things that we examined was how the sponsor would propose using the
freedoms that are available to academies in order to do the difficult
job of turning around performance. The freedoms in respect of pay and
conditions are one of the things that we look at given that they will
probably pay more money than the STPCD allows to recruit the very best
people to turn around those particular
schools.</div><a name="09032759000134"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000821"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> Yes, but I am not sure the Minister has reassured
me. He seemed to be saying that the Government are giving freedoms to
academies, but looking carefully at how they will use them. That
highlights the Government&#146;s inconsistent approach to school
freedoms and how they are acquired throughout schools. The Government
wish to give freedoms and flexibilities to a particular class of school
yet are legislating under the Bill for powers to force other schools to
do things from which academies are exempt. However, I shall not press
the issue to a

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000824"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> The clause is important. It gives power to the
Secretary of State to require LEAs in England to obtain advisory
services. This part of the Bill is significant because it is about the
mechanisms through which the Government want to ensure school
improvement. We had an interesting debate in Committee a few days ago
about the Young People&#146;s Learning Agency and the role of local
authorities in securing school improvement. Different views were
expressed about whether the Government&#146;s approach was
right.</div><a name="09032759000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
draw attention to an excellent paper produced by Policy Exchange within
the past few weeks entitled &#147;A Guide to School Choice
Reforms&#148;, which no doubt the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and
Littlehampton will already have read twice, being the assiduous reader
that he is. The document draws several lessons from the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column772" />Column number: 772</div>experiences in the United States, Sweden and the United Kingdom and
refers to the importance of accountability to drive school improvement.
It
states:</div><a name="09032759000681"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Accountability
is difficult to manage at a national level: The problem of entirely
ignoring local government is that it is very difficult to authorise and
oversee schools from central
government.&#148;</div><a name="09032759000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
of course believe that it is important that local authorities have some
kind of oversight role of schools and a duty to ensure improvement of
school standards within their area. We believe that it is important for
Ofsted, working as part of what we think should be a much more powerful
education standards authority, then to hold local authorities to
account for school improvement and ensure that they actually do their
job in a way that, frankly, many local authorities, particularly Labour
local authorities in deprived areas, were simply not doing five or 10
years ago, and perhaps even
today.</div><a name="09032759000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">Getting
the structures of accountability right is crucial. Ensuring that the
decisions taken by Ofsted, local authorities and the Secretary of State
are right and fair is extremely important. What we do not want to end
up with, in giving these powers to the Secretary of State, is an
irrational and unfair system of driving school improvement. Indeed, I
would question whether we really ought to have the Secretary of State
involved in such matters at all, or whether in a properly functioning
system the accountability should not be through local authorities and
then through an independent
inspectorate.</div><a name="09032759000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some
of the problems that arise when central Government are given the power
to direct both local authorities and schools are highlighted in the
report by Policy Exchange, which shows the dangers of the Government
using crude measures to determine how they intervene in schools and
therefore implicitly in local authorities. The report highlights
specific issues that are relevant to amendments 148 and 1. It deals
with what it described as the slightly Orwellian national challenge
that has been implemented by the Government over the past year and the
638 schools that were identified in
it.</div><a name="09032759000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
report states that the definition of failure used by the Government is
woefully simplistic, as it assumed, for example, that an inner-city
school achieving 25 per cent. good GCSEs on the five A* to C benchmark
might be performing worse than a suburban school scoring 35 per cent.
That might be debatable on the basis of its intake. Indeed, perhaps
more encouraging in terms of making rational decisions about school
performance, we recently saw one of the first grammar schools being
criticised by Ofsted in respect of its performance, even though its
five A* to C figures were extremely
good.</div><a name="09032759000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">Policy
Exchange goes on to state that it hopes the school report cards that
the DCSF is considering introducing will bring a new level of nuance to
school improvement policy that, for now, is based on a crude and
arbitrary cut-off point. Some of its concerns reflect our worries about
this part of the Bill, which gives powers to the Secretary of State to
interfere in respect of local
authorities.</div><a name="09032759000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause amends existing section 62A of the Education Act
2002.</div><a name="09032759000147"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000825"></a>Mr.

intervene. Would the hon. Gentleman accept that a school in a leafy
suburb that has fewer than 30 per cent. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column773" />Column number: 773</div>achieving five or more GCSEs including English and Maths is a school
that warrants intervention from

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000826"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I would certainly suggest that such a school
warrants intervention of some kind, but we are here being invited to
give that power of intervention on an extremely vague and unclear
basis. I shall come on in a second to look in particular at clause 192
and how it seeks to define failing schools and who it gives power
to.</div><a name="09032759000149"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000827"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> If the hon. Gentleman accepts that some intervention
is necessary for a school in a leafy suburb that has fewer than 30 per

not accept that the same intervention should take place if the school
is sited in an inner
city?</div><a name="09032759000150"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000828"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> The hon. Gentleman misses the point. I am not
suggesting that action should not be taken to improve schools with very
poor results. However, I do not support a crude approach that suggests
that the only way to measure whether schools are doing a good job is
based on a 30 per cent. threshold, aside from whether they could be
schools that are improving very rapidly from, say, a 5 per cent.
starting point, or schools that are achieving 50 per cent. five A* to C
grades at GCSE when they should be achieving a figure of 80 or 90 per
cent., based on their intake. I am not seeking in any way to undermine
the drive for school improvement and I am trying to ensure that local
authorities are properly held to account in their job as commissioners.
Indeed, it would be a major deficiency in our approach if we were not
to hold the commissioners to account, because clearly that has not
worked in the past. I am merely questioning how the Government are
doing that and whether there is any coherent&#151;to use the
Committee&#146;s favourite word today&#151;thinking behind the
measure.</div><a name="09032759000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
existing power that the Secretary of State has is to require local
authorities in England to obtain advisory services where the local
authority has schools in either of the categories requiring special
measures or significant improvement&#151;in other words, Ofsted
categories with some form of independent ratification of the extent of
the problem&#151;and where the LEA does not appear to be effective or
likely to be effective in improving those schools or other schools in
their area that may be placed in these
categories.</div><a name="09032759000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
192(2) inserts an additional trigger for the Secretary of
State&#146;s power to require the local authority to obtain advisory
services. Proposed new subsection (1A)(a) says that a local
education authority in England can have intervention from the Secretary
of State where it maintains a disproportionate number of low-performing
schools. The questions are how the assessment of low-performing schools
is made and whether the assessment has any credibility. Those questions
arise because of the definition of a low-performing school in proposed
new subsection (1B). It
states:</div><a name="09032759000682"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In
subsection (1A) &#145;low-performing school&#146; means a school at
which the standards of performance of pupils are unacceptably
low.&#148;</div><a name="09032759000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
will be obvious to most Committee members that that is pretty much a
tautology and that it does not help in any way to determine whether the
schools really are low-performing.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column774" />Column number: 774</div><a name="09032759000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">Somewhat
predictably, to deal with that problem, we have new proposed new
subsection (1C), which
states:</div><a name="09032759000683"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;For
the purposes of subsection (1B) the standards of performance of pupils
at a school are low if they are low by reference to any one or more of
the
following&#151;</div><a name="09032759000684"></a><div class="hs_brev">(a)
the standards that the pupils might in all the circumstances reasonably
be expected to
attain;</div><a name="09032759000685"></a><div class="hs_brev">(b)
where relevant, the standards previously attained by
them;</div><a name="09032759000686"></a><div class="hs_brev">(c)
the standards attained by pupils at comparable
schools.&#148;</div><a name="09032759000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our
concern is that that is all still extremely vague and that we are
giving powers to the Secretary of State to intervene in local
authorities without there being necessarily a proper basis of proof
that those are failing local authorities. If the Secretary of State is
to intervene at all&#151;we question whether he or she should be a
fundamental part of the system of school improvement, rather than a
distant backdrop&#151;he or she must intervene on the basis of an
objective assessment of whether schools in a local authority area are
really
failing.</div><a name="09032759000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is clearly a danger that the Government could waste time commissioning
or insisting that local authorities commission advisory services when
they do not need to do so, or that the current Government or a future
Government could decide to target local authorities that are not under
their political control&#151;for example, because they might be
embarrassed by the consequences of targeting local authorities that are
under their political control.</div>
<a name="09032759000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">If we have
proposed new subsection (1B) as a tautology and this degree
of vagueness in proposed new subsection (1C), there must be
serious concerns. Even proposed new subsection (1C)(c), which seems to
have a more sensible benchmark embedded in it&#151;seeing
if</div><a name="09032759000687"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
standards of performance of pupils at a school are low by reference
to...the standards attained by pupils at comparable
schools&#148;&#151;</div><a name="09032759000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">raises
all sorts of questions, with which the Government are trying to grapple
in the school report card that they are considering
developing.</div><a name="09032759000726"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.30
pm</div><a name="09032759000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are some difficult questions. For example, the Government might say
that they could compare a number of different schools that have similar
numbers of pupils on free school meals to determine whether the
standards in one school were unacceptably low. However, the performance
of many youngsters who are not entitled to free school meals can often
be as poor as those entitled, particularly if those youngsters come
from low-income families where the family income may be just above the
level of benefits, where the parents may be on the minimum wage or
where there may be low educational aspirations. There are also enormous
differences in the performance of different ethnic groups. If we chose
to compare groups of youngsters in particular schools with a similar
free-school-meal composition, we could find that the reasonable
expectations for the level of performance might be quite
different&#151;for example, comparing a school with a large number of
Asian or Chinese pupils with pupils of a different ethnic
background.</div><a name="09032759000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
question whether the Government are clear and convincing enough about
how they are going to use the powers fairly. So, we have proposed a
couple of amendments to the clause, the first to appear in the Bill
being amendment 1, which would
insert</div><a name="09032759000688"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;judged
by Ofsted to be&#148;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column775" />Column number: 775</div><a name="09032759000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">in line 10 of page 111.
The clear purpose of the amendment is to ensure that the means for
judging whether schools are low performing is not some national
challenge-style, crude sledgehammer approach, but is based on a proper
appraisal and assessment of the
school.</div><a name="09032759000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am willing to acknowledge that the assumption that every school that is
failing needs to be assessed and ratified by Ofsted is a challenge. In
our discussion the other day I raised the circumstances in which Ofsted
might not have a detailed oversight of every school on an ongoing
basis, particularly under the new light-touch inspection regime.
However, what we are talking about here is intervention against a local
authority. It is surely reasonable&#151;highly desirable&#151;that
Ofsted should be involved in that evaluation. I would like the
Government to be much more rigorous in using Ofsted to hold local
authorities to account, particularly as there seems to be such low
confidence in Government in the ability of many local authorities to
hold schools to account that we have had to establish a YPLA in order
to have oversight of the academies as a group.</div>
<a name="09032759000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would like
Ofsted to play an important role in holding local authorities to
account. I would like its reports on local authorities to be
transparent, up front, given a large amount of publicity and, perhaps,
filtered away from the other reports on children&#146;s services,
which are dealing with such sensitive issues in the aftermath of Baby
P. I want to ensure that the reports on the job that local authorities
are doing are based on a sensible and realistic appraisal by an
impartial body, not simply on the basis of a political
assessment.</div><a name="09032759000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
148 would reinforce that message by deleting &#147;the Secretary of
State&#148; from page 110, line 38, thereby ensuring that the
responsibility for determining whether a local authority
has</div><a name="09032759000689"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a
disproportionate number of low-performing
schools&#148;</div><a name="09032759000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">is
transferred to
Ofsted.</div><a name="09032759000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
believe that those changes are sensible and would like the Government
to reflect on them. They should certainly do so before developing the
performance score card, which might give a more reliable basis for
making the judgments that the Minister
wants.</div><a name="09032759000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will conclude with some points on clause stand part, because I assume,
Mr. Chope, that you would like that to be dealt with in this
debate rather than having a separate clause stand part debate. I wish
to raise the oversight of academies with the Minister. Although the
freedoms that academies have should be protected and granted to more
schools, there must be a proper accountability framework for academies.
A number of them are already failing. As the academy programme expands,
there are bound to be more failures, because there are failures in any
school
type.</div><a name="09032759000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Policy Exchange report highlights deficiencies in the academy
programme. It points out that the DCSF can cancel existing contracts if
the academy is put into special measures by Ofsted or if the sponsor is
at risk of bankruptcy. If the academy has not infringed those
requirements, the DCSF must give seven years&#146; notice if it
wishes to cancel the contract, as must the sponsor. Given that the
number of academies will expand, the Government should consider how
they will be held to account under the provisions of the Bill that deal
with bodies that hold accountability for individual schools.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column776" />Column number: 776</div><a name="09032759000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">In expanding
on his party&#146;s position the other day on the YPLA provisions,
the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton said that in future,
federations of academies and other schools are likely to be a necessary
driving force in holding schools to account. I am not sure I agree with
that, but it raises the question of how those federations should be
held to account. When taking these powers to ensure that local
authority commissioners do their job, the Government should reflect on
how they will hold to account federations of academies or individual
academies. They must consider whether their intervention powers are
strong enough. We could end up with the Government taking increasingly
strong intervention powers for local authorities and maintained
schools, while leaving academies unprotected in relation to their
performance
accountability.</div><a name="09032759000170"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000829"></a>The
Chairman:</b> The hon. Gentleman is right to anticipate that I
do not intend to have a separate clause stand part
debate.</div><a name="09032759000171"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000830"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> The hon. Gentleman has described the clause and
the amendments. The clause will ensure that the Secretary of State can
challenge and support local authorities in which the standards in a
number of schools remain low, with no evidence from the authority of
sustainable improvement. There must be robust evidence of low
standards, such as data on attainment and pupil progression in relation
to reasonably expected standards using standards previously attained by
them or by pupils at comparable schools. Such local authorities will be
given the expertise to support and challenge their schools. The
advisory services will be external educational experts or a named
school that will bolster the local authority&#146;s ability to
support its
schools.</div><a name="09032759000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under
the amendments it would be the role of Ofsted, not the Secretary of
State, to judge whether the performance standards of a school are
unacceptably low and thus whether the local education authority
maintains a disproportionate number of low-performing schools. It is
important to remember that the Secretary of State, not Ofsted, is
responsible for school standards and is accountable to Parliament on
them. As a principle of public law, he has to act reasonably and
rationally. He sets the targets and collects data on standards
annually. He therefore maintains a legitimate view of standards. Given
that accountability, the Secretary of State must have the freedom to
take the ultimate decision about when he deems standards in schools to
be too low and to direct a local education authority to obtain the
services that I mentioned. However, we do not anticipate that he will
do that in isolation. I hope that the hon. Gentleman accepts that that
goes some way towards his
argument.</div><a name="09032759000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
intend that the Secretary of State will consult Ofsted, when he deems
it necessary, before exercising this power, and he will certainly want
to look at the context within which the school operates. The amendments
would fetter his ability to act swiftly and effectively and support
local authorities to remedy local performance in their schools and take
responsibility for ensuring that the local authority targets, which he
has set and is accountable to Parliament for, are
met.</div><a name="09032759000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">Academies
already have a proper accountability framework. Many of the powers to
appoint additional governors are modelled on legislation dealing with
schools 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column777" />Column number: 777</div>causing concern. The accountability is there through me and we have the
measures that we need in the funding
agreement.</div><a name="09032759000175"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000831"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I think that the Minister said that before using the
intervention powers the Secretary of State would always consult Ofsted.
It would be useful if he confirmed that. It would also be useful if he
said what would happen if Ofsted responded to the Secretary of State,
saying that it did not believe that the criteria set out in new
subsection (1C)(a) to (c) were met in relation to that local authority.
Would the Secretary of State pay any attention to
that?</div><a name="09032759000176"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000832"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> I said that it is our intention that the Secretary
of State will consult Ofsted where he deems it necessary. We do not
intend to give Ofsted the power of veto. In the end, the Secretary of
State is accountable and he will make the decisions. I hope that, on
that basis, the hon. Gentleman will ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="09032759000177"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000833"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> We got so close, but did not quite get there. The
nub of the issue is not accountability or who triggers the action. I
can accept that, given that the Secretary of State is a democratically
accountable national politician, he might need to have some role in
insisting over the head of the local authority that advisory services
should be brought in. The nub of the amendments is whether the judgment
and evaluation should be an objective, serious and impartial one made
by a credible body on the basis of a careful assessment of school
performance, or whether it should be made by&#151;if I may say
so&#151;a here today, gone tomorrow Secretary of
State.</div><a name="09032759000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">Even
though the Minister indicated that the Secretary of State might consult
Ofsted when he thought it necessary, I do not think that he therefore
implied that he would always do so, because the wording suggested that
that was effectively optional and it left me with exactly the same
concerns that I expressed in my main comments, which are essentially
that a Secretary of State can make up his or her own assessment of
whether a local authority is doing a good job and can exercise the
powers of intervention without a basis in fact. That concern has been
triggered by the crude way in which national challenge has
operated.</div><a name="09032759000179"></a>

much more independent oversight and appointment process for individuals
who are given such important roles. Sadly, the Government have rejected
many of those proposals that would ensure that those important
officials have a reporting, accountability and appointment line that is
not simply down to the Secretary of State of the day. The hon.
Gentleman raises an important issue, but there is a way round
that.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000839"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> The clause is important. It gives parents and pupils
the right to complain against a school when they believe they have
suffered an injustice because of the actions or omissions, as it says
in the explanatory notes, of the governing body or the head teacher
exercising, or failing to exercise, certain specified functions.
Amendment 72 would require the Secretary of Sate to issue
guidance setting out precisely which powers, duties or functions of the
head teacher would be regarded as 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column779" />Column number: 779</div>prescribed functions&#151;those that the parent or pupil could
complain about to the local government
ombudsman.</div><a name="09032759000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
decision to create a new system for school complaints has not been
greeted universally with acclaim. The Association of School and College
Leaders said in its briefing to members of the
Committee:</div><a name="09032759000690"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
complaints service proposed has the potential to be expensive,
bureaucratic and, as it will have an interest in justifying its own
existence, may be liable to increase rather than diminish whatever
problems there may
be.&#148;</div><a name="09032759000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
went on to
say:</div><a name="09032759000691"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
are also extremely concerned that the effect of formalising the
complaints system, in the way set out, has the potential to make
schools more defensive thus fundamentally altering the home/school
relationship. Even for concerns that initially appear minor, in order
to protect themselves, schools will start recording all conversations
and parental concerns and logging them with senior staff...Any
increase in administrative time spent by teachers...will result in
a reduction in available teaching
time.&#148;</div><a name="09032759000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
a similar vein, the NUT has also expressed its concern to the
Committee,
saying:</div><a name="09032759000692"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;There
is concern among teachers and head teachers that this provision is at
best unnecessary and at worst may further complicate existing
complaints structures.&#148;</div>
<a name="09032759000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">NASUWT expressed
scepticism and pointed out a number of potential problems with the
system. It is not convinced that a complaints procedure of this nature
is necessary. It would be helpful if the Minister could respond to the
concerns of all those trade unions that have expressed their view. Will
the new procedure result in schools becoming more defensive and
cautious, perhaps by setting up a rather bureaucratic system to log
complaints and
concerns?</div><a name="09032759000197"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000840"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> The hon. Gentleman is putting very forcefully the
comments made by the NUT and the ASCL. Does he believe that this local
complaints commissioner is unnecessary, and would he have a preference
for another
solution?</div><a name="09032759000198"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000841"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> I am not unconvinced that it might work. It might be
a good system to enable parents to have more say over a school. I have
cases in my own constituency where parents have complained to the head
teacher at a school and have taken their complaint to a school governor
and have received no satisfaction. Then they have come to me and I have
written to the director of education or of children&#146;s services
and nothing has happened. I have then referred the complaint to Ofsted
and, again, nothing has
happened.</div><a name="09032759000199"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000842"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> On what areas has the hon. Gentleman received
complaints? On what type of issues did he not get
satisfaction?</div>
<a name="09032759000200"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000843"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b><b class="B"> </b>I have a particular incident in mind. I will
not name the school, but a parent had been concerned over a number of
years about the amount of homework being given to her daughter. She was
complaining that it was not enough and that the daughter did not
receive any homework in some subjects, which did not comply with the
homework documents that she had received from the school. She
experienced that problem over a period of years and received no
redress. I do not know 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column780" />Column number: 780</div>whether this provision will ensure that such complaints are dealt with
effectively, which is why I am asking such questions. I want to ensure
that the system does not become defensive and bureaucratic. It must be
able to deal with the genuine concerns of parents, if those concerns
are not being met. Our education system must be much more responsive to
parents&#146; desires about the quality of education that their
children receive.</div>
<a name="09032759000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">Does the
Minister expect the change to result in an increase in the number of
complaints, or does he believe that the overall total will remain the
same? Amendment 72 requires the Secretary of State to
specify which powers and functions of a head teacher would fall within
the scope of a new complaint system.</div>
<a name="09032759000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">The ASCL has
asked for clarification on whether prescribed functions mean functions
prescribed directly in legislation, or powers given to head teachers by
virtue of other legislation. It says that if it were to be interpreted
as the latter, it could have most unfortunate results. In its briefing,
it cites an
example:</div><a name="09032759000693"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;schools
have a power (but not a duty) to act on poor behaviour away from the
school site. However, if school staff take up this power, for example
by patrolling an area away from the school and disciplining pupils who
misbehave a school could be seen as assuming a duty of care to prevent
all misbehaviour and bullying in the patrolled area. The school could
then potentially become liable in tort if something happened, that
could be shown to be foreseeable, to one of its pupils in the area even
though the school has no power to give orders to pupils unless they are
either on the school site or under the lawful control of the
school.&#148;</div><a name="09032759000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
would be very helpful if the Minister could address that very specific
example.</div><a name="09032759000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
73 relates to complaints about the disciplining of pupils, pupil
behaviour and the enforcement of published school rules, and proposes
that such matters should be specifically excluded from the remit of the
complaints procedure. As it stands, the Bill only takes out of the
procedure issues about admissions decisions and matters about which the
complainant already has a prescribed right of appeal, but there is a
strong case for taking out behaviour issues.</div>
<a name="09032759000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 74
would exclude decisions about temporary and permanent exclusions from
the remit of the complaints procedure. Both amendments are important.
There is a growing sense that poor behaviour among pupils is a very
serious problem in our schools that has significant implications for
the wider success of the education system. Poor behaviour undermines
the education of pupils and impacts on the quality of their school
life. It is a major cause of stress for teachers and school staff. If
pupils are poorly behaved, teachers are forced to spend more of their
time on crowd control rather than teaching, and that causes some to
leave the
profession.</div><a name="09032759000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
survey in March 2008 by the Association of Teachers and Lecturers found
that nearly a third of all teachers&#151; 29 per
cent.&#151;had been punched, kicked or bitten by pupils. Nearly one
in 10 teachers said that they had been injured by an aggressive or
violent pupil, and two thirds of teachers had considered leaving the
profession.</div>
<a name="09032759000207"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000844"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I have a lot of sympathy with all of these
amendments. None the less, amendment 74 would exclude from the process
permanently excluded pupils. Is not that already one of the exempt
areas in relation to complaints?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column781" />Column number: 781</div><a name="09032759000208"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000845"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> Page 106 of the explanatory notes says that
permanent exclusions will be outside the remit of the local government
ombudsman. It is important to include temporary exclusions, which is
why the amendment is worded in such a way. Such matters of discipline
and management should be left to the school. If teachers expect that
they will have to justify themselves on such matters before an
ombudsman, they are likely to resort to recording the process in ever
greater detail, which may even serve as a deterrent to schools taking
action that they would otherwise take. Therefore, in our opinion, the
Bill should be amended to ensure that the ombudsman&#146;s powers are
not extended to this area.</div>
<a name="09032759000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">Actually,
that is also the view of the ASCL, which is concerned about the system
of independent appeals panels. It is the Conservative party&#146;s
policy to abolish them&#151;they have provided a huge disincentive to
head teachers to expel or exclude pupils permanently because of fear of
the stress and expense of having to go through the independent appeals
process.</div><a name="09032759000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
ASCL says that it is
imperative</div><a name="09032759000694"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;that
the local commissioner will not be able to substitute
his...judgment for that of the
school&#148;.</div><a name="09032759000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
also says that without that, and without a means of enforcing it, we
may see a rising tide of complaints as parents seek another roll of the
dice when trying to obtain what they want. That has been the experience
of independent appeals panels for exclusions and omissions. In
particular, there is a real danger that this well-meaning provision
will significantly undermine schools&#146; capacity to maintain good
order and discipline. We agree with the ASCL that anything to do with
behaviour and discipline, whether or not there is already a prescribed
right of appeal on it, should be taken out of the Bill, which is the
purpose of amendments 73 and 74.</div>
<a name="09032759000212"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000846"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> On a point of order, Mr. Chope. I seek
your guidance on when you want me to make my main speech on this aspect
of the Bill, in the hope of a courteous
response.</div>
<a name="09032759000213"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000847"></a>The
Chairman:</b> We will have a stand part debate on the clause,
so if the hon. Gentleman wishes to speak to this group of amendments,
he can do so, or he can wait for that
debate.</div>
<a name="09032759000214"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000848"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I know that you will stop me if I get this wrong,
Mr. Chope. Our concerns underlying clauses 194 and 195 are
similar and they would complement the discussion on amendments 72 to
74. With your permission, I will speak to the amendments now and not
repeat myself when we discuss clause 195 or during any stand part
debate on clause 194.</div>
<a name="09032759000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our attitude
to this part of the Bill is one of deep scepticism. The hon. Member for
Bognor Regis and Littlehampton made the point very effectively that
parents in our constituencies want to ensure that when they have
complaints about a school, they have some mechanism for getting them
heard. Of course, at the moment, there is a mechanism in any school to
discuss issues with a head teacher. A discussion that probably began
with the classroom teacher can be escalated to include the head teacher
and the governing body. Frequently, in my experience, it will be
escalated to the local authority.  At that point, it can be
escalated finally to the Secretary of State.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column782" />Column number: 782</div><a name="09032759000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand
why the Minister and his colleagues want to remove the right of appeal
to the Secretary of State, because it seems somewhat excessive. I am
not sure whether we obtained from the Minister in the evidence session
an idea of how many of the complaints that the Secretary of State
receives are investigated rather than simply dismissed as things for
which he does not have responsibility. It would also be interesting and
useful to know how many of those complaints have been upheld. Will the
Minister&#151;now or in the future&#151;tell the Committee how many
complaints have been received in the past three years, how many of
those were investigated, and how many were
upheld?</div><a name="09032759000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
impression is that the types of complaint that are likely to work their
way up to the Secretary of State will often be vexatious, although I
will not address that issue now as we have amendments that specifically
deal with that. My impression is that many of the complaints tend to be
issues that will not be pursued and that probably reflect a frustration
with the decisions that were originally made. I am horrified, as are
the ASCL and the NUT, by the thought that in many of the areas
described so eloquently by the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and
Littlehampton, there could be the process of appeal not only to a head
teacher, but to a governing body, potentially to a local authority and
then to this ombudsman function.</div>

Committee will know&#151;in some senses this is a commendable
thing&#151;just how rigorous and detailed the ombudsmen process is,
and how expensive it is. There is even a section

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000849"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. These are quite specific amendments. The
hon. Gentleman has already referred to the fact that he has tabled a
separate group of amendments. We will also have a clause stand part
debate. It would be much more helpful if he directed his remarks
specifically to the amendments before
us.</div><a name="09032759000220"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000850"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I am quite happy to do so, Mr.
Chope.</div><a name="09032759000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is my wider scepticism about whether the Bill strikes the right balance
between the rights of parents and having a practical complaints system
that makes me strongly supportive of amendments 72 to 74. Amendment 72
essentially seeks to clarify and pin down the details in relation to
prescribed functions that apply to the powers and duties of a head
teacher. Amendments 73 and 74 address our concerns and those of the
ASCL and the NUT about the types of issues that are likely to be
referred to the ombudsman service. Amendment 73 would exclude issues
relating to the disciplining of a pupil or breaches of school rules,
while amendment 74, as we heard, would ensure that issues relating to
permanent exclusion or temporary exclusion are also left aside from the
job of the local
commissioner.</div><a name="09032759000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
think that that is extremely sensible. After a parent has exhausted the
head teacher, the school and the governing body process, and arguably
has even gone via a local authority on the way, expecting a local
ombudsman to deal with the issues of detail that relate to the
disciplining of a pupil and decisions to suspend and permanently
exclude would place an onerous administrative burden on schools. It
could lead to a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column783" />Column number: 783</div>very expensive, prolonged and protracted process. It could significantly
increase the number of complaints beyond the number received through
the existing process. My suspicion is that the appeal to the Secretary
of State is enough to deter many people, even if they are aware of it,
from going through this process. If we had a local commissioner or
ombudsman process, I have little doubt that the number of complaints
that would be referred of the type that amendments 72 and 73 deal with
would escalate quite rapidly.</div>
<a name="09032759000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">The evidence
given to us by the ASCL and the NUT showed clearly that their concern
was not about just having the judgments on discipline of the teaching
force of the school and the governing body overturned and questioned in
a way that could be very damaging and undermining. They are also
worried that to meet the evidential criteria that an ombudsman service
is inclined to use, as opposed to the governing body or a head teacher,
there would be a real risk that the amount of information that would
have to be kept by a school could increase enormously compared with
what is kept today. It is not just that that information might have to
relate to the incident that may have led to the decision to discipline,
permanently exclude, suspend or temporarily exclude, but that a series
of incidents, perhaps over a prolonged period, often are taken into
account in a judgment made by a head teacher and a governing body. If
we have these more onerous criteria and the new mechanism, which is
likely to be used more and to be more demanding of evidence than the
existing systems, schools will inevitably feel obliged to keep much
more information at an early stage about problems with individual
pupils so that when decisions are looked at by a local ombudsman, they
can be
upheld.</div><a name="09032759000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton has referred to a
decision on discipline in schools, and recently a similar decision in
my constituency was challenged. The school has already been asked to
account for the series of decisions, in discussions with parents over
some time, that had led to the ultimate decision. I appreciate that the
Minister has already indicated in the explanatory notes that a
permanent exclusion will not be challengeable through the complaints
mechanism because there are already appropriate appeal rights, but it
would be useful to have that in the Bill. It would also, however, be
useful to exclude from these provisions wider disciplining powers and
the powers to suspend, because otherwise I fear that we will, at this
very late time of the night&#151;or very early morning&#151;be
casually imposing on schools an enormous bureaucratic burden that they
and we might regret for many
years.</div><a name="09032759000225"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000851"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> The clause describes who can ask the local
commissioner to investigate their complaint and the types of complaints
that he may consider. The functions of a head teacher that can be the
subject of a complaint will be set out in regulations under clause
194(2), and we will consult with stakeholders on what they might
include. That addresses one of the points made by the hon. Member for
Bognor Regis and Littlehampton. He also asked whether schools would
become more defensive and cautious. I do not believe so. We expect
that, over time, complaints will go down to the local government
ombudsmen, as those ombudsmen 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column784" />Column number: 784</div>work with schools on their complaints process and we use our powers to
issue guidance to schools on how complaints should be handled. At the
moment, schools need to have a complaints process for parents, but
there is not much guidance on what it should include and it is not very
consistent. We can firm that up and make it more consistent, and have
in place the teeth of an ombudsman process at the end of
it.</div><a name="09032759000226"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000852"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> I understand that the guidance for schools issued
every year by the Minister&#146;s Department contains the same amount
of text as the complete works of Shakespeare. How effective has that
guidance
been?</div><a name="09032759000227"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000853"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> This statutory guidance will be effective because
schools will have to abide by it. There are different types of
guidance, and they have differing effects, but I am confident that we
can make improvements. The hon. Gentleman also asked whether the number
of complaints would increase. Currently, around 2,200 cases a year come
through to the Secretary of State. Others go through to local
authorities, even though there is no statutory basis for that, and over
time those numbers might decrease. One reason for piloting the new
complaints service is to test some of those things and properly
understand
them.</div><a name="09032759000228"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000854"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> The Minister has helpfully given us the figure of
2,200 annual complaints to the Secretary of State under the elements
covered by this clause. How many of those were investigated, and how
many of the investigations upheld the
complaint?</div><a name="09032759000229"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000855"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> Naturally, if the Department receives a complaint,
the bar for the use of the Secretary of State&#146;s powers will be
set very high. He will have to judge whether any other governing body
could reasonably have come to the same conclusion&#151;it is a test
of reasonableness. The numbers currently being upheld are negligible
because the bar is so high, which is why we think that we should set up
something in between the school complaints process and the Secretary of
State to give parents confidence that their complaint will be heard
independently of the
school.</div><a name="09032759000230"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000856"></a>Mr.

negligible, but can he give us a figure? Is it less than one

Knight:</b> I cannot give the hon. Gentleman a precise figure,
but I think that &#147;negligible&#148; is an extremely good
adjective to describe it. If, at some point, I am able to provide him
with a figure, I shall be happy to do so, but I suspect that it hovers
around single
figures.</div><a name="09032759000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">Hon.
Members clearly disagree with the inclusion of matters relating to
behaviour and exclusions. Schools will continue to agree their own
behaviour policies, to determine their school rules, and to fulfil
their existing duties in relation to behaviour and discipline. They are
the best bodies to do that, and nothing that we are doing will prevent
them from continuing to do
so.</div><a name="09032759000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">Statutory
guidance already states that head teachers must keep formal records on
the length of temporary exclusions, so the Bill will not add further
bureaucracy there. The local commissioner will, of course, look at a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column785" />Column number: 785</div>school&#146;s policy when reviewing a complaint, and will consider how
well the policy has been followed, as well as whether the policy itself
was sound. However, if it is reasonable and lawful, it would not be
expected to change. We are not asking good schools to do anything that
they are not doing already, but asking all schools to continue to
strive to make improvements. That means learning lessons from previous
formal complaints. We must accept that not all schools will get
everything right, and when they get something wrong, an independent
review process will ensure that parents and young people have access to
effective redress. There is evidence that those very elements that the
Opposition want to exclude from the new service are not working as well
as they could and
should.</div><a name="09032759000234"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000858"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> Newspapers sometimes report cases of, for example, a
head teacher who bans pupils from wearing earrings and an irate parent
who goes to the newspaper about it and causes a big fuss. If the
complaints procedure does not exclude the enforcement of behaviour
policies and school rules, is there not likely to be a flood of such
complaints? At the moment, they are usually dealt with effectively by
the head teacher. Under the proposals, there might be a flood of
complaints to the local government ombudsman from irate parents who
want their children to wear earrings, have long hair or wear trainers
instead of black shoes or whatever, which would be a big problem and
discourage head teachers from properly controlling their schools and
enforcing their
rules.</div><a name="09032759000235"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000859"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> I do not believe that such an increase would
result. The process will be smartened up, so that schools have in place
a more consistent internal complaints procedure that parents can
follow, whether in respect of earrings, short hair, long hair, black
trainers, white trainers, or whatever trainers they are interested in.
If parents then feel that the complaint has not been properly followed
up, they could go to the local government ombudsman, who will make a
judgment first about whether the complaints process was sound and then
about whether it was followed. They will consider the merits of the
case in order to make those judgments. The local government ombudsmen
are extremely skilled in weeding out vexatious complaints very
quickly.</div>
<a name="09032759000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall give
some examples of when the system might not work as well as it should.
Just over a year ago, the Children&#146;s Commissioner submitted a
report to the Secretary of State on the way that schools deal with
complaints about bullying. The commissioner found that although the
majority of schools are to be commended for their focus on
anti-bullying policies, some families felt that their complaints had
not been dealt with effectively. The commissioner also found that, in
some cases, those who have taken unresolved bullying disputes through
the system thought that it lacked transparency, accountability and
effective redress. For example, a child with special educational needs
might have disciplinary action taken against them for bullying, but
their parents might think that those needs were not taken properly into
account by the school when disciplining the child. That might give the
parents cause to begin a complaints process. I see those sorts of cases
in my surgery every now and then, and I am sure that other members of
the Committee see them too. It is those sorts of cases that can be
addressed.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column786" />Column number: 786</div><a name="09032759000729"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.15
am</div><a name="09032759000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">Last
year&#146;s Ofsted TellUs3 survey found that 44 per cent. of children
and young people who were asked thought that their school dealt with
bullying &#147;not very well&#148; or &#147;badly&#148;. That
may be a perception; we know that many schools tackle bullying and
other behavioural matters properly. However, I am concerned about the
cases that fall through the net and the effect of the amendment tabled
by the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton would be that
those young people and their parents would not be able to approach the
local commissioner.</div>
<a name="09032759000238"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000860"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> Could the Minister clarify that legal concerns are
not in any way behind this shift in policy and that it is not for a
legal reason in relation to parental rights that the Government have
put the measure in the Bill? That is not what he is indicating at the
moment, but I just wanted to clarify
matters.</div><a name="09032759000239"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000861"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> Certainly, when I made the judgment about whether
we should introduce the measure my decision was not informed by any of
the legal concerns that the hon. Gentleman referred to. As the hon.
Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton either said or implied, it is
really important that parents and pupils, as consumers of a service,
feel that they have the right to complain, and complain independently,
if that service is not being properly delivered.</div>
<a name="09032759000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">I turn to
exclusions. We are not proposing to transfer the hearing of complaints
about permanent exclusions to the ombudsman, because there is already a
well-tested system. However, we want to look at temporary exclusions.
Complaints about the operation of the fixed-term exclusion process by
governing bodies and management committees currently come to the
Secretary of State. We are proposing that dealing with those complaints
is brought into the remit of the new body. That is in line with our
approach that unless there are effective processes in place to deal
with complaints, the power to deal with them should transfer to the new
body.</div>
<a name="09032759000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again, I
stress that the system does not undermine good schools, which are doing
what they should be doing. For exclusions, we have not put in place any
new rights of appeal that do not exist already. Furthermore, the
measure does not prevent head teachers from suspending unruly pupils,
which is particularly important for the well-being and safety of other
pupils. We will continue to back the authority of head teachers when a
pupil&#146;s behaviour warrants exclusion, permanently or
otherwise.</div><a name="09032759000242"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000862"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> Could the Minister explain why it is more sensible
for the local authority to exercise oversight of appeals in relation to
permanent exclusions, rather than the new body doing so? Why has he
decided that the local authority is the right route for the permanent
exclusion appeal rather than giving that power to the new
organisation?</div>
<a name="09032759000243"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000863"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> We consulted on the proposal and the local
authority option was one of the options that we consulted on. However,
people came down very strongly in favour of the local government
ombudsman as a properly independent body for a complaints service. I
think that is the right judgment.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column787" />Column number: 787</div><a name="09032759000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that on
the basis of those arguments the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and
Littlehampton will withdraw the
amendment.</div>
<a name="09032759000245"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000864"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I appreciate that these are the amendments tabled by
the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, so I will not delay
the Committee for too long, other than to say that the longer the
Minister spoke the less convinced I became that the Bill, as it stands,
is sensible. Indeed, I became more convinced of the excellence of the
amendments and of the need to amend the Bill even further.</div>
<a name="09032759000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have just
heard from the Minister that of the 2,200 complaints that get through
to the Secretary of State each year only a negligible number are
upheld. That rather supports my view that there is probably not a great
problem that needs to be addressed.</div>
<a name="09032759000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think the
Minister indicated that he expected the number of complaints received
by the local commissioner to go down over time. I was not clear if he
meant that there would be an initial surge of complaints of the type
that I certainly anticipate. However, I am certainly not confident that
he is right to predict that the number of complaints will go down. It
is far more likely that the number of complaints will go up
significantly, as people began to realise that they have this new
power.</div>
<a name="09032759000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
confirmed my fears about school bureaucracy, when he said that schools
would start to need a more rigorous complaints procedure and would need
to write everything down in more detail. That is precisely what I was
worried about. Furthermore, he succeeded in horrifying me when he
mentioned bullying and said that we will give a local commissioner the
duty of mounting investigations into the way that schools deal with
bullying policy.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000865"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> I did not say that. The hon. Gentleman is not
listening.</div><a name="09032759000250"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000866"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I will give way to the Minister if he wants to
correct me, but he did refer to bullying and concerns about the way
that bullying is dealt with in schools, in relation particularly to the
local
commissioner.</div><a name="09032759000251"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000867"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> What I said, more than once, was that the job of
the ombudsman will be to look at the process of complaints, to
establish if that process has been followed.</div>
<a name="09032759000252"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000868"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> And the Minister mentioned bullying in relation to
that. If the measure is really needed only to check if due process has
been followed, why on earth do we need a local commissioner? Why do we
need that individual to have the power to recompense individuals who
have to be involved in the investigations in relation to this part of
the Bill? Surely, if it is only about examining
&#147;process&#148;, not only could the governing body do that but,
at worst, the local authority could take five minutes to figure out
whether due process has been followed. Instead, I fear that this part
of the Bill could be used precisely for some of the challenges to the
policy of the school that are anticipated in amendments 72
to 74. That is why I would support the amendments strongly, if the hon.
Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton decided to push them to a
Division.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column788" />Column number: 788</div><a name="09032759000253"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000869"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> I was reassured by the Minister&#146;s response to
amendment 72, when he said that he would consult on which functions of
the head teacher or governor could be complained about. I think that
will reassure some of the trade unions and the Association of School
and College Leaders.</div>
<a name="09032759000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">Like the hon.
Member for Yeovil, I was less convinced by the Minister&#146;s
response to amendments 73 and 74. The Minister&#146;s answer to the
question about whether the measure would make schools more defensive
was that he doubted that it would, because he will be issuing guidance.
It is to be very special guidance that teachers will be forced to read
and abide by, and they would introduce wonderful new complaints
procedures in the school. The Minister said that will satisfy all
parents who may have problems with the complaints about the behaviour
of their children and the punishments applied to them.</div>
<a name="09032759000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not
really buy that argument. Based on my constituency experience, I think
that unless we take out issues such as behaviour and obeying school
rules, there will be a surge of complaints. I am sure that if the
Minister thought carefully, he might concede that point, based on his
own experience as a constituency MP.</div>
<a name="09032759000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">Such a surge
of complaints would be a pity, because it would overwhelm the system
and undermine the genuine attempt in the clause to provide a route for
parents&#146; genuine complaints. For example, I have a constituent
who has a problem with her daughter&#146;s school, which is not
providing enough homework. She seems to have failed to get redress, and
I too have failed to get redress despite writing on her behalf to
Ofsted and the Secretary of State.</div>
<a name="09032759000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am minded
to press the amendment to a Division, just to test the views of the
Committee, because it is important to take out of the right of appeal
any decision relating to the disciplining of a pupil, or any matter
relating to pupil behaviour or the enforcement of the published rules
of the school. It is very important that head teachers have the power
to impose school rules, and they should be supported by the local
authority, Ministers and the public when they try to enforce their
school rules, because unless we get behaviour right in our schools,
standards in education will not rise.</div>
<a name="09032759000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">To support
head teachers in their determination to instil discipline in schools, I
want to test the views of the Committee about amendment 73, when we
come to it. I would like to press amendment 73 to a vote, but in the
meantime, I beg to ask leave to withdraw amendment
72.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000883"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I am very happy with that, Mr. Chope. As
you rightly said, the previous debate extended quite widely and I
anticipate that we may have to touch on similar issues when we discuss
amendments 2 and 71 to clause
195.</div><a name="09032759000281"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister will have realised by now that I am not a fan of this part of
the Bill. I would prefer it to be deleted altogether and that the
powers of oversight on complaints were given to local authorities
rather than the Secretary of State. However, if we are to end up with
this part of the Bill, there at least needs to be consistency in the
way that complaints are dealt with across different schools. One
weakness that my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole
asked me to mention relates to the existing complaints mechanism. There
can be difficulty pursuing complaints in relation to foundation
schools, where I believe that the appeals mechanism does not even go
beyond the governing body.</div>
<a name="09032759000282"></a><div class="hs_Para">In a similar
spirit, I am concerned that academies seem to be left out of the list
of schools covered by clause 194. I cannot understand what mechanism
there will be for pursuing complaints in academies beyond the governing
body of academies. I would like clarification from the Government on
whether there will be a consistent mechanism for complaints relating to
academies. Amendment 425 deals with protection for those who complain,
to make sure that any complaints that they make are not held against
them.</div>
<a name="09032759000283"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000884"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> On Amendment 425, I would not expect any school to
subject a parent or pupil to negative treatment simply because they had
approached the new service. However, I realise that some parents might
be concerned that their child would receive negative treatment as a
consequence of their taking a complaint to the commissioner. I want to
allay those
fears.</div><a name="09032759000284"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
the statutory guidance on handling complaints&#151;in which some
people do not have confidence&#151;we will make it clear that parents
or pupils who complain must  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column790" />Column number: 790</div>not suffer any kind of negative discrimination. I stress that it is the
route for complaints that will change, not the right to complain.
Parents and young people already have that right and there is no
evidence that anybody complaining at present suffers adverse treatment.
Finally, where a complaint qualifies for consideration, a commissioner
will oversee the process, making sure that it is dealt with
impartially, objectively and professionally, to ensure that parents and
pupils have no fear of adverse treatment simply because they have made
a
complaint.</div><a name="09032759000285"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
425 would bring complaints from parents or pupils in academies into the
remit of the local government ombudsman. Clause 207 allows the
Secretary of State to make an order amending the definition of a
qualifying school, which will enable us to bring academies into the
service in future, if we choose to do so. However, we have good reasons
not to include them in the early stages of the pilot; there will be a
gradual roll-out of the new service across England.</div>
<a name="09032759000286"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
schools facing particular issues. Many schools face challenging
circumstances, but academies are often the solution for those with the
most entrenched problems and the most disadvantaged areas. Such
projects dismantle existing structures and processes, and start from
scratch to rebuild the school from the bottom; to deliver, from the
moment of opening, a transformed educational experience for pupils. I
cannot overestimate the challenge that represents for the academy
leadership. It will not be helpful to add to that challenge by asking
academies to help us iron out the processes and structures in the
service during initial stages of the roll-out, when we intend to
evaluate the processes in a small number of local
authorities.</div><a name="09032759000287"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
should also be borne in mind that the very nature of a phased approach,
where we test the mechanics of the service before the full roll-out,
means that the current complaints process for schools under sections
496 and 497 of the Education Act 1996 will still apply in many local
authority areas, and therefore for many complaints. Academies will need
to have their own complaints process for parents, and the pupil
entitlements covered by funding agreements will allow the Secretary of
State to ensure that pupils in academies are not disadvantaged by the
different arrangements that will apply to them during the
pilot.</div><a name="09032759000730"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.30

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000885"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I have two questions for the Minister. First, in the
interim period, what is the appeal mechanism for complaints that are
not satisfied by the governing body? Secondly, is it his clear
intention, if the trial period is continued, to have academies treated
in the same way as all other state-funded schools regarding the
roll-out of such a flawed complaints
procedure?</div><a name="09032759000289"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000886"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> Academies have a robust complaints procedure in
place, regulated by legislation on independent schools standards. That
means that if parents or a young person were not satisfied with the
response to their complaint&#151;made in writing&#151;provision
would be made for the complaint to be heard by a panel, which would
include one person who would be independent of the management and
running of the school. So we have that in place at the moment, and I
have not yet made the judgment on whether I definitely want academies
to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column791" />Column number: 791</div>enter the complaints service. We want to get the pilot up and running
and see how well it is working before we make a decision for academies.
On that basis, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="09032759000290"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000887"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for that run-through
on the two amendments. The more I listened to his response on amendment
425, the more convinced I was that the Government have carefully taken
the matter into account, and that there is no need for the amendment;
the reassurances that have been given would satisfy any reasonable
person. However, on amendment 149, the same is not the case.
Some schools across the country will be slightly irritated to hear, for
example, that academies will be exempted from the trial period because
they are serving particularly deprived and disadvantaged
neighbourhoods.</div><a name="09032759000291"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000888"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> I am reluctant to intervene, because it only
prolongs the pain. It is not because the academies are in disadvantaged
areas, but because they are dealing with a very difficult and
challenging set of circumstances in turning around the school. It is
the beginnings of a service, and while we are getting it up and
running, I do not want to distract them from the difficult job that
they are doing.</div>
<a name="09032759000292"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000889"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> That is a useful clarification, but perhaps the
Minister can tell me how many of the schools still in national
challenge are academies and how many are not, and whether he intends to
exempt the schools in national challenge that are not academies. He is
sitting back&#151;I am not sure whether he is thinking or sighing,
but what he is certainly not doing is offering to intervene to explain
the glaring inconsistency between the treatment of the majority of
schools in national challenge that are precisely in those difficult
circumstances and academies that are in exactly the same challenging
circumstances, but will be exempted from
it.</div><a name="09032759000293"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000890"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> There are different sorts of schools in national
challenge, some of which are making good progress, and they will cross
the threshold without any problem. But there are some that need a
significant structural intervention, and it is likely that they will be
academies, which means that they are likely to be
exempted&#151;certainly for now&#151;from the
process.</div><a name="09032759000294"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000891"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I simply do not believe that that is true. There are
a huge number of schools in national challenge; some of them are
improving rapidly&#151;some of them are academies, and others are
not. Many of those that are not academies may need serious intervention
from their local authority. Indeed, I thought that that was what the
previous clauses we have been discussing were all about. I am not
convinced at all by the reasons for leaving academies out of this. If
the Minister was saying that he was going to leave out all schools in
similar circumstances, the Government would have a more coherent
position. I understand why he might not want schools with those
challenging problems to be going through this pilot, but my complaint
is about the lack of consistency between different schools in the same
challenges.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column792" />Column number: 792</div><a name="09032759000295"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was also
somewhat surprised that the Minister maintained that, even if the
pilots were successful and the process was rolled-out across all
maintained schools, he might still be open to the possibility of not
including academies. That simply underlines what we have had to come
back to time and again throughout consideration of the Bill: the
totally inconsistent way in which the Government treat academies
compared with other schools. More importantly, there is a lack of any
serious intellectual case for treating academies in such a way. I have
a feeling that I will not on this occasion manage to persuade the
Minister to amend this part of the Bill, so I beg to ask leave to
withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="09032759000296"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000892"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I suspend the sitting until 1.10 am. I
understand that, during that period, there will be some discussion
about possible progress. However, I particularly ask the usual channels
to have regard to the fact that there are people in this building who
were led to believe that matters would have been concluded for today by
now. It is important to bring some certainty to bear on matters and,
from the Chair, I implore that something definite is made apparent by
the time we reassemble  at 1.10
am.</div><a name="09032759000731"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.37

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000893"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I made a plea before the sitting was suspended
for half an hour for some certainty regarding the proceedings. Around
three hours ago, I received a communication from the Government Whip
stating that she would regard getting to clause 215 as reasonable
progress. On that basis I informed, through the Clerk, the Refreshment
Department and other workers in the House. It now seems that, despite
the relatively steady progress made since then, the Government wish, or
may wish, to go beyond clause
215.</div><a name="09032759000302"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
offered to chair this afternoon&#146;s sitting because my co-Chairman
chaired a long sitting on Tuesday and was likely to have a reasonably
long one today. Nobody notified my co-Chairman that proceedings were
likely to carry on as late as this, but if she was still here, as was
the original intention, she would have been in the Chair throughout,
which would have been equivalent to around two and a half times more
than a normal sitting for one day. I appeal to the usual channels to
bring some clarity and reasonableness to bear on the situation. The
Bill can be considered on Tuesday and I was earlier informed that the
Programming Sub-Committee might meet&#151;I do not know the full
details&#151;to enable that sitting to go on until
midnight.</div><a name="09032759000303"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
appeal to all members of the Committee to think about what is happening
to other people in this building. The Refreshment Department was given
no notice of what was happening, and there are also police officers,
Badge Messengers, Clerks and shorthand writers to consider. We should
do what is reasonable. I cannot dictate things from the Chair; all I
can do is appeal to the better nature of members of the Committee, and
I 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column793" />Column number: 793</div>am doing that publicly because it would be unreasonable for us to sit
beyond the time necessary to complete clause 214. If we get to that
stage and the Government or anybody else insist on proceeding further,
I will consider what action I can
take.</div><a name="09032759000304"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
make a plea for reasonableness on the issue. There have been a number
of incidents today, most of them when I have not been in the
Chair&#151;there was a period, for instance, when there was not even
a quorum. We need to get down to business, but I hope that when we
start debating the extra amendments on the amendment paper, we also
have discussions behind the scenes and through the usual channels to
bring some much-needed clarity to bear before it is too late. It is now
quarter past 1 and people are entitled to know whether the
Government plan for the sitting to continue until breakfast time or
whenever.</div><a name="09032759000305"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
Chairman, I do not have the privilege of being able to go for a kip or
whatever, so I am certainly not going to sit in the Chair without a
significant break if the plan is to continue until breakfast. If the
Government want to go on until then, we will consider that, but we need
to be able to plan accordingly. I have said enough, so we will now move
on to consider further
amendments.</div><a name="09032759000306"></a><div class="hs_Para"></div><a name="09032759000733"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.15
am</div><a name="09032759000307"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000894"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> On a point of order, Mr. Chope. I hear
your plea and am certainly mindful of the strains that sitting so late
puts on you and the staff to whom you have referred, and to whom we are
extremely grateful for the service they are providing to us. We have
sat for six hours extra this evening, but have made progress only from
clause 184 to clause 195. Six hours is longer than we would have been
sitting next Tuesday, so that is not reasonable progress, and we feel
that it is important now to make reasonable
progress.</div><a name="09032759000308"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000895"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> Further to that point of order, Mr.
Chope. I would like to clarify whether your comments, with which I very
much agree, are directed at the usual channels. I think that
you have made it clear that you are in no way suggesting that the
scrutiny of the Bill should be compromised, and you will understand
that we are keen to ensure that we scrutinise it rigorously, because it
is extremely important and could place onerous responsibilities on all
the institutions involved. I support what you have said, but note that
it is directed at the usual channels, not at the scrutiny being
undertaken by those on the Liberal Democrat
Benches.</div><a name="09032759000309"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000896"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I will make one further comment on the points of
order. If it was thought reasonable at 10.30 pm that the Committee
should adjourn when we reach clause 215, it does not now seem
reasonable that we should adjourn after getting beyond clause 215,
bearing in mind the time that has elapsed since then. I will say no
more on that, other than that I hope that constructive discussions will
take place while we consider further
amendments.</div><a name="09032759000025"></a>




<h4 class="hs_8Clause">Clause

of Local Commissioner to investigate

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000897"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I beg to move amendment 2, in clause 195,
page 112, line 46, at end insert</div>
<div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;or if the local Commissioner considers the
complaints to be vexatious or
malicious&#146;.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column794" />Column number: 794</div><a name="09032759000311"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000898"></a>The
Chairman:</b> With this it will be convenient to discuss
amendment 71, in
clause 195, page 112, line 46, at
end insert&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(5A) A Local
Commissioner may in particular decide not to investigate a complaint
under this Chapter, or to discontinue an investigation if, in his
opinion, the complaint is
vexatious.&#146;.</div><a name="09032759000312"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000899"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> By extraordinary coincidence, Mr. Chope,
following the comments you have just made, we come to an amendment
dealing with vexatious and malicious
activity.</div><a name="09032759000313"></a><div class="hs_Para">Often
when someone gets a bee in their bonnet over some perceived injustice,
perhaps having had some setback they find difficult to accept or
tolerate, they pursue a complaints procedure, or some other procedure
open to them, maliciously or vexatiously. That can have enormously
damaging consequences: it can use vast amounts of other people&#146;s
time and be an expensive and unproductive process. That is why we have
proposed amendment
2.</div><a name="09032759000314"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have already indicated, as was clear in the debate on clause 194, that
we do not believe that clauses 194 and 195, or the associated clauses,
are necessary or that those powers should sit with a local
commissioner. We believe that local authorities should be the relevant
higher appeal beyond the school governing body. However, if we are to
have those measures in the Bill, we ought at least to try to filter out
some of the complaints that would not be productive, could be damaging,
and could be vexatious and
malicious.</div><a name="09032759000315"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment has been suggested by the Association of School and College
Leaders, which is extremely concerned about these provisions and
believes that there is scope for endless second-guessing of head
teachers and endless complaints that could be extremely time consuming
and unproductive. We believe that ensuring that the local commissioner
can disallow, set aside or not pursue complaints that are considered
vexatious or malicious would help to ease some concerns about the
Bill.</div><a name="09032759000316"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment is in some ways moderate. It would not necessarily change the
Government&#146;s intentions, but it would clarify the how malicious
complaints would be dealt with. Indeed, the wording is taken from the
explanatory notes to the Bill. We hope that Ministers are willing to
accept that malicious and vexatious  activity can be extremely
damaging, especially under the circumstances described in the Bill. We
therefore hope that they will accept amendment 2&#151;or, indeed,
amendment 71, tabled by the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and
Littlehampton, which deals with the same concern in a similar
way.</div><a name="09032759000317"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000900"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> Amendment 71 would give the local commissioner a
specific power to decide not to investigate a complaint if he believed
it to be vexatious. The amendment would provide clarity and reassurance
for teachers, who are clearly concerned that vexatious complaints may
arise, causing them distress and other problems. That has not been
adequately addressed in the Bill, as the hon. Gentleman said when
moving amendment
2.</div><a name="09032759000318"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
cite what John Bangs, assistant secretary of the National Union of
Teachers, said in evidence to the Committee. It is always good to quote
the NUT when 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column795" />Column number: 795</div>making my argument; I have done so several times today and may do so
several times more this morning. Mr. Bangs
said:</div><a name="09032759000695"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;What
I am anxious about is the increased potential for irrelevant vexatious
and malicious complaints with this
system.&#148;</div><a name="09032759000319"></a><div class="hs_Para">Similarly,
Chris Keats, general secretary of the National Association of
Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers, told the
Committee:</div><a name="09032759000696"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
have reservations about the practicality and manageability of vexatious
complaints&#148;.<i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official Report,
Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Public Bill Committee,
</i>5 March 2009; c. 92, Q228 and
229.]</div><a name="09032759000320"></a><div class="hs_Para">An
Association of School and College Leaders briefing says that the
association is concerned about the same point. It notes that vexatious
complaints by parents or pupils are referred to in the explanatory
notes and that the local commissioner can investigate or discontinue
such complaints as he feels appropriate. It wants provision in the Bill
to discontinue complaints that are considered vexatious by the local
commissioner. Although vexatious parents represent only a small
proportion, they occur at every school and their impact can be
disproportionate. The experience of ASCL members suggests that such
parents would not be satisfied to be told by the local commissioner,
however independent, that the school had acted
reasonably.</div><a name="09032759000321"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is the concern of all the unions that gave evidence to the Committee.
They said that there is the potential to undermine the effectiveness of
the new complaints procedure and that if the Bill fails to deal with
this matter, it is also likely to undermine any good will that schools
may feel towards the new arrangements. It is surely sensible to put the
matter beyond doubt and to accept amendment 71, or the amendment moved
by the hon. Member for Yeovil. That would give the local government
ombudsman a specific power to discontinue vexatious
complaints.</div><a name="09032759000322"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000901"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> The amendments would make it explicit that the
local commissioner could decide not to investigate or to terminate an
investigation on the ground that a complaint was vexatious or
malicious. We would agree with the need for the local commissioner to
do so, which is why, under clause 195(4), in direct replication of the
power he has in respect of other complaints, the local commissioner has
wide discretion to determine whether to initiate, continue or
discontinue an investigation. Included within that provision is the
ability to determine whether the complaint is vexatious or malicious,
or does not warrant investigation by the service.</div>
<a name="09032759000323"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
important to bear in mind the fact that the commissioner has a wealth
of experience in dealing with such matters, and that when appropriate
he exercises his discretion to terminate an investigation dealing with
unreasonably persistent complaints. It is important to note that the
percentage of complaints that would fall into this category is small. I
expect the commissioner to adopt similar policies to those that he uses
in his work with local authorities and to produce guidance on how to
determine whether a complaint is vexatious in relation to complaints
about school matters.</div>
<a name="09032759000324"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also
anticipate that the service will work closely with the widest possible
range of stakeholders, including schools and governing bodies, to
assist in handling such complaints. That should help to nip those
difficult cases 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column796" />Column number: 796</div>in the bud and ensure that we do not encourage such complaints by
establishing the service. I therefore ask that the amendment be
withdrawn on the basis that the issue has been given full and careful
consideration.</div><a name="09032759000325"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000902"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> I listened very carefully to what the Minister said
and I am not convinced that the fact that the ombudsman, with his
general powers, can stop a vexatious complaint being investigated will
be enough to satisfy teachers. They will take advice from unions and
look to the Education Acts, or similar legislation emanating from the
Government, for information on how complaints are dealt
with.</div><a name="09032759000326"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
reassure teachers, this power needs to be explicit in the clauses that
create the new complaints procedure. It is not good enough to have
those procedures spread around the legislation on measures that give
the local government ombudsman his powers. We want to clarify the
system; it needs to be explicitly drafted, as the hon. Member for
Yeovil and I have
said.</div><a name="09032759000327"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000903"></a>Bill
Wiggin:</b> I am very unhappy with the clause as well. This
power should be clear and explicit in the Bill in the way described in
the amendment, because our experience as Members of Parliament is that,
often, people who become vexatious litigants and are persistent and
unpleasant in the way that they complain are quick to check their legal
position before they begin. Therefore, it would be helpful to teachers
to know that we have taken every step with the Bill to ensure that
anybody who wished to be vexatious was aware that the course that they
were about to embark upon could be stopped dead in its tracks through
clear legislation. Is that not the case with the
amendment?</div><a name="09032759000328"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000904"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that
intervention. He is absolutely right, which is why I will support
either the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Yeovil or that which
stands in my name and the names of my hon.
Friends.</div><a name="09032759000329"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000905"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I fear that we have heard wise words from
Conservative Members on the Back and Front Benches. From our experience
in Parliament and our constituencies, we know that vexatious or
malicious individuals can use all sorts of devices to take forward
their complaints and can be particularly malicious and difficult
regardless of the consequences. The provisions that the Minister
referred to are extremely ambiguous. He referred to clause 195(4),
which merely says:</div>
<a name="09032759000697"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Whether
to initiate, continue or discontinue an investigation is a matter for
the discretion of the Local Commissioner dealing with the
complaint.&#148;</div><a name="09032759000330"></a><div class="hs_Para">Frankly,
it is obvious that the local commissioner would have that type of
discretion if, for example, the complaint collapsed completely.
However, the Bill does not make it clear that there should be specific
provision&#151;encouragement, in some ways&#151;for the local
commissioner not to allow malicious or vexatious complaints, which
could be time consuming and
damaging.</div><a name="09032759000331"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000906"></a>Ms

feel that that flexibility is right. The 12-month rule is not hard and
fast. One of the reasons for it is that the longer the delay, the
harder it is to gather evidence. We believe that 12 months is a
reasonable period to set as a guideline in the legislation, but as I
said, it will be tempered by subsection (2). I urge the Committee to
support the clause.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000929"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> Amendment 535 will remove from the clause the
definition of &#147;Commission&#148;, which is no longer required,
because it is now defined in new clause 27. Amendment 537 is
another technical, drafting amendment that is required due to the
insertion of new clause 27. The terms &#147;act&#148;,
&#147;Local Commissioner&#148; and &#147;respondent&#148; are
used throughout chapter 2, and the interpretation clause&#151;clause
209&#151;defines what those terms mean in relation to the
chapter.</div>
<a name="09032759000370"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause 27
makes it clear that references to &#147;the Commission&#148; in
that clause will be to the Commission for Local Administration in
England. That amendment to the interpretation clause simply provides
that the same definition is applicable throughout the chapter. New
clause 27 will ensure that the commission divides matters that may be
investigated into appropriate categories and allocates responsibility
for each category between the local
commissioners.</div><a name="09032759000371"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
commission will also have to publish information about the procedures
for making complaints under chapter 2 of part 10, and I emphasise that
the new clause will simply replicate provisions in the Local Government
Act 1974. The new clause is necessary and will simply serve to ensure
that the commission can manage its cases
effectively.</div><a name="09032759000372"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000930"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> I want to ask the Minister more about new clause 27.
It talks about
dividing</div><a name="09032759000699"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
matters which may be investigated under this Chapter into such
categories as it considers
appropriate&#148;,</div><a name="09032759000373"></a><div class="hs_Para">so
it is not good enough simply to cite other legislation in which a
similar division of categories of complaint occurs. This legislation
includes a new set of complaints from parents of pupils at school, so
it would be helpful if the Minister set out for the Committee the
categories of complaint that will be divided. Will there be one for
behaviour, where parents or pupils complain about behaviour, and
another on&#151;I do not know&#151;the amount of homework or the
quality of education? Will he explain what categories the new clause
will
introduce?</div><a name="09032759000374"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000931"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> The commissioner needs to make those decisions,
which are practical matters. We are making the changes to give the
ombudsman the powers to do as he does in respect of his local
government responsibilities. It is right that we give him that freedom.
We have not agreed with him how we might organise things, but it is
appropriate to give him the powers to do
so.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000932"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000934"></a>Mr.

State&#151;[<span class="SmallCaps">Hon. Members:</span> &#147;Oh!&#148;]
I am sorry, Mr. Chope. I must not promote the Minister too
rapidly. However, I noticed in one of our earlier breaks that the
Secretary of State seems to have applied for a higher post&#151;that
of Chancellor of the Exchequer, no less, is his latest request in an
interview. Perhaps I was not far off the mark in saying that the
Minister may soon be elevated to an even loftier
position.</div><a name="09032759000381"></a><div class="hs_Para">Earlier,
we debated annual reports, including the job that they would be
expected to do, and the detail and accountability necessary in respect
of the bodies that are expected to produce annual reports, yet the
explanatory notes on the clause say almost nothing about what the
contents of the annual report will
be.</div><a name="09032759000382"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
reading the clause, which is considerably longer than the explanatory
notes, we are no wiser about the expectation in respect of the
report&#146;s contents. There is nothing about whether the annual
report will have to include the cost of the local commissioner and,
given the Minister&#146;s earlier answer, there is a degree of
ambiguity about who those individuals are who will be doing that job
and whether they will be carrying out ombudsman functions in relation
to other services beyond the schools
sector.</div><a name="09032759000383"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is no indication of the types of problem that the local commissioners
will have to deal with and whether any information will be required in
the annual report to tabulate sensibly the types of issue that have
been referred to the local commissioner, which might be useful for
those people considering the job that the local commissioner is doing.
There is also no indication of what the performance criteria will be or
whether the local commissioner will be required, in his or her annual
report, to state whether there are any lessons to be learned from the
complaints received during a particular year, in relation to resolving
them locally rather than having to go through what could be an
expensive
process.</div><a name="09032759000384"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Bill and the explanatory notes are sketchy in that regard. I fear that
we could be missing an opportunity to use the annual reports on this
body, which we do not support, but which we are struggling to assist in
doing a good job. This may be a missed opportunity to make this body a
more effective in the role that the Government envisage for
it.</div><a name="09032759000385"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000935"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> The local commissioner must prepare an annual
report and submit it to the Commission for Local Administration in
England. The report may, for example, contain information to do with
delivering public value, the commissioner&#146;s performance, and
financial accounts and governance arrangements. In relation to
complaints, we would expect the report to include, for example, the
number of complaints, a summary of their outcome and information on the
speed with which complaints had been resolved. The commissioner will
submit the report to the commission, which will then lay it before
Parliament. The publication of that report is an important element of
monitoring transparency and public accountability.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000937"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> It would be tempting to breeze past this clause,
particularly at this early hour. However, I would like to ask the
Minister for more information, as the clause is dealt with rather
sketchily. The explanatory notes
state:</div><a name="09032759000700"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Local Commissioner will be able to consider complaints relating to the
National Curriculum where it affects an individual pupil. Previously,
local education authorities had a role in the complaints process under
section 409 of the Education Act 1996 and paragraphs 6(3) and (4) of
Schedule 1 of the Education Act
1996&#148;&#151;</div><a name="09032759000395"></a><div class="hs_Para">no
doubt we were all aware of that. Those sections have been repealed so
that complainants are able to approach the local commissioner under the
new scheme. Why has the Minister decided to shift from the existing
mechanism of complaints to the new one, given that in respect of
exclusions, he has said that he does not propose to  make any
changes to the existing appeal and complaints mechanism?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column802" />Column number: 802</div><a name="09032759000396"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would like
to probe further what the explanatory notes to clause 208 mean when
they state that the local commissioner will be able to consider
complaints that relate to the national curriculum where it affects an
individual pupil. What types of complaints are likely to be acceptable,
and what complaints have been made in respect of this to the Secretary
of State over the past few years? Does the Minister have any indication
of the numbers of complaints that have been
made?</div>
<a name="09032759000397"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000938"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> It is sensible to align the current complaints
handling system as much as possible when introducing the commissioner.
Under current arrangements, the local authority has a role in
considering complaints about a school&#146;s curriculum, Christian
collective worship, attendance at Sunday school and exemptions from
non-curricular sex education. However, local authorities have no legal
obligation to consider any other type of complaint.</div>
<a name="09032759000398"></a><div class="hs_Para">That system
does not always work well. There are up to three stages for parents to
go through from the governing body to the local authority and the
Secretary of State. That process can often be lengthy and frustrating
for all concerned. In exempting local authorities from considering
those types of complaints, the new arrangements will introduce a more
streamlined and coherent system.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000939"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I am not entirely convinced by that explanation. In
our view, the right of appeal should be to the local authority, which
would remove the Minister&#146;s concerns about an additional tier of
bureaucracy involving the Secretary of State. The Minister was a little
sketchy about concerns surrounding the national curriculum that relate
to one pupil. He gave us no statistics about the number of complaints
that have been received in that area over the last five years. That
might be another issue on which he would like to write to the

inspected within 3 years; in general, schools judged good or
outstanding will be inspected within 6 years, although one
&#145;health check&#146; report will be published in the
intervening
years.&#148;</div><a name="09032759000407"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
purpose of the clause, therefore, is to change the legislation to
enable Ofsted to conduct a health check only, instead of the regular
three-yearly inspection. The amendment would introduce an additional
provision to ensure that the chief inspector of schools may make an
interim statement about a school that has provision for pupils with
special educational needs only if it has first been assessed by an
inspector who is trained in assessing special educational needs. The
amendment also stipulates that the inspector must have properly engaged
with pupils at the school as part of the
assessment.</div><a name="09032759000408"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
light-touch inspections system raises concerns that inspectors can do a
lot of their inspecting via desktop data, that they will rarely see the
school, and that they will often not sit in classrooms. Inspectors
could, therefore, inspect a school without coming across any children
with special educational needs, particularly if it was a small
specialised unit and the inspectors were there for only a couple of
days and spent much of that time analysing data. Care must be taken so
that schools do not become subject to only the health check, rather
than their three-yearly inspection, in circumstances in which the
inspector has not specifically inspected the SEN provision. The
inspector should be properly trained and experienced in that
provision.</div>
<a name="09032759000409"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is the
view of the National Deaf Children&#146;s Society, which said that it
would welcome assurances from the Government that a school with
provision for children with SEN will not be granted an interim
statement or school health check unless provision has been assessed by
an inspector with training and expertise in SEN. It wanted to see that
the inspector had properly engaged with SEN pupils at that
school.</div><a name="09032759000410"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
would like to hear the Minister&#146;s response to this important
amendment that would ensure that we were inspecting the SEN provisions
in schools and not simply doing a high-level inspection that could
often overlook important
details.</div><a name="09032759000411"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000941"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I do not need to add much to the comments made by
the hon. Gentleman in relation to the amendment&#151;[<span class="SmallCaps">Hon.
Members:</span> &#147;Hurray!&#148;] If I am tempted by the
usual channels, I might speak for slightly
longer.</div><a name="09032759000412"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
would merely like to put on the record our strong support for the
amendment. If a fair evaluation is to be made of such schools, it is
important that the elements of protection and quality assurance
contained in amendment 79 are present.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column804" />Column number: 804</div><a name="09032759000413"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000942"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> For reasons that I shall explain, the amendment is
not appropriate. It is right that the progress of pupils with special
educational needs is an important consideration in the new school
inspection arrangement, and I can assure hon. Members that it will be.
In fact, a focus on the progress of different groups of
pupils&#151;especially vulnerable pupils&#151;will lie at the heart
of the new arrangements. All inspectors&#151;whether they are those
from Her Majesty&#146;s inspectorate or additional inspectors
employed by Ofsted&#146;s contractors&#151;will receive training in
inspecting SEN under the new arrangements. There will be a specific
judgment on the learning and progress of pupils with SEN in every
school inspection
report.</div><a name="09032759000414"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
a school is judged inadequate in that respect, there will be real
consequences. A school will not be judged as good or outstanding
overall&#151;in fact, it would be highly unlikely that a school would
be judged good overall&#151;if progress for SEN pupils is anything
less than good. That is important because only good and outstanding
schools will be eligible for a health check report at the three-year
point, and only when Ofsted&#146;s annual risk assessment shows that
a school is maintaining or improving its level of performance will a
health check report be issued, as opposed to an inspection being
carried
out.</div><a name="09032759000415"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
annual risk assessment will apply to all schools and will be used to
determine the scheduling of inspections within the cycle. Performance
data on the progress of SEN pupils will form part of that assessment
and a decline in the performance of pupils with SEN could lead to a
school being inspected earlier in the cycle. The fundamental point is
that it is important to remember that the health check report is not an
inspection report. Having an expert on SEN put together the health
check report for a school would not make a material difference to the
outcome because the report will be based on performance and other data,
which all inspectors should be able to interpret. There is no need for
additional expertise for an inspector to analyse data and
produce  a
report.</div><a name="09032759000416"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000943"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> I am not sure whether the Minister has understood
the amendment correctly. It is not a matter of whether the health check
is carried out by an inspector who is properly qualified in SEN. The
issue is whether the chief inspector is making the decision only to
have an interim health check based on an inspection that has been
carried out by an inspector who is properly trained in dealing with
SEN.</div><a name="09032759000417"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000944"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> I am sure that the hon. Gentleman is taking note
of what I have said, which was that where inspectors are making a
judgment, they have to be properly trained in SEN matters. SEN will be
an important part of that. Where they are analysing data, it is clearly
not such an
issue.</div><a name="09032759000418"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
assure the hon. Gentleman that properly engaging with pupils at the
school will be an even more important aspect of the inspection process
than it currently is. In particular, Ofsted is developing a pupil
questionnaire that it will use to seek views from all pupils at the
start of an inspection. Clearly, it would not be appropriate for
inspectors to engage directly with pupils at a school as part of
putting together a health check report&#151;that engagement could
happen only as part of an inspection visit. In the context of a health
check, such a visit would defeat its object, which is to defer
inspection in recognition 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column805" />Column number: 805</div>of good performance. In light of those clarifications and assurances, I
hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw his
amendment.</div><a name="09032759000419"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000945"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> I am afraid that those assurances do not tally with
the wording of the amendment, which
is:</div><a name="09032759000702"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Chief Inspector may only make an interim statement about a school in
England that has provision for children with special educational needs
if it has been assessed by an inspector who has training and expertise
in special educational needs and has properly engaged with such pupils
at that
school.&#148;</div><a name="09032759000420"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is the point that concerns the National Deaf Children&#146;s Society.
It wants to be sure that when a mainstream school with a unit for
children with special educational needs has been categorised as good or
outstanding, the inspector makes that judgment based on an assessment
that took into account the quality of the SEN provision. I take the
Minister&#146;s point that in coming to that overall conclusion, the
inspector will have assessed the unit, but I am not convinced that the
inspectors carrying out the inspections will always be trained in
dealing with the schools&#146; specific special educational needs.
Deafness, for instance, is a low-incidence special educational
need.</div>
<a name="09032759000736"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2
am</div><a name="09032759000421"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given
how inspections are carried out under the light-touch inspection
regime, I suspect that inspectors will engage very little with pupils
in schools. If the number of pupils with special educational needs at a
school is small, it is even less likely that the inspector will engage
with them. In light of that, unless the Minister wants to respond, I
would like to test the Committee&#146;s opinion of amendment
79.</div><a name="09032759000422"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<a name="09032759000438"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 150
is another important amendment to clause 210. It is necessary to step
back a moment and to record the significance of the clause, which will
insert three new provisions into the Education Act 2005 relating to the
powers of the chief inspector and associated duties to schools.
Proposed new section 10A of the 2005 Act, as we have
discussed, will enable the chief inspector to publish an interim
statement, commonly known as a health check, when the chief inspector
considers that a school&#146;s performance is such that it is
appropriate to defer a routine inspection of the school for at least a
year. In other words, it is an important statement of oversight in
relation to individual schools&#146; 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column806" />Column number: 806</div>performance. The statement must set out the chief inspector&#146;s

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000960"></a>Mr.

not criticising the Chair or suggesting that the hon. Member for Yeovil

his merely reading out the Bill as a filibuster. I was suggesting not

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000961"></a>The

Laws.</div><a name="09032759000443"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000962"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> The words &#147;when in a hole&#148; spring to
mind.</div><a name="09032759000444"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is important to set the debate in context. The point of the amendment
is to deal with accountability to local authorities in relation to the
performance management and commissioning function of schools. Indeed,
the 2006 legislation gave local authorities a key strategic role in
school performance management and commissioning schools. The amendment
would ensure that the Government&#146;s stated intention was
respected in relation to the key role that local authorities should
have.</div><a name="09032759000445"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
explanatory notes to the Bill make it clear that the changes that it
introduces ensure that when the chief inspector makes an interim
statement about a community foundation or voluntary school, a community
or foundation special school or a maintained nursery school, she has to
send a copy of that interim statement to
the</div><a name="09032759000703"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;appropriate
authority of the
school&#148;,</div><a name="09032759000446"></a><div class="hs_Para">which
can be either the governing body or the local education authority. In
respect of academies and other schools specified in the Bill, the chief
inspector</div><a name="09032759000704"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;must
send a copy of the interim statement to the school&#146;s proprietor
and
others&#148;.</div><a name="09032759000447"></a><div class="hs_Para">What
both those elements of the Bill are sadly lacking is any assurance that
this very important statement of how a school is performing and how it
should be inspected will be available to the local authority. After
all, under the Government&#146;s 2006 legislation&#151;and we must
presume that this is still their approach&#151;the local authority is
supposed to be discharging a key responsibility in relation to
performance management and commissioning. In the two circumstances that
I mentioned, however, a local authority, with its supposed strategic
oversight, would not even be copied in.</div>
<a name="09032759000448"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
would therefore ensure that an interim statement from the chief
inspector stating that a school does not need to be inspected for a
year would be sent to the local authority as well as the school in
question. That is crucial. If the Government are serious about local
authorities&#146; performance oversight role, surely authorities must
know whether a chief inspector is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column807" />Column number: 807</div>giving an exemption from inspection for a period. Surely authorities
must be able to cross-check whether that is sensible.</div>
<a name="09032759000449"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill sets
out a number of circumstances in which there would be no duty to inform
the local authority. They concern schools where the governing body is
the relevant authority, and apply to academies and other specified
schools, in respect of which the statement would go to proprietors and
not local authorities.  Such an approach has been taken despite
the fact that  local authorities are increasingly being seen
and treated as commissioners for academies. As the Bill
stands,  authorities are not even being allowed to see the
interim statements issued by the chief inspector. That is crucial for
the oversight of such schools and for performance
management.</div><a name="09032759000450"></a><div class="hs_Para">Increasingly,
the Government are funding and providing school improvement partners,
which are working in and for local authorities to assess the progress
and performance of schools. How can it possibly be right that those
individuals are not made aware of such an important interim statement
that indicates that a school does not need to be inspected for a
specified period? If the information is not provided to local
authorities, there will be a risk that, where there is a difference
between the local authority&#146;s view and the chief
inspector&#146;s assessment, there will be no opportunity to air the
matter. There will be occasions when the local authority, with all its
knowledge and the complaints that it may have received from parents and
others, has an insight into how a school is performing that the chief
inspector does not have. This common-sense amendment is both necessary
and consistent with Government policy and, at this early hour of the
morning, the Minister could easily accept it. That would improve the
Bill, satisfy me and ensure that Government policy would be delivered
more effectively. I invite him to accept this important and excellent
amendment.</div><a name="09032759000451"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000963"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> The hon. Gentleman is seeking to be generous, but
I fear that we will not agree. There is a clear case for the local
authority to be automatically sent a copy of the health check report on
a school that it maintains, particularly in the light of the
authority&#146;s role as an employer and given its direct
responsibilities for the school&#146;s improvement. The Bill allows
for
that.</div><a name="09032759000452"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is equally a case for the local authority to be automatically sent a
copy of the health check report when it provides funding for pupils to
attend non-maintained special schools. Again, the Bill covers that.
However, the case in respect of other non-maintained schools&#151;in
particular, academies, city technology colleges and city colleges for
the technology of arts&#151;is far from clear. The local authority is
neither the employer nor the funding source for such schools and it is
not correct to imply that the inclusion of those schools in the list of
relevant partners for the children&#146;s trusts somehow means that
they have been brought under the control of the local authority and
that the authority could therefore have an automatic right to receive
the health check report. On the basis of those arguments, I invite the
hon. Gentleman to withdraw his
amendment.</div><a name="09032759000453"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000964"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> You will not be surprised to hear, Mr.
Chope, that I am not particularly satisfied with that explanation. It
is astonishing that a local authority, and particularly 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column808" />Column number: 808</div>one that had commissioned with enthusiasm academies in its area, should
not be informed of the conclusion of a judgment by the chief inspector.
It also seems extraordinary that the schools that are listed in
proposed new section 14A of the 2005 Act and paragraph 646 of the
explanatory notes would not be included in that group of schools about
which the local authority would be informed of the results of the
interim
statement.</div><a name="09032759000454"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000965"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> If it will help the hon. Gentleman, I can assure
him that there are no barriers to a local authority gaining access to
any of the reports. All the health check reports will be published on
the Ofsted website and a local authority can, if it chooses, obtain a
copy from the school. In addition, a local authority representative is
on the governing body of every academy and all the other schools
listed. There will therefore be no problem in local authorities
accessing the reports if they want them. We just do not propose to send
them to
them.</div><a name="09032759000455"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000966"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I am sorry, but the Minister cannot have it both
ways. He cannot say that he wants to send the reports on presumably the
majority of schools in the country to local authorities and create this
sensible duty and, at the same time, say that there is an expectation
that all the others can be looked up on a website, or a hope that a
local authority representative will have attended a particular meeting
of the governing
body.</div><a name="09032759000737"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.15

School Support Staff Negotiating
Body</div><a name="09032759000474"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000976"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> I beg to move amendment 377, in schedule
15, page 221, line 10, at end
insert&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(5) The membership
of the SSSNB shall include an equal number of persons
representing&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel2">(a) the
interests of prescribed school support staff organisations,
and</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel2">(b) the interests of
prescribed school support staff employer
organisations.&#146;.</div><a name="09032759000475"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
now come to schedule 15 and clause 212, which establishes the school
support staff negotiating body. The amendment would insert into
paragraph 2 of the schedule, which relates to the membership of the
body&#151;paragraph 1 relates to its constitution&#151;a fifth
aspect of the membership by saying that it shall include an equal
number of people representing the interests of prescribed school
support staff organisations and the interests of prescribed school
support staff employer organisations. It is designed to ensure that the
SSSNB is not dominated by one side or the other in negotiations and
that employers and employees are given an equal voice in the body. That
is one concern of the Foundation and Aided Schools National Association
and other employers, so I should be grateful if the Minister addressed
the amendment and let us have his
opinion.</div><a name="09032759000476"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000977"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> I wholeheartedly agree that there should always be
equal representation of employers and employees on the school support
staff negotiating body. It goes without saying that it would be
unlikely for trade unions or organisations representing employers of
support staff to agree to be party to any body that did not allow them
fair representation and equal voting
rights.</div><a name="09032759000477"></a><div class="hs_Para">Schedule
15 already provides the necessary means to ensure that employer and
employee organisations are treated equally by providing that the SSSNB
will be constituted in accordance with arrangements made by the
Secretary of State after consultation with the school support staff
organisations and the school support staff employer
organisations.</div><a name="09032759000478"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
constitution for the non-statutory body, which the Secretary of State
will set up using his prerogative powers, is being drawn up in
consultation with all the organisations that will make up the
membership of the SSSNB. Arrangements made for the constitution of the
non-statutory body will be treated as if they were arrangements made
for the statutory body once it comes into effect. That draft
constitution allows the organisations representing school support staff
employers and employees to agree collectively the number of individuals
who will represent each named organisation. However, it also stipulates
that the total number of individual members representing support staff
employer organisations must not exceed a total of 15; similarly,
individual members representing support staff must not exceed
15.</div><a name="09032759000479"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000978"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> The right hon. Gentleman has almost answered my
question. If he is consulting on a constitution that provides for an
equal number of people representing employers and employees, there is
no reason why he cannot accept the amendment. It would not clash with
the constitution, which has other things in addition&#151;more detail
on the numbers and so on. The amendment is not inconsistent or
incompatible with the constitution.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column810" />Column number: 810</div><a name="09032759000480"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000979"></a>Jim
Knight:</b><b class="B"> </b>I do not believe that it is necessary to
reiterate the point that the hon. Gentleman made in the schedule.
Before making revisions to the constitution, the Secretary of State is
required by the schedule to consult the member organisations that
represent the interests of school support staff and employers. That
will help to ensure the fairness and equity of membership that is being
sought, and I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment on the
basis of those
assurances.</div><a name="09032759000481"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000980"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> It is a little churlish of the Minister not to
accept the amendment, but I am reassured, so I might be thought
churlish if I pressed it to a Division. His assurance was delivered at
great speed, so I shall read the <i class="I">Hansar</i><i class="I">d</i> report and
consider the matter further with a view to returning to it on Report. I
beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="09032759000482"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,
by leave,
withdrawn.</i></div><a name="09032759000483"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09032759000981"></a><b class="B">Mrs.
Sharon Hodgson</b> (Gateshead, East and Washington, West)
(Lab): I beg to move amendment 547, in schedule 15,
page 222, line 4, leave out
&#145;represents&#146; and insert</div>
<div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;is a trade union recognised to
represent&#146;.</div><a name="09032759000484"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
is a small but perfectly formed and important amendment to paragraph 8
of the schedule, which includes some important definitions of the
organisations that will be members of the negotiating body. School
support staff are represented by recognised trade unions, such as GMB,
UNISON and Unite, and that is incorporated into their employment
contracts via the local government Green Book conditions. If the Green
Book terms are replaced with the SSSNB&#146;s terms, the recognised
status of support staff unions will be lost. What replaces it under the
SSSNB structure is membership of the body, but that is not the same as
being recognised. The purpose of the amendment is to maintain the
continuity of trade union recognition for support staff, and I look
forward to the Minister&#146;s
response.</div><a name="09032759000485"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000982"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> My hon. Friend has set out clearly what the
amendment is trying to achieve, and I am aware that some trade unions
are worried that their status of recognition in collective bargaining
will be lost. The SSSNB will be a statutory body and membership will be
prescribed in regulations. UNISON, Unite and GMB will be the prescribed
unions as currently titled, and employers and unions represented on the
SSSNB will be required by statute to consider and negotiate on matters
relating to the remuneration of support staff. The statutory provision
supports the view that the employers who are represented on the SSSNB
have recognised the unions for collective bargaining purposes by virtue
of the fact that both unions and employer representatives are required
under legislation to negotiate with a view to reaching agreement.
Naming the relevant organisations within the prescribing regulations
provides the unions with appropriate statutory recognition, so the
amendment would add nothing of further significance in strengthening
that level of recognition. I hope that my hon. Friend will withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="09032759000486"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000988"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> These five amendments make the same point, but apply
to different clauses on the School Support Staff Negotiating Body. They
would ensure that the Secretary of State and the SSSNB have regard to
the desirability of promoting school autonomy at all points in the
decision-making process. They require the SSSNB to have regard to that
point when making a decision and require the Secretary of State to make
a statement on school autonomy when ratifying any agreement. They would
also enable the Secretary of State to refer the agreement back to the
SSSNB if it fails to take account of this
issue.</div><a name="09032759000498"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our
concern is that schools that are autonomous and value their autonomy
and freedom should not have that autonomy undermined by the existence
of the SSSNB. When they enter into negotiations, the autonomy of
schools must not be jeopardised by a national pay-bargaining
agreement.</div><a name="09032759000499"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000989"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> I appreciate the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point.
The member organisations that make up the negotiating body will of
course include representatives of employers of school support staff,
representatives of local government employers, FASNA, the Church of
England education division and the Catholic Education
Service.</div><a name="09032759000500"></a><div class="hs_Para">During
the oral evidence sessions, we heard from FASNA, which represents the
governing bodies that are employers of support staff. It explained the
need for any agreements reached by the negotiating body to include 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column812" />Column number: 812</div>an appropriate level of flexibility. That flexibility is needed for
schools to continue to choose the specific roles of their support staff
and to deploy them in a way that meets the school&#146;s particular
needs. Unison said it was confident
that</div><a name="09032759000707"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;flexibility
can be built into it... Schools will be able to determine what
their staffing structure is, what level of staff they want and what
jobs they want the staff to
do.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official Report, Apprenticeships,
Skills, Children and Learning Public Bill Committee, </i>5 March 2009;
c. 146,
Q88.]</div><a name="09032759000501"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is not only self-governing schools that will need that flexibility.
Community voluntary aided schools, community special schools and
maintained nursery schools all need flexibility to manage their staff
in ways that allow them to address the challenges they face. The whole
school work force must be managed in a way that supports personalised
learning and development and focuses on pupil
attainment.</div><a name="09032759000502"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are already sufficient safeguards in the way that the voting membership
is arranged to ensure that the needs of employee and employer will be
catered for in any agreement. That will include the safeguarding of
autonomy. There will be a fair and equal system with both sides voting
on agreements. Clause 217 allows the Secretary of State to refer an
agreement back to the SSSNB for a reconsideration if he thinks that it
would be inappropriate to ratify it. Clause 220 allows him to refer an
agreement that has been revised or resubmitted following
reconsideration back to the SSSNB for further consideration if he
believes that it would not be practicable to implement it. The
Secretary of State may use that provision if he considers that an
agreement fails to provide appropriate
flexibility.</div><a name="09032759000503"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
those reasons, I do not think that the amendments are necessary. I ask
the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="09032759000504"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000990"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000993"></a>Mrs.
Hodgson:</b> The support staff trade unions&#151;GMB, Unison
and Unite&#151;warmly welcome the establishment of a national
negotiating body for school support staff. It is also supported by head
teacher and teacher organisations, governor representatives and
employer organisations. As we know, support staff have grown in number
and role under this Government, and they are the new professionals in
schools.</div><a name="09032759000516"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments would enable the SSSNB to function properly. I would have
liked to say much more about the amendments, but in the interests of
brevity I shall curtail my remarks to those that I have just made. I
look forward to hearing from the Minister in due
course.</div><a name="09032759000517"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000994"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> On amendment 538, clause 215 allows the
negotiating body to consider and reach agreement on a matter within the
remit of the body, regardless of whether the matter has been referred
to it by the Secretary of State. Clause 215(3) provides that the body
may, however, submit its agreement to the Secretary of State only if it
has received the Secretary of State&#146;s prior consent. The
amendment would remove that
requirement.</div><a name="09032759000518"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
understand the concern that has been raised that in a genuine
negotiation, issues sometimes crop up at the last minute that need to
be included in order to secure a negotiated agreement. That is why
clause 215 is in the Bill. The amendment raises an interesting
question, given all the safeguards that I mentioned in speaking to the
last amendment, as to whether we need to have subsection (3) in the
Bill. I will reflect on that, and if I decide that it is not necessary,
I will bring something back on
Report.</div><a name="09032759000519"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
amendments 539 to 544, if the negotiating body submits an agreement to
the Secretary of State for his consideration, clause 216 requires it to
accompany the submission with a recommendation about how the agreement
should be implemented in schools. Clause 216 currently
requires that the recommendation must set out whether the agreement
should be ratified by the Secretary of State, which would require
schools to comply with the agreement, or should be one which schools
must &#147;have regard to&#148;. That is an important part of the
flexibility that I spoke about
earlier.</div><a name="09032759000520"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clauses
217 and 218 set out the Secretary of State&#146;s options if the
negotiating body&#146;s agreement is initially submitted to him with
a recommendation. They are, therefore, inextricably linked to clause
216. The amendments would deprive the body of the option of
recommending that the Secretary of State require schools to have regard
to the agreement submitted, thereby, in effect, imposing a duty on the
negotiating body to recommend that the Secretary of State make an order
ratifying the agreement. As a consequence of the amendments, the
Secretary of State would no longer be able to make an order requiring
schools to have regard to an agreement submitted by the negotiating
body.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column814" />Column number: 814</div><a name="09032759000521"></a><div class="hs_Para">At that stage
in the proceedings, he would be limited to either making an order
ratifying the agreement, or referring the agreement back to the
negotiating body for
consideration.</div><a name="09032759000522"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000995"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> On that specific point, under what circumstances
would the Secretary of State be likely to make the order in clause
216(2)(b)&#151;in other words,
to</div><a name="09032759000708"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;make
an order requiring persons specified in the recommendation to have
regard
to&#148;</div><a name="09032759000523"></a><div class="hs_Para">rather
than ratify the agreement?</div>
<a name="09032759000524"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000996"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> The negotiating body will be looking at a range of
different issues, from pay and conditions through to training.
Currently, such issues are negotiated through local government
arrangements. The current arrangements involve a certain number of
things that are applied locally; for example, around training matters.
The national agreement is something that local determination has regard
to. That is why we need
flexibility.</div><a name="09032759000525"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
negotiating body itself may have a view on what schools should have
regard to as opposed to what they must implement, but it is right to
withhold for the Secretary of State the ability also to decide, on the
recommendations of the negotiating body, what schools should have
regard to and what they should implement. It is that flexibility that
we are seeking to
achieve.</div><a name="09032759000526"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000997"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> Will the Minister give way one last
time?</div><a name="09032759000527"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000998"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> I will one last time, but then I must make
progress.</div><a name="09032759000528"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759000999"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for being so patient.
Can he clarify the Bill as it stands on that specific point? Does it,
in effect, simply maintain the status quo on flexibility, or does it
introduce an additional element of
flexibility?</div><a name="09032759000529"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759001000"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> As I understand it, the measure implements
additional flexibility to allow the Secretary of State to influence
things. While I understand the rationale behind my hon. Friend&#146;s
amendments and can see arguments both for and against requiring a body
to make such a recommendation, the amendments would not achieve the
desired
result.</div><a name="09032759000530"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
546 is not inextricably linked to those that I have just discussed.
Where the Secretary of State refers back to the negotiating body for
reconsideration of an agreement that it has previously submitted,
clause 220 provides the Secretary of State with a comprehensive and
appropriate range of options for taking forward those agreements, once
the negotiating body has resubmitted them. Where the negotiating body
submits an agreement to the Secretary of State following
reconsideration, the Secretary of State can make an order ratifying it
or requiring schools to have regard to it. However, if the Secretary of
State does not feel that it would be appropriate to do either of those
things, he can either refer the agreement back to the negotiating body
for further consideration, or, where there is an urgent need and
further conditions are met as laid down in clause 220(5), he can make
his own determination by order.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column815" />Column number: 815</div><a name="09032759000531"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
would remove the Secretary of State&#146;s power to do that. It is
not possible to say in advance what matters the negotiating body may be
asked to consider or under what circumstances schools may be required
to have regard to or to implement an agreement. It will be for the
Secretary of State to consider such matters very carefully at the time,
taking into account the nature and content of the agreement. To take
away that option from the Secretary of State would be unwise and
detrimental to schools, and it would severely limit flexibility, which
is more important than ever in the constantly changing working
environment in our schools. We are looking for the negotiating body
agreements to achieve national consistency alongside appropriate local
flexibility. I am aware that trade unions and employer representatives
expect that some of the agreements that they reach will be appropriate
for a &#147;have regard to&#148; order, and the amendment would
remove that
flexibility.</div><a name="09032759000532"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
summary, I know that trade unions are concerned that unless agreements
are presented as &#147;required to implement&#148; orders, schools
could ignore them, but there is no evidence that that will be the case.
If the Secretary of State makes an order requiring employers to
&#147;have regard to&#148; an agreement, all maintained schools and
local authorities would be expected to implement the agreement, unless
they can demonstrate a very good reason not to do so. With those
reassurances, I hope that my hon. Friend will withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="09032759000533"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759001001"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> The hon. Member for Gateshead, East and Washington,
West has received a detailed response from the Minister on the
important points that she has raised about a group of employees who do
a valuable job within our school and college system. Will the Minister
ensure that he informs the Committee if his judgment about the
significance of clause 216(2)(b) is incorrect in any way? He said that
he thought that it was the case that that provision, which the hon.
Lady is effectively seeking to delete, is introducing new flexibility
into the circumstances in relation to these
staff.</div><a name="09032759000534"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759001002"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> What I am referring to is the generality of the
system and the powers that the Secretary of State has in respect of
these clauses. The issue of &#147;have regard to&#148; has been the
subject of much discussion. My understanding is that the entirety of
these arrangements gives the Secretary of State a bit more power to
ensure that there is flexibility under the National Joint Council
arrangements.</div><a name="09032759000535"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759001003"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> Clearly, that is an important issue. It is
understandable that the employees and trade unions concerned will want
to scrutinise the Bill to understand whether it gives additional
flexibility that some people may welcome and think is sensible, or
additional flexibility that undercuts what may be considered to be
important employee rights. The perception of the significance of the
debate would be affected if it were the case that additional
flexibility was being introduced, as opposed to the Bill simply
maintaining, even in a different form, the existing degree of
flexibility. I am assuming that the Minister, who is normally extremely
well briefed on these matters, is correct. I know that, having made
that point, if anything that he said is not perfectly accurate, he will
draw it to the attention of the Committee so that we can take it up at
a later stage.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759001006"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I give the hon. Member for Brent, South an
opportunity to bring us up to date on what has happened in the last
quarter of an hour.</div>
<a name="09032759000545"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09032759001007"></a><b class="B">Ms
Dawn Butler</b> (Brent, South) (Lab): Thank you,
Mr. Chope. First, I should like to put on record my thanks
to the staff of the House for all their help today. There has been no
formal agreement on how far we are going to get today. In fact, the
provisional planning for the Committee, annexe 4, suggests that we
should be way ahead of where we are at the moment. We have spent a lot
of time discussing the Bill today and yesterday and we would like to
continue with the progress we are making.</div>
<a name="09032759000546"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759001008"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I hear what the hon. Lady says, but that is not
sufficient for me in the Chair. I have to make a judgment as to the
length of time for which I am going to suspend the Committee.
Obviously, as the hon. Lady may know, it would be theoretically
possible for this sitting to continue right through until all the
business that was scheduled under the programme motion to take place on
Tuesday has been completed. At the moment, under the programme motion,
five and a half hours are available on Tuesday, and earlier a proposal
was canvassed that the Committee would be able to sit until midnight on
Tuesday, thereby extending the period by another three and a half or
four hours or so.</div>
<a name="09032759000547"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are
talking about the possibility of eight hours&#146; business and the
hon. Lady has said that we have not made as much progress as she would
have liked. It 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column817" />Column number: 817</div>seems implicit in what she is saying that she is fearful that eight
hours will not be sufficient on Tuesday to cover all the ground, in
which case she is inferring that there is more than eight hours&#146;
business ahead of the Committee.</div>
<a name="09032759000548"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
co-Chairman, to whom I spoke before I volunteered to take over this
afternoon, said to me that she had never, as a Member of the
Chairmen&#146;s Panel, experienced a Committee where there was so
little co-operation with the Chairman. I expressed exactly the same
opinion to her and I now put it on record openly, because the
conventions of the House are that the Chairman is involved. If my
co-Chairman and I had known that the intention was that we should sit
until three o&#146;clock, I am sure that she would not have returned
to her constituency, as she has. Therefore, I am left in the situation
that I may be expected to do another 12 hours in the Chair, and I have
already been up since early this morning. I have been in the Chair for
eight hours&#151;we have had a few breaks, but they are in addition
to those hours. I feel&#151;maybe the hon. Lady does not wish to
inform me&#151;that I am entitled to know how long the Committee
intends to sit.</div>
<a name="09032759000549"></a><div class="hs_Para">That means
the hon. Lady either giving a time when she will be minded to move that
the Committee do adjourn, or an indication as to how far down the
amendment paper she wishes to go before she moves the adjournment
motion. I invite her to give me some more information because it is not
just me in this position. There are a lot of other people in the House,
as I have already pointed out. I would welcome her intervention so that
she can help a bit more.</div>
<a name="09032759000550"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759001009"></a>Ms
Butler:</b> I am not quite sure what you meant by your
reference to the Chairman&#146;s involvement, Mr. Chope,
but as I said, quite clearly, we would like to continue making progress
with the Bill. I thank you for your time in the Chair&#151;I think
you are doing an excellent job&#151;but I would like to continue the
Bill&#146;s progress.</div>
<a name="09032759000551"></a><div class="hs_Para">Further to
that, I am also not sure whether there is a formula for the times that
we break and the times that we sit, so you might want to clarify it,
Mr. Chope.</div>
<a name="09032759000552"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759001010"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Perhaps I can explain to the hon. Lady. As I
said before, it is open to the Committee to carry on sitting until the
whole Bill is completed and that might mean anything between eight and
12 hours more of sitting. If it is her wish to complete the
Committee&#146;s consideration of the Bill all in one sitting, it
means that she will be expecting me to stay in the Chair for another
eight or 12 hours. If that is her intention, or if that is in doubt, I
have to take that into account in making a judgment as to what is a
reasonable period for the Committee to be suspended. I invite the hon.
Lady to give a bit more information, otherwise, having regard to what
has happened up to now, I shall have to interpret what she is saying as
an indication that it may be the Government&#146;s intention to go
right through to the end of the business on the amendment
paper.</div>
<a name="09032759000553"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759001011"></a>Ms
Butler:</b> Thank you for that clarification, Mr.
Chope. I apologise for not being able to say what time we will finish,
but at the beginning of the Committee the hon. Member for South Holland
and The Deepings spoke for very long periods of time and not always to
the Bill. I was unable to say when he would stop talking, so I could
not say what time we would finish or even get to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column818" />Column number: 818</div>the clauses that we hoped to get to earlier on. We are ready to spend
the number of hours that we would have spent if we sat on Tuesday
deliberating the Bill. I do not think that there is a further eight
hours ahead, so we should be able to complete the Bill in less time
than that. Therefore, I should like us to continue making progress with
the
Bill.</div><a name="09032759000554"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759001012"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> On a point of order, Mr. Chope. We all
know why the sitting has been prolonged to this extent. It is to cover
up the Government&#146;s embarrassment for losing a series of their
own amendments through incompetence. What we are now experiencing is
Labour Members being put in detention. I am happy to continue
scrutinising the Bill, although the way in which the Government intend
to do that, given that we have a full day on Tuesday, is not very
rational, sensible or fair to you, Mr. Chope, or to all the
staff who have to stay here in order for the usual channels on the
Government side to make their political point. It would be more
sensible to continue with deliberations on Tuesday. However, if it is
the wish of the Government to continue to press this, we will be very
happy to go on scrutinising the Bill for as long as is necessary. We
are certainly not willing in any way to compromise on the scrutiny of
the Bill.</div>
<a name="09032759000555"></a><div class="hs_Para">If it is the
Government&#146;s intention to continue, it would be sensible,
Mr. Chope, for you to suspend this particular sitting for a
few hours to give you an opportunity to have a break and to ensure that
you are chairing the proceedings as they deserve to be chaired.
Moreover, it would ensure that those who speak from the Front Bench on
both sides are up to scratch with the matters they are having to
debate. Those outside this place who look at the proceedings will not
want to feel that we are scrutinising the Bill inadequately for
political reasons associated with the Government&#146;s embarrassment
yesterday morning. They will want to ensure that you, Mr.
Chope, and Committee members are able to do their job properly. We will
be better able to do that if we suspend the sitting for a period of
hours and then, if necessary, continue throughout
tomorrow.</div><a name="09032759000556"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759001013"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I do not know if anyone else wants to
contribute, but it seems from what the hon. Member for Brent, South has
just said that it is the intention of the Government to carry on this
sitting until we conclude the Bill. I will stand corrected if that is
not the correct interpretation. If that is the right interpretation, I
will consider for what length of period we should suspend the sitting.
I will sit down briefly to enable her to confirm or deny that that is
the intention of the
Government.</div><a name="09032759000557"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09032759001014"></a><b class="B">Mary
Creagh</b> (Wakefield) (Lab): From the point of view of Back
Benchers, Mr. Chope, I should like to say that many of us
have constituency engagements&#151;as I am sure is probably the case
for all hon. Members. If the Government intend to continue, as appears
to be the case, it might be a better use of our time to see how far we
can get during the next hour or two, and to review the situation then,
with the agreement of the usual channels. To go now, and then return at
6, 7 or 8 o&#146;clock, would cause more disruption for
me, given that I have child care responsibilities, than if I just got
on the Wakefield train at 6 o&#146;clock this morning. That hour is
rapidly approaching.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column819" />Column number: 819</div><a name="09032759000558"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759001015"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> Further to that point of order, Mr.
Chope. If Government Members are so keen to ensure that they are back
in their constituencies tomorrow, for child care and other
responsibilities, surely we should continue this sitting properly on
Tuesday. That would give us an entire day&#146;s sitting in which to
finish what little remains to be done. However, if the Government
intend to pursue their course, we are more than happy to remain, but it
would be sensible to have a suspension for a few hours, for the reasons
that I gave earlier.</div>
<a name="09032759000559"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759001016"></a>The
Chairman:</b> The hon. Member for Brent, South said that we
have not yet reached the point in the Bill at which the Government want
to begin on Tuesday. I am not privy to what that point is, but perhaps
it is where she wants to get to during the next hour or so. However,
unless I get some more information, I cannot identify that point nor
make a judgment about it. I take to heart the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
point about the need for people to address properly and with a clear
head the very important issues in the Bill. I do not know whether the
Minister wishes to comment on that. He needs to take into account the
fact that he and his ministerial team have been changing places during
the course of the day. We have now been sitting for well over 12 and a
half hours. We have made very good progress and have completed much of
the Bill. As far as I can tell, we have disposed of some 48 groups of
amendments, and a further 17 remain on the order paper. We have dealt
with 90 clauses, six schedules and about 85 Government
amendments. I would have thought it reasonable to say at some stage,
&#147;Well, the rest of the business can be dealt with on Tuesday, in
accordance with the programme motion.&#148; However, I am in the
Committee&#146;s hands, and unless I can get some more information, I
shall take it that the Committee&#146;s intention is that I should
sit in the Chair until the whole of our proceedings are
completed.</div>
<a name="09032759000560"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759001017"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> Mr. Chope, as I said earlier, I fully
appreciate the strain on you and the staff&#151;both parliamentary
and departmental&#151;who have been serving us so well. I am very
grateful to them for that. However, it would seem that only at this
time of day and night can we make good progress in our consideration of
the Bill. I certainly suggest that we finish this and the next part,
and then consider whether we have achieved good
progress.</div><a name="09032759000561"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759001018"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I am sorry, but I missed the Minister&#146;s
peroration.</div><a name="09032759000562"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759001019"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> I am suggesting that it might help the Committee
to complete parts 10 and 11 and then consider whether that progress is
sufficient. We will make a decision at that
point.</div><a name="09032759000563"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759001020"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> On a point of order, Mr. Chope. I am not
really satisfied with the Minister&#146;s proposal, especially given
that those parts of the Bill are incredibly important. They were very
controversial when we took evidence from outside bodies. We shall want
to give considerable scrutiny to those parts of the Bill, spending some
time on them. I am not convinced that we can do that in a short period.
I am happy to do it later this morning, but I suggest that a short
suspension would be helpful if the usual channels and the Government
insist on taking the matter further
today.</div>

point of order, Mr. Chope. One of the most helpful
contributions that the hon. Member for Yeovil has made was the one

several hours. He said that there is little in reality to fill an
entire day. That is helpful in terms of estimating how long this is
likely to take. I was interested to hear you, Mr. Chope,
suggest that it might take between eight and 12 hours. We seem largely
to be in the hands of the hon. Member for Yeovil as to how long the

by which we can expect to have made real progress, because, as my hon.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759001026"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> We are now debating a very important part of the
Bill, which concerns behaviour in schools. This is one of the problems
that parents and teachers raised with us many times. Poor behaviour in
our schools is one of the key reasons why teachers leave the teaching
profession. It is also a key reason why many people who might be
tempted to enter the teaching profession refuse to do so. Those people
know that in too many of our schools persistent low-level disruption is
the order of the day. We therefore need the provisions set out in
clause 229 to give teachers more powers, for example, to search pupils
for prohibited items.</div>
<a name="09032759000575"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause is
very restrictive on the items for which teachers are allowed to search.
For example, in proposed new section 550ZA of the Education Act 1996,
teachers are given powers to search for knives in subsection
(3)(a), offensive weapons in subsection (3)(b), alcohol in subsection
(3)(c), controlled drugs in subsection (3)(d) and a stolen article in
subsection (3)(e). That is a very prescriptive and exhaustive list.
What about other items? The hon. Member for Yeovil has pointed out
before that violent pornography does not seem to be listed. There may
be other items that the school has banned in its school rules and which
teachers should have the power to search for. Again that is not
provided for in this
clause.</div><a name="09032759000576"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
209 says that if the teacher has reasonable grounds for suspecting that
a pupil at the school may have an item that in the judgment of a member
of staff may present harm to other pupils, staff or teachers, that will
be regarded as grounds for the teacher to conduct a search. Amendment
337 says that in determining whether there are reasonable grounds under
subsection (1)(a), the member of staff may have access to any CCTV
footage that the school may have. That might seem an odd amendment but
there was a case reported in <i class="I">The Daily Telegraph</i> recently where
a teacher wanted to see CCTV footage of a classroom where poor
behaviour was recorded, but was refused access to it because of the
Human Rights Act. We have to make it clear that teachers have the right
to examine such
footage.</div><a name="09032759000577"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
353 says that any other item can also be searched for if, were it to
remain with a pupil or in his possession, it constitutes a risk of
imminent harm to the pupil or to other people. This issue was brought
up during the evidence sessions of the Committee by the representative
from the teaching unions. It is a very real concern that that power to
search seems to be missing from this important clause giving. Amendment
95 adds a sixth item to the five items that can be searched for under
subsection (3), namely any item that is prohibited by the rules of the
school. That is the most important amendment, because in some ways it
is not the item that is important but the fact that their child is
deliberately disobeying a school rule. Being able to enforce school
rules is probably even more important than confiscating the items
listed in subsection 3(e), because it is about the credibility of the
head teacher and the ability of teachers to maintain discipline in the
school. Unless they can do that, violence will break out in the school
and poor behaviour will proliferate not just within the school grounds,
but out in the community.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column822" />Column number: 822</div><a name="09032759000578"></a><div class="hs_Para">Teachers have
to be given real powers to tackle poor behaviour, because unless we
tackle poor behaviour in our schools, we will not see a rise in the
standard of education for schools, pupils or the country as a whole.
Ofsted reports that 43 per cent. of schools in this country are not
good enough. One of the key factors that renders them not good enough
is poor behaviour. Teachers say that they simply do not have the power
to instil discipline and good behaviour in our schools. One reason why
they do not have that power is a lack of credibility. We on the
Conservative Benches also believe strongly that head teachers should
have the power to exclude pupils without such decisions being
second-guessed by an independent appeals
panel.</div><a name="09032759000579"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
would be grateful if the Minister were to explain why the list of items
that can be searched for is so restrictive. Why is it confined to
knives, offensive weapons, alcohol, controlled drugs and stolen
articles, and why does it not apply to, for example, mobile phones,
computer games or pornography, which also should not be on the person
of a pupil at a school? During the evidence sessions with the Minister,
it appeared that one reason might be the Human Rights Act 1998 or other
legislation that protects the rights of a child in respect of
possession of such items. But if those items are banned by the school
rules, it should be perfectly within the legal right of schools to
confiscate and search for them, if they were included in the provision,
without contravening the Human Rights Act. Perhaps the fact that there
is no home-school contract signed by parents, students and the school
before the children enter the school is a reason why such action would
contravene other Acts of Parliament, if items beyond those listed here
were to be the subject of a search of a pupil. If that is so, the
answer&#151;again, this is Conservative policy&#151;is for a
home-school contract to be a condition of admission to a
school.</div><a name="09032759000580"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister has on many occasions expressed opposition to that policy, on
the grounds that, if a pupil has a particularly poor parent who refuses
to sign such an agreement, for whatever reason, that pupil should not
suffer as a consequence, but that would then be an issue for social
services and other departments to look into. If such clear evidence of
poor parenting were presented, it would be an early warning sign to the
social services department at the local authority that there was a
problem. Otherwise there is no reason why a parent would not sign an
agreement that simply says that the child, on entering the school, will
abide by the school rules. If the school rules say that certain items
are prohibited in the school, I see no reason why those items cannot be
searched for, within the provisions in the clause, by teachers, head
teachers or staff so authorised by the head
teacher.</div><a name="09032759000581"></a><div class="hs_Para">With
those few words, I look forward to hearing the Minister&#146;s
response to this first group of
amendments.</div><a name="09032759000582"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759001027"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> This is an important clause, as the hon. Gentleman
has explained. We think the amendments are valuable in seeking to
strike a sensible balance between the powers to search that a school
should have and the legitimate considerations about the confidentiality
of pupils&#146; items. In the clause, the Government give teachers
additional powers to search not only for weapons but for illegal drugs,
alcohol and stolen property.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column823" />Column number: 823</div><a name="09032759000742"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3.30
am</div><a name="09032759000583"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
understand that the Minister is trying to be helpful and to ensure that
instead of the existing restriction to weapons, specific provision is
made for drugs, alcohol and stolen property. However, there are some
problems, one of which is that as soon as Ministers put a specific list
such as this on the face of the Bill, head teachers, teachers,
governing bodies and local government will understandably conclude that
it is not reasonable for staff to search for items not included in the
list.</div><a name="09032759000584"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
know from our evidence sessions that a number of the teaching unions
are concerned about the effects of clause 229 and want it either
deleted or amended to take proper account of their considerations. They
understand that it is sometimes necessary to search in circumstances
where there may not only be a weapon. I suspect that it is already the
case&#151;the Minister will correct me, if I am wrong&#151;that
when they think it proper, head teachers routinely search for illegal
drugs, alcohol and even stolen property. However, by proscribing those
particular items, the Government are opening themselves up to the
accusation that they are leaving out a lot of items of great concern
for which head teachers, teachers and others, including governing
bodies, might legitimately expect that powers to search
exist.</div>
<a name="09032759000585"></a><div class="hs_Para">An
interesting exchange that I cannot cite, as I do not have the papers to
hand, took place involving one of the Conservative Committee members
during our evidence session. He challenged the notion that children
should automatically be presumed to have rights of protection in
relation to most or all of their property and the ability to search it.
He rightly pointed out that head teachers, teachers and governing
bodies are, to a large extent, in loco parentis when young people are
in school and that their responsibilities and powers ought therefore to
mirror in many ways the freedoms that parents have in the home
environment, particularly with regard to items that could endanger
either the child concerned or other children in the school.</div>
<a name="09032759000586"></a><div class="hs_Para">We had some
interesting exchanges about that matter in Committee on 10 March,
during an evidence session. I questioned the Under-Secretary of State
for Children, Schools and Families, the hon. Member for Portsmouth,
North about whether she intended under clause 229 to exclude powers to
search for hard pornography, which was mentioned earlier by the hon.
Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton. She was commendably direct
in saying&#151;I assume that she will confirm it today&#151;that
she has no intention of allowing it to be possible for head teachers,
teaching staff and governing bodies to search within a school, even for
hard pornography and, presumably, even if it is suggested that a pupil
not only possesses hard pornography but seeks to sell or market it in
some other way to other pupils. That leads us to the inescapable, but
somewhat bizarre, conclusion that a head teacher or a teacher wishing
to search pupils&#146; possessions or a locker, for an item such as
hard pornography would find that they were unable to do so. However,
presumably under the Bill, if a student were suspected of having
alcopops or cider in their locker, there would be powers for the head
teacher to search for that item. Most people outside this
place&#151;press comment has already been made about the
issue&#151;would be absolutely astonished that the Government intend
such action under clause 229.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column824" />Column number: 824</div><a name="09032759000587"></a><div class="hs_Para">By putting
such powers in the Bill in respect of items that it will be permissible
to search for, head teachers will conclude that, rather than expanding
the range of items that can be searched for, which seems to be the
intention of the Minister, it will be made more difficult for them to
exercise their judgment in determining which items should be searched
for when they pose a risk to other students in the school and
potentially individuals outside the school. It will create an extra
element of bureaucracy for teachers and head teachers when doing their
job.</div><a name="09032759000588"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
much respected John Dunford, the leader of the Association of School
and College Leaders, has been critical of many aspects of the Bill and
its degree of prescription. He said that additional burdens will make
it difficult for schools to discharge their responsibilities and that
it will make it particularly difficult for school leaders, who are a
critical resource. We have already dealt with the complaints that
Mr. Dunford is seriously worried about. Head teachers really
do not need additional burdens of bureaucracy or obligations. They fear
that the provisions will not only make schools a more dangerous place
for students, but will make the job of being a head teacher or even a
teacher much more
challenging.</div><a name="09032759000589"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
asked the Under-Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families,
the hon. Member for Portsmouth, North, about her response to the issue
of hard pornography and whether she would be willing for head teachers
and teachers not to have the power to search for it. She
replied:</div>
<a name="09032759000709"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It is
a choice between not making a prescriptive list covering absolutely
everything that you would not want schoolchildren to have and a
balanced power. We believe that the additional powers covering drugs,
alcohol and stolen goods are
appropriate.&#148;</div><a name="09032759000590"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
understand that a balance might be struck between the need to protect
to some extent the rights and freedoms of students and pupils, because
I am not sure that any of us wants to give a completely open-ended
power to schools to carry out a general trawl of all lockers on a
regular basis. It is sensible to have some regulations and guidance
within which head teachers and teachers have to operate. Surely the
risk from the Government&#146;s strategy is that, by specifying more
clearly than is currently the case what can be searched for and not
including some important items, they will make it difficult for head
teachers to do their jobs.</div>
<a name="09032759000591"></a><div class="hs_Para">I posed that
point to the Under-Secretary after she said that she is relaxed about
head teachers not being allowed to search for items such as hard
pornography. She
replied:</div><a name="09032759000710"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
have data suggesting that drugs, alcohol and stolen goods are in
schools, but we do not at this stage have evidence that there is a
significant problem with pornography being taken into schools. We can
extend powers further if a justifiable need occurs, but at this stage
we do not believe that that is
required.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official Report,

raises several concerns, the first of which is what the data show at
present and whether they are reliable. To my knowledge, the Committee
does not have access to the information to which the Minister has
referred about the extent to which drugs, alcohol and stolen goods are
a problem in schools, and the extent to which they are searched for and
seized. If there is such information and it compares those items with
hard pornography, can we see it, because it would be useful in making
our assessment?</div>

Laws:</b> Thank you, Mr. Chope. I would be
delighted if the hon. Lady were to make a speech on the issue later,
and I hope that she will indicate whether she supports the rather
extraordinary limitations that the Bill places on the power to search.
The provisions are not sensible and will amaze most people outside
Parliament and strike them as completely dotty, particularly as there
are powers to search for items that are far less dangerous. I think
that most head teachers agree with the majority of teaching unions that
the provisions are not
sensible.</div><a name="09032759000599"></a><div class="hs_Para">During
the evidence session on 10 March, the Minister

Q384.]</div><a name="09032759000600"></a><div class="hs_Para">Is it
really sensible to go about things in that way? The Minister suggests
that there is currently no evidence that hardcore pornography is a
problem, but we will discover whether that is the case when she
responds and tells us what the statistics show in that regard, as well
as whether they are reliable in relation to items such as drugs,
alcohol and stolen goods, for which there are no powers to search at
present.</div><a name="09032759000601"></a><div class="hs_Para">Is
it sensible not to include powers to search for hard-core pornography,
even if it is not currently considered to be a huge issue? Are we
really suggesting that we come back to legislate in yet another
Committee, take up the officials&#146; time and incur additional
expenditure simply to insert a power into the Bill that any sensible
person would believe that a head teacher should already have? It is
stunning and amazing that the Government do not believe that such a
power is
needed.</div><a name="09032759000602"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are also interesting questions about other items that are not covered
by the Bill. The Bill lists drugs, alcohol and stolen goods, and
mentions the existing definition of weapons. Will the Minister let us
know how the existing legislation currently defines weapons? That is
directly relevant to our amendments on the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column826" />Column number: 826</div>issue, because the provisions prescribe an inflexible list of items that
will inevitably exclude others, on which head teachers and teachers
should be allowed to make a judgment. There is a danger that we will
exclude some items that are not currently considered to be weapons but
that may be used as such in the future. That would not be
sensible.</div><a name="09032759000603"></a><div class="hs_Para">Youngsters
often have crazes; there was one a couple of years ago, for example,
that, rather than involving a hidden item, involved an activity that
was inspired by a media advert. The situation became quite dangerous,
and the practice was banned in many schools. There will be items that
fall outside the Bill&#146;s list that sensible head teachers,
governing bodies and staff will not want to be circulated in their
schools. It would therefore surely be appropriate for the Bill&#146;s
powers to be framed in such a way that we do not have to keep adding
new items. We should not treat head teachers, teachers and governors
like children; they are adults and responsible people who should be
allowed to make
judgments.</div><a name="09032759000604"></a><div class="hs_Para">During

why the Government had reached their
conclusion:</div><a name="09032759000712"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
are following the recommendations from Sir Alan Steer&#146;s report,

in the same evidence session, we heard further evidence on the issue
under cross-questioning by my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Dorset and
North Poole. She is insightful and well informed on the issue, and she
probed Ministers about Sir Alan Steer&#146;s report. Those
discussions made it clear that independent bodies have recommended that
there should be a more general power to search. If I have got that
wrong&#151;I do not want to waste the Committee&#146;s
time&#151;I hope the Minister will intervene on me immediately with
enthusiasm to prevent me from making any
errors.</div><a name="09032759000743"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3.45

it was true that Sir Alan Steer or others advising the Government
suggested that there should be a general power to search, it would be
odd that the Government had come forward with the specific proposals in
the Bill, which create the concerns that lead to the amendments in the
group. We need some further clarification on that, because when I
further asked the Minister for Schools and Learners about that issue on
10 March in the witness sessions for Ministers, there seemed to be a
great deal of uncertainty. I
said:</div><a name="09032759000713"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;You
will be aware that a couple of amendments have been tabled to clause
229 that do not give a general power to search, but that would widen
the power to cover items, for example, that threatened potential or
imminent harm to pupils; another Tory amendment refers to items banned
by the school. Presumably you have not taken any legal advice on
whether that would be an acceptable, wider power that would not have
the same implications as a general power. Perhaps you could answer that
last question before the two opening
questions.&#148;</div><a name="09032759000607"></a><div class="hs_Para">Interestingly,

clear explanation from the Minister today, particularly because as it
is relevant not only to this group of amendments, but to all those that
we will discuss under the clause. It will be useful to have a clear
explanation of why the Government have chosen to go down the course of
having the specific power that excludes some important items, rather
than a general power. Is it, for example, that the Government have been
told that were there to be a general power to search, it would
effectively be illegal because it would be in breach of
children&#146;s rights or human rights? The evidence given to the
Committee by the Ministers was not only unclear, but seemingly
contradictory to the Steer report in many respects, and seemingly
inaccurate&#151;although I believe that the Parliamentary
Under-Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families may have
corrected herself later. Unfortunately, I tore out a page from the
<i class="I">Official Report </i>for the Committee evidence session to use in

that the Minister will correct me enthusiastically if I am getting this
wrong.</div><a name="09032759000610"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
crucial issues that the amendments address are: why have the Government
chosen not to go for a general power of search, and if they decided not

power such as that contained in amendment 14, and in one of the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759001035"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I respect the right hon. Gentleman enormously, both
as a Minister and as an MP in my region, but I am sure that he would
not want others to read the proceedings of the Committee only to
discover that, for party or other reasons, he had cut off a debate that
was genuinely important. Frankly, even without the present background,
I would want to explore the clause in detail. The number of amendments
that have been tabled show that this is not an attempt at a long-winded
intervention. We are debating a serious matter.</div>
<a name="09032759000613"></a><div class="hs_Para">In deciding
whether amendment 209 and the others in this group are a sensible
solution to the problems, it is crucial to know whether the Government
have considered the possibility of having some sort of mid-way power
that sits between a general power to search&#151;that might be too
wide, although it seems that that is what Sir Alan Steer
recommended&#151;and a power to search involving proscription of the
type suggested by Ministers.</div>
<a name="09032759000614"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some of the
amendments in this group could be immensely useful to the Government
and might offer a way forward&#151;a sensible compromise. I wish to
comment on not only amendment 14, but some of the amendments tabled by
the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, to which he has
already spoken, and which are important and useful.</div>
<a name="09032759000615"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 209
is a proposal from the Conservative party to add a refinement to the
powers to be granted under clause 229. It allows for a power to search
when there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that</div>
<a name="09032759000715"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a pupil at the
school may have an item that, in the judgement of a member of staff,
may present harm to other pupils, staff or
teachers.&#148;</div><a name="09032759000616"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is precisely the sort of sensible compromise amendment that might be

are at a late hour&#151;or an early hour, depending on how one looks
at it&#151;and although the Minister may be tempted to give short
shrift to anything at the moment, I hope that we will hear a positive
response that not only sets out the reasons why the Government have
taken this course, but explains why a provision of this sort might not
be more sensible than the Government&#146;s proposal. The amendment
would ensure that the powers were not too widely defined, and thus
would not fall foul of a reasonable person&#146;s view of what powers
a head teacher or teacher should have, but would be not so narrowly
defined that sensible head teachers, governing bodies and teachers
would find that they were operating under totally barmy restrictions
that did not allow them to do their job properly. I would certainly be
willing to support that amendment if the hon. Gentleman was minded to
press it to a Division.</div>
<a name="09032759000618"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
337, which was also tabled by the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and
Littlehampton, would insert an additional condition in clause 229(2),
which deals with the powers that a member of staff may have to search a
pupil or pupils. The hon. Gentleman seeks to add the following
words:</div><a name="09032759000716"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In
determining whether there are reasonable grounds under subsection
(1)(a), the member of staff may have access to any CCTV footage that
the school may
have.&#148;</div><a name="09032759000619"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is a sensible proposal. It is a sad fact that many schools have CCTV
cameras. One would not have dreamed that it could happen, except in the
John Cleese film&#151;I have forgotten the title&#151;that starts
with a head teacher using a CCTV camera. Many schools now have CCTV
cameras and it would be sensible, given the importance of these items
and the risks involved, if the footage were allowed to be used.
Clarification would be useful of whether the powers to search are to be
based on evidence, rather than being general. I understand that the
concern about the general power relates to not just the legal issues
and human rights, but the power perhaps being abused by schools to
trawl lockers on a general basis and without evidence. This useful
amendment would indicate that there ought to be an evidential basis for
head teachers and teachers taking
action.</div><a name="09032759000620"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
353, which was also tabled by the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and
Littlehampton, is also useful. In proposed new subsection 550ZA(3),
which describes what are considered to be prohibited items, the
amendment would replace paragraph (c)
with</div><a name="09032759000717"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;any
other item which, if it were to remain with the pupil or in his
possession, may constitute a risk of imminent harm to the pupil himself
or to any other
person&#148;.</div><a name="09032759000621"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is similar to amendment 14, which stands in my name and that of my
colleagues who have been wise enough to charge me with speaking to
these provisions and therefore leave earlier. That amendment would add
another prohibited item to the list of items in proposed new subsection
(3):</div><a name="09032759000718"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;any
other article which the member of staff considers may cause potential
or imminent harm to the pupil or to
others.&#148;</div><a name="09032759000622"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
would address some of the concerns that I raised earlier. Unless my
memory is flawed&#151;as it may be at this time of the
morning&#151;the amendment was suggested to me by the National Union
of Teachers. It gave very helpful evidence to the Committee based on
its enormous experience in this area. It represents tens of thousands
of teachers across the country, and even some head teachers, and many
of those members would be faced 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column829" />Column number: 829</div>with the practical difficulties of implementing the narrow powers to
search contained in this clause. I hope that the Government will accept
something like either amendment 14 or amendment
353.</div><a name="09032759000623"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
90 takes another approach, which is also a sensible alternative. It was
tabled by the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, although
I do not know whether it was recommended by some wise person in the
world of education. <i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> Yes it
was&#151;the hon. Gentleman himself. The amendment would define which
items should be prohibited more narrowly through the use of a general
power to search, but more widely and sensibly than in the Bill. It does
so by stating very common-sensically&#151;if that is a
word&#151;that the head teacher and staff should have the power to
search for any other item that is prohibited by the published rules of
the school. That amendment is extremely sensible, and it would be very
odd if a head teacher or a teacher were not given such a
power.</div><a name="09032759000624"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
view&#151;we will hear from the Minister whether it is
accurate&#151;is that if we accepted either amendment 14 or amendment
353, or amendment 90&#151;which is coupled with amendment 95 on the
college sector&#151;we would have a far more pragmatic and realistic
power to search. With amendment 14 or amendment 353, the power would be
constrained to items that might cause potential or imminent harm, which
could include a far wider range of items than set out by the
Government, but would not be a general power to search, and the other
route that has been suggested, almost as an alternative to amendments
14 and 353, would simply base the power on the published rules of the
school.</div><a name="09032759000625"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
see no reasons why parents would not be extremely happy to know that,
were their child to bring in an item prohibited by that school or
college, the head teacher or another member of staff would have the
power to search for it. That seems extremely sensible, and in my view
it could get the Government around the problem of trying to deal with
the potential problems of a general power of search while ending up
with a list of items that is frankly incomplete. As the Minister has
been so constructive, thoughtful, patient and unhurried today, I hope
that she will give the issue and the amendments the consideration they
deserve.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759001036"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> Amendments 209, 353 and 14 would broaden the
scope of the clause to include items likely to cause harm, and
amendment 353 would also remove the specific reference to alcohol. I
understand why hon. Members want to widen the scope of the clause in
such a way, but I do not believe that to be necessary. The current
weapon-search powers, which the clause will re-enact, already enable
teachers to search for any article made or adapted for causing injury,
or intended by the person carrying it to be used to cause injury. That
covers much of what is proposed by the amendments with regard to items
causing harm to other pupils.</div>
<a name="09032759000627"></a><div class="hs_Para">Both alcohol
and illegal drugs were specified by Sir Alan Steer. He did recommend a
general search power when responding to a question from the hon. Member
for Yeovil, but he particularly highlighted alcohol, drugs and stolen
property.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759001037"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> The Minister has usefully corrected the evidence she
gave the Committee on a page of the report that I do not have&#151;in
fairness, she might have corrected it later in our proceedings. Will
she indicate why she has rejected the general power to search that Sir
Alan Steer
recommended?</div><a name="09032759000629"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759001038"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> I will get to that point if the hon.
Gentleman is patient and does not jump up to
intervene.</div><a name="09032759000630"></a><div class="hs_Para">Both
alcohol and illegal drugs were specified by Sir Alan Steer, following
consultation with fellow practitioners, as items used by pupils to harm
themselves. Both will be specified for the first time under the new
search powers, together with stolen property, which Sir Alan also
highlighted as an
issue.</div><a name="09032759000631"></a><div class="hs_Para">Items
contrary to a school&#146;s behaviour policy, as suggested by
amendments 90 and 95, were also included in Sir Alan&#146;s
recommendation on the extension of the search powers, and we considered
that when drafting the clause. I agree that we could have had a longer
list or a more general power, as the amendments suggest, but there are
clear reasons for not doing so. First, we want to ensure that any
potential interference in a pupil&#146;s rights under article 8 of
the European convention on human rights is reasonable and
proportionate. Secondly, alcohol, controlled drugs and stolen property
are the items that schools are most likely to want to search
for.</div>
<a name="09032759000632"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman asked me what data we had on that. In 2006-07, there were 400
permanent exclusions relating to drugs and alcohol and 210 permanent
exclusions for theft. Of the fixed-period exclusions recorded, 8,180
were related to drugs and alcohol and 9,440 to theft. Bullying data
from the longitudinal survey of young people in England tell us that 3
per cent. of 13 to 14-year-olds had been made to hand over money or
possessions to bullies in the previous 12 months. According to the Home
Office&#146;s 2006 crime survey, 9 per cent. of 10 to 17-year-olds
spoken to reported stealing something at school in the previous 12
months. In a survey of 1,500 teachers for the NUT published in 2008, 20
per cent. of respondents reported witnessing possession of drugs within
their school in the preceding year, and over 20 per cent. reported
witnessing the possession of an offensive weapon in the preceding
year.</div><a name="09032759000633"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman mentioned pornography, but we simply do not have
evidence that a power to search for pornography is needed. Schools can,
of course, search young people with their consent, and if pornography
is found, they have the power to confiscate it. His proposal would
allow search without consent.</div>
<a name="09032759000634"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759001039"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I apologise if I missed part of the
Minister&#146;s speech as I try to juggle these different amendments,
but did she refer a moment ago to evidence on the number of occasions
on which alcohol was searched for and found in schools in the past few
years?</div><a name="09032759000635"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759001040"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> The evidence I gave was of the number of
drug and alcohol-related permanent and fixed-period exclusions, and the
survey of teachers, which showed that 20 per cent. of respondents
reported witnessing possession of drugs within their school. By
limiting the scope of the clause to five specific items&#151;knives
and blades, offensive weapons, alcohol, illegal drugs 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column831" />Column number: 831</div>and stolen items&#151;we are confident that any breach of a
learner&#146;s right to privacy is in each case justifiable and
proportionate. These items are either potentially dangerous to other
pupils or the cause of serious disruption to the school. Furthermore,
schools and colleges are responsible for developing their own rules for
learner behaviour, and including items contrary to the behaviour policy
would leave learners open to personal interference in relation to any
item that a school or college might introduce within its rules. It
might be helpful if I tell the Committee what schools can and cannot do
in respect of their behaviour policy. They can make clear in their
rules and in communications to parents that certain items are
unacceptable, they can punish pupils who are found in possession of
such items and they have the power to discipline under the Education
and Inspections Act
2006.</div><a name="09032759000636"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759001041"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> How will schools find a child in possession of an
item prohibited by the school rules if they are not permitted to search
for them under the provisions of this
clause?</div><a name="09032759000637"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759001042"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> I am making the point that they have certain
powers without the power to search without consent. They can instruct a
pupil to turn out their pockets or bag. They can confiscate, retain or
destroy items if they find them. School and college staff need to be
clear about what they can and cannot search for, otherwise we risk
causing confusion and uncertainty. We will, of course, ensure that our
new guidance gives staff the clarity that they need to use the new
powers appropriately and professionally.</div>
<a name="09032759000638"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to
turn to amendment 337 because I wish to assure hon. Members that it
would be permissible under the Data Protection Act for school staff to
view CCTV footage to establish whether a pupil has brought a prohibited
item into school, so there is no need to specify that in the Bill. For
the avoidance of doubt we will make this clear in our revised guidance.
I hope that the hon. Gentlemen will not press their
amendments.</div><a name="09032759000639"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759001043"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I thank the Minister for giving a&#151;not
entirely&#151;full response to the Committee, particularly in the
light of the length of time for which she has had to lead for the
Government on the Bill in this sitting and the wide range of issues she
has had to deal with. She has been at all times extremely helpful to
the Committee. However, I still have a couple of concerns about the
Government&#146;s
position.</div><a name="09032759000640"></a><div class="hs_Para">First,
I am not clear&#151;again I apologise if I missed a part of the hon.
Lady&#146;s exposition&#151;why the Government have decided to go
down this route. My recollection from the Committee hearing when we
took evidence from the Minister&#151;and I confess I do not have the
relevant quote handy&#151;was that there was some indication that
there might be a legal concern about the general power to search, which
was why I questioned the Minister for Schools and Learners about this.
The hon. Lady did touch on the Government&#146;s reasons for making
the judgment, but she did not say whether this was primarily a legal
judgment, and whether she felt the Government might be open to
challenge if the power to search were too wide, or she was making her
judgment because she 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column832" />Column number: 832</div>thinks that the rights, freedoms, protections and privacy of youngsters
should be given as high a priority as possible and she thus wished to
constrain the number of proscribed items to the priority ones. I would
be grateful if she could clarify that, as it is obviously enormously
significant. I would also be grateful if she could confirm that there
is nothing in this particular group of Opposition amendments that would
be illegal. I ask because it seems to me that the amendments are so
obviously superior to the Government&#146;s position that I cannot
help but feel that the Minister must think that they might be perceived
to be illegal and thus that they would not stand up to the scrutiny
that exists in relation to human rights these days, which is admittedly
quite extensive. If that is the case, we need to know that here and
now.</div><a name="09032759000641"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
think that we are bound to return to this issue, either on Report or in
another place. We know that our noble Friends at the other end of the
corridor do a very thorough job of scrutinising Bills and that they
also have a great deal of legal expertise. I think that they will want
their debate to be informed by legal realities rather than the
instincts of a Minister. They will want to know the fundamental
objections to this different approach.</div>
<a name="09032759000642"></a><div class="hs_Para">My second
concern about the Minister&#146;s position relates to the evidence
that she is offering to the Committee. I am not aware that she cited
any particular statistics in relation to pornography, be it hard or
otherwise. I am not clear whether that was because there is a lack of
data on the subject, or because the data that exist indicate that there
have not been many occasions when these powers have been used. However,
I wonder if part of the reason why she is not able to cite any evidence
is that information on measures that she has discussed and referred to
in relation to other proscribed items is more likely to be collected by
schools and, potentially, local authorities. In other words, is it the
case that although pornography&#151;hard or soft&#151;is a very
serious matter, some head teachers might be seeking to deal with it in
a way that is well short of the types of sanctions that might trigger a
reporting process?</div>
<a name="09032759000643"></a><div class="hs_Para">When the
Minister cited evidence about the items that she selected for this
particular measure, I think that she indicated that, in relation to
drugs and alcohol, she was talking about permanent exclusions, although
I might be wrong and she may have referred to temporary
exclusions&#151;perhaps she will clarify that point. However, she was
certainly relying on exclusions as a proxy for the number of cases of
drug and alcohol abuse. It may be the case that that proxy is reliable
for capturing some sense of the scale of drug and alcohol problems, but
not for capturing some sense of the scale of the problems relating to
pornography. In fact, I might have misquoted the Minister, in which
case she may want to correct
me.</div><a name="09032759000644"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
think that the Minister also referred to evidence on school staff
witnessing drug incidents, so she was relying on data reported by staff
members. It may have been that the exclusions related to weapons. If
the Minister could confirm that that was the case, that would be
useful.</div>
<a name="09032759000645"></a><div class="hs_Para">My point
stands, however, because I am not quite sure that the evidential basis
that the Government are using is reliable. Also, I am unsure that what
we are not picking up from the statistics that the Minister cited is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column833" />Column number: 833</div>the propensity for particular prohibited items&#151;or, as it may be,
non-prohibited items&#151;to be identified by schools as
serious.</div>
<a name="09032759000646"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think that
I was mildly convinced by the Minister&#146;s comments about weapons.
I was not quick enough to write down precisely what she said, but she
appeared to indicate that the legislation relating to weapons is quite
widely drawn. Although I was trying to think of a way of catching her
out, it seemed to me that most of the items that sprang immediately
into my mind might be covered by the definition of
&#147;weapons&#148;. Having said that, given the risk of weaponry
developing in unexpected ways, I would want to reflect on that
definition before the later stages of the
Bill.</div><a name="09032759000647"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
I am afraid that I still cannot accept the Minister&#146;s judgment
that schools and head teachers should not be empowered to search for
soft or hard pornography. I repeat the point that in the media, in the
Chamber and among our constituents, there will be amazement that the
Government are prepared to pass legislation that prohibits a series of
items, including alcopops and cider, but that leaves teachers and head
teachers absolutely powerless to intervene when they think that hard
pornography is being marketed or spread throughout a school by a
student. That is a deeply irresponsible position for the Government to
take, and it will cause great concern among head teachers and governing
bodies throughout the
country.</div><a name="09032759000745"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.15

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759001044"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> I listened carefully to the hon. Member for Yeovil
and to the Minister. The latter recited the definition of a weapon. I
presume that I missed the citation, but I presume that she cited the
Prevention of Crime Act 1953&#151;the clause refers to its
definition of an offensive weapon. If my interpretation is right, she
gave quite a wide definition, as the hon. Gentleman said, to include
anything that would essentially cause injury&#151;the Minister used
those words&#151;but not necessarily cause harm.</div>
<a name="09032759000649"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
concerned about that because more things than items that could fall
within a definition of an offensive weapon can cause harm. Some things
may well, from what I heard of the Minister&#146;s
definition&#151;it sounded as though she said &#147;things like
poisons&#148;&#151;fall within a definition of an offensive weapon,
although it is not entirely clear to me as a layman. Items other than
pornography could be harmful to children in schools, such as violent
video games. Extreme violent video or computer games could well have
been banned by the school and they could clearly cause harm, especially
to young children. Teachers should be able to search for such things if
children are suspected of having them in their possession.</div>
<a name="09032759000650"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was not
convinced by the Minister&#146;s argument&#151;I suspect she was
not convinced either&#151;because she carefully used the phrase
&#147;cause injury&#148; and deliberately missed out the word
&#147;harm&#148;. I am therefore minded to press amendment 209 to a
Division. To remind the Committee, it refers to a situation in which a
teacher</div>
<a name="09032759000719"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;has reasonable
grounds for suspecting that a pupil at the school may have an item
that, in the judgement of a member of staff, may present harm to other
pupils, staff or teachers&#148;.</div>
<a name="09032759000651"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before
deciding definitively whether to press the amendment to a Division, I
should like to talk about what the Minister said when she responded to
the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column834" />Column number: 834</div>debate on amendment 90. She indicated that any item prohibited by the
published rules of a school should be the subject of a search if it is
suspected that a child has them in their possession. It seemed that she
ruled that out in her response to the later debate, despite the fact
that it was recommended by Sir Alan Steer, because it might not be
reasonable or proportionate to search for items such as mobile phones
that had been banned under the school rules under article 8 of the
European convention on human rights.</div>
<a name="09032759000652"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Home
Secretary referred to such situations when she said that some people
over-interpreted the Human Rights Act 1998. She said that people erred
on the side of caution&#151;jobsworths and others prevented people
from, say, holding events on the grounds that they might contravene the
Act. The Minister is falling into that trap by saying that giving
teachers the power to search for items that have been banned by the
school rules might contravene the 1998 Act or the convention. I find
that difficult to believe, so I should like look again at what she
said.</div>
<a name="09032759000653"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759001045"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> Is the hon. Gentleman hopeful that the Minister will
respond to some of the points that were raised, particularly about the
legal questions attendant to the proposed amendments and the
Government&#146;s attitude? It would be enormously helpful to us if
the Government put those on the record, not only so that we can make
judgments today, but on Report and when the Bill goes to another
place.</div>
<a name="09032759000654"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759001046"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes a valid point, but alas, I
am not hopeful&#151;and after seeing the Minister&#146;s
expression, I am even less hopeful. I would like to think about it
further and, perhaps, come back to the subject of whether school rules
can be enforced through search powers a little later. For the moment, I
would like to press amendment 209, regarding items that might cause
harm to pupils, staff or teachers, to a Division. Teachers should be
able to search for such items if they suspect that they are in the
possession of a pupil at the school.</div>

since we reassembled after the one-hour break for dinner and we have
been sitting continuously for over three hours since the last
refreshment break. I have been reflecting on the comments which
were  made following the short break which
concluded at 3 am  and was designed for discussion
through the usual  channels. Taking into account the
number of amendments  and clauses left to the Committee to
consider; the time 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column835" />Column number: 835</div>available to complete consideration under the decisions of the House on
the programme motion and of the Committee&#146;s programming
sub-committee; the imperative that the Chairman, members and staff
involved in supporting the Committee&#146;s work are entitled to
reasonable rest and refreshment to enable them to operate effectively;
and the lack of notice of this prolonged sitting, which has meant that
my co-Chairman is absent, that the <i class="I">Hansard </i>reporters and the
Refreshment Department have been unable to bring in substitutes, that
no staff were given notice of this, including the Clerks who have been
valiantly supporting the Committee since 9 o&#146;clock on Thursday
and considering the powers that I have as Chairman to suspend the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759001059"></a>Mr.
Simon:</b> On a point of order, Mr. Chope. I am
grateful for that clarification. I could not help noting that you did
not mention taking into account the desires expressed by Labour Front
and Back Benchers to make progress with the
Bill&#151;&#151;progress that was not aided by Opposition Members
taking more than an hour on the last group of amendments. Nor was it
expedited by your decision not to allow the Question to be put some
time into that hour. In the light of this very unusual suspension for a
very long period of time, which effectively denies us the opportunity
to sit through the night, and adjourning the sitting until the morning,
can you clarify the precedents for the decision, which is not in line
with the advice we received from the Clerk earlier in the
evening?</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759001060"></a>The
Chairman:</b> The hon. Gentleman raises a point of order of
which I can assure him I have taken account. I have also taken into
account all the comments of hon. Members, the amount of time that is
left for consideration of the items that have yet to be discussed on
our agenda and the desire expressed by some Members to carry on sitting
indefinitely. I have to take all those issues into account, including
precedents and the fact that we are in a completely new situation
without precedent, where it is possible&#151;&#151;I do not
know&#151;&#151;that the Committee will not take advantage of the
possibility of sitting on Tuesday so that proceedings will be
concertinaed into one very long sitting.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column836" />Column number: 836</div><a name="09032759000673"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Birmingham, Erdington may wish to reflect on the fact that
there was no need for people to be taken by surprise on this issue.
When I speak to my co-Chairman about it, I expect that she will be as
surprised as I am, and continue to be, that the fact that this was a
possibility was not shared with the Chair. If it had been shared, then
many of the problems that I addressed in my remarks, and the
conclusions I have reached, could have been avoided. The hon. Gentleman
said that we were not going to sit through the night. I am not going to
get into semantics, but many people would think that a virtually
continuous sitting from 8 pm after the one-hour break until
4.30 am is sitting into the night, although it may not be going right
through the night. I will not get involved in issues relating to
working time, because the Palace of Westminster is exempt from all
that, but I must take into account the sort of factors that lie behind
that type of legislation. I think we owe it, even if not to ourselves,
to the staff to have some reasonable consideration. Lots of short
breaks would not be sufficient if we face the prospect of another eight
or 10 hours of deliberation.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759001061"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> On a point of order, Mr. Chope. I do
not wish to delay things very much further. I understand what you are
saying and I appreciate the work the Clerks have done. I would
appreciate your advice as to whether the time of four hours is your
judgment or the advice of the Clerk.</div>
<a name="09032759000675"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759001062"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Ultimately, whether it is the Speaker, Deputy
Speaker or member of the Chairmen&#146;s Panel, the judgment is a
judgment of that person&#151;&#151;</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759001063"></a>Mr.
Simon:</b> On a point of order, Mr
Chope.</div><a name="09032759000677"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032759001064"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. I am answering one point of order. The
hon. Gentleman, who is a Minister, should know better than to interrupt
the Chair when he is responding to another point of order. That is the
sort of behaviour that should not be tolerated. I put it down to the
fact that people are suffering from fatigue.</div>
<a name="09032759000678"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are in an
unprecedented situation and I am making my judgment. If people disagree
with it, they are free to do so, but what they cannot do is challenge
the ruling of the Chair. Without further ado, I am going to suspend the
sitting until 8.15 am.</div>
