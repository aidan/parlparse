<H2><center>Standing Committee B</center></H2>
<H4><center>Tuesday 16 May 2000</center></H4>
<H4><center>(Morning)</center></H4>
<H4><center>[Mr. Humfrey Malins in the Chair]</center></H4>
<H3><center><A href="/pa/cm199900/cmbills/078/2000078.htm">Countryside and Rights of Way Bill</a></center></H3>
<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Damian Green </B>(Ashford): On a point of order, Mr. Malins. I wonder whether you can give me some guidance.

<P>
The Committee will be aware that, since we last met, a large raft of amendments has been tabled by the hon. Member for Pendle (Mr. Prentice), dealing with the subject of hunting with hounds. The Burns committee is sitting to investigate that important and controversial matter, and it would clearly be improper for this Committee to discuss those matters without having the deliberations of the Burns committee to hand.

<P>
Do the Ministers have anything to say to the Committee about the timing of our future deliberations? I am sure that they, too, would not wish our discussions to take place before the Burns committee had reached its conclusions. Debating this raft of amendments now might put in jeopardy the wildlife protection aspects of the Bill, which Opposition Members consider paramount. Have the Ministers made any approach about a new sittings motion?

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I have received no notice of a new sittings motion. This is not a point of order for the Chair, but the Minister might perhaps wish to respond to the hon. Gentleman.

<P>
<B>The Minister for the Environment </B>(Mr. Michael Meacher): I shall be happy to respond briefly to the point made by the hon. Member for Ashford (Mr. Green).

<P>
My understanding of the position accords entirely with the hon. Gentleman's view. The Government's position on the matter is very clear. We set up the Burns committee to examine the practical implications of banning hunting with dogs-for example, the effects of such a ban on pest control and on animal welfare. It is our view that we must wait for the conclusions of that inquiry before anyone-including the Government-decides what the next steps should be.

<P>
I also entirely concur with the hon. Gentleman about the importance of the remaining parts of the Bill and I am glad that he is keen to pursue those interests. The Government are equally keen to do so, and we do not want to create difficulties for the prime purpose of the Bill, which is to promote those interests.

<P>
<B>Mr. Nicholas Soames </B>(Mid-Sussex Further to that point of order, Mr. Malins. Having listened to the Minister for the Environment and to my hon. Friend the Member for Ashford, I wonder whether you can assist me. The amendments on hunting with hounds would drive a coach and horses through the Bill. We should need to make the most detailed and searching examination-line by line and word by word-of the amendments, if they were selected. What representations have you received as to the length of time that the Bill is to remain in Committee? If we were to debate all those amendments, we should be here until Christmas.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I have received no representations whatever on that point. As Chairman, I am neutral on the matter of time.

<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> Further to my point of order, Mr. Malins, may I say how grateful I am to the Minister for his response? Will he give the Committee some indication of the Government's attitude to the amendments? If he were to say that the Government were determined to reject-

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I appreciate that the hon. Gentleman is trying to make a point but it would be unwise to start debating the amendments now, or to seek the views of other members of the Committee.

<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown </B>(Cotswold): Further to that point of order, Mr. Malins. I have carefully studied the long title of the Bill, which refers to ``the protection of wildlife''. For the amendments to be in order, the long title should surely make specific reference to the prevention of hunting with hounds.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The Bill's long title is not the same as its scope. The issue for the Chairman is whether an amendment's subject matter falls within the Bill's scope, and whether the amendment is otherwise in order. Schedule 11 makes various amendments to part I of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, which deals with the protection of wildlife. Section 11 of the 1981 Act deals specifically with the prohibition of certain methods of killing or capturing wild animals, so I am satisfied that amendments relating to hunting wild mammals with dogs are within the Bill's scope. As they also meet the other rules of order, I have selected them for debate. Perhaps we can now make some progress.

<H4><center>Clause 58</center></H4>
<H4><center>Making of traffic regulation orders for purposes of conserving natural beauty, etc.</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 552, in page 33, line 20, leave out from ``the'' to second ``the'' in line 21 and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`purposes of nature conservation and heritage protection in.'<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to consider the following amendments: No. 553, in page 33, line 22, leave out from ``to'' to ``area'' in line 23 and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`nature conservation and heritage protection in the.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
No. 554, in page 33, line 23, leave out from ``including'' to end of line 25 and insert-
{**UF5**}
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(a) conserving its flora, fauna and geological and physiographical features, and

<P>
(b) preserving-<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(ii) any scheduled monument as defined by section 1(1) of the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979, or<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(iii) any other structure, work, site, garden or area which is of historic, architectural, traditional, artistic or archaeological interest.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> We regard making traffic regulation orders to conserve natural beauty as a central element of the Bill. The purpose of the amendments is to improve the clause's wording and provide a wider and more focused definition of the phrase ``natural beauty'' than that in subsection (2).

<P>
As we discovered in our previous sitting, the Government have taken to expropriating some of our amendments and turning them into Government amendments. We are not proud-in an attempt to improve the Bill, we are happy to do the Government's will without compensation. I am therefore slightly disappointed that the Government have not expropriated these amendments, which are largely drafting amendments and which, as I said, would make the provision all-embracing and clarify what is meant by the phrase ``natural beauty''.

<P>
Amendment No. 552 would insert the phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>purposes of nature conservation and heritage protection.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We think it important to add to the clause the concept of heritage protection, which, as the Minister will agree, should be preserved and enhanced.

<P>
Amendment No. 554 would apply the same principle by including in the clause not only the conservation of
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>flora, fauna and geological and physiographical features,<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
but any scheduled monument as defined in the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979, or any other structure or site
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>which is of historic, architectural, traditional, artistic or archaeological interest.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
The definitions are fairly wide, but they would clarify the clause's meaning, and could provide greater protection for a wider range of desirable features of the countryside. Therefore, I commend the amendments to the Committee.

<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> We are careful in our expropriation practices, with or without compensation, but in this case we decline the offer, and I shall explain why.

<P>
Clause 58 will add new section 22A to the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984. The amendments would enable traffic authorities to make orders to regulate vehicular traffic on unclassified roads throughout England and Wales to protect ancient monuments and other historic sites.

<P>
I note that the hon. Member for Ashford modelled his definition of heritage on the one that relates to exclusions and restriction of access in part I of the Bill. I recognise that provenance. The definition is very widely drawn-it would encompass almost any item or place of interest. Rights of way are public highways, and the aim of the Bill is to increase access overall. There would have to be extremely good reasons for us to widen powers for the control of traffic beyond those which we have already provided for nature conservation, which, in some cases, involves obligations under European legislation. We have seen no strong evidence that the powers suggested by the amendment are justified.

<P>
Existing powers cover the potential for damage by modern vehicles to the surface of ancient ways such as Roman roads. Traffic authorities are able to make traffic regulation orders to control traffic on any roads, including rights of way, for the purposes of preventing damage to the road, preserving its character-if it is especially suitable for walking or horse riding-or preserving or improving the amenities of the area.

<P>
As I have already said, the amendment would extend those powers far beyond the mere safeguarding of historic ways. The provisions in new section 22A implement commitments that were made by the Government following a review of damage caused to minor byways by motor vehicles. We are not convinced that any risk to historic sites is sufficient to justify further constraints on public access to highways that they have every right to use. I therefore ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Has the Minister investigated the procedure for implementing traffic regulation orders? It is extremely cumbersome. When I was a member of the Select Committee on the Environment, we carried out an inquiry in the course of which we visited the Peak District national park. We were told that the procedure for making traffic regulation orders is difficult, because objectors have a considerable amount of power to prevent an authority from doing so. At the time, four-wheel-drive vehicles were inflicting significant damage on the park-that is probably even more of a problem nowadays-and it was hard to deal with the matter by employing traffic regulation orders. Will the Minister investigate that, and write to me with information about how often such orders are used?

<P>

<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I shall be happy to do so. The hon. Gentleman will not be surprised to know that I do not have the statistics immediately to hand. Some three years ago, we carried out a review about streamlining the procedures. It is a question of balancing speed with public access.

<P>
I acknowledge the force of the hon. Gentleman's point. I will ensure that he receives a full reply, including the most recent figures on traffic regulation orders and the conclusions of our review on facilitating the procedures.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I thank the Minister for his generous reply and look forward to receiving the information.

<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I am slightly disappointed with the Minister's reply. If the definition is good enough for part I, it is probably good enough for part II. I am not sure that I recognise his distinction of the balance of advantage in promoting access in part I with protection of the various important natural and man-made features that we are discussing. However, following earlier exchanges this morning and the possibility that we shall be here for some time yet, I do not want to delay the Committee on this group of amendments, so I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<P>
<B>Mr. David Lepper </B>(Brighton, Pavilion): I beg to move amendment No. 583, in page 60, line 12, leave out ``footpath or bridleway`` and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`way shown in a definitive map and statement as a footpath, bridleway or restricted byway'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: Government amendments Nos. 527, 652 and 653.

<P>
No. 584, in page 60, line 32, after ``section'', insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>```definitive map and statement'' has the same meaning as in Part III of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981; and'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`, and ``restricted byway'' has the same meaning as in Part II of the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Lepper:</B> Amendments Nos. 583 and 584 deals with the Grimsell lane case in Derbyshire, which has been discussed at length in Committee. As we have discussed it previously, I shall be brief. I welcome the Government's amendments and hope that the Minister will be able to accept my amendments also. They are simple amendments to the Road Traffic Act 1988.

<P>
Amendment No. 583 would do two things. First, it would bring into section 34 of the 1988 Act ways shown on definitive maps as restricted byways. Secondly, it would change the application of the section from footpath or bridleway as defined in section 192 of that Act to ways shown as footpaths or bridleways on definitive maps. Amendment No. 584 is a technical amendment to define ``definitive map and statement'' which is not otherwise defined in the 1988 Act. I know that the amendments have the support of the Ramblers Association and the Open Spaces Society.

<P>
<B>Mr. James Paice </B>(South-East Cambridgeshire): This group of amendments includes not only the hon. Gentleman's two amendments, but some Government amendments, one of which started life as our amendment. The Government usurped it, which is fair enough, because they did not want to be seen to accept our amendment. It puts together some strange bedfellows, not least of which is that the hon. Member for Pendle is supporting his own party and the Minister.

<P>
As the hon. member for Brighton, Pavilion said, the matter goes back to the Grimsell case. Only last week the Under-Secretary referred to it in Committee and said that he was in the process of tabling amendments that day to improve the enforcement of traffic requirements under section 34 of the Road Traffic Act 1988. He stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The amendments dealing with the Grimsell case will create a rebuttable presumption that there where a definitive map shows, for example, a footpath, the way is to be treated as having only these rights. The same will apply to restricted byways.-[Official Report, Standing Committee B, 9 May 2000 c. 568.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am glad that Government amendment No. 527, which started life as our amendment, adds that. The Minister will have received advice, but I am worried. I have had sight of the correspondence from outside commentators in which they queried whether the Government amendments would achieve their stated objective. I agree. Mr. Graham Plumbe, who is a chartered surveyor and chartered arbitrator, has written to all Committee members on several occasions. He wrote, after the amendments were tabled:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I am however dismayed at the idea that amendment 652, which I take to be the promised change-<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
to which the Under-Secretary referred-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>is seen as the remedy. I assume that this is what was referred to by Mr. Mullin as ``improving the enforcement of traffic offences under section 34'' ... Amendment 652 is hopeless as an answer, as it is exactly because magistrates are not in a position to judge the true effect of ``prima facie evidence'' that is causing the problem. By way of example, many old bridleroads have appeared on commercial maps as ``cross roads'', a matter which has been the subject of extensive correspondence with the DETR and of reference to a valuable judgment known as Hollins v Oldham ... where the judge held that cross roads can be bridleways. It is arguments such as that which, taken together with a range of other evidence, have led to many RUPPS being confirmed as bridleways, in spite of such prima facie evidence to the contrary. The whole problem with section 34 lies in the fact that motorists can wave in front of the magistrate a few old maps ... and the magistrate is simply not equipped to examine the merits of such a complex civil law subject which normally takes a full scale inquiry, and an experienced inspector to resolve.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
In additional documentation that Mr. Plumbe sent to me, he wrote:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Magistrates have been declining to convict motorists who drive on bridleways, where the defence is offered that there is doubt whether rights are limited to bridleway rights, even though the way is shown on the Definitive Map as a bridleway.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That matter is directly relevant to the Government amendments. He continues:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The definition of bridleway under the-<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>assumes that there are ``no other rights``, this tag appearing in section 192 without qualification.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Mr. Plumbe is adamant about that. Judging by the general tenor of his remarks, he is well acquainted with the detail of rights of way legislation. He feels that the Government amendments are inadequate.

<P>
I have a copy of a letter that was sent by Sergeant 1445 Harwood, of Dronfield police station, to the hon. Member for North-East Derbyshire (Mr. Barnes), in whose constituency, I believe, the Grimsell lane case occurred. Sergeant Harwood was the police officer who dealt with the reported problems of motorised use. He was, he wrote,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the ``officer in the case'' in respect of Grimsell Lane, Holmesfield.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Incidentally, I have seen ``Grimsell'' spelled about five different ways, but its spelling is not crucial if I only say the name. Sergeant Harwood continued:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Schedule 8(5) rewrites section 34 of the Road Traffic Act, 1988. But does nothing to address the problems highlighted in the Grimsell Lane case at all. It merely closes a loophole in respect of vehicular classification.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That was the situation before the introduction of the Government amendments. He went on:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I would respectfully ask that you make representations to amend the current Bill, but I would suggest the following  The definition of bridleway needs to be tightened up. This could easily be achieved by amending section 192 of the Road Traffic Act, 1988 removing the words ``but no other''-<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
my understanding of the Grimsell case is that phrase was the key issue-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>and to do the same for ``restricted byway'' and cycle tracks''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I do not want to labour the point, and I do not say this simply to disagree with the Government, but it is important to bring those quotations to the Minister's attention. I hope that the Government's approach is right and the representations are wrong. There is widespread concern about how one should properly enforce rights of way legislation to deal with motorised users. Although we concur entirely with the spirit of the Minister's aims, it is clear that not everyone believes that he is achieving them in the intended manner.

<P>
I am delighted that the Minister has accepted our amendment by usurping it, but there is some doubt as to whether his other amendments, which seek to address the problem arising from the Grimsell case, will prove sufficient. I hope that he can reassure me, and those outside the House, that he is addressing the key problem: the possible existence of other rights to a bridleway, to which the three words ``but no other'' give rise.

<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> As was said, amendment No. 527, which was tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Pendle and members of the Opposition Front Bench, is identical to Government amendment No. 651, which no longer appears on the amendment paper. Amendment No. 527 would make it an offence to drive a mechanically propelled vehicle on a restricted byway. It would extend to restricted byways the amended version of section 34 of the Road Traffic Act 1988-contained in schedule 8-which makes it an offence to drive a mechanically propelled vehicle on a footpath, bridleway or any other land that is not a road. Currently, section 34 relates to a motor vehicle that is defined in section 185 of the 1988 Act as a mechanically propelled vehicle intended for, or adapted for, use on roads. This longer definition of a motor vehicle may not include vehicles such as quad bikes. Schedule 8 will ensure that such vehicles are included in the definition.

<P>
Given that we are discussing section 34 of the 1988 Act, I should like to clarify a point that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary correctly made during last Tuesday's debate on amendment No. 528, which was moved by the hon. Member for Ashford. My hon. Friend said that it is not currently possible to create, by implied or deemed dedication, a carriageway through long use of mechanically propelled vehicles. In fact, it may be possible to do so in limited certain circumstances-for example, on a private estate road. However, as my hon. Friend said, amendment No. 527 makes it an offence to drive on a restricted byway, and we do not believe that the exercising of restricted byway rights can give rise to dedication of a full carriageway.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Green:</B> Is the Minister saying that the deeming mechanism, as it were, cannot continue after the Bill has completed its legislative passage? Would it be impossible for that mechanism to continue where driving through occurs after the Bill's enactment?

<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I shall take advice on the matter, but my understanding is that we are talking about the existing problem of driving through, and not just in relation to the Bill. The question was raised whether it would be possible to create a carriageway, by an implied or deemed dedication, through long use by mechanically propelled vehicles. We originally thought that that would not be possible. We now believe that it will be, but in circumstances that are extremely unlikely to arise, for the reasons that I have already given.

<P>
Government Amendment No. 652 is designed to improve enforcement of section 34, and to address the famous Grimsell lane case to which my hon. Friend the Member for Brighton, Pavilion (Mr. Lepper) referred. Many people have complained that that case will encourage large numbers of motor bike riders, in particular, to believe that they may ride with impunity on bridleways and footpaths irrespective of whether there is any evidence that vehicular rights exist over them. That is because in that case the prosecution was obliged to prove beyond reasonable doubt that, over the way in question, which was shown on a definitive map as a bridleway, there were bridleway rights only. In other words, it had to prove the negative, that there were no vehicular rights. However, a careful reading of the judgment in the case reveals that the defendants produced substantial evidence of the existence of vehicular rights over the bridleway in question.

<P>
Government amendment No. 652, and the consequential amendment No. 653, will deter the abuse of ways shown on the definitive map as footpaths, bridleways or restricted byways. Amendment No. 652 will, for the purposes of a prosecution under section 34, create a presumption that, where a way is shown on a definitive map as a footpath, bridleway or restricted byway, it is to be treated as being a way of the type shown. For example, if it is shown as a footpath, it will be presumed to carry only a right of way on foot. However, the presumption will not be conclusive. It will be rebuttable by prima facie evidence to the contrary. For example, in the case of a restricted byway, a defendant will be able to replace the burden of proof on to the prosecution to show that it does not carry rights of way for mechanically propelled vehicles by producing prima facie evidence of such rights. If the defendant were unable to do that, there would be no requirement on the prosecution to prove that such rights did not exist. We have, therefore, transferred the liability-the onus of proof-on to the defendant, and removed the requirement for the prosecution to prove a negative. We believe that that will be effective.

<P>
<B>Mr. David Heath </B>(Somerton and Frome): My concern is the level of evidential burden that is suggested in relation to prima facie evidence. That is a very low test, as the Minister will realise. Is there a reason why the drafters of the amendment have used the concept of ``prima facie evidence'' rather than a more substantial test?

<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> The requirement to provide prima facie evidence of such rights will not, by itself, be conclusive. The burden of proof will lie with the defendant, who will have to provide such evidence prima facie, and it will then be for the court to make a judgment in the light of such evidence. A defendant will not have established his case simply by producing prima facie evidence. It will be a matter for debate in the court.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> I am not a lawyer, but the problem seems to be that, having produced some evidence, however slight, that could be taken as prima facie evidence of different use, we would be in the position of having to prove a negative. That is, as we have discussed, a difficult thing to do.

<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> If some evidence has been produced, there is, at least, a matter for discussion. The case will not automatically go against the defendant. My understanding is that it would still be for the court to decide, in the light of the evidence, whether it would be justifiable to allow the use of vehicles in such a case. That is an appropriate balance.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> In practice, the judge might find the defendant guilty, subject to proof that there was a vehicular right. The whole process of proving that right-advertisement, creation orders, a hearing by the Secretary of State-would have to be gone through. That is a cumbersome procedure. Is that a likely scenario?

<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I am receiving helpful advice, the force of which is not immediately clear. I am advised that it is unclear why, in cases relating to the use of footpaths and so on, we should depart from the general rule that the prosecution should prove its case beyond all reasonable doubt. I hope that that is clear.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> It is almost inevitable, in such cases, that there will be a dispute over whether there was a vehicular right. The procedure set out in the Bill will not deal with that problem. There will still be considerable confusion.

<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I do not believe so. The amendment will remove the requirement on the prosecution to prove a negative and place the onus of proof on the defendant. If the defendant can produce significant evidence that vehicular rights exist, the court should take it on board. The point about prima facie evidence is that the defendant must produce, at least, a minimum standard of evidence. It is for the court to judge whether that evidence justifies a view that vehicular rights exist. That introduces the flexibility of a court judgment into the matter.

<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> The last series of exchanges has been helpful. I hope that the Minister is right.

<P>
The creation of a restricted byway should be without prejudice to existing vehicular rights of way on that route. We discussed that issue in connection with an earlier clause. There will be many restricted byways, over which there are vehicular rights of way-it could be access for a farmer, for example. I am concerned at the way in which the Minister has gone about dealing with the Grimsell problem. Amendment No. 652 could create a loophole, allowing people to say that farmer Bloggs can drive his tractor up a particular track, so there must be a mechanical vehicular right of way.

<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I hope that I follow the hon. Gentleman's point. I think that he is referring to the evidence that he read in a letter.

<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> Not strictly, no.

<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I hope that it is relevant for me to say that it is not conclusive evidence for the definitive map to show that a way is a bridleway-in other words, that it carries only bridleway rights. That is less than is needed to establish a balance of probabilities. It is, therefore, unfair to require a defendant to show the non-existence of greater rights.

<P>
This is an extremely complex area. To my relatively simple mind, the real issue about Grimsell lane is that the prosecution was put in the unreasonable position of having to provide more evidence than is justified. It now puts the burden of proof on the defendant. In the light of that evidence the court must decide whether vehicular rights exist. That seems clear and reasonable and enables enough flexibility to take account of the evidence. One would expect the prosecution case to be rebuttable, and we are allowing for that to be taken fully into account.

<P>
Amendments Nos. 583 and 584 in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Brighton, Pavilion appear to prevent the offence under clause 34 from being committed in relation to footpaths, bridleways or restricted byways not shown on a definitive map. Furthermore, unless the intention is to put the burden of proof on the defendant to show vehicle rights of way on the balance of probabilities, as opposed to prima facie evidence-the point made by the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath)-the amendments seem designed to create a criminal sanction that prevents a person from exercising public vehicular rights merely because they had not been recorded on a definitive map. The definitive map does not do that in civil cases. Where, for example, it shows a footpath, that is without prejudice to higher rights.

<P>
I share the concerns that my hon. Friend the Member for Brighton, Pavilion and others have expressed about unlawful driving on footpaths and bridleways, but we are not convinced that it would be right to burden a person with a criminal record, simply because the public rights that he would otherwise be free to exercise had not been recorded on a definitive map or because he could not produce evidence on the balance of probabilities of those rights.

<P>
I hope that my hon. Friend will accept that Government amendment No. 652 goes a good part of the way to dealing with the problems that he and others have identified and that, for the reasons that I have given, he will seek to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> As the Minister has just accepted, the hon. Member for Brighton, Pavilion and Opposition Members have expressed concern about whether the Government amendments will produce the clarity that everybody seeks in the law regarding motorised vehicles. I simply want to ask the Minister if he will do us the courtesy, and he is a courteous gentleman, of looking at this again, because there is confusion and doubt over whether his approach will be sufficient. I am not a lawyer, so I am not in a position to argue the case too deeply, but, as legal experts tell us that the measure is inadequate, perhaps the Minister will agree to look at it again before Report and listen to what others say. If he still believes that he is right, so be it, but that would ensure that the matter was covered.

<P>

<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I am happy to offer that. We shall look at the letters that the hon. Gentleman quoted from people who clearly have a great deal of expertise in this complex area. I shall not give a commitment that we shall table an amendment or make any change in the Bill, but if, in the light of further discussion, we felt it necessary, clearly we would do so. However, I am happy to have a further serious look at it.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> In doing so, will the Minister also consider the conflict in relation to the procedure for making a right of way with vehicles, which revolves round this dispute? If there is a dispute, it is basically because everybody believes that the right is only a right on foot or a bridleway and somebody is trying to prove that there are vehicular rights. A highway authority would normally go through the proper procedure of allowing representations, appeals, advertising and, if necessary, a hearing by the Secretary of State. It would be wrong for a court to substitute that procedure with an order that a right of way had vehicular rights by proving somebody to be innocent or guilty.

<P>
I agree entirely with my hon. Friend the Member for South-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Paice) about this, and I am not convinced that the Government amendment will deal with the problem. I would therefore be grateful if the Minister would examine the whole procedure before the Bill is considered on Report.

<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I have undertaken to consider the making of traffic regulation orders. If there is uncertainty about whether there is, or is not, a vehicular right of way-which is another issue-it is for the courts to try to resolve the matter. There is a difference between that and the generality of how decisions are made in the first place. I am keen that the procedure should not be over-burdensome, over-bureaucratic or too difficult to implement. A balance of interests must be fully represented, but with no more bureaucracy than is strictly necessary.

<P>
(5) A highway authority (or in a National Park a National Park Authority) may by order (a ``traffic authorisation order'') declare that a carriageway which is not a made-up carriageway may be used by a mechanically propelled vehicle or mechanically propelled vehicles of any class specified in the order whether generally or on a particular occasion or occasions, at all times or at times on day or during periods so specified or in any other specified circumstances or subject to any specified conditions.

</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I shall be as brief as I can in asking my hon. Friend the Member for Pendle to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Section 34 of the Road Traffic Act 1988 makes it an offence to drive motor vehicles other than on roads, and the Bill will extend that provision to make it an offence for mechanically propelled vehicles to be driven other than on roads. However, the amendment would go far beyond the 1988 Act-so far, in fact, that it is questionable whether it falls within the scope of the long title of the Bill, which does not provide for the prohibition of vehicular use on highways. The scope of the amendment is so wide that it would apply as much in towns as in the countryside. That is because it would cover carriageways that are not made-up, irrespective of where they are situated or whether the highway in question is maintainable at public expense.

<P>
The amendment would prohibit vehicles from using private streets to which the public have access and which do not have a made-up carriageway. It would therefore deny access to premises on such private streets in towns and cities. Persons who use such a road may seek to use the defence that they have lawful authority, which means the permission of the owner. However, in many cases, ownership of private streets is unclear, which is often why they fell into a state of disrepair, or were never provided with a metalled surface.

<P>
The amendment would deny vehicular access to homes that were accessible only from publicly maintained highways that are not made-up carriageways-it provides for access only for agricultural purposes. Vehicular access for all other purposes would be illegal. A farmer would not, for example, be able to give permission to a scout group to camp on his land if the access was off such a highway.

<P>
I see that my hon. Friend the Member for Pendle is nodding-I think in agreement. I could say more, but in order to make progress I encourage him to withdraw the amendment. I do not think that it was intended to have the effect that I described.

<B>Mr. Gordon Prentice </B>(Pendle): I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

Schedule 8, as amended, agreed to.

<H4><center>Clause 60</center></H4>
<H4><center>Erection of stiles, etc.: needs of persons with mobility problems</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. David Heath:</B> I welcome the addition of the clause to the Bill, but I have two questions about the scope of the guidance that will be given to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>competent authorities as to matters to be taken into account.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
First, we have already discussed the position of a bridleway that was formerly a road used as a public path-Government amendments may be introduced at a later stage that will encourage their use by non-motor-driven vehicles, that is, horse-drawn carriages. That is of particular importance to disabled people-the requirement would enable them to use bridleways in a way that they might not otherwise be able to do. Stiles and gates can be an obstruction to such use. Would the authority be able to take that into account?

<P>
My second question involves the converse situation. Powys county council wrote to me suggesting that there is a need to reflect the needs of livestock management. Will the Minister give an assurance that authorities should take that into account?

<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I think that I can give the hon. Gentleman a positive answer to both those questions. I have already said that we are keen to promote the use of horse-drawn carriages. Our changes in the status of roads are designed to provide greater security and certainty in relation to the use of such vehicles. The hon. Gentleman's second question was about whether the guidance would include considerations of good or appropriate land management. I am sure that the answer to that is yes, but if it is not, or if any qualifications are necessary, I shall write to him.

<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<P>
Clause 60 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<H4><center>Clause 61</center></H4>
<H4><center>Reports on functions relating</center></H4>
to rights of way
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> Will the Minister give an assurance that the reports of the functions relating to rights of way will not duplicate reporting procedures that are already in place? I refer to some of the performance indicators within the ambit of the Audit Commission's best-value reporting procedure. It would be nonsense if authorities had to make several returns on one matter to different bodies in different places. Such duplication is in no one's interests. That returns me to the adequacy of local authority funding for that purpose, which we have already discussed. Such reporting must take into account the resources that are available.

<P>
I have a significant concern about funding that is hypothecated for that purpose, which will not be subject to the normal pressures of local authority funding, and which may become associated with other aspects of the principal authority's work. We have already discussed that matter. The Government appeared to be sympathetic to the view that local authorities should have adequate funding for such work. Has the Minister reflected on the matter further since that discussion, and could he share his thinking on the mechanism by which local authorities will be assured of the financial support that they need to do their job effectively?

<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> In answer to the hon. Gentleman's first point, our intention is to simplify-perhaps I should use the word ``amplify'', although I hope that our approach will be as simple and straightforward as possible-rather than to duplicate. The regulations will require local highway authorities to publish reports on the performance of their functions relating to rights of way. The prime example involves reports by local highways authorities on the implementation of their rights of way improvement plans. The regulations may describe the information that the reports should contain and the way in which they should be published.

<P>
The hon. Gentleman also asked about funding. I am not sure that this is the appropriate moment to discuss in detail the Bill's effect on local authority funding. I am not in a position to go beyond my recent comments on the matter. Our intention is to ensure that local authorities are properly funded. We have taken the view-somewhat differently from the previous Government-that if additional responsibilities are given to local authorities, it should not automatically be assumed that efficiencies can fund them: they need to be properly and reasonably funded. That remains our position. I am aware of the hon. Gentleman's concern that the Government should give more detailed information. I am sure that there will be an opportunity on Report to marshal a more up-to-date and fuller expression of our view about how local authorities will be funded to meet the obligations that the Bill will place on them. That will be done before the results of this year's spending review are known, which will not be until July.

<P>

<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I face the daunting prospect of speaking to a massive set of proposals, but I shall try to do so. I apologise to Committee members for the size and range of subjects that are involved. I have been advised that the only way in which we could amend the schedules is by using the approach that we have adopted. I shall try to assist the Committee by ensuring that we debate each item separately, and I hope that the matter will not become too muddled. I shall do my best to disaggregate it, and to respond to the relevant points.

<P>
I want to introduce the short new clause 16, and the rather long new schedule 4, which replace, revise and expand on the current clauses 49, 50 and 51, and schedules 6 and 7. The changes do not affect clause 52. I shall give a brief opening statement on the rationale behind the Government amendments and new clauses, and perhaps we can then move on to a wider debate on each of the points.

<P>
The revisions and additions to the Bill contained in the new schedule perform several functions. First, they refine the process of applications for public path orders and incorporate the procedures ralating to the determination by the Secretary of State and the National Assembly for Wales of appeals against councils' refusal to make or confirm orders following such applications.

<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
Secondly they give schools a right of application and appeal in relation to orders to stop up or divert rights of way in school grounds to protect pupils and staff from harm. Thirdly, they fulfil our commitment to enable rights of way to be diverted where necessary to protect sites of special scientific interest. For the first time, local authorities will have a power-albeit a limited one that we expect them to use only rarely-to divert ways carrying vehicular rights, because it would appear pointless to safeguard sensitive sites from walkers, horse-riders and cyclists while disregarding the potential effect of vehicles.

<P>
It made sense to amalgamate the provisions in one clause and one schedule because they amend the same parent statute-the Highways Act 1980. The procedures for making the different, new categories of public path orders follow the order-making process that has been tried and tested by local authorities. In all cases, there will be an opportunity for anyone with an interest to object to orders affecting rights of way, and for objections to receive proper consideration in a hearing or public inquiry.

<P>
We have sought to place sensible restrictions on who may apply for a public path diversion or extinguishment order. In our consultation paper ``Improving Rights of Way in England and Wales'' we explained that the reason for introducing such a measure was to overcome the difficulties experienced by land managers in obtaining diversions in the interest of efficient management of their business, even when there was no apparent detriment to the public interest. We decided that the right of application should be restricted to those with an economic interest in working the land.

<P>
We have also thought carefully about the limits to be placed on appeals. For example, there is no right of appeal against a council's refusal to make an order, if the applicant declines to enter into an agreement to pay the costs of the diversion or closure, or when a council has no power to make an order because another council's consent is required and is not forthcoming. That is consistent with existing legislation. When orders are needed to divert or close rights of way for reasons of school security, the school proprietor will be able to apply and to appeal against a council's refusal to make an order. That applies to all schools in the state and private sector.

<P>
The new powers for special extinguishment and diversion orders-for crime prevention in designated urban areas and in school grounds-and SSSI diversion orders require the order-making authority to take into account other ways of addressing the problem that the order would be expected to alleviate. The police authorities must be consulted for order in respect of urban crime prevention and to protect the safety of school staff and pupils. Account must also be taken of the extent to which orders would be made consistent with a local authority's statutory crime prevention strategy. Local highway authorities will only be allowed to make site of special scientific interest diversion orders on application from English Nature or the Countryside Council for Wales. That will ensure that a full assessment of the risk to the SSSI is made first.

<P>
Authorities must also consider whether a traffic regulation order would solve the problem and whether it would be more convenient for the public. The powers apply only to rights of way that are in, part of, next to or near a SSSI. The Secretary of State and the National Assembly for Wales will have reserve powers to make orders, irrespective of whether English Nature or the Countryside Council for Wales has made an application.

<P>
I have been speaking fairly generally, but I hope that I have spelt out the structural background to the amendment and the new clauses. I am sure that hon. Members will now want to debate the issues in more detail.

<P>
<B>Mr. David Heath:</B> I have a number of amendments to the new schedule in the group. I also have one new clause-new clause 12.

<P>
New clause 12 is partially covered by the Government's new schedule, which provides a facility for diversion in the case of SSSIs. However, new clause 12 also covers European sites, which are special protection areas, as designated under the EU directive on the conservation of wild birds, and special areas of conservation, as designated under the EU directive on habitats and species. Can the Minister account for that omission-if, indeed, there has been an omission-and say whether he would consider tabling an amendment to correct that omission, if those areas are not already covered? If we are to provide protection for sites of special scientific interest, we should make the provision comprehensive. Having established the principle in relation to SSSIs, we must extend it to the European sites.

<P>
My remaining amendments fall into two principal categories. The first group deals with the extraordinary issue of the designated urban area. It is not clear to me why, if we are to deal effectively with crime prevention matters, there should be a differentiation between urban and rural areas. The situation of a school in a village is no different from that of a school in a town. If there is a problem with potential or real criminal behaviour created by a right of way across the school grounds, it is surely right that that should be dealt with in precisely the same way in both areas. Why have the Government proposed a new schedule that will restrict the operative clauses to designated urban areas? Perhaps the term ``designated urban area'' will encompass any village, hamlet or collection of houses. In that case, it is a meaningless term. If not, speaking as a Member of Parliament for a very rural area, none of which would normally be considered to be urban in the sense that I suspect the clause intends, I object to that differentiation. I cannot see a reason for it and I ask the Minister to explain why it has been introduced into the new schedule and how it will be used. My amendments would expunge that area so that we have the more proper course of action, whereby each case is taken on its merits and, if the case has been made, examined on its merits.

<P>
My second group of amendments tests Ministers on their definition of the word ``school''. They have had recourse to the definition in the Education Act 1996. The difficulty with that definition is that it applies only to infant, primary and secondary schools, not to schools created for children of a lower age than the statutory age of entry into school. That means that we are in the extraordinary position of making a proposal for infant schools that will not apply to a nursery school or a pre-school playgroup registered with the local authority. That is perverse. One would have imagined that it would be more important to protect smaller children than those of statutory school age. I suspect that it is an act of omission rather than of commission.

<P>
Therefore, I have suggested here, however inadequately, that we should extend the provision to include nursery schools or pre-school playgroups, extend the reference to pupils to include children using the facilities of a nursery school or pre-school playgroup and extend the definitions-again I do not suggest that my definition is necessarily the best definition of a nursery school or pre-school playgroup-to show what is meant by those categories of school or playgroup, and what is meant by the proprietors, who are defined as the person or body of persons responsible for the management of a school, but are not defined in terms of these other issues.

<P>
That is an extendable concept. It could be suggested that youth clubs, opportunity playgroups and other vulnerable groups have equally been omitted. I do not want to include ever-extendable provision in the Bill, which contains other means of dealing with such matters. However, the Minister should explain why the provision is linked so tightly to the statutory school age. The right hon. Gentleman may wish to accept the amendments in principle and table an appropriate amendment on Report.

<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I shall make a few general points and then deal with one of the group of amendments in my name and that of my hon. Friends, leaving others to my hon. Friend the Member for South-East Cambridgeshire.

<P>
The general point is that Opposition Members, like many outside the Committee, support the principle of improving and, if I dare use the word, modernising the rights-of-way network. As we have said all along, we believe that some parts of the Bill are essential and important and many are not. This is one of the essential and important parts, because a decent and practical rights of way network is clearly an asset. The current position not only fails to live up to that aspiration, it encourages unnecessary and damaging friction between landowners and those who want to walk along footpaths. This is an important part of the Bill for the provision of increased access, but most people want a clearly marked, good and practical rights of way network relatively near the urban areas where 80 per cent. of the population lives. Much of our debate on access has covered the needs of a relatively small proportion of the population and increasing access is more important than anything that the Government have proposed in part I.

<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
The Government have had one stab at the problem and are now making a second, all-embracing attempt to get this important part of the Bill right. We welcome the fact that they have thereby admitted that their first attempt was not perfect. Significant improvements remain to be made and one problem that should be covered in this part of the Bill arises when there is a clash between the interest of access and the interest of nature conservation and wildlife protection. On the whole, the latter should prevail because other means of access can often be found, but damage to an area or species is often irreversible and permanent protection should be paramount. It is not yet clear that the Government have achieved that desirable end in its current formulation. I shall be interested to hear the Minister's comments, not least an affirmation that the Government believe that when those two desiderata clash, the protection of wildlife and area should come first.

<P>
Our amendments cover one of the issues to which the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome referred-the peculiar distinction that remains in the Government's recasting of the clauses and schedules between urban and rural areas. The amendments would remove references to designated urban areas with the necessary consequential changes and omissions. It is perverse to say that crime prevention that is necessary in urban areas is not necessary in rural areas also. Local highways authorities are given the power to stop up or divert footpaths and bridleways in the interests of preventing or reducing crimes that would otherwise disrupt the life of a community only in an urban area designated by the Secretary of State. I share the ambition of the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome that that designation should be loosely drawn, but, however loosely it is drawn, much of his constituency and mine would not be covered. People would find it odd that, under the Bill, crime prevention might be necessary in one area and unnecessary three miles away in the same local authority borough. That seems peculiar to me. I have not heard a convincing argument from the Government or their advisory agencies as to why the distinction should be made.

<P>
I should also like to question the peculiar concept of crimes that would otherwise disrupt the life of the community. I should be interested to hear the Home Secretary's views on the Government being more relaxed about crimes that do not disrupt the life of a community. Any crime disrupts the life of at least one member of the community-the victim. As Ministers will be aware, the knowledge of even a single crime, particularly in a small vllage or in outlying rural areas, is likely to spread the fear of crime, which affects and damages the quality of life in rural communities. I should be interested to hear the Minister's justification for having stricter anti-crime measures in urban than in rural areas, and his explanation as to why local authorities should not be worried about crimes that do not disrupt the life of the community as opposed to those that do. Neither type of crime-if there is any distinction-should be tolerated.

<P>
The Minister will know that one of the main complaints of people in rural areas is that law enforcement agencies pay them insufficient attention for good or bad reasons. People in rural areas feel that most of the policing effort goes into urban areas. They also feel that because of the extra difficulties of policing rural areas they are neglected. The Bill as drafted will reinforce the view that the Government care more about fighting crime in cities than they do about fighting crime in rural areas. I am sure that the Minister does not want to give that impression. I accept that he genuinely does not want to give that impression, rather than that he fears the political consequences of doing so. Therefore, I commend the amendments, which would make people in rural areas feel that they are receiving equality of treatment in the legislation rather than being treated like second-class citizens.

<P>

<B>Mr. David Kidney </B>(Stafford): I have a number of amendments in the grouping to which I would like to speak.

<P>
I will make one general remark at the beginning. I agree in part with the hon. Member for Ashford and his comments on the potential for clashes between different interests when we deal with creating, diverting or extinguishing existing rights of way. I am optimistic that, if the rights of way improvement plans are good and if there are local access forums that are successful in their work on an effective rights of way network, we will be able to design a network that will meet the needs of all the community.

<P>
My first amendment is (a). As presently drafted, the schedule allows an owner, unless they are the occupier of agricultural or other types of land, to apply to the local council to make an order to close or divert a footpath or bridleway. The local council must then deal with the application within a set time. I support the provision in principle. However, the schedule, if left unamended, leaves the modernisation of the rights of way system incomplete and unbalanced. Some people will be able to apply for some orders through a speedy process, others will have to apply for other orders through a slower process, and in some cases there will be no process at all. That may result in a net loss to the rights-of-way network, as a speedy process will allow some footpaths to be closed while a slower process will mean that new ones are created a lot later or never.

<P>
My proposal is not so narrow that creation orders would have to be sought as direct quid pro quo proposals for the closure of other paths. However, the amendment acknowledges that an owner, lessee or occupier who is applying for a closure will sometimes want also to apply for the creation of a substitute path. It would, therefore, allow concurrent path creation orders to be made.

<P>
The briefing supplied to hon. Members by the Countryside Agency shows that it sees the danger of the Bill as currently drafted. It believes that it could result in a net loss to the network and proposes the remedy of giving equal rights to all types of applicants and equal priority to applications for path creations, diversions and closures. The amendment does not go that far, and I hope that the Minister will see the justice and balance in the proposal for a new and speedier system for dealing with applications for creation orders.

<P>
Proposed amendments (e) and (t) to new schedule 4 would each add the following words:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>after consulting such persons as may be prescribed.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
They aim to ensure that councils shall not determine applications for public path extinguishment and diversion orders until they have consulted prescribed persons and bodies. Amendments (f) and (u) would allow councils 12 months rather than four months to determine applications for public path extinguishment and diversion orders. That accords with the 12-month requirement contained in section 53 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. I believe that it is a more reasonable time limit, bearing in mind that it is specified in the 1981 Act and that a huge backlog of undetermined applications is already in the pipeline. Amendment (a) would also provide a period of 12 months for determining applications for creation orders.

<P>
Amendments (o) and (ii) are paving amendments for amendment (oo). They deal with the procedure and framework for setting the criteria by which the Secretary of State will designate urban areas for the purposes of the special extinguishment and diversion orders that are allowed to be made on the grounds of preventing or reducing crime. Amendments (q) and (r) recognise that the owner, lessee or occupier will be the applicant, and would therefore ensure that references to such people in relation to their representations are not included.

<P>
Amendments (ee) and (ff) would introduce into the Bill new special diversion order procedure tests that are comparable with those which already appear in section 119 of the Highways Act 1980. They seek to ensure that the convenience to the public of the new route and the public enjoyment of the path are taken into account before it is diverted. Amendment (mm) would introduce the same test in respect of new SSSI diversion order. Amendment (nn) would make clear that inspection of the register of applications for new orders shall be free of charge.

<P>
Amendment (oo), my James Bond amendment, sets out the procedure for the Secretary of State's designation of urban areas for the crime prevention diversions. The new schedule currently states that the Secretary of State will designate such areas, but it does not say how he should do so. The Bill should set out a procedure to be followed in respect of designated urban areas where applications can be made for special extinguishment and diversion orders to prevent or reduce crime. The procedure that I have suggested would provide that designation can occur only when a local highway authority applies for such designation and sets out a system of public advertisement, consultation and objection. It would also limit the operation of the designation to a period of five years at a time.

<P>
My purpose in seeking to ensure that the Bill pins down the Secretary of State on how designation will occur is to ensure that paths are diverted or closed for crime prevention reasons only where a genuine problem exists. I take that to be a designation in crime hot-spots as opposed to a specific diversion on the merits of an individual case.

<P>
The schedule is a commendable effort to modernise the law but as other hon. Members have said, it is not quite right yet. I hope that the Minister will accept some of the amendments in a constructive spirit, as improvements to the Bill.

<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> I, too, welcome the general thrust of the new schedule and the wisdom of finding a simpler way of dealing with diversion and stopping-up. The difficulty-amounting almost to impossibility-of moving a right of way has long been a bone of contention in the countryside. The difficulty exists despite the fact that often change would be more logical from the point of view of farming and would provide better scenery for the walker.

<P>
Amendment (b) stands alone and would require consideration to be given to ancient monuments and other historical features. It is right that the councils should, in exercising their functions, consider the needs of agriculture and forestry and
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>flora, fauna and geological and physiographical features.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This is the first opportunity I have had to mention that it is not clear to me what physiographical means. I have tabled the amendment to make sure that it includes ancient monuments and the other features mentioned-monuments under section 1(1) of the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979 or
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>any other structure, work, site, garden or area which is of historic, architectural, traditional, artistic or archaeological interest.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Minister may say that the definition is too all-embracing, but I should like to be assured that the term ``physiographical'' covers those subject areas. I am advised that it is an odd word to have used in a Bill.

<P>
Secondly, a substantial bunch of amendments-(c), (d), (g), (k), (s), (x), (z), (cc), (dd), (gg), (kk) and (ll)-are all linked. They are not alternatives, but would all add the restricted byway to the list of ways that could be stopped up or diverted. At present, the possibility of diverting or stopping up restricted byways is limited to sites of special scientific interest. That seems odd to me and we would like restricted byways to be added to the other powers for stopping up and diversion. In particular, schools, which have been used as an example in relation to other amendments, are relevant in this context. An example arose in my constituency of a comprehensive school, which had once been a grammar and secondary modern on two adjoining sites, with a public footpath running between them. A few years ago it was decided that there was no option but to fence both sides of the footpath with highly expensive security fencing. Admittedly, that case involved a footpath, but if it had been a restricted byway, the only option for diverting it would have been to go through the whole procedure. I was a Minister in the then Department for Education at the time. It was decided that it was not possible to seek to divert it for security reasons. The county council would not have accepted that; ultimately, it lay across its land.

<P>
Under the Bill, there will be a power to seek to divert for security purposes if such a situation arises again. That is good and welcome. However, I do not follow the logic of being able to divert a footpath or bridleway for security purposes and the prevention of crime, but not a restricted byway. That some ways but not others might be stopped up seems totally illogical. A footpath can have only walkers on it but a byway can be used by walkers. If a school has a potential problem with walkers on a footpath, it can deal with it. If it has a potential problem with walkers on a restricted byway, it can do nothing. That seems illogical and inconsistent. It seems odd that restricted byways are covered, as the Minister rightly said, by SSSI protection, but not by other measures, including, notably, prevention of crime. I attach importance to SSSIs but still maintain that prevention of crime is more important than them; it is given lesser protection under the new schedule.

<P>
When the time comes, I would like to move the significant large group of amendments. I shall not read them out again. All of them seek to add restricted byways to footpaths and bridleways in the new schedule.

<P>
<B>Mr. Lepper:</B> I rise to speak on the relatively simple new clause 10, which proposes amendments to sections 116 and 118 of the Highways Act 1980. It deals with the role of magistrates in stopping up and diversion orders and would strengthen the standard procedures available for order making.

<P>
Section 116 of the 1980 Act enables a highway authority to apply to a magistrates court for an order to stop up or to divert any highway other than a trunk road or motorway. The procedure can be used for closing or diverting footpaths and bridleways. Despite the Secretary of State's current advice that the power should not be so used unless there is good reason-a standard order-making procedure is available instead-considerable use is made of section 116 for those purposes.

<P>
Organisations concerned with rights of way, especially the Ramblers Association and the Open Spaces Society, have long considered the involvement of magistrates courts in decisions on changes to the rights of way network to be an historical anomaly that should be removed. The new clause gives us an opportunity to do that.

<P>
It is usually volunteer footpath workers who must appear before the magistrates bench to make a case in respect of an order. Understandably, appearing before magistrates to make such a case is more intimidating than appearing before a public inquiry for people not used to such things. The wording of section 116 is arcane, often causing difficulties for magistrates when called upon to make judgments on orders.

<P>
The effect of new clause 10 is simple. It would add footpaths and bridleways to the list of highways that cannot be the subject of a section 116 application. It would enable an order-making authority to use section 118 of the Highways Act 1980, which provides for the extinguishment of footpaths and bridleways, to downgrade such rights of way, a sometimes useful measure that can currently be achieved only through the use of section 116.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I shall try to deal with each of the amendments in the order in which they appear on the selection list.

<P>
Amendment (a), tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Stafford (Mr. Kidney), would give people the right to apply to a local authority for an order under section 26 of the Highways Act 1980 to create a footpath or bridleway. I agree with my hon. Friend that local authorities should be more willing to consider using their current powers to create footpaths and bridleways by agreement with the landowner or by order. We are keen for gaps in the rights of way network to be filled and for local highway authorities to take a more proactive approach towards meeting modern day recreational needs.

<P>
We are not convinced that giving a person a right to apply for creation orders over someone else's land is the appropriate approach. In the consultation paper issued last year, we explained that it would not be appropriate for people to have an express statutory right to apply for creation orders. Highways exist for the wider public benefit, and we believe that responsible public authorities should determine whether-and if so, where and when-to initiate specific proposals for the creation of new highways. It is for them to decide whether a new footpath or bridleway is needed.

<P>
If it is not Jesuitical, I should add that, in some circumstances, my hon. Friend's amendment could run counter to the public interest. For example, a landowner who is keen to keep out the public might apply for new rights of way to be created on his neighbour's land-my hon. Friend gets the point immediately-and, after those rights have been created, he might apply for some or all of the rights of way on his own land to be extinguished on the grounds that the public no longer need them. It is not a good idea to risk tying up local authority resources in such cases, but I am sure that that was not my hon. Friend's intention.

<P>
<B>Mr. Kidney:</B> I am sure that my right hon. Friend hopes that I shall not press the amendment to a vote, but I want to ask him about the guidance that will be given to local authorities on their rights of way improvement plans and the work of the local access forums. Will my right hon. Friend's stated wish that local authorities should be more proactive in the use of their existing powers be turned into reality?

<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> Of course. The guidance will certainly press local authorities to be more proactive in the way that I have outlined. They will be expected to produce rights of way improvement plans and there will be an opportunity for people who live in the area, associations such as the Ramblers Association, and the Secretary of State to consider whether the plans are adequate. Therefore, local authorities will be under more pressure to ensure that rights of way network gaps are filled.

<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Stafford tabled amendments (e) and (t), which would require an authority to consult certain organisations to be prescribed by the Secretary of State before determining an application for a closure or diversion order. I agree that such consultations would be useful, but I am not convinced of the need or the desirability of adding an extra layer of statutory procedures. It is not so much the objective that is a problem, but that it is unnecessarily heavy handed. Local authorities can carry out informal consultations. Indeed, they are encouraged to do so in the good practice guidelines that were produced by the rights of way review committee chaired by my hon. Friend the Member for Burnley (Mr. Pike). It is better to rely on non-statutory guidance, which is easier to adjust in the light of experience. Authorities are required to serve notices on user groups and other prescribed organisations when they decide to make a public path order. To that extent, my hon. Friend's intention will probably be met.

<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
Amendments (f) and (t) relate to the period after the expiry when an applicant for a stopping-up or diversion order can apply to the Secretary of State for a direction that requires the relevant council to determine the application. My hon. Friend proposes to extend the period from four to 12 months. That is a matter of judgment. The period of 12 months applies to applications that are made under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 for orders that modify the definitive map. However, four months is an appropriate starting point as a period within which decisions on whether to make a closure or diversion order can be made. The issues that we are considering are substantially different from the complex task of assessing evidence that is submitted in support of an application for a definitive map order. In many cases, the authority might have to undertake additional research in old archives before it can decide whether there is sufficient evidence to justify adding a right of way to a map.

<P>
Did my hon. Friend refer to amendments (q) and (r)?

<P>
<B>Mr. Kidney:</B> I mentioned in passing that amendments (q) and (r) are drafting amendments to Government new schedule 4.

<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> In that case, I shall move on to amendments that establish a paving device.

<P>
Amendments (o) and (oo) would introduce an additional procedural layer into the process of considering whether a footpath or bridleway in an urban area should be closed or diverted to prevent or reduce high levels of crime. Again, I do not disagree with the objective, but the amendments are unnecessary. In designating those open areas in which the new powers are to be available, we shall consult widely with local authorities and other interested organisations. My Department will take the lead, but we shall work closely with Home Office colleagues and perhaps Government regional offices.

<P>
A key consideration is the extent to which the new powers will help in areas where high crime levels are undermining policies to tackle the problems of social exclusion. There are other circumstances in which there might be a case for closing or diverting a footpath to reduce persistent crime, such as when a footpath runs along the backs of houses and is less visible from the main street, which is the case with some footpaths in my constituency. Those factors will be considered when we decide in what circumstances the new powers will be available. However, no right of way will be closed or diverted without thorough scrutiny. In each case, the public's interest in reducing crime will have to be weighed against the interests of the public in keeping the right of way open for use. Anyone will be able to object to an order. If those objections are not withdrawn, an order cannot take effect unless confirmed by the Secretary of State after an inquiry. Substantial procedures are already in place. The Secretary of State would have to take account of not only the case for taking action to combat crime related to the use of the right of way in question, but the effect of closure or diversion on the land served by the path. We believe strongly that that balance of considerations needs to be preserved.

<P>
Amendments (ee), (ff) and (mm) seek to incorporate additional conditions to the making and confirming of diversion orders to protect SSSIs, to prevent crime in urban areas and to protect children and staff in schools-in other words, the general purpose of the new schedule. Some of the conditions in section 119 of the Highways Act 1980 are incorporated in the new provision relating to SSSI orders, but some are not. In framing the provisions, we have had to weigh the public interest of access with the public interest of protecting those important sites. That interest underlies all my responses to the amendments. In particular, where an SSSI has also been designated under the European Union habitats or birds directive, we have to allow for the possibility that it might not be possible to meet all the conditions set out in section 119 and to meet our obligations under those directives. Again, we must make a judgment. I have probably said enough, in what will be a long speech, to indicate that we have tried to build a degree of flexibility into the diversions provisions in new section 119B.

<P>
In amendment (nn), my hon. Friend the Member for Stafford would introduce the words ``free of charge'' into the requirement in new schedule 4 for councils to permit public access at all reasonable hours to the statutory registers of applications for orders to close and divert footpaths and bridleways. We intend that the registers should be available for inspection free of charge. However, the Freedom of Information Bill, presently before Parliament, may allow for charges to be made for access to those registers. We shall therefore consider the need for my hon. Friend's amendment in the light of that Bill.

<P>
Amendment (b), tabled by the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire would place a new duty on councils to have due regard to a wide range of heritage protection considerations in relation to the making of public path orders and public path creation agreements. I note that the Opposition have been ingenious in borrowing the wording of the amendment from clause 24; the hon. Member for Ashford referred to it earlier when he said that what is good enough for part I should be good enough for part II. However, they serve quite different purposes. It is a wide provision-I continue to say that, because it is expected of me, but it is true. It appears to include not only scheduled ancient monuments, which are the target of the amendment, but almost any other site that may be of interest.

<P>
I am grateful to my hon. Friends for alerting me to the potential question of how new footpaths or bridleways might affect historic sites so, with a view to considering carefully the need for such an amendment, I shall ask officials to investigate whether it would be a widespread problem for heritage protection. I hope, therefore, that the hon. Gentleman will not press it.

<P>
Amendment (c) would enable local authorities to close or divert vehicular rights of way to prevent crime in urban areas or to increase school security. The powers in new sections 118B and 119B of the Highways Act 1980 apply only to footpaths and bridleways because those have been identified as the principal cause of the problem in urban areas and schools, which the new powers are intended to address. In urban areas, criminal use of back alleys, either as escape routes or to gain access to houses, can be a particularly difficult problem to tackle. Those powers will help to do that. However, closing vehicular rights of way would not be justified because of the wider impact on people's ability to move freely within their local community and beyond it. We return to the question of balance. There are strong considerations on both sides. Similarly, the problems for schools arise mainly from people gaining access on foot. The new provisions have been framed to deal with those problems.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Paice:</B> The Minister says that most of the problems for schools are due to access on foot, but pedestrians can still use a restricted byway. Simply allowing a school to divert or stop up a footpath or bridleway does not prevent pedestrian access to a restricted byway along or through school grounds.

<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I accept that point, but it is a question of balance. How much weight does the hon. Gentleman give to diversions or closures, whatever the status of the path, in order to prevent crime? We have to look at the purposes that exist and decide whether, on balance, they are justified. We have tried to achieve a balance in the Bill. The amendments, however, go too far in one direction.

<P>
Amendments (d), (s), (kk) and (ll) give schools and land managers a right to apply to their local authority for vehicular rights of way to be closed or diverted. I am not certain how the amendments would help land managers because that right of application relates to the existing provisions in the Highway Act 1980, which enables local authorities to close or divert footpaths and bridleways. Local authorities have no powers to close or divert vehicular rights of way under these powers and no amendments have been tabled to give them such powers.

<P>
New clause 10, tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Brighton, Pavilion, would remove from the magistrates court its present powers under section 116 of the Highway Act 1980 to close or divert footpaths and bridleways. It would also enable a local authority when closing a bridleway under section 118 of the same Act to keep the way open as a footpath. My hon. Friend is right in saying that our consultation paper issued last year proposed removing from the magistrates court its powers to close rights of way. However, the proposal had a mixed response to put it euphemistically. Local authorities in particular were concerned that they would lose the flexibility essential to the overall management of their rights of way networks. We have therefore decided not to proceed with the proposal. Safeguards do exist in that notices of orders have to be served and published and, for example, users of the highway in question have a right to be heard by the magistrates court. In addition, parish councils have a power of veto and the court cannot divert a highway without the consent of all parties with a legal interest in the land over which the highway is to be diverted.

<P>
As to the second part of the new clause, an order is made under section 118 of the 1980 Act on the basis that the right of way in question is not needed for public use. For example, another right of way may serve the same purpose. However, if there is a bridleway which performs the same function as another bridleway, that will be open to people on foot as well. If there is a case for closing the first bridleway, it is not immediately clear why the right of way on foot should be saved.

<P>
The hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire wanted to know why the issues of crime prevention and schools do not apply to restricted byways in the same way as they do to SSSIs. In part, the new powers under the Bill are necessary to ensure that the United Kingdom can meet its obligations under the European habitats and birds directives. They are last-resort powers to prevent significant damage to sites of special scientific interest. Clearly, they would be incomplete if they did not apply to vehicular rights of way.

<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> The Minister has put the point the wrong way round. I did not suggest that the measure should not apply to sites of special scientific interest. I am all in favour of powers to protect SSSIs, but I wanted to highlight the fact that it is illogical for the measure to apply to them but not to be available for crime prevention and the protection of people.

<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I hear the hon. Gentleman's point, but our advice from the Department for Education and Employment and from the Home Office strongly suggests that the real risks for crime are only from footpaths and bridleways. With regard to schools, the advice of the Department for Education and Employment is that the main cause of the problem is footpaths. The provisions have been framed to deal with that, without removing higher rights, as far as possible. That is why the powers relate only to footpaths and bridleways.

<P>
Amendments (h), (v), (i), (j), (n), (w), (y) and (hh) would give powers to local authorities to make special extinguishment and special diversion orders affecting footpaths and bridleways in the interest of crime prevention, anywhere in England or Wales. The results of our consultation exercise showed serious concern about our proposals for stopping up and diverting public rights of way for crime prevention purposes. Seventy per cent. of respondents opposed them. That does not mean that they are wrong, but if on consultation seven out of 10 people disagree with a proposal, we should take account of that. That is why we thought carefully about where best to target the measures. There is a case, where offenders persistently take advantage of the opportunities offered for criminal activities by back alleyways in inner urban areas, for councils, with the support of residents, to have a power to close the rear access to properties. We expect the powers to be used to assist local regeneration and crime prevention measures. To ensure that the criteria are met, the areas where the powers will be available will first have to be designated by the Secretary of State.

<P>
Special extinguishment and special diversion orders would follow the procedures that already govern public path orders, which are widely acknowledged to be pretty fair and open. There will be an opportunity for anyone to object and provision for objections to be properly considered, if necessary at a public inquiry.

<P>
The hon. Members for Somerton and Frome and for Ashford said that the Government were favouring urban areas and that rural areas were not being given an equal opportunity. There is no case for the powers to apply beyond urban areas. According to Home Office statistics, in 1995 3.9 per cent. of households in rural areas were burgled, compared with 10.3 per cent. of those in inner-city areas and 6.3 per cent. of those in other urban areas. I understand that the hon. Member for Ashford would ask why, even if that is so, rural areas should not benefit from the same provisions. It is a question of targeting: we do not have the resources that we would all like to put into the police force. Risks of vandalism, burglary and vehicle-related theft were also lower for retail and manufacturing premises in rural locations. Burglary forms a smaller proportion of crime in rural areas than it does elsewhere. The fact is that the problems at which the Bill is aimed are hardly characteristic of rural areas. I am sure that offenders would not be deterred from gaining access to livestock or farmhouses by the closure of a public path or bridleway.

<P>
Hon. Members will be relieved to hear that amendment (l) will bring me to the end of my remarks. The amendment would extend the provisions in new sections 118B and 119B to the 1981 Act to cover nursery schools, nurseries and pre-school playgroups. The definition of schools contained in the Bill is taken from the Education Act 1996, which includes nursery schools; such schools are, therefore, already covered. We are sympathetic to the principle of extending provisions to nurseries and to pre-nursery-school playgroups, and I take the point made by the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome about problems of definition that are not covered by the Education Act. The hon. Gentleman has offered a definition, and I hope that he will accept that we need to consider it closely. Another issue must also be taken into account, as many playgroups will be situated in private houses or shared accommodation. We will need to consider carefully whether it will be possible to provide a close enough definition to ensure that the new powers of closure and diversion are not capable of use for purposes other than those that we intend.

<P>
<B>Mr. David Heath:</B> May I test the Minister on the definition taken from the Education Act 1996? I have the Act in front of me. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In this Act ``school'' means an educational institution which is outside the further education sector and the higher education sector and is an institution for providing-

<P>
(a) primary education

<P>
(b) secondary education, or

<P>
(c) both primary and secondary education.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It does not mention nursery education, which falls outside those categories. I am surprised at the Minister's assertion that the Bill would cover a school that provides only nursery education, as opposed to a primary school to which nursery classes are attached.

<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I commend the hon. Gentleman for his diligence and for having the appropriate page of the 1996 Act in front of him. Despite my conscientiousness in reading previous Acts of Parliament, I do not have it to hand. I shall consider his point and I accept that a definition of nursery school might also be needed. Indeed, I am making the point that definition is required for related institutions intended for the education of young children. We intend to consider that matter further, and we will, therefore, consider the amendment. I cannot promise that we will table similar amendments, but I assure the hon. Gentleman that we will consider the matter carefully. I hope that I have dealt with all the points that have been made.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> Will the right hon. Gentleman deal with new clause 12 before he sits down? It deals not only with SSSIs, which I accept are covered, but with European sites.

<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> Indeed, the hon. Gentleman also asked about European sites. There are differences between the new clause and the provisions of new schedule 4. His clause refers expressly to European sites, but we do not believe that such a reference is necessary, as all terrestrial sites in England and Wales that have been designated under the EU habitats and birds directive are also SSSIs. It is Government policy that any future sites designated under the directives or under the Ramsar convention on wetlands of international importance should be underpinned by SSSI notification.

<P>
I could say more, if the hon. Gentleman wished me to, about new clause 12. However, given the Committee's patience and the hon. Gentleman's forebearance, I shall not do so. I have said that we shall consider amending the Bill. I hope, therefore, that hon. Members will not press their amendments.

<P>

<B>Mr. Green:</B> First, I thank the Minister for the fullness of his response. I am grateful that he will further consider amendment (b) and the issues behind it.

<P>
The Minister's answer on the distinction between urban and rural areas was breathtakingly complacent. The Home Office figures that he cited show when the Government start caring about the use of legislative power to fight crime. The figure of 6.3 per cent. for urban areas suggests that it is worth making the provisions, but that, at 3.9 per cent., it is not worth making them for rural areas. The one in 25 people who have already been burgled in rural areas have it confirmed to them that the Government do not think it worth taking that measure to help them.

<P>
The Minister made a perfectly valid point about resources; everyone wants the police to have more money. Indeed, my local police superintendent said on Friday that it is extremely difficult to allocate resources in a constituency that has an urban area with concentrations of crime that is surrounded by a large rural area. However, the Bill seems to ignore the fact that it must be a relatively cheap way of tackling crime. It will not have an all-embracing effect but it will have beneficial effects at the margin. The Minister must admit that; otherwise he would not introduce it in urban areas.

<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I cannot let the hon. Gentleman get away with his characterisation of what I said. We are talking about the closure of public footpaths or bridleways. The question is whether that will have a significant impact and reduce crime in urban areas. Our judgment is that it would. That is why the provision is targeted on urban areas. However, I said that offenders in rural areas would not be deterred from access to livestock or farm houses because a public right of way had been closed. That is the difference. It is not a matter of resources.

<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> That explanation is slightly peculiar. I wonder why people will be discouraged in one configuration of buildings and not in another. The Government do not seem to have thought it through. In practical terms, if they believe that it would be useful in urban areas, it should be worth trying in rural areas, not least because, as we all know, effective crime prevention is a lot cheaper and a better use of public resources than attempting to clear up crime. Crime prevention is the best way to help communities.

<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> The Government seem wholly to have missed the fact that, because people used to walk to their farm jobs, rights of way go through countless farmyards. The Minister is wrong to suggest that people would burgle farm buildings even if those footpaths were not there. They would not have the excuse to do so, because there would be no public right of access to the farmsteads and buildings and the related machinery and equipment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> My hon. Friend is exactly right. The question is whether the legal and regular proximity of people to an area would make it more difficult for the criminally inclined to commit acts of crime. That must be true in rural as well as in urban areas. Apart from the practical consequences, the Minister is sending the most appalling signal to those who live in rural areas. There is clearly an argument on both sides about the effectiveness of the measure. By allowing the stopping up of rights of way in urban areas, the Government have come down on the side of caution. In rural areas, however, they have taken the opposite view. The Minister will live to regret that signal. I am deeply sorry that he has not accepted our amendments or those tabled by the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome.

<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> I, too, thank the Minister for his long and detailed response to the amendments, and I am grateful for his explanation of new clause 12. As for schools, I am pleased that he will reconsider the definitions to see whether they encompass the range of establishments that we want to include. I look forward to hearing about that. However, I agree with the hon. Member for Ashford that his explanation of so-called designated urban areas is unacceptable.

<P>
The Government's decision does not make sense. They have said that it is a serious matter when an incidence of crime is associated with a particular footpath in one part of the country, but that it is a less serious matter when it occurs in another part of the country. As there are not many burglaries in country areas, which are, of course, sparsely populated, they do not matter as much to the Government. That is not acceptable. The suggestion that the only crimes in rural areas are those associated with livestock or farm buildings is wrong. I got rid of the straw when I came into the Committee having arrived from Somerset yesterday, but some people who live in villages do not engage in agricultural activities although they do sometimes experience crime. Many of my constituents, some of whom I met on Friday in a meeting of neighbourhood watch schemes, are extremely worried about increasing crime in rural areas.

<P>
I agree with the Minister: the provision should be used sparingly. I also agree with those who made representations to him when we were considering the draft Bill. There is a fear that, if the measure is unrestricted, it could be used to extinguish many rights of way. None of us would want that to happen, but the Government's proposal includes tests to ensure that there is a genuine problem. It needs to be confirmed by the Secretary of State and the local police authority, and there is a range of options for appeal.

<P>
The proposal will not be used willy-nilly by local authorities to extinguish the rights of way network for which they are responsible just to satisfy the whims of local people. But if it is possible to have a significant effect on crime prevention, it cannot be right to apply the measure only in inner urban areas because the global level of crime in those areas is higher than the global level of crime in rural areas. It must be specific to the circumstances in which the footpath or bridleway is situated. If the police authority and the Secretary of State confirm that a diversion would have a significant effect in reducing crime, surely there should be provision for something to be done about it.

<P>
<B>Mr. Mark Todd </B>(South Derbyshire): I think I mentioned that a footpath runs adjacent to and through my property and goes on to a neighbouring farm. As someone who has been a victim of crime in that situation-the farmer co-operated with me in drawing police attention to my concerns-I share the hon. Gentleman's anxieties. Clearly, such powers should be applied only in extremis. However, there are instances-I am not saying that my case is one such instance-in which a footpath might be used as an access point for crime, either to an urban area from a rural area or within a rural area. The Government might give further consideration to that matter, which would reassure my constituents.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that intervention. Without wishing to sound unsympathetic, it might be inappropriate to create a diversion in the case that he cited. The circumstances in which that would be of major assistance would occur only in an inner city area, although we have yet to discover how that will be defined by the Secretary of State. We do not know whether the sleepy west-country town of Bristol will be considered to be an inner urban area-we can live in hope-but if Bristol, why not Bath? If Bath, why not Yeovil? Where will the line be drawn? We are talking about crime prevention and, if the circumstances are right, an appropriate provision should be made. I do not expect the criteria to be loosened in order to bring forward a proposal, but I do expect the criteria to be applied universally across the country. An artificial distinction should not be made between rural and urban areas.

<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes a balanced case, to which I have listened carefully. I repeat that, in preparing the Bill, we relied heavily on advice from the Home Office, which was that the threat exists mainly, if not overwhelmingly, in urban areas. Furthermore, the local authorities' response to the consultation paper was that the problem relates mainly to urban areas. I shall certainly reflect on what has been said and discuss the matter further with colleagues. I do not want to give the impression that I shall reach a different opinion, but I shall consider the matter further in the light of the strong representations that have been made.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> I am most grateful to the right hon. Gentleman. I had intended to press the amendment to a vote but, in the light of his remarks, I shall give him a week or two to cogitate on the issue, and we shall return to the matter on Report.

<P>
<B>Mr. Kidney:</B> I, too, thank the Minister for the fair and reasonable way in which he dealt at length with the amendments that I tabled. I am satisfied with his response. However, I want to pose one general question about the Government's strategy. The schedule creates some priority groups of people who may apply and priority orders that may be made. In the previous two contributions we heard some jockeying to get into the priority group. Why should an application to divert a right of way in an urban area in the interests of crime prevention have priority over a similar application in a rural area, or why should an application to divert a right of way have priority over an application to modify a definitive map? I am worried that we might create a two-tier system, which would be unjust. I know that my friends in local government would say that the problem could be managed if sufficient resources were made available. However, even if sufficient resources are available to local authorities, my right hon. Friend the Minister is, none the less, setting out new priorities for dealing with applications. Does that not create a two-tier system, which might seem to be unfair?

<P>

<B>Mr. Paice:</B> I thank the Minister for his reponse to amendment (b) to new schedule 4, which relates to ancient monuments, and look forward to the results of his further investigations. I want to respond in more depth to his remarks on our large group of amendments that extends the stopping up and diversionary powers to cover restricted byways and byways open to all traffic. In those, the Minister shot his own fox. [
Interruption.] I was under the impression that the Government think all foxes should be shot rather than hunted. The hon. Member for Somerton and Frome made the point that the Minister, in stating that the powers should be used sparingly, actually undermines the argument against wider powers. It may be that there will be few situations where, for example, a restricted byway produces a threat to a school or to law and order, but if there is only one such exmaple, surely a power should exist to deal with it. A school might feel it necessary to stop up or divert a restricted byway, but when it goes to a solicitor, he will tell it that it has no right to do so because the Government had decided it was not appropriate. However, if it is a footpath or a bridleway, it will have the right to do so. There is no logic in that.

<P>
The Minister asked what weight I would give the prevention of crime commensurate with all the other aspects of the Bill. I would give it extreme weight, especially where it relates to the safety of children, as it does in regard to schools. A comparison with what happened after the awful events of Dunblane is not unreasonable. The previous Government and the present Government went to unbelievable extremes to protect children. I will not start a debate on whether their action was right or wrong. However, the Government trampled over the civil rights of thousands of law-abiding gun owners in order to protect children. Whether that is right or wrong is not relevant to the debate, but it is an example of the Government putting the protection of children at the pinnacle of policy making. Here, however, the Government are not doing the same. Here, the Government say, ``To protect wildlife and SSSIs, we will put in a restricted byway, which can be moved or stopped, but there will be no power to stop or divert them in order to protect children.'' The Minister shakes his head, but that is the import of what he has said. He has claimed that there will not be many examples of schools where there is a restricted byway. That may be the case. But if there is only one, the Government stance on the protection of children in other respects seems to be at odds with their stance on this particular, relatively small issue. I do not understand why the Minister cannot accept the additions that we propose.

<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I did try to explain the answer to that point. We have received advice from the Department for Education and Employment that it is mainly footpaths that cause a problem. Obviously, that could be extended to restricted byways. As the hon. Gentleman knows, the Government have to weigh all considerations. The provisions are framed to deal with the requirement to protect children as far as possible without any removal of higher rights. The balance must be taken into account. We are targeting the main issue.

<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> The Minister says the DFEE has stated that it is mainly footpaths and byways that are concerned, but the use of the word ``mainly'' implies that it is not always. Therefore, there may be occasions where this is not the case. Given his quite proper intention expressed in his opening speech that the power be used sparingly, I cannot see why he will not allow the power to be used sparingly on the few occasions when it will be relevant to a bridleway. As to the consideration of balance that he raises, I repeat my previous example of the firearms legislation. There all concept of balance went out of the window and the Government went to extremes to protect the safety of children and other people. That is not the case in the Bill. We will wish to pursue at least one of the amendments to a vote.

<P>
<B>Mr. Lepper:</B> I note my right hon. Friend the Minister's comments on the response to consultation on issues raised in new clause 10. Our debates have shown that the users of footpaths have a keener sense of the practicalities and what is best for them than the highway authorities. However, in view of the Minister's comments I beg to seek leave to withdraw the amendments.
