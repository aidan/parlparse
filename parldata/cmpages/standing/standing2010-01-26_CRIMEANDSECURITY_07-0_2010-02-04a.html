148, in clause 14, page 30, line 7, after &#145;fingerprints&#146;,

footwear&#146;.</div><a name="10020449000009"></a><div class="hs_Para">Good
morning, Mr. Cook, and good morning to the other members of
the Committee. Amendment 148 is probing and relates to the destruction
of particular classes of data. It is designed to test the Government in
relation to the operation of proposed new section 64ZC of the Police
and Criminal Evidence Act 1984. Under PACE, there are powers to take
impressions of footwear among other things such as fingerprints, DNA
profiles and DNA samples. We touched on the issue of footwear. If
someone is wearing trainers, the impression from underneath them can be
relevant intelligence in cases of violent crime. I want to understand
why in other provisions, there are references to impressions of
footwear being destroyed within a particular time, but that does not
appear to apply in relation to new section 64ZC(3). Certainly new
section 64ZD(3) does refer to impressions of footwear. Is there any
inconsistency or is there a rational explanation? I suspect that there
is.</div><a name="10020449000010"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020449000236"></a>The
Minister for Policing, Crime and Counter-Terrorism (Mr.
David Hanson):</b> Good morning, Mr. Cook. I hope
that I can offer the hon. Gentleman a rational explanation of the
provisions. Clause 14 includes new section 64ZC of PACE, making
provision for the destruction of fingerprints and DNA profiles derived
from samples taken from persons subject to a control order. I hope that
this is the point of clarification he wanted. The amendment would
ensure that impressions of footwear taken from such individuals also
had to be destroyed. I can deal with that by saying to the hon.
Gentleman that there are currently no powers for impressions of
footwear to be taken from controlled persons under any legislation. As
there is no power to take them, there is no need for them to be
destroyed. I hope that is
helpful.</div><a name="10020449000011"></a>

and use of relevant physical data and DNA material under the Terrorism
Act 2000 as applicable to Scotland. Amendments 128  to 133
relate to the destruction regime for fingerprints and non-intimate
samples taken from controlled persons, amending the existing provision
in clauses 14 and 15 relating to the circumstances in which the
material does not have to be destroyed to cover cases in which the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020449000243"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> To summarise, the purpose of this group of
amendments is to ensure the destruction of the material either after
acquittal&#151;I have left a period of 12 months from the date of
acquittal&#151;or after a decision. The amendments would require the
destruction of the material within one year of the date of acquittal
or, if there has been no trial, after a reduced period, other than that
provided for in the Bill. Where there is an acquittal, or where there
is no trial, the material should be destroyed after a substantially
abbreviated period&#151;abbreviated in comparison with that in the
Bill.</div>
<a name="10020449000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is
public anxiety about the retention of material, although as I said in a
previous debate, I am not sure whether I agree with that public
anxiety. None the less, it exists, and the case for destruction is
responsive to it. The Bill probably enables the retention of material
for longer than is consistent with public judgment. As I said last
time, I reach a slightly different judgment, but that is probably
neither here nor there for these purposes. The public want this stuff
to be destroyed fairly promptly, and that is what I have tried to
provide for in the
amendments.</div>
<a name="10020449000028"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020449000244"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> In amendment 99, my right hon. and learned
Friend proposes removing the
words</div><a name="10020449000190"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;or
only one exempt
conviction&#148;</div><a name="10020449000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">from
new section 64ZD of PACE. He did not mention this specifically, but the
amendments raise an interesting and important point about the
provisions on exempt convictions&#151;those under which a recordable
offence is not a qualifying offence for the purposes of clause 7 if the
person is under the age of 18. Under those provisions, the DNA profile
of someone who has been convicted of an exempt offence is retained for
five years.</div>
<a name="10020449000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">A question
arises about the interrelationship between the regime in new section
64ZD and other regimes. Is the framing is right? Should the Bill refer
to someone 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column224" />Column number: 224</div>with an exempt conviction when the five-year period has expired? I can
understand that when someone has been subject to an exempt conviction,
as drawn by the Government&#146;s proposals, and the five-year period
has expired, another DNA sample may be required to create a DNA profile
that can be retained on the national DNA database. However, I am
concerned that the proposals will create a period of six years plus
five years and that top-up might lead to a very extended period. In
other words, a profile will already have been taken and put on the
national DNA database as a consequence of an exempt conviction,
triggering the five-year requirement.</div>
<a name="10020449000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">As we know,
however, there are duplications on the national DNA database. Someone
who has had their DNA taken may be arrested again. Should it be six
years plus five, or six years plus whatever the residual amount is? In
other words, when the original profile was taken it would normally
trigger the five-year requirement under the exempt conviction regime,
but if a subsequent arrest takes place it will then start a new
six-year period. That is my understanding. I want to test whether that
is the Government&#146;s
intention.</div><a name="10020449000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
see some logic in having an extended post-arrest period for certain
serious offences, following the lines of argument that we take in
relation to the treatment of the material. However, an 11-year period
seems extensive in such circumstances. The Government are deeming to
treat someone as having an exempt conviction&#151;in other words, a
young person who may have been subject to a recordable but not
qualifying offence, which is not in the category of serious offences. I
wish to understand the logic and interrelationship between the two
regimes.</div>
<a name="10020449000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">I turn to
amendment 68 and my right hon. and learned Friend&#146;s other
amendments. I understand his underlying desire that DNA samples from
those who are innocent and have not been convicted of any crime should
not be retained beyond a reasonable and proportionate period. Striking
that balance and making the right judgment is fundamental to our
debates on clause 14.</div>
<a name="10020449000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand
the concept of my right hon. and learned Friend&#146;s amendments,
which follow the basic principle of innocence before the law unless
guilt has been proven. It is, therefore, a question of putting
appropriate restrictions in place. I shall obviously listen carefully
to the Minister&#146;s
response.</div><a name="10020449000035"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020449000245"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> The amendments proposed by the right hon. and
learned Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham would make two specific
changes to the various retention categories set out in clause 14. As he
explained, they would remove references to exempt convictions, seeking
to clarify that an individual is unconvicted.</div>
<a name="10020449000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">To make it
clear, &#147;exempt conviction&#148; is defined in proposed new
section 64ZI(2)(b) of PACE, which is to be found on page 35 of the
Bill. It is a conviction for a single recordable but non-qualifying
offence committed by a person under the age of 18. In such cases,
fingerprints and DNA profiles would be retained for five years and then
destroyed. In answer to the hon. Member for Hornchurch, it is our
intention that the clock should be restarted; if necessary, we would
need to take and profile a fresh DNA sample. We recognise that although
young people may fall foul of the law, once they have been dealt with
by the criminal justice system they can become upstanding members of
the community.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column225" />Column number: 225</div><a name="10020449000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
difficulty&#151;I hope this will help the right hon. and learned
Gentleman&#151;is that the amendment would mean that if a DNA profile
had been derived from a child convicted of an exempt offence, which
would have been deleted after five years, and if that person was
subsequently re-arrested and a fresh DNA sample and fingerprints were
taken, they would not fall within the provisions of the limited
retention and destruction provisions of clause 14.</div>
<a name="10020449000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">Theoretically,
the impact of the amendment would be that the DNA profile and
fingerprints could be retained indefinitely, which I know is not the
intention of the right hon. and learned Gentleman. I hope that he will
reflect on that point and withdraw the amendment.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020449000246"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I hear what the Minister of State says. In my
response, I suggested that we should look outside the five-year period,
ensuring a right of retention beyond then. Is it custom and practice to
create a duplicate DNA profile in such circumstances? A DNA profile
would have been created in relation to the exempt conviction, so it
seems slightly odd that if a person was arrested for a second offence,
a DNA sample would be taken and a further DNA profile created. I wonder
whether there is duplication, given that it appears that there is an
interrelationship between the two. I would be interested to know if
that is the practice or the intention of the
clause.</div><a name="10020449000211"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.15

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020449000247"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> I shall return to that point in a moment, because
I want to ensure that we receive proper advice on the practice
regarding those matters.</div>
<a name="10020449000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">I turn to
amendments 68, 81, 85 and 75. I can see already, from our discussions
this morning, that there is an element of complexity around the content
of clause 14, which will set out whether the biometric data of those
people who have not been convicted of an offence should be retained
and, if so, for how long. I believe that the amendments seek to clarify
the definitions in clause 14 in respect of persons who have not been
convicted.</div>
<a name="10020449000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
the right hon. and learned Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham will
recognise that the amendments are unnecessary, for the reasons that I
will give in a moment. The proposals, as drafted, set out the
circumstances in which a person will be regarded as not having been
convicted of an offence. Those circumstances include whether the person
has had any previous convictions and their age at the time of the
alleged offence, and it does not matter at what stage the arrest or
charge was dropped.</div>
<a name="10020449000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
references the amendments make to related offences are also
unnecessary, because if a person has not been convicted the provisions
of clause 14 will apply once they are convicted, as long as the
conviction is not exempt, as I described earlier. Clause 14 will not
apply, and their DNA and fingerprints will be retained
indefinitely.</div><a name="10020449000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
recognise that that is a very complex explanation, Mr. Cook,
but I assure you that it will read well in <i class="I">Hansard</i> in due

<i class="I">Hansard</i>, with the view that it will clarify what he has said.
Well, I am not being rude to the Minister on this point, but I am bound
to say
that&#151;<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Laughter.</i><i class="I">]</i></div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020449000249"></a>Mr.

made to the right hon. and learned Gentleman is perfectly clear. I have
read my response to his amendments exactly as I have been advised. On
reflection, it will be even clearer in

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020449000250"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> Let me put it like this. As the Minister read his
response to the amendments, I found it pretty dense. That is not a
criticism of him; he himself said that this was pretty complicated
stuff, and complicated stuff it is. What I propose to do is to read his
response in <i class="I">Hansard</i> and reflect upon it. Although I shall
withdraw my amendments, perhaps through you, Mr. Cook, I
might communicate to those who have responsibility for the Report stage
that I am withdrawing my amendments in order to reflect on the printed
word.</div>

welcome to have the speaking notes that were prepared for me to respond

wishes.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020449000252"></a>Mr.

the printed word, with a view to considering whether we should bring
the amendment back on Report, if it is selected.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020449000255"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> We come to one of the key debates on the
Bill, on the retention of the DNA of persons who have not been
convicted of any offence and the judgment that might need to be applied
in connection with such retention. I shall comment on the background to
the clause, the rationale for amendment 26, and the context&#151;the
significance of the DNA database.</div>
<a name="10020449000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is
little doubt about the importance of DNA as an evidential tool in
prosecutions and in bringing crimes to justice. DNA data can form an
important part of the evidential case for guilt and can ensure that
serious criminals are brought to justice. I think that the Committee
agrees about that. Notable cases have been successfully prosecuted with
the assistance of DNA evidence, and that is right and
proper.</div><a name="10020449000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
fight against crime&#151;particularly organised crime, terrorism and
crimes of violence&#151;depends on the use of scientific, modern
techniques of investigation and identification. The DNA database and
the use of DNA for those purposes should be welcomed. However, a
balance is needed, and that was at the heart of the judgment in the
case of S and Marper before the European Court of Human Rights. In some
ways that led to the Government&#146;s introducing the
provisions.</div>
<a name="10020449000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Court
noted that basic
freedoms</div><a name="10020449000192"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;would
be unacceptably weakened if the use of modern scientific techniques in
the criminal-justice system were allowed at any cost and without
carefully balancing the potential benefits of the extensive use of such
techniques against important private-life interests.&#148;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column230" />Column number: 230</div><a name="10020449000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">We take a different view
from the Government about where the balance should be struck, and that
is what frames the debate. It is about the relative merits, the
judgments, and the relevant evidence. I look forward to hearing the
Minister of State&#146;s s thoughts on
that.</div><a name="10020449000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is a potential conflict between the need to protect individual liberty
and the need to provide collective safety against crime, acts of
violence and terrorism within the framework of the operation of
law&#151;in this case, the European convention on human rights.
Because, proportionately, this country has the largest DNA database in
the world, and we claim a lead in the use of the technology, which is a
positive thing, we bear a greater responsibility to achieve in its use
the right balance between the promotion of the wider public interest
and safety and the protection of the important private life interests
that are central to the debate.</div>
<a name="10020449000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">The number of
profiles stored on the DNA database by police forces in England and
Wales has now topped 10 per cent. of the population. More than 5.5
million individual profiles are held on the national DNA database by
police forces in England and Wales, and that amounts to more than one
in 10 of the population. The database continues to grow at an
exceptional rate. In November 2009 alone, 32,467 profiles were added.
Yet despite that growth, the proportion of crimes detected using DNA
has fallen. The figure two years ago was 0.76 per cent. and last year
it was 0.67 per cent. The argument that indefinitely retaining more and
more profiles will lead to a proportionate increase in detection of
crimes does not seem to be borne out by statistics. In recent years,
the rate has been relatively static, showing a slight fall, rather than
increasing, despite the number of profiles that have been added, and
the approach that has been taken to date of retaining profiles
indefinitely.</div><a name="10020449000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">Similarly,
the proportion of crimes that were detected in which a DNA match was
available was 36.5 per cent. two years ago and 32.4 per cent. last
year. Simply growing the database and retaining information for ever
and a day has not, apparently, resulted in a growth in detections. The
central question is: to what extent should the Government retain DNA
and other data on people who have been suspected of committing a
criminal offence but have been acquitted or have never been charged?
There is no disagreement or dispute: an adult convicted of an offence
should have their DNA profile retained indefinitely. There are certain
exceptions for young people; the Minister of State has touched on those
and we will deal with them in further detail later.</div>
<a name="10020449000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under PACE,
as amended by the Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001, fingerprints
and samples, including DNA samples, can be taken from anyone arrested
for a recordable offence and detained in a police station. More than 1
million people on the database have never been convicted, cautioned or
even formally warned or reprimanded, as recorded by the police national
computer. Young people and people from black and minority ethnic
communities are represented disproportionately on the database, yet
despite that and until the judgment in the case of S and Marper, the
Government&#146;s stated policy was to grow the DNA database for the
sake of it; guilt or innocence were not relevant to the growth in the
number of DNA samples and data retained. As the Court heard,</div>
<a name="10020449000193"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the sole reason
for their retention being to increase the size and, therefore, the use
of the database in the identification of offenders in the
future.&#148;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column231" />Column number: 231</div><a name="10020449000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">The stated policy then
was simply to grow the database and retain those DNA records
indefinitely.</div><a name="10020449000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">Obviously,
the Government have been forced to change their approach as a
consequence of the judgment. Their actions in bringing forward the new
provisions were necessitated by it. In that landmark case, the Court
held that there had been a violation of article 8 of the European
convention on human rights with regard to the retention of DNA by the
Government. The Court said that the &#147;blanket and indiscriminate
nature&#148; of DNA retention in the UK was in breach of the
convention. It highlighted a number of issues, including the fact that
retention
was</div><a name="10020449000194"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;irrespective
of the nature or gravity of the offence with which the individual was
originally
suspected&#148;</div><a name="10020449000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">and
not time-limited; that the age of the suspected offender was not
relevant; and
that</div><a name="10020449000195"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;there
exist only limited possibilities for an acquitted individual to have
the data removed from the nationwide database or the materials
destroyed.&#148;</div><a name="10020449000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
also highlighted the lack
of</div><a name="10020449000196"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;provision
for independent review of the justification for the retention according
to defined criteria, including such factors as the seriousness of the
offence, previous arrests, the strength of the suspicion against the
person and any other special
circumstances.&#148;</div><a name="10020449000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Court highlighted the differences in approach among the nations of the
United Kingdom, noting  in particular that the approach in
Scotland was noticeably consistent with Committee of Ministers&#146;
recommendation R(92)1 on the use of analysis of DNA within the
framework of the criminal justice system. It is worth noting the
reference to recommendation R(92)1, which frames the context of the
amendment 26 and the consideration behind its drafting. The
recommendation sets out the framework, stating
that</div><a name="10020449000197"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Samples
or other body tissue taken from individuals for DNA analysis should not
be kept after the rendering of the final decision in the case for which
they were used, unless it is necessary for purposes directly linked to
those for which they were
collected.&#148;</div><a name="10020449000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
goes on to add certain provisos, for
example:</div><a name="10020449000198"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Where
the security of the state is involved, the domestic law of the member
state may permit retention of the samples, the results of DNA analysis
and the information so derived even though the individual concerned has
not been charged or convicted of an offence. In such cases strict
storage periods should be defined by domestic
law.&#148;</div><a name="10020449000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
continues:</div><a name="10020449000199"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Since
the primary aim of the collection of samples and the carrying out of
DNA analysis on such samples is the identification of offenders and the
exoneration of suspected offenders, the data should be deleted once
persons have been cleared of suspicion. The issue then arises as to how
long the DNA findings and the samples on which they were based can be
stored in the case of a finding of
guilt.&#148;</div><a name="10020449000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
comments of the Court and the Committee of Ministers&#146;
recommendation R(92)1 are an important backdrop, setting out the legal
context of what may or may not be appropriate. The potential elements
are: the legal aspects, which I have run through; and, separately,
maintaining the proportionate balance between the potentially
conflicting rights of the individual and the collective right of
security and the need to prevent crime.</div>

am</div><a name="10020449000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
be fair, the Government have said that they are committed to
implementing the Marper judgment, but in doing so, the factors outlined
by the Court and in the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column232" />Column number: 232</div>Committee of Ministers&#146; recommendation are directly relevant. It
is also fair to say that the Government have made a faltering start.
Initially, Ministers sought to reserve an order-making power to address
this extremely sensitive issue. It should have been no surprise that
that approach was utterly unacceptable and the proposal was
subsequently dropped. A 12-year retention period was then suggested for
anyone arrested for a crime involving serious violence or a serious
sexual offence, and a six-year period for other offences. That approach
was based on work carried out for the Jill Dando Institute, but that
work was subsequently questioned and the Home Office does not now place
reliance upon it to justify its position; it would argue that it relies
on what is more up-to-date or slightly different
evidence.</div><a name="10020449000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
proposition set out in clause 14, and in particular in proposed new
section 64ZD of PACE to which amendment 26 relates, is apparently based
on an internally-produced Home Office hazard rate analysis as a means
of supporting a blanket six-year retention period for all DNA records
obtained as a result of an arrest for any recordable offence. However,
in examining the relative merits of our amendment and the
Government&#146;s proposal in the Bill, it is important to note that
the hazard rate analysis is subject to a number of important caveats,
including regarding how the evidence was drawn up. In his letter to
members of the Committee on 2 February 2010, the Home Secretary quite
fairly acknowledged that. He
stated:</div><a name="10020449000200"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
data available to us, however, describe the likelihood of subsequent
arrest, not
conviction&#148;.</div><a name="10020449000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
other words, in drawing up the analysis, the Government have sought to
compare arrest data and how long until someone might be subsequently
arrested, with the arrest rate for the general population. Again, there
were limitations on the data that were available, and the Home
Secretary rightly notes in his
letter:</div><a name="10020449000201"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
had a maximum of three years of usable PNC data on arrests available to
us, because of weeding of PNC arrest entries for earlier years. As a
result, we had to extend the data statistically to forecast the risk of
re-arrest.&#148;</div><a name="10020449000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
other words, because there was only a limited amount of data, there had
to be an extrapolation&#151;a forecast&#151;and there are some
caveats and uncertainties regarding whether that extrapolation is
accurate. We do not have the real data over a sufficient time period to
draw that sort of
conclusion.</div><a name="10020449000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hazard rate analysis itself highlights a number of caveats regarding
the justification for the six-year retention period. On trying to
measure the intersecting lines of arrest-to-arrest hazard rate and the
rate for the general population it
states:</div><a name="10020449000202"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Both
these lines are measured with some degree of uncertainty...the
hazard rate curve is extrapolated, rather than being based on real
data...The comparison arrest rate for the general population is
also not known precisely but
estimated.&#148;</div><a name="10020449000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
other words, two estimated lines intersect to come up with a six-year
period. The analysis
continues:</div><a name="10020449000203"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;This
means that the intersection of the two, around the six-year point, is
quite sensitive to errors in either the extrapolation or the estimated
risk of criminality for the general
population.&#148;</div><a name="10020449000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
think that the Government themselves would say, in looking at a
six-year period, that there is some flexibility about where the lines
may intersect, and therefore flexibility about what is appropriate
based on their arrest-to-arrest hazard rate analysis. We argue that, in
striking the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column233" />Column number: 233</div>six-year period, the Government have fallen on the wrong side of the
line. Notwithstanding the evidence, they have failed to strike an
appropriate balance between collective protection and individual
freedom. On the basis of the hazard rate analysis, we have taken a
different approach, as reflected in amendment
26.</div><a name="10020449000097"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020449000256"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department
(Mr. Alan Campbell):</b> Is the hon. Gentleman
saying, in a perfectly acceptable way, that he is drawing a line
similar to the Scottish model based on the evidence produced by the
Home Department, although he disagrees with the line that we have
drawn; or is he adopting the Scottish model in full, without reference
to that evidence? If he is, where is the evidence on which the Scottish
model is
based?</div><a name="10020449000098"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020449000257"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I am grateful to the Under-Secretary of State
for that intervention. I will come on to the support that even the Home
Department document appears to provide for a three-year retention
period. It appears to support, in some ways, the principles that have
been enunciated by the Scottish retention period of three years, plus
the two-year top-up. Albeit that the proposals set out in amendment 26
are modelled on the Scottish model, they are not an exact replica or an
exact carbon copy. There are certain differences, as I am sure the
Ministers accept.</div>
<a name="10020449000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
of State will be aware of the research that was subsequently conducted
by Professor Fraser in his investigation of the appropriateness of the
retention periods in Scotland. I will come back to that point, because
I know that that was an issue that came up on Second Reading and I also
note that, in his letter of  2 February, the Home Secretary
makes reference to that work as well.</div>
<a name="10020449000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
doubtful that the Government&#146;s proposals for DNA retention, as
outlined in clause 14, comply with the European convention on human
rights. In a written statement to the House last November, the Home
Secretary acknowledged that the European Court in the S and Marper case
had</div>
<a name="10020449000204"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;suggested that
the seriousness of the alleged offence should be a factor in
determining what length of retention was
proportionate&#148;.&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report</i>, 11 November
2009; Vol. 499, c.
26W.]</div><a name="10020449000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
the Government have not taken that into account in relation to adults
in their proposal. It is interesting that they appear to make a
fundamental distinction for children, which is not reflected in their
approach to adults. There is some inconsistency in the logic attached
to the Government&#146;s proposals. It is interesting to note that,
and it will be interesting to hear the Minister say why those slightly
different lines have been taken, with a blanket six-year retention for
adults and slightly altered approaches for children and young
people.</div>
<a name="10020449000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Equality
and Human Rights Commission has written to the Council of Europe
arguing that the Government&#146;s revised proposals do not comply
with the Committee of Ministers&#146; recommendation R(92)1. What we
can be clear on is that a system similar to that used in Scotland would
be compliant&#151;the Court stated that in the judgment on the S and
Marper case. Although not perfect&#151;it is a question of fine
balances of judgment&#151;we believe that an approach similar to that
used in Scotland should be adopted in England and
Wales.</div>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column234" />Column number: 234</div><a name="10020449000103"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020449000258"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> May I get to the nub of the argument? We now come
to what this is really all about. If we could persuade the Committee of
Ministers that six years was proportionate; if we had evidence that DNA
collected and kept for between three and six years under that system
could lead to convictions; and if, as our experience shows&#151;I
refer to the letter from the Home Secretary&#151;23 victims of
serious violence would have been denied justice if we had not adopted
that model, why is the Conservative party not interested in bringing
those criminals to justice, and in giving justice to the victims? What
is the basis for that? I would really like to have that explanation,
because that is the nub of the argument.</div>
<a name="10020449000104"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020449000259"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> That is certainly one argument. We take
seriously the issue of the use of DNA records and material, and the use
of technology in bringing crimes to justice, as I have said. The
Minister has highlighted a number of cases. In his letter to the
Committee, he referred, fairly, to some cases where DNA has been used.
They were serious cases and quite shocking in many regards, but the
question is how the DNA technology fits in with other aspects of
policing and evidence. What are the other facts and circumstances that
may be
appropriate?</div><a name="10020449000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister highlighted the case of Abdirahman Ali Gudaal in support of
that evidence. It was an appalling case. On 19 October 2008, a woman
was dragged into a bedsit as she walked home from a night out and was
repeatedly raped over a two-hour period. The DNA record was used as
part of the prosecution&#146;s case against this individual; that was
right and proper. He had previously been arrested for robbery, and
although he had not been charged, his DNA profile was taken. What the
Minister did not mention was that the appalling attack took place in
the rapist&#146;s own home, and that the victim escaped from that
bedsit, so there was other intelligence that might have led to someone
being convicted of those crimes. We cannot look at the issue in
isolation. There may be other relevant factors that would also have led
to that
conviction.</div><a name="10020449000106"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10020449000260"></a><b class="B">Tom
Brake</b> (Carshalton and Wallington) (LD): Another example
that the Minister deployed is the case of Matthew Fagan, who, when
sacked from his place of work, returned quite soon afterwards to burgle
it. Does the hon. Member for Hornchurch agree that that is another case
where the police might have been able to establish a connection,
because that person was a disgruntled ex-employee and probably one of
the first people whom they might have
interviewed?</div><a name="10020449000107"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020449000261"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes a fair point about
the interrelationship between other evidence, other more general
policing issues and the data that might be available.
<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> Before I give way to the Minister
and my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Sleaford and North
Hykeham, I should like to refer to case study
5.</div><a name="10020449000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
2006 a Dutch male was arrested on suspicion of robbery. This was
investigated and his DNA was taken before he was released without
charge. In 2008 that same male was further arrested for rape after
being identified by the victim. The DNA crime scene samples taken at
the time were found to match the suspect&#146;s 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column235" />Column number: 235</div>DNA profile, already held on the national DNA database, and he was later
tried and convicted in court. Abdirahman Ali Gudaal was Dutch. He was
arrested for robbery in 2006. He was said to have raped somebody in
2008. I therefore submit that case studies 1 and 5 are one and the same
case. Could the Minister look into that? It seems strange that two
Dutch people were arrested for robbery in 2006, committed a rape in
2008 and were subsequently
convicted.</div><a name="10020449000109"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020449000262"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> One should be a bit cautious about all that. I have
told the Committee about one case from my professional experience. I
referred to the defendant as Mr. X. I am willing to give my
hon. Friend and the Minister, if he wants, the name in private, but I
do not want to embarrass the defendant by giving his name in Committee.
That was a case where the rape was discovered exclusively through the
DNA. When he came before the court there was some corroborative
evidence, but he would never have come before the court had he not
subsequently been arrested for attacking a taxi driver. His DNA was
taken and was matched with samples that were 10 years
old.</div><a name="10020449000110"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020449000263"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I absolutely agree with my right hon. and
learned Friend about the retention of crime-scene DNA; it is absolutely
right that that should happen. As our amendments show, we accept that
DNA samples from people who have been arrested but not convicted of
offences of a sexual or violent nature should be retained for a period.
Even if the attack that he mentioned took place before the attack on
the taxi driver, it would have been covered by our proposals, which
would have assisted in the conviction.</div>
<a name="10020449000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">That all
comes down to balancing the rights of someone who has not been found
guilty and so is, to all intents and purposes, innocent. It is a
question of judgment where we draw the line. The Government have
obviously not followed the Scottish model that has been in place for a
few years. We would make some slight modifications to it, and that is
reflected in the amendments. I look to the evidence and the backing in
relation to support, reasonableness and the approach
taken.</div>
<a name="10020449000213"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.45
am</div><a name="10020449000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is worth noting that, as I have mentioned, Professor Fraser looked at
the situation in Scotland and made no recommendations for change. The
Home Secretary said in his letter that he felt that that was not
necessarily fair or reasonable, and questioned the approach. A letter
from Lord Bach&#151;the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State,
Ministry of Justice&#151;to Lord Pannick confirmed that Professor
Fraser</div>
<a name="10020449000205"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;did not uncover
any evidence to suggest that this approach to retention has caused any
detriment to the detection of serious crime in
Scotland&#148;.</div><a name="10020449000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
the Home Secretary highlighted that</div>
<a name="10020449000206"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;That
is to misunderstand this research which did not assess whether
alternative systems would have been more
effective&#148;.</div><a name="10020449000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
checked the terms of reference of the inquiry, which stated that the
inquiry should extend to cover experience elsewhere. I am not sure that
it is right that there was no consideration of alternative systems in
support of the broad Scottish model. The terms of reference stated that
the inquiry was to take account of experience elsewhere.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column236" />Column number: 236</div><a name="10020449000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although I
understand that the analysis undertaken by Professor Fraser may not
support the Government&#146;s case, it is still worth considering. It
certainly does seem to take account of the relevant factors and the
approach taken in Scotland since the introduction of the system there.
Although the system in Scotland is not perfect, we believe in a similar
approach, reflecting the relative merits of, and the balance between,
individual freedoms. The general starting point is that people should
not have their DNA record retained if they have not been convicted of
an offence. In striking that balance and taking into consideration some
of the individual cases that rightly need to be dealt with by DNA
detection, a system based on the Scottish model is proportionate and
reasonable. It will provide the levels of protection that the public
would expect. The cases and examples that the Minister provided do not
seem to question  the approach that we are taking in the
amendment, which appears to us to be appropriate and to strike the
right
balance.</div><a name="10020449000116"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10020449000264"></a><b class="B">Shona
McIsaac</b> (Cleethorpes) (Lab): I have been listening
carefully to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s arguments in relation to the
Scottish model. However, is not the gaping hole in his argument the
fact that in Scotland there are three possible verdicts: not guilty,
not proven and guilty? Therefore, to make a direct comparison between
&#147;not guilty&#148; in Scotland and &#147;not guilty&#148;
in England is not to compare like with
like.</div><a name="10020449000117"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020449000265"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> The hon. Lady might have a point, were it not
for the fact that even the hazard rate analysis, which we talked about,
appears to suggest that a three-year period might be appropriate,
justified and reasonable. It is appropriate to examine that. The hazard
rate analysis says that the basic estimate was six years, which is the
approach that the Government have taken. It
states:</div><a name="10020449000207"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;However,
most of the incremental offending risk of the NFA group is dissipated
some time before this point, as indicated by the relative flatness of
the hazard curve after, for example, three years. The shape of the
hazard rate curve indicates how significant offending risk is in the
years immediately following an initial arrest. This means that the
choice of shorter retention periods is quite robust to the
sensitivities introduced by these errors and
assumptions.&#148;</div><a name="10020449000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
analysis appears to say that three years may be a justifiable and
supportable period in relation to that work. The Home Office itself
accepts that, ultimately, it is a matter of judgment and that a
three-year period could be regarded as within the scope of
reasonableness, even on the basis of the hazard rate
analysis.</div>
<a name="10020449000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our judgment
is that the proposals outlined in amendment 26 strike the right
balance, unlike the Government&#146;s proposals, which remain on the
wrong side of the line, are not appropriate and do not reflect the
basic starting point of innocence before the law unless guilt has been
proven.</div><a name="10020449000120"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020449000268"></a>The

several amendments in this group, so I assumed that he was prepared to
speak to them. If that is an embarrassment for the moment, I will call
Mr. Brake.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column237" />Column number: 237</div><a name="10020449000123"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020449000269"></a>Tom
Brake:</b> As the hon. Member for Hornchurch made clear in his
speech, this group of amendments goes to the heart of the debate on DNA
and its retention, and whether it is right to retain the DNA of
innocent people. I must confess that the matter is controversial, even
within the Liberal Democrats. Perhaps our party conference took a hard
line by making a clear and simple distinction between people being on
the database if they are convicted and off the database if they have
been found innocent or if charges have not been pressed against
them.</div>
<a name="10020449000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">Interestingly,
the Home Affairs Committee is currently conducting an inquiry into the
DNA database, and the Minister was sitting in the Gallery when that
Committee heard evidence from Sir Alec Jeffreys, who invented the
techniques for DNA profiling 25 years ago. He made it clear that, had
he known then that 25 years later he would be sitting in front of a
Select Committee debating whether it was appropriate to have millions
of people&#146;s DNA retained on a database, very large numbers of
whom are innocent of any crime, he would have been appalled. I perhaps
expected him to say that he regretted ever having invented the
techniques, but he said that they were significant and important for
tackling crime and that he therefore had no regrets about it. He does,
however, have significant regrets about how the techniques are being
used.</div>
<a name="10020449000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">Sir Alec also
confirmed in evidence that the risk of mismatches or false matches for
DNA will increase as the number of people on the database increases,
and that it will increase significantly when the process of exchanging
DNA at a European level starts, which he said is already happening. He
confirmed that he was aware of some scientific analysis that showed
that it is now quite easy to falsify DNA and place it at a crime scene,
and a company called Nucleix Ltd has published reports on that. He was
clear that for several reasons he regretted the Government&#146;s
decision and was much more comfortable with a position in which
innocent peoples&#146; details were not kept on the
database.</div>
<a name="10020449000126"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10020449000270"></a><b class="B">Dr.
Brian Iddon</b> (Bolton, South-East) (Lab): Professor
Jeffreys, who invented the techniques, has referred to the number of
markers that should be kept, and I think that it would be fair to put
that on the record.</div>
<a name="10020449000127"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020449000271"></a>Tom
Brake:</b> Yes, we have discussed that matter in both this
Committee and the Select Committee. As I understand it, in the UK we
use 10 markers, but the Germans use five, hence the increased risk of
false matches. Sir Alec wanted to highlight that issue for us, and I
hope that when the Minister responds he will pick up on the ability to
generate false DNA, because that is an area that we should be concerned
about.</div>
<a name="10020449000128"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020449000272"></a>Shona
McIsaac:</b> Does the hon. Gentleman acknowledge that the
police in this country have now confirmed that they will move to 15
points of comparison, which will make false matches less
likely?</div><a name="10020449000129"></a>

small, but Sir Alec&#146;s point was that it is not like the national
lottery, which happens once a week; we are talking about something that
happens regularly&#151;daily or twice daily&#151;so the probability
increases. I do not 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column238" />Column number: 238</div>know how many matches are done each day, but they are clearly done with
great frequency, and the probability of a false match is greater as a
result. Also, of course, DNA is often degraded, so the 10 reference
points required for matching are not always present. That is my
understanding.</div>

Conservative spokesman and I must acknowledge that in a small number of
circumstances&#151;the right hon. and learned Member for Sleaford and

evidence might put a person in a place and bring them before the court
to explain. If they cannot explain why they were there, a conviction
might result. Equally, however, the DNA, even if it were slightly
flawed, might put the person in that place, but they might have a
perfectly good alibi that would allow them to be cleared of the charge
in due course. The key point is that without the DNA, they would not
come before the court in the first place. That is why DNA is important,
and it helps secure convictions
accordingly.</div><a name="10020449000135"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020449000277"></a>Tom
Brake:</b> I am not suggesting that the police should not use
DNA in tackling crime. Clearly they should, but this debate is about
whether the DNA of people who have not been found guilty of any offence
should be retained on the database. The hon. Member for Hornchurch
quoted examples, and I intervened on him to cite the example of
Mr. Fagan. In the case referred to by the hon. Gentleman, a
horrendous attack happened in the flat of the perpetrator, which
suggests that there would have been other means of securing a
conviction. The arguments and examples deployed by the Minister to date
have not been very convincing.</div>
<a name="10020449000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">As Sir Alec
said, false matches are also probable, which could lead at the very
least to police pursuit of a line of inquiry that delays proceedings or
the effective investigation of a case. We heard from witnesses during
our first sittings that there is no guarantee that the
Government&#146;s proposals will address the concerns of the European
Court of Human Rights. I contend that the Liberal Democrats&#146;
proposed new clauses 6,7 and 8 would do so and would meet the
requirements. The evidence deployed by the Government to justify a
six-year retention period has not been particularly
convincing.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column239" />Column number: 239</div><a name="10020449000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Hornchurch said that the UK needed to set an example. We
have the largest DNA database. Clearly, our Government
cannot&#151;nor should they&#151;make decisions simply because
other countries will quote our example in respect of measures that they
take, but that is a risk. I understand that the United Arab Emirates is
considering introducing a mandatory DNA database on which every
resident will have to have a DNA profile kept. The UAE could say,
&#147;If it&#146;s all right in the United Kingdom for people who
are innocent of any crime to have their DNA retained for a certain
period, what possible objections can there be for us being a little bit
more systematic in retaining or capturing the DNA profiles of every
resident of our
country?&#148;</div><a name="10020449000214"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10
am</div><a name="10020449000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
evidence deployed so far by the Government on whether there is a
greater likelihood of someone whose DNA is kept subsequently committing
a crime, compared with a random sample of people whose DNA is kept on
the database subsequently committing a crime, is somewhat inconclusive.
Broadly speaking, if the convictions secured in respect of the former
or the latter are the same, to be consistent the Government should
argue for a United Arab Emirates model, which captures the DNA profiles
of everyone. The Minister will no doubt criticise me&#151;he has
criticised the Conservative spokesman&#151;by saying that our
proposals would allow people to escape conviction, but by not adopting
a DNA profile database that retains the details of everyone in the
country he will not secure some convictions that he could presumably
secure if we were all entered on the
database.</div><a name="10020449000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
should like to mention the approach that is being adopted towards
children in the Government&#146;s proposals&#151;I emphasise
&#147;children&#148;. We will come to another example shortly on
gang injunctions, although I will not detain the Committee on that
matter now, where the UK Government seem to adopt a particularly
draconian attitude towards children, whereas other European countries
do not. Such an approach perhaps explains why there is a breakdown
between children and adults in this country, which has led, as
Committee members know, to our children perhaps being less happy than
those in virtually any other country in the world. The draconian
approach that is adopted on DNA retention and gang injunctions for
14-year-olds is regrettable. Many organisations representing children
are disappointed with the Government&#146;s approach, because it is
criminalising children or treating them in a way that suggests they are
mini adult criminals, and in many respects treating them the same as
adults.</div><a name="10020449000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
do not want to pursue the debate further. This group of amendments is
fundamental to our debate about DNA and DNA retention. If the Minister
wants a solution that both helps to tackle crime, although not quite to
the extent that he would like, and ensures that people&#146;s civil
liberties are maintained, he should adopt the one that we have
advanced. Our solution is much more straightforward. The Minister
himself acknowledged just a few minutes ago that what is being proposed
in the Bill is exceedingly complex. I am willing to bet a
fiver&#151;</div><a name="10020449000141"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020449000278"></a>Shona

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020449000279"></a>Tom
Brake:</b> For someone who does not bet, a fiver is a huge
amount of money. I bet a fiver that the algorithm the Minister says
will be used to ensure that people&#146;s DNA is deleted from the
database consistently, efficiently and methodically is unlikely to
work.</div><a name="10020449000143"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020449000280"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020449000281"></a>Tom

to the Minister&#146;s
response.</div><a name="10020449000145"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10020449000282"></a><b class="B">Tony
Baldry</b> (Banbury) (Con): I am something of an agnostic on
this issue, and I think there may be other voices that need to be
heard. Our overall purpose seems to be to ensure that justice is done.
In both the Old Testament and the New Testament there is an
exhortation, &#147;What does the Lord require of you but to seek
justice, show mercy and walk with the Lord thy God.&#148; Justice is
important.</div><a name="10020449000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">DNA
technology enables police forces to identify perpetrators of serious
crimes, such as murder and rape, who might otherwise get away with it.
I do not know whether I am the only member of the Committee to have
been fortunate enough to spend time on the police parliamentary scheme,
but I commend it, because it is worthwhile. I spent a day with the
Thames Valley police cold cases review team. It examines murders and
rapes that were committed in the Thames valley over the past 20 years,
using DNA as a means of identifying possible perpetrators. On the day
that I was with the team, officers were preparing to arrest a man who
was subsequently convicted at Oxford Crown court of a rape that he had
committed some years before. Without the DNA, that man would not have
been brought to justice and, throughout her life, the victim would have
known that no one had been held to account for  that
rape.</div>
<a name="10020449000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">DNA is a
valuable tool for helping to bring people to justice. I understand the
point made by the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington, but it
also applies to false positives with fingerprint evidence. Whenever
fingerprint evidence is adduced in a criminal trial, the prosecution
must prove that evidence to the jury, and I am sure that the same will
apply to DNA
evidence.</div><a name="10020449000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am agnostic about the matter because during our evidence sittings,
those representing civil liberties groups said that they objected to
DNA being retained because it provides a lot of information. It might
show our propensity to contract cancer later on, and so on. But I
understand that that is not what is proposed. I understand that a set
of numbers&#151;perhaps 10&#151;will be retained.  I cannot
see a problem if the state retains a set of numbers, as it already does
with national insurance numbers.</div>
<a name="10020449000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">Perhaps I
have missed something, but my national insurance number, which is
unique to me, consists of two letters, followed by six numbers,
followed by a letter. It consists of nine digits, and I put it on
numerous documents. When constituents write to us about their problems
with the Child Support Agency or other organs of state, the reference
we use to identify them uniquely is their national insurance number. I
do not understand why there should be a problem if the state holds a
seven or 10-digit number. That is my perspective, and I put it on the
record because I do not understand why my civil liberties would be
infringed if someone knows that my DNA is 1234512345. What is the
problem?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column241" />Column number: 241</div><a name="10020449000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, I
accept that the Bill came to the House because the Government lost a
case in the European Court of Human
Rights.</div><a name="10020449000151"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020449000283"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> I rather agree with my hon. Friend, and I have
articulated my view to the Committee. The problem is that our view is
far ahead of public opinion, which is probably where we should direct
our conclusions, rather than our personal opinions that happen to
coincide.</div><a name="10020449000152"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020449000284"></a>Tony
Baldry:</b> I say gently to the Minister that our problem with
public opinion is that the police may have been the authors of their
own misfortune. When people have been found not guilty, or
investigations have been discontinued, and they have asked for their
DNA to be destroyed, the police&#146;s attitude has been, &#147;Sod
you. We might not have got you, but we think you&#146;re guilty of
something so we&#146;ll retain your DNA.&#148; That is why people
who have not been found guilty of something object to the police
retaining their DNA. I think the police have an attitudinal
problem.</div>
<a name="10020449000153"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020449000285"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> My hon. Friend is right, but there is a further
point. He and I served in the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and
Food where we both discovered the public&#146;s distrust of
scientists and of the use to which scientific material can be put. Does
my hon. Friend agree that there is an underlying distrust of science,
scientists and, indeed, the big state in relation to this issue as
well?</div><a name="10020449000154"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020449000286"></a>Tony
Baldry:</b> I certainly understand that point. In some
criminal cases, specialist evidence has been submitted by experts on
statistics who have sometimes inadvertently managed to mislead the
court. We have seen a number of such cases unravel in the Court of
Appeal criminal division. There have been misunderstandings by everyone
of the statistics involved in some notable, tragic cases of battered
babies.</div><a name="10020449000155"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10020449000287"></a><b class="B">Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020449000288"></a>Tony
Baldry:</b> No, or I shall lose my train of thought.</div>
<a name="10020449000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are here
not because of my personal view, or that of my right hon. and learned
Friend the Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham, of what civil
liberties are, but because of the decision of the European Court of
Justice. My questions genuinely seek knowledge. What is the position on
DNA in other member states? Why has it not been possible for the
Justice and Home Affairs Council, which the Minister attends, to
achieve some consensus or agreement among colleagues in the European
Union on an appropriate way forward? It seems that we are being offered
two choices: the Minister&#146;s choice and the Scottish model. I
cannot believe that those are the only variants. What is happening
elsewhere in other European member
states?</div><a name="10020449000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
there were some suggestions during our oral evidence sittings that the
Government&#146;s proposal will not be judge-proof. In other words,
we could go through the palaver of taking the Bill through both Houses
before the general election, and then find that no sooner has it been
enacted, someone returns to the European 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column242" />Column number: 242</div>Court of Justice and gets it overturned. What indications does the
Minister have that the Government&#146;s proposed solution will
command favour and will not be overturned by European judicial
review?</div><a name="10020449000159"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020449000291"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> I shall disappoint you, Mr. Cook, because
I do not feel any obligation to speak at great length. Many of the
amendments that I tabled in this group were responded to by the rather
dense material that the Minister read in the debate on the previous
group. You will recall, Mr. Cook, that I said that I would
read that dense material and then come to a conclusion. The group of
amendments under discussion are in fact very much the same as those
that were the subject of the dense response. In any event, I am minded
to rally around the proposals suggested by my hon. Friend the Member
for Hornchurch. To that extent, anything I say would be substantially
otiose.</div><a name="10020449000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
only other point&#151;just to show that I have been listening to the
debate&#151;is to my hon. Friend the Member for Banbury. Although it
might be desirable for Ministers attending the Justice and Home Affairs
Council to agree what my hon. Friend described as a way forward on
dates and duration, I am not sure that it would make a lot of
difference. What we are dealing with is an interpretation of the
European convention on human rights and the issues that flow from it.
The Justice and Home Affairs Council would not be able to form a
decisive view as far as the European convention on human rights is
concerned.</div><a name="10020449000215"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.15
am</div><a name="10020449000163"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020449000292"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> This debate represents the nub of our discussions
in relation to DNA in general. May I say from the outset that I am with
the hon. Member for Banbury? This is about justice and bringing people
who have committed crimes to justice. It is about making sure that the
police have every opportunity to ensure that such people are brought to
justice, and that the victims of crimes have a sense of satisfaction
that someone is held to account for the crime. The framework that we
have put in place is a tool to help secure
justice.</div><a name="10020449000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will start with the hon. Gentleman&#146;s important point about
European comparisons. There is no general consensus. Operation varies
in Europe and, as the right hon. and learned Member for Sleaford and
North Hykeham said, that will form the backdrop for consideration of
each of the regimes in relation to the European convention on human
rights. However, I shall give some
examples.</div><a name="10020449000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">At
one extreme, which may not be endearing to the Committee, is Lithuania,
where retention lengths are between 100 years and 10 years after death
for any recordable offence. Retention length in Estonia is
10 years after death; in Austria, the period indefinite for
a serious offence but removed if requested. Our colleagues in Sweden,
Belgium, Cyprus, the Czech Republic and Hungary have no retention
procedure, which might not actually be policy but due to the fact that
they do not have the capacity to retain. France retains for 25 years
and Finland erases after one year. There is a range of options, and no
consensus.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column243" />Column number: 243</div><a name="10020449000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government
have tried not to be like the United Arab Emirates. We want to be
proportionate, to base retention on evidence and to ensure that
individuals are brought to justice within a reasonable framework.
Initially, we looked at 12 years. We produced a consultation paper in
May 2009 that proposed an indefinite period for adult conviction; for
adult non-conviction, 12 years; for adult non-conviction of a minor
crime, six years;  for under-18 conviction of a serious crime,
indefinite; and so
on.</div><a name="10020449000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
consultation and the European judgment have made us reflect, so we are
trying in clause 14 to be proportionate but to retain justice at the
heart of the clause and its objectives, as the hon. Member for Banbury
said. We have reflected, we have revised our proposals and we have
pushed the envelope as far as we can. As Members know, the revised
proposals are six years for those who are not convicted of a minor or
serious crime, and indefinite for those who are convicted of any crime.
We have pushed the envelope as far as we can, but we believe that we
can secure the support of the Committee of Ministers and comply with
our obligations under human rights
legislation.</div><a name="10020449000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">With
due respect to the right hon. and learned Member for Sleaford and North
Hykeham and other Opposition Members, I find it ironic that the
official Opposition, who are probably the most Eurosceptic party in the
House at present, are leaning on the European convention on human
rights and on ensuring that we meet our obligations in Europe in the
legislation. We are trying to do that in a proportionate
way.</div><a name="10020449000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
position of the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington is perfectly
legitimate. It is a position of absolute integrity: the Liberal
Democrats would not take DNA from anybody who is presumed
innocent&#151;who is not found guilty of any crime. That is an
absolutely legitimate
position.</div><a name="10020449000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
as I have done previously, I can list many examples of people who had
been arrested, found not guilty, and released without charge, yet who,
on the basis of evidence, were subsequently found guilty of a serious
offence and convicted. The murderer of Sally Anne Bowman, one of the
hon. Gentleman&#146;s constituents, was brought to justice through
DNA retained under our
proposals.</div><a name="10020449000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am starting from the basis that if we have to hand evidence that will
stack up in court, help to bring somebody to justice and convict them
of a serious crime, we should use it. Hugh Orde, the President of ACPO,
said in his evidence to us that
it</div><a name="10020449000209"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;puts
a person in a place, and they then have to explain
that.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official Report, Crime and
Security Public Bill Committee,  </i>26 January 2010; c. 42,
Q77.]</div><a name="10020449000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is
something we should
support.</div><a name="10020449000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
genuinely cannot get my head around why a party that has always
professed to be the party of law and order would not use modern
technology to ensure that individuals are brought to justice for
serious crimes. I can legitimately understand the Liberal
Democrats&#146; position; it is absolutely
fine.</div><a name="10020449000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
position of the official Opposition is &#147;Let&#146;s adopt the
Scottish model.&#148; The Scottish model keeps the DNA of people who
have been convicted, or arrested for serious crimes but not charged. I
have given evidence to the Committee&#151;it can be disputed and
examined&#151; 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column244" />Column number: 244</div>showing that ultimately, people who have been arrested have the
potential to commit further crime in a six-year

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020449000294"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> The point is that our evidence shows that like it
or not, people who have faced initial arrest and been charged, even if
they are not convicted, have a propensity to return before the courts
and be convicted within six years. Not everybody will; I accept that.
The hon. Member for Ashford (Damian Green) asked the chief constable to
remove his DNA, and the chief constable consented. That is perfectly
legitimate. There may even be other hon. Members for Ashford out there
who do not know their rights and do not go to the chief constable, even
though they are innocent, and who, although they have been arrested and
had their DNA taken, will never commit a crime.</div>
<a name="10020449000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">That might be
the case, but I must balance that against the contrary judgment. I
understand that it will be difficult. It will infringe people&#146;s
rights and could cause them personal&#151;although not
public&#151;embarrassment. I accept all of that, but ultimately, I
want a system in place in which people such the killer of Sally Anne
Bowman, who was in the same position, can be brought to justice and
will spend a long time in prison so that families have justice. That
murderer is behind bars, which means not just that he has been brought
to justice for that crime, but that he may not go on to kill my
daughter or somebody else&#146;s child. I am sorry, but I think that
is a good system, and I will defend it to the Committee. Civil
liberties are important&#151;I accept that, and I will say it to the
hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington&#151;but civil liberties
also include the right not to be murdered randomly on the street by an
individual if it can be prevented. To me, that is the most important
part of the
debate.</div><a name="10020449000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
think that the hon. Members for Carshalton and Wallington, and for
Hornchurch, are in the wrong place. Actually, we might like to stretch
the envelope still further to our original proposal of 12 years, but we
must accept our legal obligations and the European judgments, and we
must look at the evidence. All those things have brought us to the
conclusion that six years is proportionate and realistic, for the
reasons that we have
discussed.</div><a name="10020449000179"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020449000295"></a>Tony
