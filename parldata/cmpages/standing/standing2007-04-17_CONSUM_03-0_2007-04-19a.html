well-mannered and productive Committee as it has so far proved to
be.</div>
					<a name="07041985000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment is
simple. It would introduce subsection (8) to ensure that, if the
council refuses to investigate a complaint, the complainant is entitled
to know in writing that it will not investigate the matter and the
reason why it has taken that decision. Such a provision would be
entirely reasonable and we look forward to hearing what other members

amendment.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07041985000223"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (Jim
Fitzpatrick):
						</b> Good morning, Mr. Caton. The
Committee warmly welcomed you and your co-Chairman on Tuesday and
expressed its collective confidence in your skill to guide us through
our deliberations. I am sure that I can say on behalf of Labour Members
what a pleasure it is to see you in the Chair this
morning.</div>
					<a name="07041985000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
53 would require the new council to write to a consumer as soon as
reasonably possible if it decided not to take up a complaint made by
that consumer as a result of any of the exceptions listed in clause
13(4) and to provide reasons for its decision. At present, the
Department for Trade and Industry sets key performance indicators for
its non-departmental public bodies as part of the annual budget and
work programme round. That process results in targets. In the case of
Energywatch, for example, the body has targets to resolve 95 per cent.
of inquiries within 10 working days; to resolve 80 per cent. of
complaints within 35 working days; and to resolve 95 per cent. of
complaints within 66 working days.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column86" />Column number: 86</div>
					<a name="07041985000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those targets and performance
against the targets are published in the Energywatch annual report. The
Committee can be sure that that will be a feature of the annual reports
for the new council as provided by clause 7(2)(c), which allows the
Secretary of State to specify matters to be included in the report. In
future, for the new council we will establish a comprehensive set of
performance targets that will be measurable and meaningful. They will
be challenging and more precise than what is envisaged by the
amendment, which refers to the council writing to the
complainant</div>
					<a name="07041985000191"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;as soon as
reasonably possible&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07041985000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The
performance targets will cover such issues as response times to
consumers on any inquiry or correspondence and keep consumers informed
about the progress of their inquiries. We want to ensure that the new
council delivers on demanding targets to provide excellent service for
consumers. The amendment attempts to set what should be best practice
for the new council in dealing with consumers&#146; complaints. Since
the functions of the new council are focused specifically on aiding
consumers, the council should develop its own processes and targets for
communicating with
consumers.</div>
					<a name="07041985000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">We take the
purpose of the amendment seriously and do not disagree with the overall
objective. However, as I have explained, we are already doing what the
amendment seeks by setting targets for non-departmental public bodies
such as Energywatch. The system will provide us with the flexibility to
set the right targets for the new council to ensure that it provides
the high standards of service for consumers that we expect. In light of
my explanation, I hope that the hon. Lady will understand why the
Government are unable to accept the amendment and that she will
withdraw
it.</div>

Fitzpatrick:
						</b> Clause 14 requires the new council to refer a
complaint that it considers to raise issues of general relevance made
under clause 11(1)(a) to Ofgem. It will also be required to refer
complaints made by designated vulnerable consumers and those relating
to the disconnection or threatened disconnection of a gas or
electricity supply to which clauses 12(3) or clause 13 apply. The
council will refer such complaints when it considers that
Ofgem&#146;s regulatory functions may be exercisable and when Ofgem
is not already aware of the complaint. When a complaint about a gas or
electricity disconnection is made to the council and referred to Ofgem,
the council is not obliged to investigate until the authority has had a
reasonable chance to exercise its enforcement functions.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column87" />Column number: 87</div>
					<a name="07041985000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 14 focuses on resolving
problems in the most effective way. When the authority has enforcement
powers in respect of complaints made by the consumer, it is sensible to
ensure that Ofgem&#151;the regulator&#151;is aware of the matter
and that it has the opportunity to use its powers to resolve it. That
position is the same as the current provision.</div>
					<a name="07041985000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						It is
important that Ofgem is made aware of problems that arise from a
situation in which a licencee&#146;s behaviour breaches licence
conditions. Ofgem has powers to enforce licence conditions by, for
example, imposing financial penalties of up to 10 per cent. of
turnover. Ofgem also has powers to determine connection charges. When a
consumer seeks connection to the electricity or gas network and is not
willing to accept the distribution company&#146;s quotation for the
work, the issue can be referred to Ofgem, which can make a
determination on the reasonable amount that a consumer can be asked to
pay. That is an example of an issue that can be referred to Ofgem by
the council for resolution.</div>
					<a name="07041985000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause provides for the new
council to notify a complainant if it considers that a complaint refers
to a matter that can be referred to Ofgem under existing legislative
provision. In our sitting of Tuesday 17 July, reference was made to the
need to ensure that the council notifies a complainant in accordance
with the key performance targets that we will set out. I commend the
clause to the Committee.</div>
					
					<a name="07041985000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07041985000226"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Mark Prisk</b> (Hertford and Stortford) (Con): Thank you,
Mr. Caton. I, too, welcome you to the Chair. I do not think
that I have had your guidance before in a Standing Committee or, as we
must now call them, a Public Bill Committee, but I am delighted to have
such guidance now as we continue our deliberations.</div>
					<a name="07041985000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">I welcome the Minister&#146;s
opening remarks on the clause. He rightly said that it will require the
council to refer a complaint that stems from clauses 11, 12
and13 to Ofgem when it considers the authority&#146;s powers
to be exercisable which, in principle, is a perfectly reasonable
measure. However, as the Minister will know, there will be cases on the
margins of Ofgem&#146;s power, as it were, over which there may be
some dispute, particular regarding disconnections. It would be helpful
if the Minister would express his views or give some guidance to the
Committee now or in the future as to what will be the guiding
principles in cases that involve a dispute over whether a matter should
be referred to Ofgem.</div>

Democrats very complicated, so I much appreciate your powers of
observation.</div>
					<a name="07041985000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">For the
sake of clarification, as I understand it, Ofgem will be responsible
for setting the standardsfor complaints procedures for
electricity suppliers. Presumably, Ofgem will need to get information
about the kinds of complaints that are being made from the National
Consumer Council, whether or not suppliers&#146; complaints
procedures are adequate, or whether the process is effective in the
real world. Does the Minister see the Bill as providing the structure
that will allow the transfer of necessary
information?</div>

Fitzpatrick:
						</b> In our Tuesday sitting, there were quite a
few references to double acts&#151;I myself was subject to some of
the knockabout. The hon. Members for Richmond Park and for Solihull
were not referred to then as Thelma and Louise, but I can assure them
that if they ever were, it would be in a complimentary sense.
[<i class="I">Interruption.</i>] The hon. Member for Rochford and Southend, East
(Mr. Duddridge) clearly does not have a problem with which
Minister will respond to him today.</div>
					<a name="07041985000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The
arrangements about whose uncertainty the hon. Member for Hertford and
Stortford asked will to a certain extent have to be worked out in the
implementation and work programme stage in the months ahead to identify
the lines of responsibility. The new council will clearly have a keen
interest in ensuring that it knows when it will have responsibility and
when it can and cannot pass matters on. There will need to be
co-operative arrangements and understandings between the regulators and
the NCC on how to handle complaints, who should do so and how to
resolve issues that could be handled by either or both. They will have
to identify in due course how the arrangements are working and I am
sure that that will be of direct interest to the consumer, who needs to
be confident that it is seamless. The consumer will need to understand
that a complaint that they register will be dealt with. Whether it is
handled by one or by the other will be a matter for the organisations,
but they will need to communicate that to the consumer so that the
consumer knows that their complaint is being handled and who they can
contact.</div>
					<a name="07041985000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the point
made by the hon. Member for Richmond Park, flows of information will be
established between the regulators, the redress schemes and Consumer
Direct under the redress provisions. I know that she has informally
raised matters about complaints handling procedures, and we shall deal
with those in detail later&#151;probably under clauses 47 to 52. We
are happy also to talk to her informally to give her as full an answer
as possible before the matters are raised in more detail in due

							<a name="07041985000230"></a>Susan
Kramer:
						</b> I wish to raise an issue similar to that which I
raised on the previous clause, but there is a slightly broader set of
questions here. With the disappearance of Postwatch, can the Minister
clarify which of its responsibilities the National Consumer Council
will pick up and which will be left to be picked up by Postcomm? He
will be conscious that Postwatch has effectively acted as the consumer
arm of Postcomm and that the situation has been a little different from
the energy utility arrangements.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column89" />Column number: 89</div>
					<a name="07041985000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">In that context, we are
particularly concerned by earlier discussions in the Committee. The
Minister will know that 90 per cent. of Royal Mail&#146;s activity is
related to businesses rather than domestic consumers, and there is a
new consultation on a proposal by Royal Mail to change its pricing to a
zonal basis. Yet in our earlier discussions there seemed to be a fair
amount of ambiguity about how much the National Consumer
Council&#146;s remit would include the importance of focusing on
business. It could, but it was clear that that played a secondary role
to that of the domestic consumer in the view of many Government
Members. A critical issue for business arises: where on earth will that
responsibility lie? Postcomm focuses on the licence criteria, which do
not capture any notion of consumer benefit or
disadvantage.</div>
					<a name="07041985000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">As in
the earlier clause, Postcomm will need to set up complaints standards.
Royal Mail has a modest complaints process, and in the past everyone
has relied on Postwatch to add a complaints arm. Postcomm will need to
develop and approve a proper complaints system. How does the Minister
envisage that process going forward so that we do not have a hideous
gap in the transition from one system to the
other?</div>

						</b> The hon. Lady raises several fair points. To
a certain extent, the hon. Member for Hertford and Stortford raised the
principle of working out the details of complaints handling procedures,
responsibility, accountability and communications, and that is work in
progress. I will be able to say a little more on that when we deal with
clause 16 stand part.</div>
					<a name="07041985000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am grateful that the hon.
Member for Richmond Park told me informally outside Committee that she
was going to raise the question of complaints&#151;business
complaints in particular. I know that we are going to have another
informal discussion in the interval today to ensure that we can give a
more substantive answer when we get to the part of the Bill that deals
with complaints handling and redress procedures. I hope that we can
deal with that matter in due course.</div>

specific power for the new council to investigate any matter relating
to the number and location of public post offices in the United
Kingdom. That specific function recognises the importance of the post
office network, and the valuable 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column90" />Column number: 90</div>work undertaken by Postwatch on the issue. It mirrors the provisions in
the Postal Services Act 2000. There is no change to, or weakening of,
the powers to protect consumer
interest.</div>
					<a name="07041985000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">Maintaining
the existing sectoral expertise in the postal services sector is vital
to the success of the new body, and we recognise the importance of that
in a sector that has only recently been opened up to competition.
Having a strong consumer advocate in the postal services sector, and
maintaining the sectoral expertise that Postwatch has built up and
which the new council will inherit are vital to the Government's
proposals for a sustainable post office
network.</div>
					<a name="07041985000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">As a result
of the clause, the new council will continue the role of Postwatch in
representing the views of consumers in the Post Office restructuring
programme, offering consumers a stronger voice on that and similar
issues that arise in other sectors. We envisage that the new
arrangements will be in place within a year of the Bill receiving Royal
Assent.</div>
					<a name="07041985000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
for Trade, my right hon. Friend the Member for Makerfield
(Mr. McCartney) referred yesterday to the project that is
under way to plan the implementation of this important Bill. He assured
the hon. Members for Hertford and Stortford and for Richmond Park that
we would keep them briefed on the work as it
progresses.</div>
					<a name="07041985000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">Postwatch
is fully engaged in early planning for implementation of the new
arrangements. Both the chair and chief executive attend the two groups
that have been set up to oversee implementation. Both groups meet
monthly, and also include representatives from Energywatch, the
National Consumer Council and the Office of Fair Trading. The groups
are tasked with ensuring that consumer interest continues to be
effectively represented both during the transition to the new
arrangements, and once the new arrangements are in place. Their
responsibilities include work on the timetable for
implementation.</div>
					<a name="07041985000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">Other
work undertaken by the groups so far includes: the mapping of existing
work; the transferral of resources and best practice to the new council
as well as additional work that the new council could usefully
undertake; the identification of tasks required to close down
Energywatch, Postwatch and the National Consumer Council; and early
planning to extend the Consumer Direct service to the energy and postal
services
sectors.</div>
					<a name="07041985000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						We
are taking great care to ensure that the work being undertaken by
Postwatch on Post Office network restructuring will not be disrupted
during the transition period. Additional staff and other resources are
being allocated to Postwatch to assist them with the programme, and
these resources will be carried forward into the new arrangements for
the duration of that
work.</div>
					<a name="07041985000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">We recognise the
importance that Postwatch places on the work of its regional
committees, and the role they will play in the assessment of the Post
Office network restructuring programme. The Bill makes specific
provision to enable the new council to establish regional committees
when it considers them to be beneficial to consumers. That is a matter
for the new council to determine, but as I have said, we are working
with the existing consumer bodies to plan for the implementation of the
new arrangements. I move that this clause stand part of the
Bill.</div>

							<a name="07041985000233"></a>Mr.
Prisk:
						</b>
						<b class="B"> </b>
						I am grateful to the
Minister for those opening remarks. However, I think that they focus
primarily on the transfer of where we are now to what is proposed in
the Bill rather than what is actually in the Bill. The closure of post
offices is clearly a matter of great concern to many of our
communities. The Minister will know about both the hurt and the anxiety
that the policies of the Government and Royal Mail are causing.
However, I do not propose to rehearse here all those arguments about
the way in which the Government&#146;s policy is failing many of our
communities. What I would like to do is to explore the issue and
thelikely operation of clause 16, particularly the phrase in
subsection
1:</div>
					
					<a name="07041985000192"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Without
prejudice to the generality of section 11, the Council may investigate
any matter relating
to&#151;</div>
					<a name="07041985000193"></a><div class="hs_brev">(a) the
number and location of public post
offices&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07041985000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is,
apparently, a very wide remit and it is welcome in that sense. However,
I would like to explore whatthe phrase means in practice. For
example, wouldthe council be able to investigate the rationale
of the Minister&#146;s policy and of Royal Mail&#146;s decisions in
the current round of planned closures? It is unlikely, I would have
thought, that every last closure under the current proposals will be
completed by the time that this measure comes into force. So, one would
like to know whether, in fact, this power would extend backwards, to
enable the council to examine something that is brought before it at
that point, albeit that the original policy may have occurred before
the Bill becomes law. That is one area I would like to
examine.</div>
					<a name="07041985000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is not
just a question of the retrospective nature of considering something
that happened before the Bill becomes law; it is a question of
examining the effect of that policy, which will still be current when
the Bill becomes law. I do not think that a defence of
&#147;It&#146;s retrospective, therefore we cannot look at
it&#148; would be sufficient. However, I would be interested to hear
the Minister&#146;s reply.</div>
					<a name="07041985000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						In
particular, thereafter would the council be able to investigate the
funding issues that Royal Mail would often cite as being a case for
future closures or relocations? Royal Mail is a public company and
therefore has certain matters of openness, but it will also have
certain matters of confidentiality, which Ministers often cite when
they debate these issues in the House. Further to that, if the relevant
papers are not forthcoming&#151;whether from Royal Mail, Post Office
Counters, or other related sub-units of the organisation, or indeed the
Department&#151;how will the council be able to secure those papers
in order to fulfil its investigations? I think that those are the
principal areas that I would like to explore with the Minister, if I
may.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07041985000234"></a>Susan
Kramer:
						</b>
						I would like to explore much
further the transition arrangements, as it were, that have been
described, and establish whether it is possible to put in place
transition arrangements that will be robust enough to deal with the
kind of pace of closure that is being proposed for the Post Office
network. Some 2,500 closures are proposed, the process will start in
the summer and extend over two years and that figure does not include
voluntary closures, which presumably will take place at the same time,
particularly if we continue to have the withdrawal of business from our
post offices, which makes it less and less economic for individuals to
remain as postmasters and sub-postmistresses.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column92" />Column number: 92</div>
					<a name="07041985000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The Minister
mentioned the regional structure that is so critically important to the
way that Postwatch currently responds to consumer needs and to issues
related to post office closures. As I understand it, I think that the
nine regional committee members, who I believe are all Government
appointees, will in effect lose their authority somewhere in the
process of this transition. I wonder if the Minister can help us to
understand how there will be some seamless flow of authority when these
various regional committees are playing such a key role in providing
advice. I understand that the consultation period for the closure of a
post office will be something like six weeks, which is a very short
period. If that period happens to coincide with the change in authority
and personnel, perhaps the Minister could give us some idea about how
that change will not disrupt the underlying purpose of the role that
Postwatch has played, which is the role that the National Consumer
Council intends to play in future.</div>
					
					<a name="07041985000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think that it is necessary to
put on record a great deal of concern about the fact that transition is
something that is easy to describe in theory, but very difficult to
implement, particularly at a time when a very significant piece of work
is being undertaken that is dependent on a part of the structure that
is not core to the activity of the National Consumer Council. The
principle that the Minister has described to us is of a national
council rather than a regional one. It provides the opportunity to
create regional, frequently ad hoc, committees, but that is not core to
the structure or to the functioning of the organisation. We need to put
on record that we are concerned about that.</div>
					<a name="07041985000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						All the
discussions have focused on the 2,500 post offices that we assume will
be closed with compensation under a forced closure programme. There has
been very little discussion of voluntary closures, however, which will
surely happen at a fairly rapid pace at the same time. There is no
clarity as to whether those post offices will be replaced or what will
replace them. We do not know whether they will be left closed provided
that that does not disrupt the access criteria. How on earth will the
new organisation cope with that process during the
transition?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07041985000235"></a>Jim
Fitzpatrick:
						</b> Opposition Members have raised entirely
legitimate concerns about certainty. The hon. Member for Hertford and
Stortford correctly described clause 16(1)(a) as wide-ranging. By way
of assurance to him, I say that the questions that he raised relate to
the independence of the new National Consumer Council, which we have
discussed. That thread will run through our discussion of additional
clauses later.</div>
					<a name="07041985000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						
						The
arrangements hand over from Postwatch to the new council the
examination that Postwatch has already made of the Government
proposals. It has been detailed work; I think that Postwatch made 199
recommendations during the course of the consultation, the results of
which are currently being assessed. The Secretary of State is due to
make a statement to the House in May, when we have got past purdah and
fully assessed the 2,500 responses that we have received. I hope that
it will be clear that there has been a thorough examination of the
conclusions that we set out in the consultation and how we reached
them, and of our response to the submissions that we have received.
That also relates to the point that the hon. Member for Richmond Park
raised.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column93" />Column number: 93</div>
					<a name="07041985000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">In his statement on 14 December,
the Secretary of State laid out the access criteria that we think are
appropriate for the Post Office. They will provide the template to
which the new National Consumer Council will hold the Government and
Post Office Ltd, by stating that there should be no further diminution.
There is concern about natural closures; there will always be natural
closures, because people retire or die and leases come to an end. That
will be a matter for Post Office Ltd to manage. The council will hold
it to account and protect the consumer&#146;s
interests.</div>

						 It is on the point of holding
the Government to account that I wish to pose a question. My hon.
Friend the Member for Hertford and Stortford stated that this is an
extremely wide-ranging clause. Were the council to conduct an
investigation into the number and location of post offices in England,
Wales or Scotland, and come to the conclusion that there were not
enough post offices, how would the Government be held to account and
persuaded that we needed
more?</div>

						</b>
						The hon. Gentleman tries to
draw me into a hypothetical discussion of &#147;what if?&#148; It
is a legitimate question. I think that it would be a matter on which
the council would have to engage with Government. If the council felt
that there was a deficiency in the number of post offices or in any
other area for which it thought that the Government was responsible, it
would use the dynamic of its relationship with the Government to deal
with
that.</div>
					
					<a name="07041985000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07041985000238"></a>Mr.

that the National Consumer Council had made it crystal clear that it
felt that the Government&#146;s policy was wrong and that post
offices needed to be reinstated?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07041985000239"></a>Jim
Fitzpatrick:
						</b> That brings me neatly on to the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s other, earlier points about catering for information
requests, the publication of those requests and how the council could
seek information. We will come on to those issues in clauses 24 and 25,
which include a clear power and expectation for the council to seek
information from licensees, for example. We will grant it a statutory
power to get information and publish reports. We will shortly come on
to the clause that deals with price sensitivity and commercial
confidence in the context of those who give evidence to the NCC or the
Secretary of State. They need to have the confidence that, while the
NCC has the power to seek their evidence and publish reports, they will
not be undermined in the market
place.</div>

					<a name="07041985000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">My final response to the hon.

which it believes to be in the interests of

Ellwood:
						</b>
						I am grateful to the Minister
for allowing us to probe a little further this small but hugely
significant clause. It clearly gives the council powers to investigate
the number and location of post offices. It would be helpful for the
Committee to understand where its 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column94" />Column number: 94</div>thoughts, recommendations or investigative reports might lead. If they
are simply going to be put into a file and not presented to the public
or discussed by a committee, we have to ask why the clause is there. It
is there for a reason, and that is to enable the public to understand
what the recommendations are. We need to know whether, when those
recommendations have been made, the Government will be held to account
and whether any action will follow.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07041985000241"></a>Jim
Fitzpatrick:
						</b> The answer to the hon. Gentleman lies in the
certainty that the new NCC will be able to act independently. It will
be able to publish information and reports as it wishes. It will then
be a matter for public representatives, should they think it
appropriate, to hold Government to account.</div>
					<a name="07041985000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">I cannot imagine my colleagues
seeing a report from the NCC that says that the Government have got
something dreadfully wrong and sitting there quietly. They will take us
to task, and I guarantee that the Opposition Benches will be in uproar.
In setting out the powers and the statutory responsibilities of the new
NCC, we are ensuring that there will be opportunities through all the
mechanisms of Parliament for the Government to be held to account
should the NCC challenge them on any matter for which they are
responsible. Nothing is being hidden
here.</div>

						</b> I shall get back to the hon. Gentleman on
that, and advise the Committee. My instinct says that that would not be
an expectation. Later clauses give the NCC the ability to seek
information and evidence. The Trade and Industry Committee has the
opportunity to call Ministers to account, and I am sure that it will
consider any report that is published in due course as closely as it
already does those published by bodies such as Postwatch. It will
certainly hold Ministers to account by requiring them to give
evidence.</div>

to the civil courts and regulators, and mechanisms will be put in place
to ensure that it is possible to obtain information that has been

offices in England and Wales. We press the point that it will only be a
matter of time before such a

						There is an adjournment
debate on post offices in Westminster Hall next Tuesday morning. If any
of my colleagues wish to join me there it will be their first
opportunity to carry on this discussion on post office closures. There
will be another opportunity after the Secretary of State has made a
statement to the House following the consultation exercise, to which we
have had 2,500 responses. Post Office Ltd., with the assistance of
Postwatch, will then engage in consultation with parliamentarians and
local authorities. There will be opportunities to scrutinise the
process of the restructuring programme as it progresses. Common sense
dictates that the transition from the present arrangements to the new
arrangements for this very important core part of the work programme
should be as seamless and efficient as

want, retrospectively, to look at what has gone before, or already been
undertaken, and given that Postwatch will be centrally involved. I am

markers, as the hon. Member for Hertford and Stortford did, we are in
danger of extending the ambit and remit of the NCC to the area of
social policy? If post office closures are defined on commercial terms
within a set template, but there is undoubtedly a social policy and a
social impact dimension to the closures, would it be appropriate or
fair for the NCC to have to widen its remit to consider all those
supernumerary issues? That is the role of Parliament; it is the
commercial viability and the service delivered to the consumer that
should be the prime remit of the

extensive investigative powers. It will determine its own work
programme and it will be independent in deciding what it wants to look
at. I am not going to anticipate that it will want to revisit the
Government&#146;s decisions from the full statement in December, as
that will be a matter for the NCC. I would be surprised if it did so,

						</b> I thank the Minister for giving way, as I want to
respond to the comments made by the hon. Member for Ealing, North
(Stephen Pound). In the past, there has been a fairly generous
interpretation of Postwatch&#146;s responsibility to the consumer,
which includes many social issues. It is not merely a matter of whether
the post office gives people a decent service in the narrow sense of
whether it sells stamps efficiently. The post office has a recognised
social role in termsof the viability of communities and of
vulnerable consumers, which I understood to be a significant part of
its remit. That certainly comes into the social arena. Could the
Minister to confirm whether he now sees the NCC as having a narrower
role in that regard because that would raise some serious concerns for
us? Where will that missing piece of activity&#151;representation and
advocacy&#151;go if it does not fall within the remit of the

tabled an amendment specifically on this issue. My hon. Friend the
Member for Ealing, North was saying that there is a particular role for
the new NCC, there is a role for Postwatch and we are not moving away
from that. It has strong consumer interests. It has independence of

territory where my hon. Friend says it does not have a role. It is not
a social policy think tank, it is there to be the advocate and champion
for consumers. If it is in the consumer interest, which may well be
very wide, it has a role and it will be up to it to determine what its
work programme should be and what it wants to publish. But to give it
the role described in the hon. Lady&#146;s amendment would go too

						</b> These two probing amendments seek to establish just
how open the Government will be in requiring reports. We believe that
maximum transparency is vital. It is vital for the council if it is to
have authority and it is also important for the consumer as a whole.
The Secretary of State should not therefore be in a position to cherry
pick which reports get published or, for that matter, to be seen to
cherry pick. The way in which a Secretary of State might reasonably
make a decision is
important.</div>
					<a name="07041985000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have
just discussed the obvious controversy of the post offices, but there
are other areas where there will be tension and there is an
understandable problem. Take the question of food safety and consumer
information. Quite understandably a Government may say that there are
serious and complex issues about food safety. I recognise, as most hon.
Members probably do, that there is no such thing as no risk. But in the
area of food safety there will always be a problem because it can often
get misreported. It is often overblown in the media and can frighten
people. There will be a natural tension there and Ministers may wish to
think carefully about how information on food safety issues is
released. Obviously the NCC will have a narrower remit. Its purpose
will be to ensure that it can produce consumer information, of whatever
character.</div>
					<a name="07041985000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">The purpose
of amendment No. 17 is to establish the NCC&#146;s independence. As I
say, these are probing amendments. I want to explore with the Minister
how the Government would approach the issue, because it is an important
area on which we need some clarity. When the Bill is passed and becomes
law, there is a clear understanding about how the Government would
approach that kind of more awkward situation in which Ministers will be
acting, quite reasonably, on scientific advice, but where there will be
a potential&#151;this is what we are concerned about&#151;that the
ability to have flexibility may not be in the interests of the
Government of the day.</div>

Fitzpatrick:
						</b>
						The amendments concern a
discretion of the Secretary of State not to publish a report prepared
for him by the new council under clause 18. That issue has already been
extensively debated in the other place, and I am sure that the hon.
Gentleman has looked at that. It was clear from that debate that the
concern here is essentially about the need for transparency in the
Government&#146;s dealings with the new council, and the need for
public accountability, because of the tensions that have been correctly
described by the hon. Gentleman. I would like to reiterate that the
Government are in total agreement with those intentions, and we have 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column98" />Column number: 98</div>made the case that the discretion afforded to the Secretary of State not
to publish a report prepared for him by the council impacts in no way
on either of those principles. The point to note here is that the
discretion under clause 18 for the Secretary of State in relation to
the publication of a report is necessary to deal with particular
circumstances, such as instances where the report contained sensitive
information that was commercially confidential or price-sensitive. That
is not a new concept, and would apply in circumstances in which, for
example, disclosure of information provided by a company would weaken
its position in a competitive environment by revealing market-sensitive
information or information of potential usefulness to its
competitors.</div>
					<a name="07041985000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Under clause
29, the council will have to consult a business or individual if a
report that it makes contains business or personal information before
that is disclosed in the report. The value of the report to the
Secretary of State might be significantly diminished if the information
were not contained in the report. However, in those circumstances the
Secretary of State would have to consider whether it was right to
publish the report.</div>
					<a name="07041985000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">Section 244 in part 9 of the
Enterprises Act 2002 sets out considerations that apply where a public
authority is considering disclosing certain specified information,
including commercial information whose disclosure the public authority
thinks might significantly harm the legitimate business of the
undertaking to which it relates, or information relating to the private
affairs of an individual whose disclosure might significantly harm the
individual&#146;s interests. That provision applies generally to the
disclosure of information obtained by the council under the Bill, but
not to reports of the council, where the different provisions that I
have mentioned in clause 29(5) apply.</div>
					<a name="07041985000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">Information of a confidential
nature might be necessary to support the recommendations in a report. A
requirement on the Secretary of State to publish every report submitted
by him might create a deterrent effect on external experts or
stakeholders, who might be reluctant to provide particular information
because it might be published. It is not inconceivable that a report
prepared by the new council for the Secretary of State could contain
such information that was given on condition that it would not be
published.</div>
					<a name="07041985000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						A key
consideration here is that there may be good reasons why the content of
reports prepared and submitted to the Secretary of State to aid the
decision-making process should not be published. The decision not to
publish a report in those circumstances would be to protect the
confidences of individuals and businesses, not for the purpose of
protecting Government.</div>
					<a name="07041985000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 18 must be viewed in the
wider context of the other clauses that give the new council the
statutory basis to carry out its duties. The need for the new council
to be able to act without being constrained is fundamental to what we
are trying to achieve with the introduction of these measures, and is
in no way compromised by the powers given to the Secretary of State by
the clause. It is not about taking away from the new council; it is
about allowing the council to give relevant information to
Government.</div>
					<a name="07041985000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						If the
council determines that the issue of the report that it has prepared
for Government under clause 18 is one of interest to consumers more
generally, and the Secretary of State has decided not to publish that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column99" />Column number: 99</div>report, the council can choose to exercise its powers elsewhere within
the Bill, such as under clause 17 or clause 19.</div>
					<a name="07041985000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 17 enables the council
to prepare and publish a report on any matter falling within the scope
of its functions. Clause 19 enables the council to publish advice or
information about consumer matters for the purpose of bringing issues
of importance to the attention of the consumer.</div>
					<a name="07041985000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">A report prepared under the
powers in clause 17, for example, which covered the same issue as a
report prepared under clause 18, could be published without information
that was considered to be sensitive and in a format that may be more in
line with the needs of consumers. That matter would be one for the
discretion of the council, but with those reassurances. The council,
therefore, has the ability to determine what it publishes, but the
Secretary of State has some discretion in being able to withhold
information that may be price-sensitive. I hope that reassures the hon.
Gentleman.</div>

						</b> I think we can generally expect that the
intention will be more to publish than not to. The qualifications I
gave are examples that may not be entirely exclusive, but are sensible
ones, which are pretty de rigueur for Government reports. I think that
the reassurances in clauses 17 and 19 give the hon. Gentleman the
safeguards that he is seeking. If the council thinks that it would help
and be appropriate for consumer protection and interests to publish, it
can do so regardless of what the Government
say.</div>

Kramer:
						</b> I thank the Minister. The Liberal Democrats have
fully supported the two amendments. In those circumstances, if the
Minister&#146;s only intent is to provide protection for necessary
commercial information, which should not be shared because of detriment
to the provider or to an organisation, would he consider introducing
such language into clause 18(2), to make that clearer? We live in a
cynical world, and when a clause allows so much scope not to publish,
no matter what the intent, if the intent is so narrow, why not include
it in the language? Indeed, why not incorporate the language from the
Enterprise
Act?</div>

was particularly grateful to the Minister, in response to my

State will be grateful that he did not make it absolutely
clear&#151;that the intention would normally be to publish rather
than not. With that on the record, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the

feel that it would be appalling if the NCC held information that was in

narrowly one defines the interests of consumers. It is a probing
amendment. We are asking the Government whether the clause is a bit too
limiting. It could be argued that anything could be defined as being in
the public interest. We are seeking a bit of clarity about how the
Minister defines what is in the interests of consumers and how that
differs from the public interest.</div>

similar capture of my emotions on this occasion. She makes a powerful
case, but does she not accept that for the council to publish advice or
information, it must produce that advice or information anyway? If it
produces it, surely it will not decide not to publish it. Is she not 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column101" />Column number: 101</div>talking about dissemination rather than publication? If the NCC calls in
a piece of work and produces it, it will not then sit on it.

&#147;shall&#148;, it will remove a fear in the minds of some of us
who might be slightly sceptical about an automatic requirement or the

but on having a time backstop in
itself.</div>

						Clause 20 requires
the council and the designated bodies that are referred to in this
clause&#151;namely, the Office of Fair Trading, the Financial
Services Authority&#146;s Consumer Panel, and the Consumer Panel of
the Office of Communications&#151;to enter into co-operation
arrangements, and it includes provisions relating to such arrangements.
The Secretary of State can require other bodies to enter into
co-operation arrangements by designating them by order.</div>
					<a name="07041985000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Amendment No.
18 appears to be based on a misunderstanding of clause 20(2). These
co-operation arrangements are not about making appointments to the new
council; they are about specifying which bodies the council must work
with in the exercise of its functions, and are intended to encourage
effective communication channels, collaborative working, and to provide
an effective interface between the council and others where functions
and responsibilities coincide or overlap.</div>
					<a name="07041985000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">The word &#147;person&#148;
in clause 20(2)(d) is used in all legislation&#151;and certainly in
this legislation&#151;as shorthand for individuals and persons,
corporate or unincorporated. The word has that meaning throughout the
Bill. During the debate at our first sitting, the Minister for Trade
explained that the definition of &#147;consumer&#148; as a person
who uses or receives goods or services includes persons corporate or
unincorporated.</div>
					<a name="07041985000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Over time, it
may be necessary to consider widening the co-operation arrangements to
include other bodies, and, in such circumstances, the Secretary of
State may designate others, such as other consumer bodies, to be
subject to these provisions. It is envisaged that such decisions would
be taken after appropriate consultation, and entry into new
co-operation arrangements would happen as a consequence. I hope that
that explanation clarifies that
point.</div>

that, in almost every instance, the Government will have in mind a

individual.</div>

be an individual, but it may be an office holder. In that regard, it
will be person who is a

unincorporated.</div>

						Amendment No.
19 also relates to clause 20 and to the requirement for the council and
a designated body to prepare a memorandum setting out the co-operation
arrangements between them as soon as is practicable after agreement is
reached on the arrangements. Amendment No. 19 changes that so that a
memorandum has to be prepared no later than six months after agreement
is reached on co-operation arrangements. We see no reason why the new
council and a designated body would not prepare a memorandum of
agreement and send a copy of it to the Secretary of State at the
earliest possible opportunity. The Secretary of State would certainly
want to know the reasons for any delay. The imposition, or opportunity,
of a time limit would give the wrong impression of how the process
should work. Any time limit specified could end up being seen as a
target, and could result in the memorandum being sent to the Secretary
of State later and not sooner. Therefore, we cannot accept amendments
Nos. 18 and 19, and we request that the movers consider their
withdrawal.</div>

amendment No. 18. I am not entirely confident that he has answered
amendment No. 19, although he has demonstrated that the Government

						</b> Given that these co-operation arrangements
are being negotiated, common sense suggests that signing a memorandum
of understanding would be the last thing to be done. Therefore, there
is an expectation that almost the first thing to be done after signing
it would be to send a copy to the Secretary of State. That is why we
are saying that six months does not really make sense. We think that it
will be a great deal sooner. I know that the intent is genuine but
&#147;as soon as practicable&#148; is more
appropriate.</div>

						This amendment relates, as
the hon. Gentleman said, to clause 22, the council&#146;s voluntary
activities and functions in this part of the Bill. Clause 22
(4) (b) provides for the new national consumer council to acquire an
interest in a company with a view to exercising its function under this
clause. Following debates in the other place, a Government amendment
was moved to make the council&#146;s power to acquire an interest in
a body corporate subject to the approval of the Secretary of State. As
a body which is part-funded by the taxpayer, there will be a duty on
the council to satisfy certain requirements regarding its financial
dealings. Having to obtain the Secretary of State&#146;s approval for
expenditure in this area ensures that there is a consistent approach to
proposed expenditure across all aspects of the council&#146;s
functions.</div>
					<a name="07041985000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I am pleased
to say&#151;and this might surprise the hon. Gentleman&#151;that
the Government accept, in principle, his probing amendment laid to
clause 22 of the Bill, that the Secretary of State must publish the
reason for any approval given to a request by the new NCC to acquire an
interest in a body corporate. This will ensure that any decisions taken
are transparent and open to public scrutiny. Having considered this
matter, I can advise him and the Committee that we intend to bring
forward a Government amendment to like effect on Report on the basis
that we believe that the drafting could be technically improved. I hope
that, with this assurance, the hon. Gentleman will be minded to
withdraw his amendment.</div>

						I have a couple of points that I
wish to raise on the clause as a whole without wishing to detract in
any way from the genial state of our discussion. This is a broadly
worded clause which enables the council to undertake a wide range of
paid and unpaid research and related activities. Subsection 3, as
members of the Committee will see, says that the council
may:</div>
					<a name="07041985000199"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Spend
such sums as it considers reasonable&#148;.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column106" />Column number: 106</div>
					<a name="07041985000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">I entirely accept, and we have
always argued, that the council must be independent. However, it would
be helpful if the Minister confirmed that he is confident that there
are satisfactory management and audit oversight provisions to ensure
that, as public money is involved, it is to a standard that our
constituents would expect.</div>
					<a name="07041985000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">Turning to subsection 4, the
council is allowed to set up a limited company to exercise a particular
function. This is, again, quite a wide power. If that company were to
fail or to face significant liabilities, how would the Secretary of
State be able to intervene; or is it the intention that the Secretary
of State should not intervene?</div>

necessary assurances that the Government&#146;s strict accounting
guidelines will be adhered to. On responsibility and liability, any
companies set up would be limited companies and would therefore have
limited liabilities, so there would be protection. The arrangements
laid down for the council contain protections both for the public in
how finance is expended and for the council in any exposure to
liability that it might have.</div>
