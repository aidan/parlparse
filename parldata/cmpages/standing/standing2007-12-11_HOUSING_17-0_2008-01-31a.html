are into the last lap. The new clause relates to housing association
and local authority tenants who want to move in or out of their
constituencies, and it is modelled on other previous schemes. People
often want to move from one constituency to another. No doubt members
of the Committee have met constituents who are anxious to move to
another part of the country, perhaps because of an elderly parent who
lives elsewhere, work or the need to move near to their parents for
help with child care. People have many social and economic reasons for
wanting to transfer their social housing.</div>
					<a name="08013162000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">Without mobility, we end up
with families in the wrong size houses. Unlike owner-occupiers or
tenants who can move more flexibly, it is sometimes difficult for
people in social housing to move property, because of the lack of a
proper scheme to help them to do so. Many members of the Committee will
recall that my right hon. Friend the Member for North-West Hampshire,
who cannot be here today, introduced the national mobility scheme when
he was Minister in 1981&#151;it was launched by local authorities and
new towns in England and Wales. In the 1990s, again under my right hon.
Friend, the Housing Mobility and Exchange Service, HOMES, took

apparent mismanagement. The remaining staff of HOMES, which had been

and the requirement for the Thames Gateway to assist with housing
pressures, and possibly to fill the homes with people who have moved

very speedily indeed. The current framework is really not acceptable;
the existing machinery has collapsed and there is no realistic
opportunity for social tenants in many parts of the country to move
outside their area...I am afraid that this is a very serious
position, and it is wholly in

the moment for the Government to act. There seems to
be a consensus, pretty much on both sides of the House but certainly
within the Government, on this issue. In that light, I ask the Minister
carefully to consider new clause 6. If he does not feel able to accept
it at this stage, then perhaps we can return to it on Report, because
it would genuinely improve the
Bill.</div>

						<a name="08013162000224"></a>
							<b class="B">Margaret
Moran</b> (Luton, South) (Lab): We are
coming to the conclusion of this Bill. Many people are pleased about
that, so I shall keep my contribution brief. I know what my right hon.
Friend the Member for North-West Hampshire would say, if he were here,
although I do not support the amendment. As the hon. Member for Welwyn
Hatfield has said, the Government intend to rectify the absence of a
mobility scheme. I simply want to put some fire in their belly and to
urge some speed on the matter. If my right hon. Friend the Member for
North-West Hampshire were here, he would remind us that the HOMES
scheme, which was the main mobility scheme for RSL tenants, lasted for
many years. Among the many schemes it comprised were things like the
seaside and country homes scheme, from which many of my constituents
benefited. Indeed, when I was chair of housing in Lewisham, we used
that scheme very successfully to tackle under-occupation. It addressed
the issues of elderly people who needed to be near relatives or who
wanted to retire to a place where they felt more comfortable, thus
releasing family-sized homes in Lewisham.</div>
					<a name="08013162000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">Parts of the scheme were
successful, but it has to be acknowledged that the HOMES scheme itself
was not entirely successful, because the levels of mobility were never
as high as intended and the relationship between different RSLs was
rather cumbersome. I remember in my own housing association the
difficulties in matching properties between housing association
tenants. Many housing associations have very small numbers of units
scattered across large areas&#151;either across London or, in some
cases, across parts of the country. That applies in my constituency,
where we do not have major stocks of RSL units. We have several RSLs
that have relatively small numbers of units, which makes mobility
within the borough almost impossible. As our Luton housing strategy
states, there is no way in which we can tackle housing within our
borough boundaries.</div>
					<a name="08013162000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
great deal of our hope for that strategy rests on the Bill and on the
Milton Keynes-south midlands growth area, but before that scheme comes
to fruition, we have an acute crisis where we simply cannot accommodate
people within the borough boundary. Furthermore, people who need to
move for employment purposes are finding it incredibly difficult,
particularly if they are RSL tenants. I have cases upon cases&#151;I
had another 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column694" />Column number: 694</div>one again this week&#151;where large families in RSL accommodation,
many of whom are very overcrowded, need to move either for employment
reasons or because they are severely overcrowded and large units simply
do not exist within the borough. They are prepared to
move outside the borough to accommodate their
family&#146;s needs, but they cannot do that because of the
difficulties of moving between RSLs. They therefore find themselves in
a situation where they are playing ping-pong, being passed between the
RSL and the local authority in trying to find somewhere suitable for
their
needs.</div>
					<a name="08013162000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
absence of a proper mobility system does not make it for easy for
people who are in extreme housing circumstances, people who need to
move for employment reasons and elderly people who need to be near
their family for caring purposes. We know that the replacement for
HOMES was not the best success, to put it politely. Let us be frank: it
was a pig&#146;s ear of a system that simply did not work&#151;we
all have to be frank. Lots of money was put into a system that was
clearly not capable of dealing with
it.</div>
					<a name="08013162000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">If we are honest,
since then we have all to a large extent recoiled from looking at the
issue, because, having experienced such an unsuccessful system, the
complexity of trying to establish another system has
put this debate on the back burner. That is a tragedy, because it is
not beyond the wit of the Government to come up with a system that can
work, despite the unfortunate occurrence with the replacement to
HOMES.</div>
					<a name="08013162000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">The former
Minister for Housing, now the Chief Secretary to the Treasury,
indicated that she was in favour of a regional choice-based lettings
scheme. I accept that there is a role for such a scheme, but I simply
point out that in many areas we have not even got to a local
choice-based lettings scheme. In my constituency, the housing
department is considering one, but we have not got there, and my hon.
Friend the Minister has indicated that the situation is the same in his
local authority. We are some way off having even local schemes from
which to build a regional choice-based
system.</div>
					<a name="08013162000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">I stress the
urgency of the issue. This Bill and the Hills report, which has been
mentioned, stress the need for mobility within the social housing
sector, a point with which we all agree because we see it in our
casework on a day-to-day basis. If we are to make that a reality, we
need to do it speedily. I am not convinced that waiting for local
authorities to get up to speed with local choice-based lettings systems
and then trying to build a regional choice-based lettings system on top
of that will have the speedy impact that we need. I therefore urge the
Minister to consider how we can find a replacement on a national level
that has a regional choice-based lettings system built into it and that
is based on the principle of a choice-based lettings system&#151;such
systems are extremely effective, when they work well. We need a
national system.</div>
					<a name="08013162000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
fact that we have had a rather painful time with the replacement of
HOMES should not undermine the fact that we need a replacement, and we
need it as speedily as possible, if we are to achieve the aims set out
in this
Bill.</div>

						<a name="08013162000225"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Nick Raynsford</b> (Greenwich and Woolwich) (Lab): I reiterate
the point about the importance of mobility. The hon. Member for Welwyn
Hatfield was 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column695" />Column number: 695</div>kind enough to quote me at great length on the subject, so I need not
add much more, other than to say that there have been mobility schemes
of various forms for a long time. Way back before HOMES, there were
other arrangements.</div>
					<a name="08013162000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">As my hon. Friend the Member
for Luton, South has rightly highlighted, the difficulty with schemes
that relate to only one type of landlord or to one area is that they
often fail to promote mobility on the scale that is needed. There is a
need to bring those schemes
together.</div>
					<a name="08013162000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">Many
years ago, in a previous incarnation, I was involved in setting up a
housing association mobility scheme which went under the happy name of
HALO, the housing association liaison office. That was limited to
housing associations, which was not sufficient, so it had to be widened
to bring in local authorities. London is currently exploring the
options for a mobility scheme. Good progress has been made with a
commitment of, I think, 5 per cent. of the housing stock from all the
participating London boroughs. This is a good commitment to trying to
ensure a sufficient number of homes to give momentum to the objective,
but that is limited to London.</div>
					<a name="08013162000159"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent">I press my hon. Friend
the Minister to give a positive response to the new clause, because it
is about meeting a need and the current arrangements are
unsatisfactory. The collapse of Move UK was deplorable and I do not
think that it will go down in the annals as one of the finer
administrative performances of this Government. I wholeheartedly
endorse the view expressed by the right hon. Member for South-West
Hampshire. [<span class="SmallCaps">Hon. Members:</span>
&#147;North-West.&#148;] I always get it wrong. I endorse the view
expressed by the right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire that
something must be done. The Member for South-West Bedfordshire is no
longer with us. [<span class="SmallCaps">Hon. Members:</span>
&#147;North-East.&#148;] The hon. Member for North-East

stop digging, but I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will provide
a favourable

							<a name="08013162000227"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local
Government (Mr. Iain Wright):
						</b> Good morning to
you, Mr. Benton, and the rest of the Committee. I fully
understand the intention and purpose behind the new clause tabled by
the hon. Member for Welwyn Hatfield. I agree with the hon. Member for
Montgomeryshire that there is a political consensus about it. I and the
Government agree that mobility is important; we have already announced
measures to increase opportunities for people to move, and I will come
to those shortly. The ability to fund such mobility schemes is already
contained in section 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column696" />Column number: 696</div>168 of the Local Government and Housing Act 1989, which gives the
Secretary of State the power to make grants or loans towards the cost
of arrangements for enabling or assisting tenants to move in England,
Wales or Scotland. Therefore, although I agree with everything that has
been said in Committee this morning, the new clause is unnecessary. I
want to set out the Government&#146;s policy on record. The
Government are committed to improving and increasing the options to
move available to social housing tenants. As the hon. Member for Welwyn
Hatfield has said and my hon. Friend the Member for Luton, South has
reiterated, the benefits to individual tenants are obvious to us all.
Grandparents want to move to be with their grandchildren, families want
to be closer together and people want to move to take up employment
opportunities and we should facilitate that as much as
possible.</div>
					<a name="08013162000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">Mobility is
also important for the wider social housing agenda. Enabling an elderly
person to move from a property that is perhaps too big for their needs
to a smaller home nearer to their grandchildren creates a vacant
property that can be used for an overcrowded family. We debated the
importance of freeing up such properties to help relieve overcrowding
when we were discussing new clauses 13 to 33 last week. In that
respect, there is an awful lot to do and I do not want to reiterate the
points that have been made already about the difficulties with previous
national mobility schemes. Where we are now and where we are heading
towards are the important points to
address.</div>
					<a name="08013162000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Chief
Secretary to the Treasury, my right hon. Friend the Member for
Pontefract and Castleford (Yvette Cooper), when she was Minister for
Housing and Planning, set out in December last month the
Government&#146;s programme for making social housing fairer, more
effective and more personal. As I have said, we recognise that that is
not meeting the needs of all tenants and mobility plays an important
part in changing that, but we want to learn from the mistakes of the
past. We need to avoid them and we need to ensure that we meet the
needs of those who require social housing and those who want to move
within and into social housing. The number of new lettings in the
social housing sector fell from 591,200 in 1998-89 to 409,400 in
2005-06, and that has reduced the number of opportunities for people to
move. Most moves are now local, and arranged by landlords. The
proportion of moves through a mobility scheme as a percentage of
overall lets fell between 1998-99 and 2005-06 from 1.48 per cent. to
0.36 per cent. so there is a challenge there and we need to increase
the number of moves. There are three broad areas of mobility that need
addressing, which my hon. Friend the Member for Luton, South touched
on, and we have already taken steps to improve opportunities in each.
Those three areas are local, sub-regional and
national.</div>
					<a name="08013162000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">At the local
level, research by Ipsos MORI on barriers to mobility has shown that
most tenants wishing to move want to do so locally, staying within five
miles of their existing home, and enabling them to retain social and
cultural ties. That certainly seems true of my own
constituency.</div>
					<a name="08013162000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">Existing social housing tenants
seeking a move currently have to demonstrate that they have a
particular housing need, in order to be rehoused in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column697" />Column number: 697</div>another area in the same way as new applicants on the waiting list. Some
local authorities already give priority to their tenants who wish to
downsize. However, this is not currently a national reasonable
preference category, and some authorities do not take this into account
in their allocation scheme. We want to ensure that all local
authorities offer their tenants the opportunity to
downsize.</div>
					<a name="08013162000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">We recognise
that many tenants will want to remain living in the family home where
they raised their children, and they will be able to do so. However, we
need to ensure that the existing housing stock is used to best
effect&#151;the subject of a very good debate on overcrowding we had
in Committee last week. We want to ensure that tenants have the
opportunity to downsize&#151;wherever they live&#151;so that large
family homes can be allocated to families with children, or those
living in overcrowded
conditions.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08013162000228"></a>Margaret
Moran:
						</b> I thank my hon. Friend for that. It is important
that priority is given to homes that are under-occupied, to release
family homes. When my right hon. Friend, the Member for North-West
Hampshire and I spent many a happy year on the HOMES scheme, our
priority was housing need. I notice that some London authorities are
talking about moving away from housing need as the main priority for
allocating housing in future. Will my hon. Friend take this
opportunity&#151;notwithstanding what he has just said&#151;to
re-emphasise the fact that housing need will be the main criteria,
rather than any others that seem to be emerging from some London
authorities?</div>
					<a name="08013162000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08013162000229"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> That is an important point. I want to make sure
that everybody, regardless of status, has the appropriate house. As I
said, some people may need assistance to achieve that. We have
reiterated time and again in this Committee the need to ensure that
houses that are too large for people&#146;s current needs are
allocated accordingly. That helps free up supply of housing to allow
new families to come in. As I said, we want to retain as much as
possible.</div>
					<a name="08013162000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
constituency will be very similar to others in that I often think of
it&#151;I talk about Sheffield in a similar way&#151;as the largest
village in the
world.</div>
					<a name="08013162000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="08013162000230"></a>
							<b class="B">Ms
Angela C. Smith</b> (Sheffield, Hillsborough) (Lab): Sheffield
is.</div>
					<a name="08013162000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08013162000231"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> My hon. Friend says that Sheffield is. People do
want to stay in close areas&#151;to be close to their families; their
children and grandchildren. Time and time again, a grandmother comes to
see me and says &#147;I am living in a three-bedroom council house
and would like a bungalow close to my family. So that the grandchildren
can stay, I need two bedrooms. I also would like to stay in the same
area, as that will enable my daughter to go out to work.&#148; That
is crucial. Such a move increases employment opportunities and we need
to be doing as much as possible to ensure that it can happen. I think
that is the real challenge to any local, sub-regional or national
mobility scheme.</div>
					<a name="08013162000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">May I
go on to sub-regional allocations? Choice-based letting schemes give
people the flexibility to choose where they want to live in an area,
and then to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column698" />Column number: 698</div>bid for properties. My right hon. Friend the previous Minister for
Housing and Planning announced in December that we would take this
further with the investment of &#163;1.8 million to deliver 18 new
choice-based letting sub-regional schemes, which give people the
opportunity to move across local authority borders.
</div>
					<a name="08013162000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">To take my own
particular area as an example, Hartlepool is part of the Tees Valley,
and it could be that the vast majority of people who want to move, want
to do so within the boundaries of Hartlepool local authority. However,
there will be a number of people whose families have moved to
Middlesbrough or Stockton and they will want to move within that
sub-region. So we need to help that as much as
possible.</div>
					<a name="08013162000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">An
additional &#163;2 million investment over the next two years will
enable all councils to be part of such a sub-regional scheme by 2010.
Eleven schemes are already up and running and the others will be active
by 2010. Cross-boundary mobility is planned in 86 per cent. of these
schemes, with most proposing to put aside a percentage of their lets
for sub-regional mobility moves.</div>
					<a name="08013162000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">Such schemes as Home Selector
in Guildford, Hart, Rushmore and Waverley have already ring-fenced a
set 10 per cent. of the housing supply for cross-boundary mobility
moves. Other schemes, including those in East Devon and the Derbyshire
Dales, High Peak and Amber Valley, enable all home-seekers to apply for
properties across all the local authorities involved.</div>
					<a name="08013162000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government have agreed
funding of &#163;760,000 over the next two years for the
implementation of a London-wide accessible housing register as part of
the pan-London choice. It is known as Capital Moves. This offers people
the chance to move across different London authorities. London councils
will deliver Capital Moves and are encouraging participation from all
33 London boroughs. The Capital Moves partners also include other
stakeholders, such as the Greater London Authority, the Housing
Corporation and relevant registered social
landlords.</div>
					<a name="08013162000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are a
further 14 sub-regional schemes in development, of which five schemes
include the ring-fencing of between 5 and 25 per cent. of the housing
supply for mobility purposes. Four other local authorities have already
committed to allowing sub-regional mobility applicants to bid for any
of their available housing supply. The remainder are considering the
level of commitment to mobility. So the main mechanism for local and
sub-regional moves is well established, with schemes already funded in
65 per cent. of local authorities and additional investment available
to other local authorities by
2010.</div>
					<a name="08013162000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have
discussed sub-regions, so now I come on to national schemes. Our
challenge is to make sure that we can meet the needs of those who wish
to move nationally, from one sub-region to another, and that is a big
challenge. We are working with the Housing Corporation and key social
landlords and authorities to develop proposals for increasing mobility
across the country. For example, we are looking at whether a percentage
of lets should be reserved and pooled for those looking to move further
afield. My hon. Friend the Member for Luton, South mentioned the
seaside and country homes mobility scheme. We have recently relaunched
that scheme; it gives elderly tenants in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column699" />Column number: 699</div>London the opportunity to downsize and move to more suitable and
preferred locations. Since its relaunch some six months ago, this
scheme has given more than 150 older tenants the opportunity to move
and resulted in the freeing up of much-needed and often under-occupied
properties in London. We are evaluating options for expanding
nationally the work done by that scheme and other mobility
options.</div>
					<a name="08013162000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">So
if I can sum up, I suggest with the greatest respect to the hon. Member
for Welwyn Hatfield that new clause 6 is unnecessary because we already
have the legislative power to fund a national mobility scheme. Let me
stress again the Government&#146;s commitment and my own personal
commitment to this. Mobility is a key priority for this Government, but
I am very keen to avoid the mistakes of the past. We have already taken
action to increase opportunities for local and sub-regional moves and
we have put in place specific work and projects to determine the best
way to deliver national housing
mobility.</div>
					<a name="08013162000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="08013162000232"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Andrew Love</b> (Edmonton) (Lab/Co-op): The only reason I rise
is to emphasise the importance given in the Hills review to the need
for national mobility for economic reasons. While I accept what my hon.
Friend the Minister has said about local and sub-regional mobility, it
does appear from what he has said that perhaps not enough priority is
being given to an effective national mobility scheme. It seems sensible
to take a certain percentage of property in order to achieve that, but
can he give us some more reassurance that this is a major priority for
the
Government?</div>
					<a name="08013162000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08013162000233"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> Yes, it is a major priority because a progressive
Government should facilitate social mobility to ensure greater economic
prosperity. This is absolutely key, and as I have said, the vast
majority of moves will be local and sub-regional, but it is important,
as my hon. Friend the Member for Edmonton rightly says, that for
economic purposes we have that national scheme. It has not worked well
in the past, and as we move the Hills agenda forward in the next few
months and years I do see it as a major priority to tap into the talent
and enterprise of everybody in this country and ensure that they can
take advantage of opportunities and achieve prosperity. National
mobility schemes are a way to do that, so it will become even more of a
priority for this Labour
Government.</div>
					<a name="08013162000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope I
have explained the policy. There is cross-party consensus on this very
important issue, and I hope the hon. Gentleman will not press his new
clause.</div>

Shapps:
						</b> I thank the Minister for what
was a full, although I suspect not very enlightening, response. He read
beautifully from his eight-page brief on the subject, but it was
noticeable that the answer was actually missing. There is a hotch-potch
of schemes out there, but unless the Government actually grasp the
issue and pull them all together, it is almost irrelevant whether the
power to fund schemes exists in the Housing and Local Government Act
1989, because we do not know the time scale within which the Government
intend to act. I appreciate what the Minister says about the review
that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column700" />Column number: 700</div>was launched last month; I thought that there might be some comment on
that review as we debated the Bill, and I am disappointed that there
has not been.</div>

Government to commit to a time scale within which they will come up
with something more solid than the vagueness contained within the many
pages of answer to this debate. Will it be possible, by the time the
Bill is discussed on Report, for the Minister to come back to the House
with a time scale that would be appropriate for fulfilling the obvious
desire that exists on both sides of the
House?</div>

tenacity in pushing me on this. He had made a request for further work
before Report, and that is something that I am happy to consider, but
as I have said, I do not want to introduce measures in a haphazard
manner. This is an important policy objective; we want to get it right
to avoid the mistakes of the past, but I shall certainly do my best to
bring it back on Report.</div>

Second time.</div>
					<a name="08013162000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new
clause would establish a national tenants&#146; voice, which would
provide advocacy, support and research services and promote good
practice in matters affecting the interests of tenants. The creation of
a national tenants&#146; voice was envisaged in the Cave review,
which was published in June 2007. Perhaps even more important,
following the publication of the Hills report on social housing in
February 2007, the Government are pursuing an agenda of radical reform,
as the Minister himself says. That means that we are in a period of
flux and uncertainty as we do not know all the details yet. The changes
under consideration include periodic reviews of tenant circumstances,
the recently published action plan on overcrowding, the upcoming review
of the housing revenue account and questions about how housing
providers are monitored and regulated.</div>
					<a name="08013162000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is the time for a national
tenants&#146; voice. The Cave review said that a national
tenants&#146; voice should be established</div>
					<a name="08013162000164"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to be an advocate for tenants in
national debates and undertake dialogue with the government, regulators
and providers&#146; representative bodies, on more equal
terms.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08013162000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">It goes on to
propose that</div>
					<a name="08013162000165"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;there
should be consultation on the core standards for social housing and
that this should be an early focus for the new national tenant voice.
The performance of service providers will be judged against the
standards that are
developed.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08013162000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
national tenants&#146; voice could also act as an advocate for
tenants in the private rented sector, which we have returned to a
number of times in the Committee&#146;s proceedings. Often, private
tenants are in a vulnerable position. They live in the worst conditions
and have relatively little security of tenure. They have almost no say
about their rent, and they often feel in an inferior position when it
comes to dealing with their landlord. The Minister may consider siting
the national tenants&#146; voice in the National Consumer Council,
but Shelter, which feels very strongly about the need for such a voice,
does not think that permanently locating it in the council is
appropriate.</div>

question.</div>
					<a name="08013162000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">Shelter
feels that it is inappropriate to site the national tenants&#146;
voice within the NCC. It thinks that such a voice should be
free-standing and independent, hence the wording of new clause 19. Once
again, I hope that the Minister will take a sympathetic view on this
matter, which follows directly from the Cave
review.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08013162000240"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> I pay tribute to the hon. Gentleman for
introducing the new clause. However, I do not think that it is
necessary. As I think that he said, the Government are committed to
establishing a national  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column702" />Column number: 702</div>tenants&#146; voice to represent and advise tenants. Martin Cave
argued strongly for such an organisation to ensure that the interests
of tenants, like our housing professionals and advisers, are
effectively represented when national and regional decisions are taken
on issues that affect them. On Second Reading and onwards, we have had
eloquent speeches about how social housing tenants often do not get a
good standard of service. Many social housing tenants do not have what
is known as exit power; they cannot choose to leave. Some tenants have
to endure bad housing standards in silence. Therefore, the role of the
national tenants&#146; voice is extremely important, especially in
the light of the other pieces of architecture that we are constructing
in the Bill in respect of the regulator and so on.</div>
					<a name="08013162000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">We consulted on this issue in
summer 2007. The response from tenant groups and housing associations
was extremely positive. Some 65 per cent. of those who responded
supported the idea of a national tenants&#146; voice, with a further
29 per cent. giving qualified support. Only 6 per cent. were not in
favour. I have had tenant groups in my office and they advocated very
strongly the idea of a national tenants&#146; voice.</div>
					<a name="08013162000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">On that basis, we are very
committed to existing national tenant organisations, such as Tenants
and Residents Organisations of England, the National Federation of
Tenant Management Organisations, and the Confederation of Co-operative
Housing. Such organisations need to play a key role in the
establishment of a national tenants&#146; voice. They feel that it is
very important that tenants should have a role in managing the
organisation. One option is to locate the national tenants&#146;
voice within the new National Consumer Council when it is
formed.</div>
					<a name="08013162000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new
council will be established later this year under powers set out in the
Consumers, Estate Agents and Redress Act 2007. It will bring together
the current National Consumer Council, Energywatch and Postwatch to
create a much more powerful and streamlined consumer body. Our view is
that there are considerable advantages in locating the national
tenants&#146; voice within the new organisation. It will, for
example, strengthen both its advocacy and research functions. On that
basis, we have set up a project group, involving key stakeholders, such
as tenant organisations, to take forward those proposals. The group
will meet first in late February or early March and will be tasked with
advising us on the details of the remit, location and governance
structure of the NTV. As part of that, it will hold discussions with
the new National Consumer Council about its role and the viability of
locating the NTV within the NCH.</div>
					<a name="08013162000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">I stress to the hon. Member for
Montgomeryshire and the wider Committee that discussions cannot take
place until the new council has been appointed. We expect that to
happen in February, and we anticipate the project group completing its
work by the end of the
year.</div>
					<a name="08013162000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08013162000241"></a>Mr.
Love:
						</b> I agree with everything that the hon. Gentleman has
said about a national tenants&#146; voice. I wanted to make the plea
that we should not forget tenant representation at a local level. From
my own experience, it is incredibly patchy, and if we do not have
representation at a local level, the national level will not 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column703" />Column number: 703</div>mean very much. I ask the Minister not to forget local representation,
and to do what he can to ensure that we get proper coverage at a local
level.</div>
					<a name="08013162000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08013162000242"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> As ever, my hon. Friend is correct. We have had
many debates during the last few sittings about the need for the
regulator, and to ensure that tenants&#146; voices are not lost with
regard to standards. The regulator will be a powerful driver in
ensuring that we raise housing standards, and to ensure that tenants
are consulted and engaged on a regular basis at a local
level.</div>
					<a name="08013162000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think that
tenants organisations should be involved in setting up the governance
arrangements of the national tenants&#146; voice, as they have been
in local discussions, and in the decision whether it should be sited in
the national consumer council. It is not correct for me, the Secretary
of State or other Government Ministers to establish a particular form
for the national tenants&#146; voice. There will be a project group,
and given what I have said about the importance of tenants&#146;
voices being heard at local and national level, I hope that the hon.
Gentleman will not press his new clause.</div>

						</b> The Minister has said that at this stage he
does not want to establish a particular form, but at the same time he
is establishing one. He says that he believes that the national
tenants&#146; voice should be contained within the National Consumer
Council. I do not disagree in principle, but I have issues with that.
Shelter holds the view that the NCC will give the tenants&#146; voice
insufficient power and authority to dispatch its duty to the millions
of people who are tenants in and around the country.</div>
					<a name="08013162000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister said that 65 per
cent. of those surveyed supported the idea of a national
tenants&#146; voice. Shelter has provided outstanding support to
myself and other hon. Members during the passage of the Bill, and I
thank it for that. Shelter is not trying to create arbitrary
free-standing institutions for the sake of it. It wants to ensure that
a tenants&#146; voice is worthy of the name. I hope that the Minister
will reflect on new clause 19, and that in informal conversations we
can pursue the matter further. We all want the same thing&#151;to
ensure that it works. In order to provide space for that further
dialogue, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the

a straightforward and technical amendment. It omits subsection (2) of
section 8(a) of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990. As I am sure
members of the Committee will recollect from our debate on Government
amendment No. 23, we have amended the Bill to ensure that some
non-local planning authority functions, such as the duty to keep
registers of enforcement notices may be given to the Homes and
Communities Agency concurrently with the existing body under a
designation order. Subsection (2) of section 8(a) of the Town and
Country Planning Act 1990 provides that where the agency has non-local
planning authority functions conferred on it in relation to a
designated area, the agency will be the local planning authority in
place of the existing body. That removes the powers of the existing
body and slots the agency into the planning regime where functions have
been conferred. We no longer want that in all cases, so we tabled
amendment No. 23. The amendment is consequential to the acceptance of
amendment No.

						</b> The commencement clause relates to England
and Wales. I have one specific request that I hope the Minister will
grant. Can he assure us that, before the commencement of the
legislation, there will be a meeting at ministerial level with his
opposite numbers in the Welsh Assembly who manage housing? I make that
request because there are interrelations between the jurisdiction in
Wales and that in Westminster. In the past, I have observed some
friction between those two political institutions in establishing the
territory and domain of their jurisdictions, so it would be better to
have those conversations before commencement rather than scrapping
about it once the Act comes into force. I hope that the Minister can
assure us that a high-level ministerial meeting will take place before
commencement of the legislation.</div>

						</b> Can my hon. Friend the Minister give the

clause 279, parts of the Bill will come into effect two months after
the date on which the Bill receives Royal Assent. Other parts are
subject to provisions made by the Secretary of State, which involves
different dates. Can my hon. Friend give any indication about the time
scale over which all the Bill&#146;s provisions are expected to be
brought into  effect? I know from past experience that some
Bills include parts that are never effected, and it would be helpful to
have an indication about the overall time scale by which all the
Bill&#146;s provisions are likely to be effective. I do not expect an
answer today as it is a complex area, but it would be helpful to have
that indication on Report.</div>

chairmanship, Mr. Benton, and also that of Mr.

also take the opportunity to thank the Clerks and the officials who
have worked tirelessly all month on the Bill. It is the first time that
I have sat on a Committee, and it has been a great honour. I was
fortunate because two titans from the housing world were on the Back
Benches. The right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich and my right
hon. Friend the Member for North-West Hampshire were a pleasure to
watch in action; they were great mentors. It was particularly
interesting to debate with the right hon. Member for Greenwich and
Woolwich and sometimes to agree with him. I was enormously grateful to
my right hon. Friend the Member for North-West Hampshire. On one
particular occasion, he rescued me when I had lost my notes.</div>
					<a name="08013162000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">The way in which the Committee
has proceeded has been very satisfactory. Thanks are due to the
Minister for the way in which he has behaved and acted. It has almost
gone down as a mantra that he will thank an hon. Member for a well-put
argument and say that he wholeheartedly agrees, but then explain why it
is impossible to accept their amendment. He does that with such panache
and in such a well meaning way that it is impossible to feel any
malice.</div>

I am sad that he was not promoted last
week.</div>

Shapps:
						</b> It is the kiss of death, Minister, but I will
carry on. The Minister would be a very worthy holder of office as
Secretary of State, and I have no doubt that in the future he will be
in the Cabinet, though sadly only for a brief period before we take
over.</div>
					<a name="08013162000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">Thank you
once again, Mr. Benton, for your tremendous
chairmanship.</div>
					<a name="08013162000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08013162000253"></a>Lembit
&#214;pik:
						</b> I, too, extend my heartfelt gratitude to the
Clerks and the officials. I arrived on the scene in the middle of the
process, after my new leader&#146;s wise 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column708" />Column number: 708</div>appointment of me. However, I have been in office longer than the
Minister&#146;s new boss, so I feel like an old
hand.</div>
					<a name="08013162000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Clerks are
extremely understanding and generous with their time and have helped us
to put together amendments that achieve the meaning and intent of the
Bill. I am sure that all right hon. and hon. Members feel the
same.</div>
					<a name="08013162000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">Mr.
Benton, you and your co-Chairman, Mr. Gale, have been
gracious even in moments of great confusion, particularly on Tuesday
when I was caught up short and momentarily distracted and ended up
busking it in a most blatant and obvious way. Nevertheless,
Mr. Gale was still gentle with me. Mr. Benton,
you, too, have shown an expeditious and erudite approach in chairing
the
Committee.</div>
					<a name="08013162000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, I
turn to the Minister. As we have already heard from the hon. Member for
Welwyn Hatfield, the Minister demonstrates the strange art of accepting
every point that one makes and then rejecting the amendments that go
with it. It reminds me of a phrase I heard when I was first
elected&#151;the art of diplomacy is to say no in such a way that the
other person apologises. In a sense, I felt that the Minister displayed
that skill. Nevertheless, the people of Hartlepool can rightly be proud
of his performance in this Committee. I look forward to visiting
Hartlepool in less confrontational circumstances than those in which I
first met the Minister, which involved the by-election that thrust him
into Parliament and now into power.</div>
					<a name="08013162000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">Setting sail with my new
portfolio has been an interesting and instructive experience. I hope
that on Report we can return to some of the areas which, as the
Minister has pointed out, were open to further consideration. At that
point, perhaps the Government will accept a few of the Opposition
amendments that were proposed in good faith, apparently accepted in
principle, but rejected in practice.</div>
					<a name="08013162000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08013162000254"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> I have three hours and 27 minutes. I give notice
to the Committee that I intend to take every second of that time. I
thank the hon. Members for Welwyn Hatfield and for Montgomeryshire for
their kind comments.</div>
					<a name="08013162000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">Foremost, I thank you,
Mr. Benton, and your co-Chairman, Mr. Gale, for
your professionalism, courtesy, charm, wit and efficiency in managing
the Committee. During our proceedings, I learned that Mr.
Gale is a trade union shop steward in his spare time. Certainly, he has
been standing up for his fellow hon. Members and their staff and
families in the media this week.</div>
					<a name="08013162000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also thank the Clerk for her
excellent work and the <i class="I">Hansard </i>reporters and the Doorkeepers for
helping to make the business of the Committee, including 280 clauses,
10 schedules and 300 amendments&#151;mostly my own&#151;very
smooth. I echo the points made by the hon. Member for Welwyn Hatfield
that this has been a good-natured and well meaning Committee. I pay
tribute to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s tenacity, although I think he
spent too long on HIPs&#151;I hope that he has his new HIP now. He
has been an excellent Front-Bench spokesman, as has the hon. Member for
North-East
Bedfordshire.</div>

am</div>
					<a name="08013162000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to pay
tribute to my hon. Friends. First, I thank the Whip for the
Committee&#146;s smooth operation. Despite our forensic scrutiny of
the Bill, we are finishing a sitting early. I thank my hon. Friend the
Member for Sheffield, Hillsborough for her sterling work in providing
me with information. I commend my hon. Friend the Member for City of
Durham, who has almost single-handedly changed Government policy to
ensure that the Homes and Communities Agency will take sustainable
development into account. I pay tribute to my hon. Friend the Member
for West Ham for her impatience with me and for her sterling work on
overcrowding and on ensuring that tenants have decent housing
standards, regardless of where they live. I pay tribute to my hon.
Friend the Member for Luton, South for her work on domestic
violence&#151;I hope that we can move that work forward&#151;and to
my hon. Friend the Member for Edmonton. I have taken no pleasure in
hearing my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton and
Shepherd&#146;s Bush talk about how Hammersmith and Fulham housing
has deteriorated since he ran it, because that is not particularly good
for the tenants. However, the manner in which he has done that and
bashed the Opposition has been a delight to hear. My hon. Friend the
Member for Denton and Reddish has been a tremendous advocate of work on
social housing and ensuring that tenants receive fantastic value for
money and good standards. My right hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich
and Woolwich has been tremendous; his knowledge of this policy area is
second to none. He has been extraordinarily helpful to me, and I thank
him for helping to improve the Bill through his
contributions.</div>
					<a name="08013162000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
cannot sit down without paying tribute to the right hon. Member for
North-West Hampshire, who has been tremendous and extremely courteous.
He has often played with me as a cat plays with a mouse before killing
it, but has done so with such panache and courtesy that I cannot take
issue with him; he is such a gentleman. I have been reading his blog.
Let me quote some of his
comments:</div>
					<a name="08013162000195"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Not
all the work of an MP is glamorous, any more than is the life of a
popstar. The political equivalent of endless hours in a recording
studio in the East End of London is a month on a Public Bill Committee.
Every Tuesday and Thursday in January is being spent by your MP
examining, line by line, the Housing and Regeneration Bill&#151;a
modest piece of legislation with 280 Clauses and countless
Schedules.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08013162000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given the
choice, I think that I would rather be a pop star than in this
Committee Room, but I know what he
means.</div>
					<a name="08013162000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, I pay
tribute to the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire, whom I consider to be a
friend. A few days ago, he received the ultimate accolade, a profile in
<i class="I">The Sunday Times</i> magazine. He has some courage: he called
Mr. Gale &#147;dozy&#148;, which takes some doing.
Keeping with the pop star theme, I recall a group called Dave Dee,
Dozy, Beaky, Mick and Tich, although it is a bit before my time. Let me
quote the first bit of <i class="I">The Sunday Times </i>magazine
article:</div>
					<a name="08013162000196"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;On a
poetically sloe-black, slow black&#148;&#151;</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column710" />Column number: 710</div>

					<a name="08013162000197"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;night
in Wales, the young people of Newtown are herding into the pubs. One of
them is the local MP, 42 years old but somehow still a boy in his baggy
jeans and short-sleeved shirt, his arms pale and beefy on a cold
winter&#146;s night. Lembit Opik is playing pool in his local, the
Grapes, with friends no older than their early twenties. They are
snogging and joshing as their MP takes his shot next to the television
where they let him watch Question Time on
Thursdays.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08013162000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
said to the right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire this week that I
had been having nightmares about the Office for National Statistics
classification, but I have also been having nightmares about
&#147;snogging and joshing&#148; and &#147;pale and
beefy&#148;. I suggest that if we take this pop star theme a little
further, the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire could have a duet with his
romantic interest, and the name of the group could be Dave Dee, Dozy,
Pale Beef, Beaky, Cheeky, Mick and Tich. I thought that that would get
more of a laugh&#151;it took me quite some time to think
of.</div>
					<a name="08013162000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will not take
up too much time, but I am particularly proud that this is an important
and significant Bill, designed to help all in the country with regard
to their housing needs. Thanks to the high quality
scrutiny&#151;forensic, even&#151;that hon. Members on both sides
of the Committee have applied, the Bill leaves this stage a better
Bill, and I thank all hon. Members for their work in that
regard.</div>
					<a name="08013162000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, I
thank my officials, who have worked extremely hard and often extremely
late on the Bill and our amendments to it in the previous months. At
any point in the Committee where I have looked good, it has been thanks
to them. When I have looked bad, it is because I have chosen to go on
my own. It is a tribute to their professionalism that they are keen to
have a meeting tonight at 5 o&#146;clock to discuss the Report stage.
That shows how keen, committed and professional they are, so I thank
them all very much for what they have done. I thank the Committee,
Mr. Gale and you, Mr. Benton. I do not think that
there is any more to be
said.</div>
					<a name="08013162000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">

							<a name="08013162000255"></a>The
Chairman:
						</b> On behalf of Mr. Gale and myself, I
express our thanks to the Minister, the Opposition spokesmen and all
members of the Committee for the courtesy and co-operation that has
been extended to us at all times. I have particularly enjoyed the
Committee, because housing is a great love of mine. The Minister has
mentioned visiting my constituency, where we have a huge housing market
renewal project, and it was a delight to have him there on that day.
The Committee has been full of interest, and I compliment all of its
members on their input and wish the Bill
success.</div>
