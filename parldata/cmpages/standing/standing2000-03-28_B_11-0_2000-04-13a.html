<B>Mr. James Paice </B>(South-East Cambridgeshire): I beg to move amendment No. 246, in page 3, line 15, after ``London'', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and outside the New forest'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
The amendment removes the requirement to map open country and registered common land in the New forest. It is the direct result of a statement by the Minister for the Environment during our first sitting. He said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The New forest was not registrable under the 1965 Act, but historic laws provided for the management of common rights, so there has always been free access to the New forest.-[Official Report, Standing Committee B, 28 March 2000; c. 24.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
As a result of that, I suggest that there is no registered common land in the New forest to map. Access to the New forest is already provided under other legislation referred to in clause 15, so it would not be access land under the Bill. Therefore, it comes under the same criteria as inner London and should be excluded from the mapping requirement.

<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (Mr. Chris Mullin):</B> The amendment would exclude the New forest from maps of open country and registered common land in England that are to be drawn up by the Countryside Agency.

<P>
The hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Paice) said that the New forest was excluded from the requirement in the Commons Registration Act 1965 for commons and rights of common to be registered. As was explained on 28 March, it was excluded because common rights in the New forest have always been governed by historic laws and local legislation. The core area of the New forest is largely owned by the Forestry Commission and is subject to various common rights of grazing. I welcome the fact that there has been a tradition of free access to that area for many years.

<P>
The definition of registered common land in clause 1(2), which refers to the 1965 Act, will exclude the core area of the New forest because the commons have not been registered. However, most of those commons are likely to qualify separately as moor, heath or down. Much of the open country on the fringe of the New forest was registrable under the 1965 Act and will be subject to the right of access by virtue of its being registered common land.

<P>
The Forestry Commission will also consider the possibility of dedicating the national forest estate, including the Crown lands in the New forest and elsewhere, as access land under clause 16. Therefore, I see no reason why rights of access should not extend in due course to most of the New forest. That is not an inconsistency. Rights granted under the Bill will provide the consistency, clarity and permanence that will exist elsewhere, so I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<B>Mr. Green:</B> This large group of amendments essentially relates to various aspects of mapping. Most of the amendments are to clause 4, although others that are consequential to them amend clause 6. They would provide for maps of access land to identify points where the public can readily gain access. We have had many discussions about the necessity of providing walkers with information. Users, particulary new users, will need to be guided to places where they can safely park or to points where information on rights and restrictions that may apply is easily available.

<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown (Cotswold):</B> Does my learned Friend agree that it would be helpful if maps showed all other rights of way, particularly footpaths, because that would show how access land could be reached?

<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> It would. That is a good suggestion because the more information that maps can provide, the more enjoyment and satisfaction walkers-particularly new and inexperienced walkers-are likely to get from their day out. Many of the amendments seek to have access points clearly marked on maps by the Countryside Agency or the Countryside Council for Wales. If they are marked, it would be a straightforward matter for the Ordnance Survey to transfer that information to the published maps that are most likely to be used by the public. If they are not, the Ordnance Survey will have to obtain that information by doing its own surveys, which could lead to delays and more selective or limited information. I do not think that it is a matter of controversy between us that the more information there is on the maps, the better. The issue relates to our earlier debates on the identification and designation of access points, which I do not wish to repeat. It is reasonable that the Government should encourage the countryside bodies to include access points on draft and final maps of access land. I should be grateful if the Minister could give reassurance on that point.

<P>
It is important that information be provided on maps of access land, of other land to which statutory rights of access already exist, and of land dedicated for access. A clear distinction must be maintained between the different types of land because the management arrangements and the general restrictions likely to apply to them could vary under the Bill. Users and owners should be fully aware of their rights in regard to each type of land, and that will be possible only if all the land available for access, as a right of by dedication, is clearly identified on the same maps. I hope that the Minister will agree that it would be sensible for maps of access land to show the other land available for public recreation under agreements. That would be a desirable step towards an integrated access map that covers all access opportunites.

<P>
As I said, the amendments to clause 6 are consequential on the amendment to clause 4, and many of the clause 4 amendments make the same amendment to different parts of the clause, so I do not need to go through them all separately. Amendment Nos. 247 and 255 deal with the mapping duties of the Countryside Agency and the Countryside Council for Wales. If maps are to have practical value they should show access land, but that is not a requirement of the clause. I am sure that all members of the Committee would want the new maps to be accurate and informative guides; and the amendments would fulfil that objective.

<P>
Amendments Nos. 248 and 256 would complete the picture by specifying that excepted land should be shown. I am sure that all hon. Members want to prevent inadvertent trespass. Under the Bill, hazardous areas will be shown as open country. In debating what constitutes a hazardous area, we agreed about areas such as aerodromes, although we disagreed about golf courses. The danger is that areas that are clearly hazardous will be shown as open country, giving the impression that access rights apply when they do not. The amendments would not only help walkers avoid trespassing and hazards, but would help owners avoid breaking the law in siting notices for excepted land.

<P>
Amendments Nos. 249 and 257 deal with a similar point, in that the same false impression will be given when SSSIs are designated in areas marked on the map as open country. That could result in damage to those sites if walkers are misled by the maps.

<P>
Amendments No. 250 and 256 relate to land that has been excluded indefinitely. There seems little reason why that should be included as open country, and it would be more practical to mark it as excluded.

<P>
Amendments Nos. 251 and 259 are, perhaps, more ambitious. It seems sensible for the Government's maps to show land that will be regularly closed to access at predictable times of year. As the Under-Secretary will be aware, one of the most difficult and important detailed issues is the times of year that particular land will be closed to access. For the avoidance of inadvertent damage to wildlife in particular, it is important to put such information on the maps.

<P>
Amendments Nos. 252 and 260 relate to means of access. As the entrances to access land will be restricted to particular points on the perimeter when hedges and fences are in place, it would be sensible to mark those points on the map. Earlier, we discussed whether walkers might be forced to walk 500 m one way or another and back again, and the Under-Secretary managed to add that up to a 2 km walk. The way to avoid that is for the maps to show where the entrances are. Without such information, walkers may encounter problems, and may have to stay away or risk trespassing on land outside the perimeter while looking for entrances. The amendments would prevent that problem.

<P>
Amendments Nos. 253 and 261 would extend the Bill to cover new land provided for access under clause 15 that is not provided at the moment. Similarly, amendments Nos. 254 and 262 relate to land dedicated under clause 16. Under the Bill as drafted, that will not be marked as open country on the maps, which seems slightly perverse.

<P>
Amendment No. 263 relates to the important issue of different types of open country. The maps should distinguish between different types of several reasons. Doing so would enable people to know why the land is shown as open country and would help owners make an informed decision about whether to appeal, thereby avoiding unnecessary appeals. The information would be of interest to landowners, walkers and conservationists, and should be readily available. It will certainly be available to the Countryside Agency and the Countryside Council for Wales, as they will have to determine in which category land falls to become open country. That extra information would not give rise to more appeals. It would not be a ground for appeal if open country had been marked as down rather than health. That would be a practical way of improving the utility of the maps without unnecessarily clogging up process.

<P>
Further amendments in this group cover clause 6, but they are essentially consequential on the groups that have been dealt with. I hope that the Committee will agree that, if this group of amendments were adopted, walkers would be provided with a much more informative set of maps that would enable the new access regime to provide more good for more people. I commend the amendments to the Committee.

<P>

<B>Mr. Elfyn Llwyd </B>(Meirionnydd Nant Conwy): Amendments Nos. 248 to 263 are important and cover the points raised by the hon. Member for Ashford (Mr. Green). The accuracy of the mapping and the acceptability of the mapping process are central to the Bill's success. During the lengthy debates on clause 1 and schedule 1, it became clear that the mapping process is crucial in avoiding undue conflict between users and occupiers of land.

<P>
It is important that occupiers and those concerned should be involved in the mapping process at the earliest possible opportunity. It is vital that the people who occupy and farm the land should be brought in at the beginning because that will ensure a lack of confusion and thereby, hopefully, avoid future conflict. The amendments would improve the Bill and ensure that people were brought in at an early stage to discuss the relevant issues. That would be useful. It would clarify the process and enable those who wished to express their opinions to do so early on.

<P>
If owners and occupiers are involved well before draft maps are drawn up, the process will be a success. Without such involvement, land used for haymaking and silage making might not be excepted at an early enough stage. I will not labour the point. The right hon. Gentleman and his colleague know what I am talking about. We have been through it before.

<P>
Amendment No. 248 is a useful amendment. It would ensure that excepted land that is registered common or open country is mapped. Without that provision, walkers may think that they have a right to walk on excepted land when they do not. It would be useful to consider that aspect and I commend the amendment to the Committee.

<P>
Amendment No. 250 would ensure that maps reflect open country that is, none the less, closed on a permanent or seasonal basis by means of exclusion directions. Further clarity could be given by distinguishing different categories of land, perhaps using an adequate colour key.

<P>
Amendment No. 252 would encourage walkers to use appropriate access points on to and off the land. Some conflict may arise when people gain access to land, but not in the right way. If the access point is marked clearly and plainly on the maps there can be no mistake. Often mistakes lead to conflict, and we all want to avoid that.

<P>
The amendment is a sensible proposal. It would require the Countryside Agency to map the access points to access land. It was tabled for three reasons. First, a Bill that extends the right of access to open country will not be effective unless there is a practicable and reasonable way of providing access to the land. I stress the words ``practicable and reasonable''. That will be by agreement between the occupier and/or farmer or landowner and those interested in such access. The local forum would be the right agency to discuss such matters and I am sure that agreement can be reached easily. As the hon. Member for Ashford said, we want to make access more reasonable.

<P>
Secondly, members of the public will want to know the whereabouts of access points. They will then know where to park and from where they will be leaving. Thirdly, the amendment would allow the effective and practical management of access to open country, which will be assisted by defining and mapping the access points. That will avoid the problems of people having to climb over walls, unintentionally causing damage. The amendment is not designed to make life difficult for anyone. It would make life easier for everyone, which surely must be our aim.

<P>
<B>Mr. David Heath </B>(Somerton and Frome): I support the views of the hon. Members for Ashford and for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd). We have stressed throughout our proceedings the need for clarity and the need to give as much information as possible to those who want access to land. Undoubtedly, at some stage, there will need to be maps that show various features. The argument seems to be about whether that should involve the mapping process required under the clause for the purpose of identifying the access land in broad terms or whether there should be two separate processes under which access is identified first and then other features are added to the map to provide something that is useful to those who walk on the land. That seems to be unnecessary, given that the two processes can be combined.

<P>
Four arguments could be made in support of a contrary view, the first of which would be whether such a system would delay the process. That would be an important factor to bear in mind if it had substance. However, I do not accept that it does, because countryside organisations will have to take note of the various items that are listed in the amendments. They do not need to gather such information in addition to identifying the land as open country. The representations that can be made about the showing-or not showing-of land under clause 5 would not apply to such features, so there will be no delay in terms of representations being made against certain land being included in the map. Moreover, the appeals process in clause 6 will not allow someone to appeal on the basis of those additional features.

<P>
The second possible objection to the amendment is that it could over-complicate the maps. I reject that idea. I do not think that it would-quite the reverse. People who had only a simple map of the access land that they wanted to cross would have to cross-reference constantly with an Ordnance Survey map in order to have some of the information that would be included under the amendments, and even such cross-referencing would not tell them about important things, such as permanent exclusion areas, which it would help them to know.

<P>
The third objection might be that, on drafting grounds, the matter would be better addressed in a schedule, but that is entirely down to personal preference. There is nothing inherently wrong in drafting terms with the way in which the hon. Member for Ashford has approached the issue.

<P>
The final objection might be that the proposals are otiose because the countryside bodies will incorporate the features that we have been discussing in the maps that they produce. That may be the case, and there is some evidence to that effect in the helpful draft advice that we have received from the Minister on the setting up of the local access forums-as I am pleased to call them, because the plural is used in the document. That suggests that the forums will have a role in providing local and specialist advice during the mapping process; that is the implication, although it is not there in black and white. If the countryside bodies will do that as a matter of course, let us put it into the Bill so that everyone knows what the maps should include, and we can proceed with a degree of clarity.

<P>
The balance of the argument seems to be in favour of the inclusion of more information rather than its exclusion. It would be helpful to anyone who wants to use the Bill in practice if the amendments or something similar to them were accepted.

<P>
<B>The Minister for the Environment (Mr. Michael Meacher):</B> Once again, I understand the purpose behind the amendments, but I seek to persuade the Committee that that will be better achieved by the mechanisms proposed in the Bill.

<P>
The amendments would impose new requirements on the countryside bodies to identify separately characteristics, whether they are access points, SSSIs or excluded land. Before I speak to specific amendments, I want to say a few words about the purpose of the maps to be drawn up under clause 4. They are intended to provide certainty about what is open country or registered common land for the purposes of part I. They will be the authoritative source of information on that point. As I have repeatedly said, safeguards built into chapter I provide for landowners and others affected by the maps to be consulted on draft maps, and to have the right of appeal against provisional maps. The statutory maps do not identify excepted land and land subject to restrictions; we expect the countryside bodies to provide the public with information about that, and they are investigating how best that can be done.

<P>
There is, therefore, no difference between us about the need for the information to be put intio a useful form for walkers. The question is whether that information should all be included on the statutory maps, or whether that purpose would be best served by the maps that are-appropriately, in our view-drawn up by countryside bodies. The problem is that areas of excepted land and land subject to restriction may change over time. Given that change and flux, it would be impossible for the statutory maps to identify conclusively all the possible exceptions and exclusions.

<P>
The general principle of excepted land in chapter I rightly provides for the flexibility of the right of access, which in other circumstances the Opposition seem keen to endorse. Amendments Nos, 247, 255, 343, 248, 256, 348 and 353 would imply less flexibility because , after being mapped as such, excepted land would remain excepted, at least until the next map review, which may not be for a decade. The corollary, or course, is that the map would be conclusive envidnece of what was not excepted land, so the right of access would, for example, endure over downland even if the farmer chose to plough it up. Thus, the hon. Member for Ashford will appreciate that flexibility works both ways. The Opposition must decide whether they want flexibility for land to be taken in and out of excepted land status. The Bill makes that flexibility possible, but the amendment would introduce an unhelpful rigidity, which I am sure that the hon. Gentleman did not intend.
 
<P>
<H5>3 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
It would not be sensible for the maps of open country and registered common land to show land dedicated under clause 16, which would be called for by amendments Nos. 247 and 255 and by amendments Nos. 254 and 262. Where land is dedicated, the instrument of dedication will provide proof about the extent of the land that is subject to the dedication. However, I take the point underlying this little debate: it is important for the public to be able to find out about opportunities for creation on land dedicated under clause 16. As I said, we will look to the countryside bodies to publish more user friendly information, which shows not only the extent of open country and registered common land, but also land that has been dedicated and land from which the public has been excluded either temporarily or long term, a matter to which a string of amendments, which I shall not list, refers.

<P>
The hon. Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown) raised the matter of rights of way over access land; that is exactly the sort of information that it would be useful to show on the publicity material disseminated by the countryside bodies and others; indeed, that is its purpose.

<P>
The statutory maps are not the appropriate vehicle for conveying more and better information about access opportunities to the public. We doubt whether those maps will be referred to by more than a small minority of walkers.

<P>
On the additional point about SSSIs being shown on statutory maps, as statutory maps will be reviewed every 10 years, changes in access points, SSSI designations or new dedications could not be reflected on the statutory maps until the next review, which may be 10 years on. On the other hand, non-statutory publicity such as that produced by the countryside bodies will not be restricted in that way. It is a much better way to convey to the public what they need to know. We must be realistic about how widely statutory, rather than merely user friendly, maps will be used by the general public.

<P>
Amendments Nos. 249 and 257 would introduce an additional duty separately to identify SSSIs on the statutory maps. As I said, that information will already be available to those who need to identify sensitive sites; obviously the advisory bodies-English Nature and the Countryside Council for Wales-the Countryside Agency and, of course, landowners themselves. They will be able to use that knowledge, with a consideration of the merits of individual cases, to determine whether an exclusion or restriction of access is necessary in respect of a site under chapter II.

<P>
I return to the vexed issue of access points; amendments Nos. 252 and 260 with amendment No. 345 would require the countryside bodies to identify means of access on maps of registered common land and open country. As my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State said on 30 March, we support the provision of information points where people could go-and be advised to go-to find out about the access opportunities. We all stand by that. The amendment, however, is not the right way to go about it. We expect that access information published by the countryside bodies for the use of the general public will identify means of access where information has been supplied by the access authorities, or of course by landowners. That is not a new idea. It happens now in respect of much land subject to access agreements, so that the information is frequently shown on Ordnance Survey maps.

<P>
Amendments Nos. 253, 261, 351 and 356 would introduce an additional duty to produce maps of land already accessible to the public by existing statutory authority, in other words the so-called ``existing access land''. The rights of access to such land are preserved in this Bill by virtue of clauses 1(1) and 15(1). The Bill provides that any land that is open country or registered common land should be mapped, including land over which there is an existing right. That is because for well over 1 million hectares there are real uncertainties about the extent of such land. Disputes about such matters are for the courts, not the countryside bodies, to determine. Any land shown on the map will be access land, whether it is so as a result of an existing right of access, or a right arising from clause 1 of the Bill. That will provide the necessary certainty for walkers. However, again the countryside bodies will be best able to identify, on an advisory basis, existing access land where such information is both available and, importantly, reliable.

<P>
Finally, amendment No. 263, to which the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy referred, would require the countryside bodies to distinguish between mountain, moor, heath and down on their maps of open country. We do not think that is necessary. The requirement to make such a distinction on statutory maps is quite unnecessary because the real concern, both for the landowner and the walker, is whether or not the land is open country. That is what really matters. However, the countryside bodies will need to be able to justify their classification-either as mountain, moor, heath or down-including on an appeal under clause 6.

<P>
In conclusion, I think that we already agree that the countryside bodies will need to provide the public with information about the right of access and ancillary issues in a form that people can understand and use practically. The statutory maps are not intended to be that medium. I agree, therefore, with the purpose of the amendments. I am simply suggesting that they do not represent the right way to go about it.

<P>
The amendments would make the statutory maps much more bureaucratic and difficult to use. There would be a veritable wodge of overlays for each map to show all the information that the amendments would require. In many cases, the countryside bodies would be under a duty to show information that they were unable to determine. However, we share the desire to see that the public are better informed about the issues addressed in the amendments. I ask the hon. Member for Ashford to recognise that the proposals in the Bill, which I have tried to sketch out more logically, are the right way to go about it and I hope that he will withdraw the amendments.

<P>

<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I am sorry to detain the Committee for a little longer, but it seems to me that the maps, how they are produced and what they show is the absolute kernel of the Bill-not just this part of it, but the following part as well. There is a potential for muddle here in that the countryside agencies are required to produce the maps, yet the local authorities already hold the definitive maps of rights of way. Several of them are already in dispute and the potential for conflict between the two bodies could be considerable. Schedule 5 deals with some, but not all, of the problem. Will the Minister explain the process that will be undertaken in the preparation of the maps? From where will they be made available to the general public?

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman is referring to the preparation of the maps, which is dealt with elsewhere in the Bill. Amendments other than those under discussion relate to such provisions.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I am grateful for your guidance, Mr. Stevenson, but the clause deals with map preparation. It is important that we know how the maps will be prepared and from where they will be available.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I always have great respect for the Clerk's advice and I am advised that the clause under discussion deals with what is on the maps, not their preparation. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman could advance his argument along those lines.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> On your advice, Mr. Stevenson, I shall sit down now and deal with such matters when we reach the next clause.

<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> The Minister made a valid point when he said that we can either want or not want flexibility. The debate seems to be about uncertainty and flexibility. The problem with the Government's approach is that they will come down on the side of uncertainty. I am sure that many farmers will be touched by the right hon. Gentleman's concern for someone who might be ploughing up downland. I point out gently that the bulk of the amendments have the support of both the National Farmers Union and the Country Landowners Association. They regard them as practical proposals for protecting the interests of farmers, who will be genuinely pleased to hear that the hon. Gentleman has their concerns at heart.

<P>
I take the Minister's point that the statutory maps are not designed for public use and that people will not carry them with them when walking. However, some amendments would make it easier to replicate the information that will have to be gathered for the statutory maps on those maps that people will carry with them. That is what we want to facilitate. I imagine that there is no disagreement between us on that. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
No. 269, in page 3, line 30, after ``small'', insert ``or inaccessible''.

<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> Amendments Nos. 295 and 234 cover the ground that we touched on earlier. They would introduce a de minimis figure of five hectares for the size of land to be included as open country. The Country Landowners Association said that the two amendments are merited for a number of reasons and that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the difficulties of management of, access to such pieces of land make the provision of access disproportionately expensive and impractical, for little benefit to the wider public; the mapping, consultation and appeal process will be far more difficult if there is no such de minimis provision. As the CA focuses in on smaller and smaller parcels of land, so the number of owners and the practical difficulties involved will increase exponentially.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It also suggested that a
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>de minimis provision would exclude small areas of marginal land, such as rushy fields and horse paddocks,<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
where there may be confusion anyway.

<P>
It is a matter of proportion. The Bill will clearly be enacted, so, given the hiatus that there will be between the passage of the Bill and the completion of the maps, we are all anxious that the mapping exercise be carried out as quickly as possible. Until then, people will not be able fully to utilise the rights that the Bill gives them, so it seems sensible to try to minimise causes of delay to what will inevitably be a complex and drawn-out process. A sensible de minimis provision-we suggest five hectares, which would not be a large piece of land-should be written into the Bill.

<P>
<H5>3.15 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
Amendments Nos. 264 and 269 refer to the accessibility of land. They are alternatives that would enable the agency or the mapping authority to exclude inaccessible open country. During our proceedings, both Ministers have admitted that the ability to get on to access land is critical. We have talked about it several times, especially when we considered ffyrdd land in Wales and in-bye land in this country. If there were no legal access to the land, its value for rights of access would be minimal. It seems sensible that such land be excluded from the map anyway.

<P>
Amendments Nos. 265 and 268 refer to small areas of common land. They are alternatives to try to tackle the exclusion of areas of registered common land when the countryside body considers that they are
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>so small  that their inclusion would serve no useful purpose.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We do not include a specific de minimis figure for that, because other factors about registered common land, such as existing rights of access, might make a figure less relevant. The mapping agency should have the discretion to decide that a certain piece of common land is so small that its inclusion would not be much use. That is not intended to alter the meaning or effect of registered common land, but to allow for some of it not to be included, and so avoid further delay while people argue about it.

<P>
Amendment No. 266 seeks to add to the legislation similar words to those used by the Under-Secretary when he told the Committee that he did
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>not expect larger bodies of water to be included in the maps of open country.-[Official Report, Standing Committee B, 30 March 2000; c. 40.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We would contend that, as drafted, the definition of open country as wholly or predominantly mountain, moor, heath or down could include lakes, ponds and reservoirs. The inclusion of the amendment would fulfil the statement of the Under-Secretary.

<P>
Amendment No. 267 would give the mapping authority some discretion to exclude land from the map if its inclusion would serve no useful purpose. In my view, that would reduce the risks of delay and argument, and would mean that the detail of whether every nook and cranny might or might not be open land would not necessarily have to be gone into.

<P>
<B>Mr. David Lepper </B>(Brighton, Pavilion): Would the hon. Gentleman explain how the amendment would affect a point made to me in a letter from the Society of Sussex Downsmen? I know that we are talking about mapping rather than definitions, but the letter is pertinent. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The definition of open countryside under the Bill will not be easy even in such places as Dartmoor or the Lake District. In the South Downs the patchwork pattern of arable and pasture makes the task far more difficult. Our concern is that the inclusion of ``Down'' in the Bill is safeguarded and generously interpreted. There is great scope for the public's enjoyment of the Downs being radically enhanced by expansion of the areas of permanent grass for open access, as already demonstrated by Countryside Stewardship schemes.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. If the hon. Gentleman wishes to catch my eye, I will keep at least half an eye on that possibility. Interventions should be kept to a minimum.

<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> The organisation quoted by the hon. Gentleman makes an important point. However, it would not be affected by the amendment. I am merely suggesting that the Countryside Agency-the mapping agency-should have the discretion to leave out land if its inclusion would serve no useful purpose. The issues of permanent grassland and rotationally ploughed land, which is cultivated and then put back to grass, were debated at length earlier. The Minister accepted some of the points made, for instance, about set-aside and the long-term nature of sowing lanes. If I recall rightly, he promised to return to the matter later in our proceedings, or on Report. I look forward to his comments. However, that is not relevant to this group of amendments, which are intended to speed up the mapping process by allowing the agency the discretion to ignore various parcels of land that will not contribute to the overall objective of increasing access.

<P>
<B>Mr. Lepper:</B> I shall be brief. In its letter, the Society of Sussex Downsmen, which is based not in my constituency but Horsham, drew attention to the patchwork nature of the downs landscape. The amendments that relate to mapping and rights of access have a bearing on its central point, which is that free access to land currently available should not be reduced. Mr. David Bangs who is a constituent of my hon. Friend the Member for Brighton, Kemptown (Mr. Turner), pointed out in a letter to me that the problem, especially in the south downs, which is near my constituency, is that much surviving down pasture is isolated and fragmented. He pointed out that there are 180 sites on the Brighton downs alone, and that even small sites in the assemblage have a rich and valuable wildlife, to which access is culturally important. The mapping restrictions that the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire wants to introduce into the Bill would severely affect the aspirations towards access that are expressed in those two letters.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. David Heath:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire for tabling the amendment. I do not agree with him about the specification of the de minimis provision in terms of an area. That would not be a sensible way forward, as it does not take account of the quality and location of the land in question, which may be pertinent to whether its inclusion in a map would be appropriate. However, he made a stronger point about land that is entirely inaccessible.

<P>
As I read subsection (5)(a), the Countryside Agency will not have the discretion to leave out a parcel of land because its location makes it inaccessible to anyone under any circumstances. I am therefore attracted to amendment No. 296, which would maintain the countryside body's discretion not to include certain land when drawing up maps. That would not be absolute, as it would be open to challenge through the consultation process. Therefore, those who felt that the Countryside Agency had misapplied its discretion would be able to make such representations. It would not constrain the Countryside Agency to such an extent that the only matter that it considered in such circumstances was the area of the land. The agency could also take into account the location and whether the land served any useful purpose in providing access to the countryside. The agency would not take that power lightly. It would not want to exclude land that could be included, but it would be given the discretion not to do so and not to waste time on mapping and the inevitable consequence of consultation and appeal. An argument can be made in support of the amendment, and I shall be interested to see whether the Under-Secretary accepts its validity.

<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> The amendments raise three separate but linked themes in dealing with the discretion to exclude from maps of open country and registered common land areas of land that are small, inaccessible or covered with water, and I shall deal with them in that order.

<P>
If hon. Members feel that we have been here before, that is because we have. In our first sitting, we discussed amendments that would specify a minimum size threshold of 50 hectares, and, subsequently, 10 hectares. Amendments Nos. 295, 265, 234, 267 and 268 suggest a threshold of 5 hectares for both open country and registered common land. I hope that later we shall not reach an amendment that would reduce discretion to 1 hectare.

<P>
The discretion afforded to the countryside bodies under clause 4(5) not to map small areas of open country is practical and flexible. It allows them to adopt a threshold that excludes parcels of land so small that it would involve wholly disproportionate effort and cost to survey and consult on them. In implementing the Bill, the countryside bodies may adopt a higher or lower threshold than 5 hectares. It is for them individually to decide, in the light of experience. They may apply different thresholds to different types of land. We see no reason to interfere with that discretion.

<P>
Different considerations apply to registered common land. No minimum size threshold is specified because such practical difficulties do not arise. Registered common land is, by definition, already mapped. The Countryside Agency does not need to survey such sites, and although provision has been made for consultation on their inclusion on the map, the grounds for objection relate solely to whether the land is indeed registered. About 70 per cent. of commons in England are under 5 hectares in size. I make no apology for repeating what my right hon. Friend the Minister said on our first sitting:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>many such commons in lowland England are the only areas of uncultivated, unenclosed land within areas of intensive agriculture  We therefore intend to ensure that they are not forgotten.-[Official Report, Standing Committee B, 28 March 2000; c. 25.]<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> I agree entirely with what the Under-Secretary says, and I am not sure why he bothered to say it. I do not propose that the 5-hectare threshold should apply to common land. The amendments that relate to common land refer simply to the agency's discretion not to count such sites.

<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> Excellent. I shall now move to amendments Nos. 264 and 269, which would exclude inaccessible islands from maps. Under the amendments, the public would not know where to find land that is open country, but was not directly accessible at the time of mapping. Our view is that any land that falls within the description of registered common land or open country and that is, in the case of the latter, not so small that its inclusion would serve no useful purpose should be shown on the statutory maps. How else will anyone know where such land lies to enable access authorities to make it accessible for the public, perhaps by negotiating a new right of way?

<P>
Amendment No. 266 would give the countryside bodies discretion not to map large areas of water as open country. As the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire said, we have touched on the matter before. We do not expect large expanses of water-let us call them lakes-to be mapped as open country. It is for the countryside body to determine what is, or is predominantly, mountain, heath or down. The mapping of lakes is already a matter for the discretion of the countryside body and the amendment is therefore unnecessary.

<P>
<H5>3.30 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Elfyn Llwyd </B>(Meirionnydd Nant Conwy): The proposal is not as preposterous as the Minister makes out. Lakes and various common lands have been registered under the Commons Registration Act 1965.

<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> We agree that there may be parcels of land, greater of smaller than 5 hectares, which for one reason or another should not be included on the map. All we are arguing about is whether that should be prescribed in the Bill or whether we should leave the discretion to the countryside agencies. The Government firmly support the latter course. I ask the hon. Member to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> I understand the Minister's arguments about a de minimis figure, but one of the reasons for tabling the amendment was to draw from the Minister what areas of land he felt should be excluded. I fear that he believes that nothing should be excluded, which will not be helpful to getting the maps speedily under way.

<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> The hon. Gentleman obviously did not hear what I said to the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy. It is perfectly possible that there will be areas under or over 5 hectares that, for one reason or another, should not be included. It is certainly not our case that everthing should be included. Our case is that the countryside agencies should have the discretion and should not be restricted to what is written into the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> I am happy to accept that further explanation. The hon. Member for Brighton, Pavilion (Mr. Lepper) referred to the South Downs and I wish to make two points in regard to that. The view of the Country Landowners Association is that 5 hectares would ensure that isolated, rough fields in the lowlands-which might be called down or heath-would be excluded and that a clear distinction could then be drawn between extensive heath or down, such as the Dorset heaths or the South Downs, and isolated fragments of heath or down. So even the CLA is suggesting that areas such as the South Downs would be clear. The hon. Gentleman also talked about the cultural value of allowing access to small areas of ground that were rich in plant life or wildlife. I suggest that the damage caused by significant access onto small areas that are rich in wildlife could be considerable-proportionately much greater than access onto open spaces. Having made those two points, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 270, in page 3, line 33, leave out ``whether'' and insert ``if''.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will convenient to take the following amendments: No. 271, in page 3, line 34, leave out from ``is'' to second ``to''.

<P>
No. 272, in page 3, line 35, at end add-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(6) The physical feature referred to in subsection (5)(b) must be in open country or within 20 metres of open country.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> This group of amendments explores the boundaries of the open country that will be mapped. Subsection (5)(b) allows the relevant countryside body to put the boundary of open country on land that may not be open country. We have discussed the definitions of ``wholly'' and ``predominantly'' in regard to open country, but it appears from the subsection that that is not enough. Amendments Nos. 270 and 271 would allow the boundaries of open country to be drawn within an area of open country to coincide with a physical feature, but prevent open country from being stretched to a feature outside it.

<P>
Amendment No. 272 is more in the nature of a probing amendment, to find out the Minister's thinking on definition. We want to avoid the problems that will result from defining the boundary by reference to a physical feature. How far from the open country can a physical feature be? Can it be the next dry stone wall, for example, which could be a long distance away? Problems could emerge whereby access rights would be extended to hay or silage fields and other land that should not be included in the measure.

<P>
The Minister has already said that such land should not be mapped as open country. A potential conflict could arise between his intention and the use of the physical features bondary, which obviously has some common sense behind it. As a sighting shot, our amendment suggests that such features should be within 20 m of the open country. The Minister may say that that is too small a distance and may wish to introduce another limit. However, the provision is rather vague at the moment and it could be improved by the inclusion of further definitions.

<P>
The NFU is concerned that the Bill, as drafted, allows land that is not open country to be mapped as such because of its proximity to a particular physical feature. In that regard, it would be worth while the Under-Secretary confirming whether it would be possible for the clause, as drafted, to extend the provision to cultivated land, although that would usually be considered excepted land. It is not clear which of those two desiderata takes priority in the Bill. It would be useful to have the matter cleared up. That could be done in one of two ways: either by amendments Nos. 272 and 271 which would restrict the use of a physical feature to land inside the open country or, at the least, by setting a limit on how far outside the open country the next physical feature can be to provide the boundary of the open land. I should be grateful for the Minister's comments.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. David Heath:</B> I shall take up little of the Committee's time. I wish simply to probe the Minister on how the clause should be interpreted. It is not the most transparent provision in the Bill. I assume that the intention is to allow, for example, a meandering river to be followed as a boundary, rather than the boundary weaving in and out of the bank. That works well if the physical feature itself is of the nature of a boundary. It is not so how boundaries would apply in the case of other physical features that apply at a point rather than being of a linear nature. I hope that I am expressing myself adequately; it is a little difficult to do so, but it is equally difficult to interpret the clause. We must have some clarity, otherwise people will argue about the whereabouts of a boundary of a steep incline if it were used as a boundary marker.

<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> This is another argument about the difference between discretion and prescription. I say this gently because of the constructive tone taken by the Opposition during the course of our proceedings, but for the purposes of the Bill we are the party of the light touch and they are the party of the heavy hand and of regulation. Yet again, they seek to regulate where discretion and common sense are more appropriate. We are also the party of the common-sense revolution.

<P>
Clause 4(5)(b) allows the countryside bodies to map open country to the nearest physical feature, whether the effect is to include other land as open country or to exclude some open country. The paragraph reflects the fact that open country is not a freestanding feature of the landscape. As hon. Members have said, it is not always conveniently demarcated by stone walls and hedges, and there may be a seamless transition between heath and woodland or between semi-natural downland and semi-improved grazing.

<P>
It would be impractical for both landowner and public if countryside bodies were to attempt to draw artificial boundaries to such land without reference to identifiable features on the ground. Amendments Nos. 270 and 271 would remove that discretion and leave walkers entirely bemused about how far they could or could not walk, even if they had a map showing the extent of the access land.

<P>
Amendment No. 272 would impose an arbitrary limit on the countryside bodies' ability to exercise their discretion. The scope to map outwards to a feature beyond the margin of the open country would be limited to 20 m but, as the threshold between open country and other land will often be seamless, who is to say from where the 20 m limit would be measured?

<P>
The amendments remove or fetter the discretion of the countryside bodies to take sensible decisions about tying access land to identifiable features of the landscape to give clarity and consistency to the new right. For example, the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr, Heath) suggested that there might be a meandering river boundary. We expect the countrydside bodies to exercise their discretion with great care; they should not seek to embrace land that is not part and parcel of open country, or that is incompatible with the right of access because of the way in which it is likely to be used. If any land is unreasonably included in open country as a result of that discretion, landowners will of course, under clause 5, have the right of appeal. Landowners who are aggrieved at the way in which their land has been demarcated will have the right to have that grievance recognised and the map amended. I therefore ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I am not sure that the Under-Secretary's explanation is entirely adequate. I am happy to acknowledge that we are the party of the light touch and sensible regulation; we are also the party of the countryside and therefore know how it works.

<P>
I am happy in this instance to have the endorsement to the NFU. The Under-Secretary insisted that the countryside bodies would take a common-sense view. That merged into saying that common sense suggested that they would actively seek to have a natural boundary recognisable to the walker as the boundary of access land. In my opening remarks, I made the obvious consequential point about what hold sway-whether it is the desire not to encourage people to walk inadvertently over the land that is being used for silage or hay making, or the desire to have a natural feature as a boundary. He answered airily that it would be all right because landowners would be able to appeal. When the Committe discusses clause 6, we will point out that the appeals procedure is inherently badly designed. Without going over that ground too early, it is not entirely acceptable for the Under-Secretary to say, ``People may object to the effect of the clause, but at least they can appeal against it.'' it is a shame that the Minister will not accept the common-sense change that the amendments would introduce. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(7) The body shall issue, within 6 months of the date referred to in subsection (5), a map showing all land in its area in respect of which any application has been made to it for inclusion in the said map.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment would alter clause 4 so that it requires the countryside bodies to issue maps within a specified period of 32 months, which is two and a half years, plus the additional two months to which clause 73 refers in relation to the delay period between the coming into force of other parts of the Bill and clause 4. I would be the first to accept that the sanction imposed by the amendment does not bear the hallmarks of a light touch. In the event of a failure by the countryside bodies to issue a map within the specified period, it is somewhat draconian.

<P>
The amendment is probing and is intended to address one of the Bill's basic principles. Other than the fast-track areas where there will be access without maps-which are outside the definition of clause
 1(1)(b)-it is right to say that ``no maps, no access'' is a principle behind the Bill. The Bill is entirely silent on the maximum period within which the countryside bodies have to prepare maps. Interestingly, clause 11, which gives the Secretary of State and National Assembly the power to make regulations, does not stipulate a maximum period within which maps are to be prepared, although clause 11(2)(b) refers to regulations relating to the manner and form in which draft maps are to be prepared. In the minds of many, that is a lacuna. It gives rise to concern that the mapping process may continue indefinitely, without any sanction on the countryside bodies in the event of delay.

<P>
Surely it would be consistent with the Bill's intention to fill that lacuna. Stipulating a time period is a way of giving effect to the fundamental principle behind the Bill-providing access, for recreational purposes, to open land for many thousands of people. Surely there is a legitimate public interest in ensuring that the purpose of the Bill is effective in a timely manner, with reasonable promptitude. I suspect that the Under-Secretary will pray in aid the need not to be over-prescriptive and tie the hands of the countryside bodies, especially in such a complicated area. Surely, however, there is also a legitimate public interest in ensuring that, when public money and resources are given to the countryside agencies to carry out the mapping process, the public should expect and require that that money be used effectively, efficiently and in a timely manner.

<P>
I expect that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary will argue that it is unrealistic to tie the hands of the countryside bodies, but much of our debate has concerned balance. Opposition Members rightly argued about tilting the balance more in the interests of users. Equally, it can be argued in relation to the amendment that public interest dictates that the balance should be tilted in favour of a maximum period within which the countryside bodies should prepare the maps. If there are no maps, there will be no access. I shall be interested to hear my hon. Friend the Minister's reply.

<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> As my hon. Friend the Member for Clwyd, West (Mr. Thomas) says, the amendment would introduce an interim measure in the event that the countryside bodies' production of draft maps of open country and registered common land were delayed beyond two and a half years after Royal Assent. That would require the countryside bodies to issue draft maps showing land that landowners, walkers or others had identified as open country.

<P>
I recognise that my hon. Friend is concerned about the lack of a timetable in the Bill for the delivery of the statutory right of access. It is in recognition of that concern that we have provided for a fast track for access to mountain and registered common land over 600 m above sea level. that is set out in clause 1(1). We believe that access to such land can be introduced within two to three years of Royal Assent.

<P>
Mapping of access land is liable to take a little longer. Hon. Members will recognise that we have gone to some lengths to balance the interests of the expedition of maps with the protection of landowners and others' interests in their land. The provisions for consultation and appeals on maps in clauses 4 to 9 will take time, but will be fairer to all concerned.

<P>
Unfortunately, the amendment would have uncertain results. We are happy to receive proposals from the CLA and others about landowners producing maps to show what they believe is open country. That is a welcome mechanism to build consensus, and not only landowners but all interested parties will be free to make suggestions. I know that the Countryside Agency and the Countryside Council for Wales want to encourage an early dialogue with those concerned about the mapping process. We believe that that is the best way forward, so I ask my hon. Friend to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> Judging by the past two or three debates, there is common ground in the Committee about the need for the mapping exercise to be done as quickly and effectively as possible. That seems to be the general thrust of what we and Government Members have said. Our amendments would achieve that aim. They are all about consultation, and about encouraging the mapping agency to involve everyone who has an interest in the land at the earliest possible stage. The inevitable result of not involving them properly will be that the on-going appeals after the draft maps have been published will be more drawn out. Many matters will have been thrashed out, but they could have been dealt with more simply by prior consultation. The Under-Secretary may say that, of course, the Government will consult the owners and land users, but such a statement will not be sufficient to ensure that such action takes place. Such a consultation process must be outlined in the Bill. We are not talking about regulations; it is just common sense that people should be consulted.

<P>
Amendment No. 227 would require the agency to advertise the fact that work was under way to prepare draft maps and to invite owners and occupiers to provide details of their land and say what they consider to be access land to that area. It would enable them to be involved before the draft maps had been prepared. Amendment No. 228 would require that individual consultation takes place, as would amendment No. 321 because it would provide for regulations that govern mapping to make provision for consultation with the owners of the land, again prior to the issuing of draft maps.

<P>
Amendment No. 340 would introduce a new schedule, which would set out the arrangements for consultation with the owners when the draft maps and provisional maps of access land had been prepared, which is the next stage. It is essential that owners and occupiers of the land are given the opportunity to comment and that that right to comment is incorporated in the Bill. They should be told what is happening and be given an opportunity to make their representations and, subsequently, to appeal about the decisions. However, if such matters can be dealt with before going to appeal, the process would be much smoother and the result would be achieved more quickly.

<P>
Notices on posts or in newspapers alone will not be sufficient. Notice should be given personally to owners, lessees and other occupiers to ensure that they are aware of the situation. One problem that will result from the possible involvement of the agency in such small parcels of land is the welter of individual owners. I am sure that the hon. Members for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy and for Clwyd, West, who are both lawyers with an interest in such matters, will agree that often it is not clear who owns certain land. The sooner that the agency embarks on the exercise of establishing the owners and consulting them, the sooner the whole procedure will be completed. It is important that the amendments are given a proper hearing and that the Government understand the purpose behind them. We want to minimise delays in the mapping process.

<P>
The proposed new schedule goes into considerable detail, and I shall not take up the Committee's time by going through its provisions. Putting notices here, there and everywhere will not necessarily ensure that people know what is going on. The Bill will affect the civil rights of landowners and they have a right to be told personally what is happening. They may not be present in the country or see the notice when it appears in the newspaper. The only which in which they can consider exercising their right to appeal is if they know that a map affecting their land has been produced. That can be ensured only by personal notification.

<P>
The time scale for representations will be relatively short and, when a map has been published in its conclusive form, the right of access arises and continues until the map is reviewed and amended. The proposed new schedule is based on the public path creation orders under the Highways Act 1980. Again, as in other cases, we have tried to use existing legislation as we know that it is technically correct, is usually more acceptable and provides consistency.

<P>
Failing to serve a personal notice on someone who is directly affected by access raises a serious issue in relation to the Human Rights Act 1998. The wider issue is also subject to debate, but I shall deal with the narrow point about notification. Such a failure affects the right to property in protocol 1 of article 1 of the European convention on human rights, and in such circumstances, property owners' and occupiers' civil rights would be affected. They are entitled to a fair hearing before an independent and impartical tribunal to determine whether their land should be subject to access rights. That fair hearing can take place only if the person affected knows that his or her rights are being challenged. That is the purpose behind the amendments and the new schedule, which would require full consultation.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Heath:</B> I should like the hon. Gentleman to put my mind at rest on the operation of amendment No. 228. I sympathise with his view that landowners and occupiers should be consulted, but I am worried that failure to consult or contact someone with an interest in the land that was unknown to the Countryside Agency at the time might invalidate the map-making process. That seems too extreme, and might throw the entire process into confusion.

<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> I fully accept the hon. Gentleman's point. Clearly, the system would need to be failsafe. If amendment No. 228 could lead to the eventuality that he describes, the drafting is faulty. I have always believed, even more so after an ever increasing number of years in this place, that the purpsoe of tabling amendments is not necessarily to get the wording absolutely right but to air issues. If the Government can be convinced of the justice of an issue, we can worry about the wording and get it right later. That is my approach to all the amendments. The issue that the amendments raise is consultation before and during the process in order to ensure that it goes as smoothly as possible.

<P>
<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> I agree wholeheartedly with the notion that the notice should be personally served. I do not want to be rude about members of the farming fraternity, but they are not always very good at replying to correspondence. I once knew a farmer-indeed, I acted for him as a lawyer-in Dolgellau, who used to open his post once a month. Others, too, are not keen on the written word. I am not being rude about them, but they have better things to do. Giving them personal notification might be a step forward.

<P>
I do not want to put a damper on the debate, late as it is in the afternoon. I agree wholeheartedly that the sooner that the maps are prepared, the better. However, our illustrious predecessors who introduced the Commons Registration Act 1965 no doubt felt that registration should take place as soon as possible, too. The last commissioner's hearing was in 1989.

<P>
I do not know whether this is the appropriate point at which to ask the Minister, but at some point during our deliberations, will he or his colleague tell us the cost implications of the Bill and where the money will come from?

<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> As the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire said in moving the amendment, we all agree that mapping of access land is crucial to the implementation of the new right of access. We also agree that the maps should be fair to landowners and of maximum benefit to the public. Effective consultation is obviously essential to achieve that, so there is no disagreement about the purpose underlying the amendments. However, the issue that they press is whether detailed mechanisms for consultation should be set out in primary legislation. In drawing up the access maps, the countryside agencies are keen to ensure effective dialogue with all concerned. I know that, because I meet them almost every week and I know the persons concerned. I understand that the hon. Gentlemen, who have not had that opportunity, want everything to be made explicit in the Bill. That is unnecessary, and there is a fallback to which I will come in a moment.

<P>
The countryside agencies will publicise the production of draft maps, and will listen to comments from anyone about the location of access land and the necessary restrictions. However, I would not want to place them under a duty to inform all landowners individually at every stage of the mapping process. That is what is implied by the amendments, and it is going too far. Frankly, such a duty would be unmanageable.

<P>
<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> With respect, I do not think that it would. If the identifiable owner were under a duty to file a form giving full details of all co-owners and those with an interest, it would not be difficult to make identifications. There is a great deal of concern in Wales about the way in which Cadw, the historical monuments quango, operates. It registers without any notice at all, and that causes untold grief to many people.

<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> The hon. Gentleman's final words are the key ones. Cadw has undertaken its operations without consulting anyone. I entirely accept that that causes offence, and I would not for one moment suggest that the Countryside Agency should or would behave like that. If there turns out to be a problem with the agency, the Government retain the power to ensure that consultation takes place. However, I know that the people in the agency desire to achieve a consensual process. I can remember a senior member of the agency saying, ``Our aim is to ensure that this is done in such a manner that people in several years' time will ask what the fuss was all about.'' Those were his words, not mine.

<P>
<B>Mr. Paice rose-</B><P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I wondered whether I was wise to relate such comments, even without identifying the person involved. I am happy to give way.

<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> I shall not take the Minister up on the individual's comment. If the Minister had been asked about the attitude of the Highways Agency to public paths, he would presumably have said exactly the same sort of thing about its desire to consult. However, that body's obligation to consult is set out in the Highways Act 1980, which is why we propose that the Bill should include a similar provision.

<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> The important point is that there should be consultation, and I recognise the force of the hon. Gentleman's argument. The issue is whether that is strictly necessary; to consult on a highway is one thing, but to consult every landowner at every stage of the mapping process is going over the top. I am confident that the agencies will take all sensible steps to ensure that those affected by the maps have the opportunity to feed in their views. I believe that the agencies' statutory requirements should remain focused on the formal preparation of the maps, which is their primary duty. Having said that, should it prove necessary to further regulate the consultation process-I do not believe that it will be-there is already provision under clause 11(2), which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Regulations under this section may in particular make provision with respect to  consultation with local highway authorities, National Park authorities and other persons on maps in draft form.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
If we need to use regulations formally and statutorily to determine the method of consultation, we could do so. However, I am happy that the provision provides an adequate power, even as a backstop that I believe will not be necssary. I remain convinced that it is a procedural matter, which it is not necessary to set out in detail in the Bill-although, judging from his facial expression, the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire is doubtful about that. The provision is satisfactory; there is a fallback power and the hon. Gentleman's proposal is unnecessary. I hope that he will not press the amendment to a Division.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I am grateful for your advice, Mr. Stevenson, and I apologise for jumping the gun earlier. Local authorities prepare definitive maps for rights of way. Their surveying and legal departments deal with such matters. Will the Minister say whether it will be necessary for the Countryside Agency to duplicate that number of staff? Cannot it draw on the expertise and facilities that local authorities have in place to save incurring extra public costs?

<P>
The amendments deal with how landowners will be consulted. How will members of the public be consulted? In particular, will parish councils be given an opportunity to have an input into the draft plans? Local authority legal departments deal with local authority searches. When people buy properties, they will want to know definitely whether such land is affected by the Bill, when enacted. Will the Countryside Agency have to set up a legal department to deal with the new type of searches that will be required?

<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> The hon. Gentleman-fairly-raised several points. I envisage that the countryside bodies would consult the parish councils, which clearly have a relevant locus. As for duplication, there will be a dual function. As the hon. Gentleman said, local authorities are responsible for drawing up definitive or statutory maps and it is for the countryside bodies to produce more user-friendly, but non-statutory material. As for the need for definitive maps about the rights of a property, it is the local authority statutory maps to which reference will be made. That is the case now. If there are doubts about rights of way, reference is made to the archives of the local authorities. That will continue. The countryside bodies will not be duplicating roles; their role will be separate, but complementary.

<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> The Minister understood from my expression my concern about his response. He interpreted it correctly. Frankly, his reply was inadequate. He failed to understand my point that the obligation to consult is contained in other legislation. Our new schedule was built on the Highways Act 1980, but we had also considered two other Acts. To prove that that was not an aberration, there is a similar provision under the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949, which was the forerunner of many of the present proposals. It refers to the obligation to consult, as does the Acquisition of Land Act 1981, which deals with compulsory purchase orders. I was trying not to break new ground, but simply to ensure that the Bill deals with those crucial matters in the same way as other legislation.

<P>
<H5>4.15 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that the Minister did not deal adequately with my point about local authority searches? Of course the local authority has the right to prepare a definitive map, but the local authority will not, as I understand it, have the legal obligation to keep the draft map. In dealing with the purchase of properties, where can solicitors and others direct their searches in the light of changes made by the legislation?

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Paice:</B> My hon. Friend makes an important point. The parish councils that he referred to earlier are covered by our proposed new schedule but he is right about local authority searches and we await a response on that. The Minister reported his conversations with the agency. I do not denigrate such conversations but, as we all know, whereas personnel come and go, Acts go on for ever-or seem to. That is why we think that the matter should be covered in the Bill. I was interested to hear about the correspondence of the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy with the farmer in Dolgellau. In taking a month to open his post he has obviously been taking lessons from the various Departments from whom we regularly seek answers.

<P>
I am not convinced by the Minister's response. He is a reasonable man and I hope that he will reflect on the fact that in other legislation that deals with similar issues the matter is written into the Bill. However, I do not wish to detain the Committee and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I rise simply to ask the Minister if he could give an adequate answer to my question about legal searches.

<P>
<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> Perhaps I can assist the hon. Gentleman. Where an area of outstanding beauty or an SSSI is registered, the solicitor would normally write directly to the conservation body responsible for registering. So in the case we are discussing, I expect that the solicitor would write directly to the countryside body that has overall responsiblility for the mapping.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I am grateful for that intervention because that is exactly what I imagined would happen. The countryside agencies would presumably need to set up an entire legal department to deal with what will doubtless be a considerable number of legal inquiries. If that is the case, perhaps the Minister could tell us what resources, and extra staff in terms of surveyors and solicotors, the Countryside Agency will have to take on to deal with those inquiries.

<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I accept that my initial response was misleading. The duty of local authorities in regard to rights of way is different from the mapping of open country and the countryside bodies are indeed under a duty to establish whether land is mountain, moor, heath and so on. There is no parallel with the maintenance of definitive maps. The hon. Gentleman is therefore right that the agency will have to respond to detailed inquiries. What extra personnel or resources will be necessary for that purpose and how many inquiries are likely is a matter for quesion; we are talking about whether land is open country and whether there will be a right of access to it. I cannot say now how onerous and extensive the duty is likely to be. I am happy to take advice about out best estimates and come back to the hon. Gentleman.

<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<P>
Clause 5 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<H4><center>Clause 6</center></H4>
<H4><center>Appeal against map after confirmation</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 341, in page 4, line 4, at end insert ``to the Lands Tribunal''.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 342, in page 4, leave out lines 5 and 6.

<P>
No. 358, in page 4, line 20, leave out from first ``the'' to ``may'' in line 21 and insert ``Lands Tribunal''.

<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> The amendment addresses the vital issue of the appeals procedure. We are trying to save the Government from themselves. The Minister will be aware that there is controversy over whether the Bill conforms to the European convention on human rights, despite the fact that it carries the standard claim now printed on the front of all Bills. He will also be aware that distinguished legal opinion suggests that it does not conform. I have seen cogent legal opinion to suggest that, and I assume that the Government have consulted their own lawyers and are happy that the Bill meets the terms of the convention, which is now part of our domestic law through the Human Rights Act 1998.

<P>
The problem is relevant to the appeals procedure. A significant body of evidence suggests that a failure to provide an appeals system independent of Government contravenes the Human Rights Act. Article 6 of the convention gives a right
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial tribunal.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It seems arguable that an appeal to the Government or an appeal determined by the planning inspectorate does not provide an independent tribunal in planning matters. That argument has even greater force when the appeal is against the decision of a Government agency, as it is in this context.

<P>
Appeals under clause 6 will primarily raise issues of fact and expert opinion, such as whether land is moorland, rather than the policy and political decisions that affect many planning applications. That strengthens the case for an independent appeals system, for which there is precedent. The European Court of Human Rights ruled against Guernsey's Royal Court determining planning appeals when its head had presided over an original planning decision.

<P>
There is United Kingdom case law as well. In Bryan v. United Kingdom, the European Court of Human Rights held that the planning inspectorate was not independent and impartial-a view that would be held by the many of my constitutents who have suffered from planning inspectors-but that a fair hearing had been given because of the right to appeal from the Secretary of State to the High Court. In that case, there were no facts in dispute, but there often will be in appeals under the Bill.

<P>
The Government are in danger of wading into deep water. The clause is at the edge of what may be allowable under the Human Rights Act, and may be where they step over the line. We have sought a solution to address the legal difficulties and, more importantly, the underlying fairness of the Bill, so that people have an appeals system in which they have confidence. That system should be fair and independent and seen to be so. The Government may have alternative methods for an independent appeals system.

<P>
Our suggestion is to use the Lands Tribunal as an alternative to the Secretary of State. There is a general point about how much Secretaries of State should be allowed to use quasi-judicial powers; the Government should think long and hard before extending them. In this case, the Lands Tribunal is clearly experienced, as it has dealt with property matters for more than 50 years. It would be no more expensive than any other system, because any public body hearing appeals under the Bill would have to recruit and train additional members or inspectors. The Lands Tribunal could presumably fulfil that role as well as any other public body.
 
<P>
The underlying thrust of the amendments is that an alternative independent appeals system is needed for simple equity and fairness and to avoid potential legal difficulties for the Government in future. Such difficulties would be likely to delay the implementation of the regime under the Bill. The amendments strike at the heart of the Bill. I urge the Committee to support them.

<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> As the hon. Member for Ashford said, the amendments would change the body to which appeals on mapping should be made. The Bill provides that anyone with an interest in land may appeal to the Secretary of State in England or the National Assembly for Wales against the showing of that land on provisional maps. Under the amendments, appeals would be to the Lands Tribunal.

<P>
The Secretary of State and the National Assembly would deal with appeals relatively quickly and inexpensively-they already have systems in place to deal with that type of appeal, and will be able to offer
an adequate service. We have in mind using the planning inspectorate, but we have not yet reached a hard and fast conclusion. We are open to suggestions for alternatives. The difficulty with using the Lands Tribunal-I am sure that if Conservative Members consult their friends in the CLA, they will confirm this-is that it provides neither a cheap nor a quick solution, which is what the CLA wanted. The Lands Tribunal is a slow and expensive solution.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I recently received a decision from the planning inspectorate that took two and a half years. Does the Under-Secretary really think that it provides a cheap and quick solution?

<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> Far be it from me to defend the planning inspectorate-well, why not, since I am a Minister in the relevant Department. We are not arguing that it should be the planning inspectorate; it is merely what we have in mind. Opposition Members may have an alternative suggestion, but we do not think that it is a better one. The Lands Tribunal is a Rolls-Royce service-the equivalent of the High Court-and is at Rolls-Royce prices. That is not a suitable way of dealing with disputes. The Bill provides an adequate vehicle for appeals. The amendment would increase the costs and-believe it or not-could increase the time scale of appeals.
[Mr Humfrey Malins in the Chair]

<P>
On whether the clause comes within the human rights legislation, I am advised that it does. The Bryan case, which was cited by the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire, supports that conclusion. Although I will ask the hon. Member for Ashford to withdraw the amendment, I repeat that our minds are not closed on the question of which body should hear the appeal.

<P>
<H5>4.30 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I am grateful for the Minister's three inches of movement. The principle behind the amendment, which I shall make even clearer, is whether the appeal will be independent. Obviously, the Secretary of State is not independent of decisions made by agencies, and nor is the planning inspectorate, in that planning inspectors are appointed by and report to the Secretary of State.

<P>
As I said, I am not necessarily preaching the virtues of the Lands Tribunal. It is merely a body that already exists and clearly has the experience to do the job. The Minister may be right that it provides a Rolls-Royce service that would be expensive, but the important delineation is whether appeals will be heard by a body that is-and is seen to be-independent of the Secretary of State. If the Under-Secretary can assure us that he will seriously consider alternatives that are independent, I shall withdraw the amendment with a rather lighter heart than I would otherwise.

</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Thomas:</B> I make no apologies for referring to the recurrent theme of our deliberations, which relates to the need to ensure even-handedness and balance in the Bill between the interests of those who legitimately use the land for farming and other purposes, and those who will, thank so the Bill, enjoy a new and extended right of access.

<P>
 The right of appeal conferred by clause 6 is unbalanced, in that it confers a right of appeal against the inclusion of land as open country in provisional maps only on people who have an interest in the land, not on those who want to enjoy access to it. The phrase in clause 6
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>an interest in any land<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
is defined in clause 41(1), which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``interest'', in relation to land, includes any estate in land and any right over land, whether the right is exercisable by virtue of the ownership of an estate.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Clearly, therefore, those who own land have a right of appeal under clause 6, as indeed to those who
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>by virtue of a licence or agreement<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
have an interest in the land.
<P>
The right of appeal is therefore extended to owner, tenants and licensees. Furthermore, interest in land is extended by that definition to include people who have
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>rights of common (as defined by section 22 of the Commons Registration Act 1965),<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and, most significantly, those who enjoy ``sporting rights''. Therefore those who have sporting rights have a right of appeal under clause 6, but those who want to enjoy the right to recreation on open country apparently do not have corresponding right of appeal.

<P>
The Government have clearly been at pains to ensure that a correct balance is struck between the interests that are involved. They are not necessarily competing interests. Surely that is the theme of the Bill. It concerns the interests of those who own and use the land and who have, in the strictest sense, a legal estate in the land under the Bill, and those who seek access to it. The Bill creates a new right that could be regarded as a public right, without necessarily describing it as a right that is conferred on individuals.

<P>
A mechanism should be in place to take into account the rights of those who seek to exercise access in accordance with clause 2. The Minister will rely on clause 5, which provides that, when the draft maps have been prepared and issued, any person can make representations on what should be, or should not be, included in them. The Minister will say that that is how the public interest is taken into account. However, at the very least it is arguable that that is not sufficient. If we draw an analogy from the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 and the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949, under which the public have a locus standi in certain circumstances, there is an imbalance in the Bill, and I should be interested to know how the Government will rationalise it. I accept that opening a right of appeal to all and sundry would open the floodgates. It would create an unstable situation.

<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin indicated assent.</B><P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Thomas:</B> The Bill requires strict time limits. Clause 11(2)(f) refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the period within which and the manner in which the representations on a map in draft form may be made.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That imports a strict time limit as do other regulations, so it is not beyond the wit of the parliamentary draftsman to deal with the potential problem of an unmanageable flood of appeals from users.

<P>
<B>Mr. David Borrow </B>(South Ribble): It may be of interest to my hon. Friend to know that, under the rating legislation following the post-war years, it was assumed that there was no right for someone who was not an occupier or owner of land to appeal against a rating assessment. However, following case law in connection with Arsenal football club, it was held that a person who was not the ratepayer but who could be held as such because of his involvement as a ratepayer within the local area, had some standing and had a right to appeal against the rating assessment. That right was used rarely. If it were given to non-owners or occupiers of land under the Bill, there would similarly be few appeals.

<P>
<B>Mr. Thomas:</B> I thank my hon. Friend for that helpful intervention. The Minister well understands my point, which primarily concerns balance. I wish to quote an extract from Planning, the journal of the Royal Town Planning Institute dated 7 April 2000. It states that it may be necessary to give a
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>third party right of appeal against planning permission<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
to conform with article 6 of the European convention on human rights, which forms part of the schedule to the Human Rights Act 1998. I should be interested to hear the Minister's reponse.

<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> With your indulgence, Mr. Malins, I wish to make a not entirely unrelated point that arises from amendment No. 320 which was moved a few moments before you came in by my hon. Friend the Member for Clwyd, West. He was concerned that the mapping process would be strung out indefinitely by delays if there was no incentive to prevent that from happening. I am conscious that I did not entirely satisfy him on that, so it is important that I place one point on the record. Under existing powers in the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949 and the Environmental Protection Act 1990, the Secretary of State and the National Assembly for Wales will, as a measure of last resort, be able to direct the Countryside Agency and the Countryside Council for Wales to take steps to prepare the maps if they think that there is some foot-dragging going on.

<P>
<B>Mr.Thomas:</B> I thank my hon. Friend for clarifying the issue; that is indeed welcome. I look forward to an opportunity to examine those Acts.

<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I am grateful to you, Mr. Malins, for allowing me to put that on the record.

<P>
I might not be able to give my hon. Friend quite so much satisfaction on these amendments. I naturally appreciate the good intentions behind them, and I am sure that most of us would like as much land as reasonably possible to be included on the maps. However, I regret that the amendment would delay the implementation of the right, and delay is a matter about which my hon. Friend has been concerned. Despite what he said, the amendment could lead to an unmanageable number of appeals, which would take a significant time to resolve. As my hon. Friend rightly predicted, I shall argue that members of the public will have an opportunity to feed their views into the mapping process, and the countryside bodies will hold public consultations on their draft maps. I should emphasise that the consultation will be as wide and thorough as possible.

<P>
My hon. Friend reasonably asked why there should be a different set of rights for landowners, but I think that he knows the answer. We have provided for a right of appeal for landowners and others with a clear legal interest in the land because they will be most affected by the new right of access. That also meets the requirements of the European convention on human rights. Although we appreciate the arguments for providing a right of appeal for members of the public, it would cause severe delays in the implementation of the new right of access. That would be as painful to my hon. Friend and the many people interested in proceeding as swiftly as possible with a right of access as it would be to me. In any case, we hope that there will be few appeals by landowners. However, opening up the process to potentially every citizen and certainly to every walker could risk paralysing the process, and I am sure that no one wants to do that. I must therefore ask my hon. Friend to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Thomas:</B> I thank my hon. Friend for that interesting response. It did not go entirely the way I wanted, but it at least cast some light on the Government's thinking on the issue. I am not entirely satisfied, and I should like the Government to think again between now and Report stage. It might be possible to devise a way of keeping the number of appeals under control, perhaps through the imposition of strict time limits within which people are required to appeal and a sifting mechanism to determine what is, prima facie, a proper appeal. In the light of my hon. Friend's comments, however, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

</UL></FONT>

<P>
While both Whips are out of the Room, Mr. Malins, perhaps we ought to flex our muscles.

<P>
Amendment No. 346 relates to appeals by the Environment Agency. I am sure that both Ministers in their preparation for the Bill studied carefully the National Parks Act 1949, which will be mentioned many more times. Paragraph 2(4) of the Act gave the predecessors of the Environment Agency and statutory water undertakers the right to oppose access orders made under the Act. Ministers will realise that issues relating to access that affect water undertakers and the Environment Agency would not usually affect ordinary private or charitable landowners because they involve the purity and flow of the water supply and other factors relating to water, which may go hundreds of miles to the ultimate consumer. The amendment would simply provide in the Bill the opportunity for the agency, and water undertakers, to appeal on grounds additional to those in clause 6, which we have debated. We propose that in the narrow case of the Environment Agency and water undertakers, there should be wider grounds in the proposed new section (1B)(b) which would enable them to appeal on the basis of proximity to any reservoir used by those organisations or any other physical factor affecting the flow of water from the land into any such reservoir, or if there is danger to the purity of the water supply which could not be prevented by the taking of reasonable measures.

<P>
The amendment is straightforward. It would put a slight hole in the legislation simply to provide a right that exists in other legislation and that we think should be in the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> As the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire said, the amendment would give the Environment Agency and water companies a right of appeal on the ground that the right of access might in some way endanger the purity of water in reservoirs. The right that the Bill will introduce is subject to numerous restrictions such as the leaving of litter or rubbish. Criminal offences will, of course, apply, as elsewhere. Polluting water in reservoirs is a criminal offence that could incur a prison sentence of up to two years or a fine of up to 20,000.

<P>
There is no reason to suppose that the right of appeal will have an impact on the quality of reservoir water. Some water companies-regrettably not as many as I should like-already provide a right of access to land surrounding their reservoirs and collecting grounds. No problems have been reported as a result of this access, but it will be possible, if necessary, for countryside bodies to direct that access be restricted or excluded if there is thought to be a potential difficulty. The amendment is therefore unnecessary and I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw it.

<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> The Under-Secretary has made his point. Of course, no one has suggested that access, by its nature, will be dangerous to either the flow or purity of water supplies, or to any other aspect, but the risk is there. I accept that there is already access on some water companies' land. That is both reasonable and desirable, and is to be expected. We do not propose that access be denied: we say simply that where a statutory undertaker can foresee a problem, it should have the right to appeal against access. The Minister said that he does not anticipate a potential risk to water, but obviously a risk was envisaged in 1949, otherwise it would not have been mentioned in that Act covered the creation of access.

<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> We have had 50 years experience since then.

<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> It is probably more, because that was old Labour, and we are now under new Labour.

<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> The hon. Gentleman is clutching at straws.

<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> One will not find too many straws in open land. I accept that the Under-Secretary has tried to assuage my concerns-to a certain extent he has done so-but it is odd that there will be two separate pieces of legislation with different provisions to deal with access. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. David Heath:</B> I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Malins. I want to probe the Minister on one issue-the time from the moment of the map being published to the point at which an appeal has to be lodged. The matter also arises under clause 9, but can be dealt with under this clause. I am sure that it will be covered by regulation; indeed, provision exists for it to be so dealt with. The period should not be so short as to prevent adequate time for an appeal to be lodged-less than 28 days is probably too short-but, equally, it should not be so long as to hold up the entire process and encourage a delay in arriving at definitive maps. It would be far better to specify a time in the Bill. If the Minister has a period in mind, why, in order to assuage doubt, should it not be made clear? It is unlikely to require amendment after the Bill is in operation, so why should it be left to regulation?

<P>
<B>Mr. Borrow:</B> On the appeal body, I agree that the Lands Tribunal is a gold-plated option. However, it is important that the appeal is dealt with outside the Department of Environment, Transport and the Regions. I must declare and interest in that, I spent 20-odd years working for a subordinate body to the Lands Tribunal-a valuation tribunal. It is one of a number of bodies that could provide a quick, efficient and relatively inexpensive way of dealing with such appeals.

<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I acknowledge my hon. Friend's suggestion, on which we shall reflect. The hon. Member for Somerton and Frome will not be surprised to hear, as he mentioned it, that the time scale is matter for regulation, which will be dealt with under clause 11. I do not have a period in mind, but I might by the time we reach clause 11.

<P>
Question put and agreed to.

Clause 6 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<B>Mr. Thomas:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 317, in page 4, line 29, leave out from ``hearing'' to end of line 31 and insert ``, or''.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 318, in clause 11, page 7, line 8, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`which shall include provision for members of the public to make representations at such appeals.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Thomas:</B> I refer the Under-Secretary and the Committee to clause 7(1), which provides that, in the event of an appeal-the right to which will be confined to those who have an interest in land as defined-two possible avenues exist. the first, a hearing, appears to be more informal than the second, which is a local inquiry. They seem to be alternatives, although the wording does not make that entirely crystal clear.

<P>
My amendments address the fact that it seems important, when a hearing falls short of a proper local inquiry, that the views of objectors and those who enjoy access to the countryside should be heard and taken into account. That should be the case if the alternative proceedings of a local inquiry are adopted. The amendment arises out of a perceived need to ensure balance and even-handedness between the interests of those who have a legal estate and those who seek access to the land.

<P>
I simply seek an amendment to clause 11(2)(j) to give the Secretary of State and the National Assembly order-making powers in relation to hearing representations from members of the public. Many feel strongly on the matter, and I would be interested to see whether my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary could help, or at least seriously consider the matter.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> I support the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Clwyd, West, and would have added by name to them had the Committee not raced ahead at breakneck speed through its consideration of amendments today. I support amendment No. 317 because there is an argument about whether, in matters of fact during a hearing, any person should be able to make representations.

<P>
There is no conceivable argument for holding a hearing wholly or partly in private at the request of the applicant. What reason could there be? Before joining this Committee, I served on the Committee that considered the Freedom of Information Bill. I thought that we had reached the end of the Government's putting provisions in Bills to exclude members of the public who wanted to know what went on in their names. The hearings would be public functions investigating fact, so I ask the Minister to reconsider the provision about holding them in private.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gordon Prentice </B>(Pendle): I should like to remind my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary that the extensive briefings that we received from the Countryside Agency stated that, in respect of the appeal procedures in clause 7, the references at this point and later in the Bill to hearings being held in private were inappropriate. The Countryside Agency says that the processes should be transparent, and its recommendation, with which I tend to agree, is that the references should be removed from the Bill.

<P>

<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I am sympathetic to amendment No. 317, which is about whether hearings should ever be held in private. The Government envisage that almost all hearings will be in public. The only reason that I can think of for their occasionally being held in private is that they may involve sensitive financial information.

<P>
However, that is probably rather unlikely. I take on board and will consider the points made by my hon. Friends the Members for Pendle (Mr. Prentice) and for Clwyd, West, but I should be grateful if my hon. Friend the Member for Clwyd, West were to withdraw his amendment in return for that assurance.

<P>
We covered the territory about whether the public should have a right of appeal against maps on amendment No. 318 a few moments ago. I accept that there are arguments on both sides. There may be a case to give a right of appeal to all those-namely, the public-able to exercise the new right, but the prospect of anyone being able to appeal against any part of a map raises serious concerns about practicalities and delays in implementation. It is not sensible to argue that one is concerned about the delays that are likely to arise and at the same time massively open up the prospect for appeals. A formal right of appeal should be limited to those who have a legal interest in the land. That would help us to meet our obligations under the European convention on human rights, while avoiding what might be huge bureaucracy and consequent delay.

<P>
I must again ask my hon. Friend the Member for Clwyd, West to withdraw the amendment, as he did his previous amendment along similar lines.

<P>
<B>Mr. Thomas:</B> I have been more successful on this occasion in securing a constructive assurance from my hon. Friend the Minister about transparency, so I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
