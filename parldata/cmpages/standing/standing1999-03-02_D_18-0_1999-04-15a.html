<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies </B>(Grantham and Stamford): On a point of order, Mr. McWilliam. The context in which the debates on clause 50 will take place has been transformed by the incredible shambles that many hon. Members witnessed during the debate on the money resolution in the Chamber last night. I am sure that if you were not present during that debate, Mr. McWilliam, you will have read Hansard at your breakfast table this morning and therefore will be well aware of what happened. Not only were the Government unable to understand their own figures or to explain what the figure of £15 million represented, but--more seriously in relation to this morning's debate--they seemed incapable or unwilling to explain the relationship between the personal capability assessments, for which the clause provides, and the benefit integrity project and disability benefit entitlements reviews.
<P>
Those matters must be explored in great detail. Whether or not we can change the Bill--under new Labour it is no longer possible for Labour Back Benchers or Opposition Members to have any influence on Bills as they progress through the Committee stage--it will be a terrible dereliction of our duty if we do not, during discussion of clause 50, reach an understanding of what the relationship between the different reviews and assessments will be.
<P>
I do not like to stretch your indulgence, Mr. McWilliam, by raising major matters of principle on narrow amendments--in the light of last night's debate in the Chamber, it will be impossible to frame amendments--but my hon. Friends and I set great store by having a clause stand part debate. I know that you will not make a commitment at this stage to having such a debate on clause 50, and we shall impose a strict self-denying ordinance to ensure that we do not reduce the chances of having such an important debate. Other important general issues, such as therapeutic work, could only be raised in a clause stand part debate.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Social Security (Mr. Hugh Bayley):</B> Further to that point of order, Mr.McWilliam. Sadly, we have not yet started a stand part debate on clause 50, and the relevant issues raised by the hon. Gentleman can be discussed in such a debate. We shall not be able to discuss the benefit integrity project during that debate because it relates to disability living allowance. As I think the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford (Mr. Davies) appreciates, the personal capability assessment will he discussed because it relates to incapacity benefit.
<P>
Last night's debate was refreshing and open. If the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford had listened to my hon. Friend the Minister of State's speech--or if he had read Hansard in full--he would have the answers to the questions that he asked last night.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> Further to that point of order, Mr. McWilliam. If the Minister cares to read this morning's Hansard, at columns 336 and 337, he will see whole paragraphs of questions that I asked in relation to the impact of one form of assessment on the other reviews and vice versa. We did not receive a single answer to any of those questions last night, and answers are badly needed. Clearly, the Minister has repented overnight of the attitude taken by the Government, or perhaps he has been able to brief himself on the reality of the Government's policies.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We are now straying into a clause stand part debate. I shall decide later how thoroughly the Committee has explored clause 50, which deals with incapacity for work, personal capability assessments and nothing else. Also, I have heard of the concept of elasticity of demand, but I am not sure about elasticity of tolerance.
<H4><center>Clause 50</center></H4>
<H4><center>Incapacity for work: personal capability assessments</center></H4>

<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 85, in page 49, line 9, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"provided that in making the assessment under (a) and (b) above, account shall be taken of the types of jobs available in the locality considered.".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If the concept of elasticity of tolerance exists in this House, no one has ever suspected you of being guilty of exercising it, Mr. McWilliam, least of all I--as I have many reasons to know, both from my experience in considering this Bill, and from the pleasure that I have had in serving under your Chairmanship in the past.
<P>
It is my pleasure to speak to amendment No. 85, which proposes that when the personal capability assessment is made, account should be taken of the availability of work of the type of which the applicant is judged capable. It must be clear to all reasonable people that it would be cruel and unjustified to judge someone capable of work when, in practice, no such work existed. That claimant could therefore be deemed, theoretically, capable of a type of activity, although in practice there would be no chance of his exercising that activity, and he would also be denied benefit because he was deemed capable of that type of work. That would be an Orwellian trap into which the individual could fall. I hope that the Labour Government's Orwellian inclinations, so far as running the bureaucracy is concerned, are subject to limits, which will be imposed by common sense and by normal humanitarian sentiments.
<P>
A disabled person facing the prospect of a personal capability assessment will face a strenuous and worrying experience. We hope that those who are capable of some kind of useful activity--whether part-time, or a specialised activity, perhaps to be done at home--will be positively encouraged to undertake it. That is why we earlier tabled amendment No. 78--and were disappointed that the Government did not accept it--which proposed that the personal capability assessment should take place first and the work-focused interview afterwards. That would have left no doubt as to the capability of the person, and the work-focused interview could have taken place on the basis of an established medical report. The claimant could then have had a relaxed second interview, without worrying about whether he would be deprived retrospectively of benefit because of something he injudiciously said, or because of an over-optimistic statement about the type of work he would like to do, made at that first interview.
<P>
Unfortunately, the Government did not accept that proposal. It is therefore not clear whether the work-focused interviews will happen before or after the personal capability assessment. Inevitably, the claimant will therefore suspect that he will be gone over with a view to depriving him of benefit on both those occasions, and that any tricks that are available will be used against him. That would be an unhappy situation. There is also a suspicion that the personal capability assessment will be no more fair or effective than the all-work tests that they are replacing. I hope that we shall be able to discuss that in the clause stand part debate.
<P>
We do not want people to feel that the assessment is a trap, or an unpleasant charade, in which the assessor might find some activity in which the claimant might theoretically engage, even though it might be, for example, the assembly of jewellery that takes place in India or the south seas, and there would be no market for it here. The assessor might then say, "Well, you can move your fingers sufficiently to be able to do that, so you are capable of some form of work. Consequently, you are not eligible for benefit." The claimant then discovers, cruelly, that no such activity is available, either locally or nationwide. Similarly, one could devise various notional forms of employment activity for which there are no markets in the private, public or voluntary sectors.
<P>
We must be clear about the definition of availability for work, particularly about the meaning of those two important and related words, "availability" and "work". The Government must make a clear commitment with regard to the framing of the regulations, which should establish that what will be assessed will be the ability of the claimant to perform work that is actually available. Similarly, the Benefits Agency must make it clear to the doctors that it employs--whether directly or through a subcontract--that they are to make personal capability assessments on the basis of the availability of work that claimants can actually undertake. The Bill does not deal with that simple point, nor do the explanatory notes and glossy Government brochures such as the ironically titled, "A new contract for welfare: Support for Disabled People", provide any assurances. Given that the clauses that we are about to debate will deprive disabled people of some £800 million, the title of that Green Paper is a cruel joke. Such is the cynicism of the PR machine that the new Labour Government deploy.
<P>
We are trying to limit the damage that the provision will do. Disabled claimants or, in the case of personal capability assessments, interviewees--I shall not describe such people as "assessees", because I doubt whether that word exists--will be passive objects in the process laid down in the clause. They should have rights vis-ã-vis the state and should not be subject to an arbitrary process that will make fools of them and lead to senseless theoretical rulings on their capacity for work that will fail to result in their undertaking useful activities.
<P>
I expect that the Government will say that they share my sentiments; if so, I hope that they will accept the amendment. Such a hope has yet to be fulfilled during our deliberations. If the Government do not accept the amendment, we can only hope that our initiative will secure a clear undertaking from them. The 10 minutes of the Committee's time that the amendment has taken up would then have been put to good use. We would have secured a proposal that has not, as far as I know, been secured in any Government announcement. If they give that undertaking, we trust that they will fulfil it, and we shall monitor the situation carefully.
<P>
<H5>10.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I shall not be drawn into a discussion about the relationship between the personal capability assessment and the all-work test because I do not want to damage our chances of doing so later. However, I fear that it is in the nature of things that the personal capability assessment, like the all-work test, will lead to a number of misunderstandings--I hope that there will not be too many, but there may be a lot. Disabled people who fail the assessment may feel a sense of wrong and of grievance, and perhaps even of bitterness.
<P>
The best way to minimise that risk is to ensure that the rules of the game are explicit and published in advance. Those rules relate to the basis on which the assessment will take place and the standing instructions of the doctors who will undertake the work. The decision should not be taken ad hoc during an assessment, by an individual doctor, according to how he or she happens to feel on a particular morning, or regionally in a benefit agency area. It would not he right for one approach to be taken in one area and a different approach in another--that would lead to misunderstandings and to a sense of grievance, which would discredit the process.
<P>
The rules of the game should be clearly established in advance and the instructions should be universal and known to people. They should also define availability, which I am sure they will do--the all-work test currently does--and work, which is the other important substantive in this context. If those steps were taken, there would be a lesser chance of matters going wrong, and the system would be perceived to be fairer and more effective.
<P>
The Government have said all along that their aim is to help disabled people. We pointed out that that is a pretty cruel thing to say, because much money will be withdrawn from them. However, I hope that the Government's statements about personal capability assessments are sincere: I hope that they really want people to be encouraged to take up any activity that they can do. I also hope that people who deserve to be supported by society will be, either with income replacement benefits or with the disability living allowance. The system should be fair and humane.
<P>
I see no good reason why the Government should resist the amendment. Alternatively, they could give us an equally effective and equivalent assurance. I have moved the amendment in the sanguine spirit that I usually display on such occasions.

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Before I call the hon. Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh), I must make it clear that my ruling about discussing the clause in our debates on the amendments refers to the whole Committee, not to only one individual. No Committee member should feel aggrieved that he or she has not discussed all aspects of the clause--I respond to what the Committee wants.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Leigh </B>(Gainsborough): The amendment gives us an opportunity to discuss an interesting subject. My hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford (Mr. Davies) made it clear that it is important for the public to understand the rules of the game.
<P>
The Government want the public to think that the new personal capability assessments are specific to the person who is taking the assessment and that they bear some relation to the jobs that are available where he lives. Hence the need for the amendment.
<P>
The Government are trying to proclaim that we are moving on from the all-work test to a more personal and significant assessment. However, on page 89 of the explanatory notes, the Government state that clause 50
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"replaces section 171C of the Contributions and Benefits Act, which provides for the All Work Test. New section 171C for the most part mirrors the existing provision for the All Work Test".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Let us not get too excited and conclude that we are discussing an entirely new proposal, because we are not. The Government, however, want us to believe that we are and that the personal advisers, who will be trained to a higher level than previous advisers, will provide a better service.
<P>
<B>Mr. Eric Pickles </B>(Brentwood and Ongar): My hon. Friend will recall that I have castigated him for being too doctrinaire, but is he not being a little kind to the Government by not continuing the quote, which goes on to say:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"but renames it the personal Capability Assessment"?<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Is not that an example of spin?
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> Yes.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Before we continue, I remind hon. Members that the amendment is narrow and deals with the availability of jobs in the locality. It does not deal with the all-work test or the personal assessment. It would be nice to hear the amendment mentioned occasionally.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> I was not going to explore that point further, Mr. McWilliam. Although it was tempting to read more of that paragraph in the explanatory notes, I deliberately tried to discipline myself because I did not want to queer the pitch of my hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. Pickles) when he deals with wider matters in the clause stand part debate. However, my hon. Friend made an important point. If we are to ensure that jobs relate to locality, we must not rely on spin. We must make sure that we are talking about a real assessment in a real place that relates to real jobs.
<P>
I am worried about the enormous disparity in the availability of jobs between different areas. Gainsborough is a small northern industrial town in my constituency. The hon. Member for Doncaster, North (Mr. Hughes), who, because of his high Government position, is unable to take part in the debate, represents a constituency not far from Gainsborough. He knows what the town is like. He knows that there is high unemployment in the north of England and that Gainsborough has consistently had a higher level of unemployment than the national average and the east midlands average. He will also know that traditionally it relied on two large employers, both of which have closed down.
<P>
The availability of jobs to all people, especially disabled people, in that locality is different from the availability of jobs in, for example, Dover. I do not know much about Dover--I have only passed through it as most people do--but I be should be grateful to hear more about it from the hon. Member who represents Dover.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Jacqui Lait </B>(Beckenham): The hon. Member for Dover (Mr. Prosser) is not present, but as someone who used to represent a south coast constituency, I suggest to my hon. Friend that most coastal towns, including those on the south coast such as Dover, are bad comparisons to draw because their economies are weak. It may be better to draw a comparison with the south-east in general.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. If the hon. Member for Dover were present, I would have no alternative but to suspend the Committee because he is not a member.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> I apologise, Mr. McWilliam, but because Labour Members say so little--some have not spoken even once--it is difficult to identify their constituencies, but I was rightly corrected by my hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham (Mrs. Lait) . There are several examples. Chester is a prosperous city where many jobs are available for disabled and other people. I am sure that Colne Valley is prosperous and that Winchester has a burgeoning economy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tom Levitt </B>(High Peak): I am prompted to rise by a comment made by the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford during the debate in the House last night. He said that the Opposition's only chance of winning points in the Committee relied on the eloquence of himself and his hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. Pickles). He did not include the eloquence of his hon Friend the Member for Gainsborough.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> I have received many insults and I can bear that one.
<P>
I am raising serious a point, to which I hope the Government will respond. In the north of England there is a desperate search for jobs among all people and I do not want to raise false hopes in people who have had difficulty finding jobs and who may believe that they are coming into an entirely new system in which jobs will be manufactured for them out of thin air, and particularly for those with disabilities that may make it more difficult to find jobs. I take on board the point often made by the Minister that disabled people should not be forgotten by society and simply given benefit; they should be encouraged into jobs. The point of the amendment is simple and no one could disagree with it: when making assessments, providers should take account of the sort of jobs available in the locality.
<P>
The Minister can find nothing exceptional in that statement. He must accept that account will be taken of jobs in the locality, so what is the harm in putting that in the Bill? The message would go out loud and clear to those responsible for implementing the measure in local benefit offices and elsewhere exactly what the new test is. In the spirit of compromise that has pervaded the Committee during the previous few sittings, perhaps the Minister will, for the first time, accept one of my hon. Friend's amendments.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I rise to support my hon. Friends and to raise two points, one of which may be ruled to be more appropriate to the clause stand part debate. The first concerns the role of therapeutic work and the issues surrounding the reward for such work. I see from your expression, Mr. McWilliam, that you would prefer me to leave that until the stand part debate, so I shall go on to my second point.
<P>
I want to tease out from the Government their attitude to what have historically been known as sheltered workshops. In some areas, the mere provision of such workshops to provide jobs for mentally or physically disabled people could influence the decision on capability for work. The environment in those workshops makes it easier for some people to find rewarding and satisfying work.
<P>
Some organisations are confused because many disabled people, understandably and rightly, believe that such workshops are patronising, but the people who work in them often find that it is the only way in which they can obtain rewarding employment. Much of the work must compete in the open market and I have no quibble with that. The work may be highly skilled and I have seen some wonderful print work being done and giftware of the highest standard being made in a sheltered workshop which sells easily in the open market. However, there must often be an element of subsidy and if social services are responsible for the subsidy, they may wonder whether sheltered workshops are the best way of spending money. I have no view one way or the other.
<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Many sheltered workshops are looking to become freestanding companies, and social services could provide grants to sustain the bids that they submit to obtain private sector or open market contracts. Provision of sheltered workshops is not consistent throughout the country and I should be grateful if the Minister would advise us on whether the mere fact that a sheltered workshop exists in an area where people are being assessed would be part of the consideration of whether someone is capable of work. If so, I also wish to know what, advice will be given to personal advisers and the Benefits Agency medical service doctors on the possibility of people being able to attend the workshop. The last thing that a sheltered workshop needs is too many employees, because it may not have the work for them. If a blanket decision is made by the local benefits office that someone is capable of sheltered workshop employment, but the workshop does not have the employment available, how will that affect the decision on that person's employability? That is closely relevant to the amendment. The mere fact that a sheltered workshop exists is not a reason for a personal adviser to state that someone can get work in the workshop; it might not have a role for that person, and that would be a cruel deceit.
<P>
I should be grateful if the Minister would give some us some help and guidance on how the Benefits Agency, personal advisers and BAMS will deal with the issue of sheltered workshops.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> When I was a local councillor I was chairman of social services for two years and we ran a sheltered workshop. I was also spokesman and kept in touch with what was happening in the sheltered workshop. Even during that limited period I noticed a change in the sort of people doing work there and going into part III accommodation. They became less ambulant and more dependent with a higher degree of disability.
<P>
A few weeks ago the Minister and I were members of a Standing Committee that discussed a statutory instrument to allow people to do part-time work while receiving incapacity benefit, so not all changes are bad. It is important to get people back into the workplace and it would be wrong to think that the amendment would restrict people who are capable of returning to work from doing so. Being in work gets people off the state's back and has other benefits. For example, it gives them the possibility of extending their opportunities. Attitudes will be significant in this context. It would be bad if sheltered workshops became extinct--they appear to be gradually on their way out. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham, who pointed out that such workshops provide a community for people who would otherwise be isolated.

<P>

<B>Mrs. Rosemary McKenna </B>(Cumbernauld and Kilsyth): Does the hon. Gentleman agree that, although sheltered workplaces provide a sense of community, one aspect of modern living involves the fact that everyone is part of the same society? We are trying to integrate children with disabilities into mainstream education. Should not adults with disabilities be integrated into mainstream workplaces and treated as ordinary members of society?
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I hope that it will not distress the hon. Lady too much if I say that I agree with her every word. She is absolutely right. If I gave the impression that I took a contrary view, I should correct it--neither my hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham nor I hold such a view. However, in our move towards greater integration, we must recognise the nature of our society.
<P>
Sheltered workshops appear to be gradually on their way out. I hope that the clause will not accelerate that decline, which should be gradual and natural. We should recall why sheltered workshops were originally established. Many of them sought to deal with the effects of the first--and, to a lesser extent, the second--world war but, in time, they began to deal with people whose disabilities were not the result of a war injury. It would be good to get more people with disabilities--we are considering incapacity in this context--back into the workplace.
<P>
I should return to the point that I was making before the hon. Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth (Mrs. McKenna) made her useful intervention. It is important to carefully consider the amendment's proposal that jobs should be available locally. There will be regional differences. My hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford is rightly keen to ensure uniformity of decisions throughout the land. My hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham gave an example that clearly showed the need for uniformity.
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> It is important for the criteria, which should be universally applied across the country, to involve availability for work that exists in a locality. In some localities some types of work will not exist, and a person should not be assessed as being capable for work that is not available locally.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I congratulate the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford for bringing us back to the amendment. We seemed to have strayed from it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I am hurt by your saying that, Mr. McWilliam. I should never dream of disagreeing with a Chairman's ruling, but I thought that my remarks were entirely relevant to the amendment. I keep my remarks in order for fear of being ticked off--I am a sensitive soul.
<P>
I have lived in two contrasting areas, which illustrate the importance of the differences in the work that is available locally and in the skills that are necessary. In Bradford, I witnessed the decline of the textile industry during the 1970s and the early 1980s, when there was a small revival. A raft of jobs that would have been available simply disappeared. It is true that as one door closed, another opened, in that the available skills, which involved a high degree of dexterity, were applicable to new technologies, particularly micro-electronics. However, someone who lives in Lincolnshire should not be expected to move to Scotland simply to make use of a particular skill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mark Oaten </B>(Winchester): Would not those difficulties he ironed out during the work-focused interview? Irrespective of earlier tests, surely advisers would not put forward individuals for unacceptable jobs.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> The hon. Gentleman is too trusting. I shall give an example. I read in my newspaper that the hon. Gentleman tried to set up an advice bureau in the bicycle carriage of a train, but no one turned up. He had to walk along the other carriages, which caused complaints because he got in the way of the sandwich-vending lady. [Laughter.] That demonstrates clearly why the provision should be included in the Bill. If the hon. Gentleman had received instructions from Liberal Democrat headquarters, he would not have made that mistake.
<P>
<B>Mr. Oaten:</B> So successful was the event that the bicycle carriage proved too small to cope with the numbers of people who came forward.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> That is not what it says in the paper--[Laughter.] I put my trust in the newspapers.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Can we return to the substance of the amendment paper?
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> You are right to tick me off, Mr. McWilliam.
<P>
During the previous sitting, I referred to the cloying consensus that had broken out. In the light of it, one would expect to be able to take the Government at their word, as the hon. Member for Winchester (Mr. Oaten) has done. However, several statements by the Secretary of State have suggested that the Government want to reduce the number of people claiming incapacity benefit. We want to ensure that such reductions are not sought to fulfil the Prime Minister's pledge, made during a meeting at Church house, to reduce the social security budget. Although that meeting was packed out, no member of the Labour party attended it.
<P>
Incapacity benefit claimants must not be treated as a soft touch and pushed into a job market in which no suitable jobs are available. The amendment, which is precisely analogous to, and in the spirit of the aims of the personal capacity assessment, would remove the temptation to do that by establishing the interviewee's capacity for work.
<P>
At an earlier point in our proceedings, my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough successfully predicted a response by the Minister and I should like to take a similar stab. I predict that the Minister will say that the amendment is unnecessary, because paragraph 21(2) of schedule 8 makes it clear that information will be collected that can be used to assist and encourage the person in question to obtain work or enhance his prospects of obtaining it.
<P>
It is true that paragraph 21(2) can be so interpreted, but we should not allow a matter of such importance to depend on the interpretation of individual officers. The amendment would make the matter explicit and would enable assessors to understand Parliament's precise intention. We should not deprive people of incapacity benefit if there is no work for them to do, and it would be an important step to make the amendment to the Bill.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Howard Flight </B>(Arundel and South Downs): My hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. Pickles) has made the main point that I wished to make, which is to consider whether the additional provision is necessary.
<P>
It is necessary because the clause sets out how regulations will be defined. This crucial and sensitive territory deals with how the capability to work of those with health problems, mental problems and disabilities will be measured. It will be measured by their condition, which will be assessed, but no reference will be made to the availability of appropriate work.
<P>
From my 30 years' experience in the real world--in contrast to Westminster--I have become deeply suspicious of the good intentions of Westminster, having seen how they sometimes work out in the real world. The Minister will have to go a long way to convince me that other parts of the Bill cover this matter. It is certainly not good enough to rely on the problem being dealt with in the interviews, as the hon. Member for Winchester suggested. We are dealing with people's rights to financial support, and it is better to be over-precise in defining the requirements in the regulations than to be under--precise and woolly. The onus is on the Government to argue against covering the crucial issue of what is to be taken into account when assessing the capability of people to work in their local context.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bayley:</B> This has been an interesting stand part debate. I do not know whether you wish me to respond to the stand part debate, Mr. McWilliam.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I have prevented the discussion from developing into a stand part debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bayley:</B> In that case I shall restrict myself to addressing the brief mentions that have been made of the amendment. I have read it carefully and listened to the arguments, and I shall respond to them as best as I can. I hope that Conservative Members will give me credit for having listened to them, and I believe that they will find their speculation about my response completely wrong.
<P>
The amendment would mean that the decision on whether a person is entitled to incapacity benefit would depend on factors that do not relate to that person's illness or disability. The effect of the amendment would be that people with exactly the same level of sickness or disability would face different treatment in different parts of the country.
<P>
I shall turn to the point raised by the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford. He said that it would be cruel to judge people capable of work if they lived in an area of high unemployment. However, under the Conservative Government--
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> I did not say that. I said that it would be cruel to judge someone capable of work and to withdraw benefit, if there were no work available locally of the kind of which that claimant was deemed capable. That is different. It has nothing to do with rates of aggregate unemployment. It concerns the specific availability of the work of which the person is judged capable. In certain instances of disability, that may be a narrow range of work.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bayley:</B> Let me make this perfectly clear. The personal capability assessment will not require anybody who is deemed incapable of work--and therefore on incapacity benefit--to seek work. The problem would be aggravated in areas of higher unemployment, as the hon. Member for Gainsborough made clear. If it is cruel to expect people who are deemed capable of work and who live in areas where no job is available to seek work, the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford must face the fact that while his party was in Government, unemployment increased substantially, and almost trebled at its peak--[Interruption.] I ask the hon. Gentleman to listen--the number of people claiming incapacity benefit also trebled.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman made some interesting points about the sequence of the gateway interview and the personal capability assessment. It is important to recognise that people receive incapacity benefit through different routes, at different times and at different stages in the progress of their illness or disability. It is therefore important that the gateway is flexible. In cases where a person ceases work because of incapacity before being put on incapacity benefit, it will be appropriate for that person to speak to a personal adviser straight way. A lot of evidence shows that if a person has been out of the labour market for six months--the required period for application for incapacity benefit, unless the person is self-employed--it is often too late to get that person back into employment. It would be desirable for such a person to obtain the advice of a personal adviser before having a personal capability assessment. In cases where the personal capability assessment passports a person on to incapacity benefit, it would be far too early for that person to have a single gateway interview, as he or she would be unfit for work of any kind at that time. If such a person's benefits have been dealt with, it would be appropriate for the single gateway interview to be deferred. Flexibility is therefore needed.
<P>
The hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford mentioned, in passing, trading cuts in the south seas. I have also read Malinowski's books--I am sure the hon. Gentleman has read "Argonauts of the Western Pacific", because of his classical education. Other works are "Crime and Custom in Savage Society" and--this one is particularly appropriate--"Myth in Primitive Psychology", which the hon. Gentleman has clearly studied closely as many of the ideas are reflected in his speeches.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman said that people should not have to seek work that they cannot reasonably perform. I repeat my assurance--someone who is deemed incapable of work and who therefore qualifies for incapacity benefit will not be required to seek work of any kind. The personal adviser will discuss possibilities for seeking work but there will be no compulsion whatever. If the person concerned decides that work is not appropriate, that is the end of the matter.

<P>

<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> Will the Minister confirm that that provision is in schedule 8 21(2)?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bayley:</B> I do not have schedule 8 21(2) before me, but Ministers have put that assurance on the record. The situation is absolutely clear. If there is any doubt about it, I will write to the hon. Gentleman. I make it abundantly clear that although there is an obligation on all people seeking benefits to attend an interview under the single gateway, there will be no obligation on people who claim incapacity benefit to seek, or to accept, work if they do not want to do so.
<P>
The hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford argued that the rules for the personal capability assessment should be laid down in advance. Entitlement to incapacity benefit will involve the same criteria as are currently used in relation to the all-work test. The personal capability assessment will be wider, because it will examine a person's capabilities and their incapacity, but the test for entitlement to incapacity benefit will not change in any way. We want to assure people that it will not be harder to qualify for incapacity benefit under the new arrangements.
<P>
The hon. Member for Gainsborough discussed the variation in the availability of jobs and stressed the difficulties of finding work in some northern towns. If the amendment were agreed to, a person in an area of high unemployment could be written off and forced to spend his life on benefit and a severely disabled person would be expected to look for work when local labour market conditions were good. The amendment suggests that the award of incapacity benefit should depend on local labour market conditions--in other words, incapacity benefit should be given to more people with less serious incapacities when the opportunities for work are lower, and that the test should be tougher in other parts of the country where more work is available. Someone who receives incapacity benefit and who, for example, undertook training to improve his employability, should not suddenly have his benefit withdrawn because his position in the labour market had improved as a result of his action. It is better to stick with the arrangements that were established under the Social Security (Incapacity for Work) Act 1994, which states that incapacity benefit depends on incapacity.
<P>
If the award of incapacity benefit depended on labour market conditions, as the amendment proposed, when unemployment fell--it has fallen since May 1997 from 1.7 million to 1.3 million--entitlement to IB would increase. I studied the figures last night. According to the International Labour Organisation, in May 1997, unemployment averaged 6.9 per cent. in England, 8.4 per cent. in Wales and 8.5 per cent. in Scotland. I took 8 per cent. as a rough average of the English, Scottish and Welsh figures. One could use 8 per cent. as the threshold above which a less rigorous test of eligibility for IB should be applied. Committee members know that IB is awarded in relation to a point score under the all-work test, and that that approach will be used in relation to the personal capability assessment. For the sake of argument, a lower point score could be used to establish eligibility for incapacity benefit in areas of high unemployment--8 per cent. or more.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
At the time of the last election, people in the north-east of England, Merseyside, Yorkshire and Humberside, London, Wales and Scotland would all have been deemed eligible for incapacity benefit with the lower threshold that would be required by this amendment. Unemployment rates have now fallen--only in Merseyside and the north-east of England is the rate now higher than 8 per cent. and everywhere else it is below that figure. People in those areas of lower unemployment, who had hitherto been eligible for incapacity benefit, would lose that entitlement because of an improvement in the local labour market conditions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> I do not know whether the Government are so keen to avoid a debate on clause stand part that they are trying to waste time on irrelevances. What the Minister is saying has nothing to do with the amendment. I have not suggested that the capacity to work should be linked to unemployment rates. That is the Minister's invention, and the amendment that he is addressing is a product of his fantasy; it is not the amendment that my hon. Friends and I tabled.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bayley:</B> I am responding to the hon. Gentleman's points. His amendment covers:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the types of jobs available in the locality considered."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If he thinks that the rate of unemployment is not relevant to the availability of jobs, he is living in a different world from me and also from the hon. Member for Gainsborough, who made the point that I am now making. If this is not a response to the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford, it is certainly a response to the hon. Member for Gainsborough, who argued that there should be a lower threshold to incapacity benefit in parts of northern England, where unemployment rates are higher.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> The Minister is quoting unemployment statistics from across regions. Taking an extreme case, people who live in Caithness and Sutherland do not travel to the Borders for work. There are different levels of unemployment within regions. I pointed out to my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough that the south coast towns--indeed, most coastal towns--have far higher levels of unemployment than inland areas. If the Minister will address availability for work in genuine localities within which people will travel to work, we will be addressing the same issue.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bayley:</B> The hon. Lady and I are debating the same issue. I used the Government standard regions to illustrate the point. I have here the same figures for travel-to-work areas and constituencies, although I shall not use them.
<P>
The hon. Lady makes a good point. If the unemployment rate in Hastings were considerably higher than in inland parts of East Sussex, and if this amendment were carried, one would have a lower test for eligibility for incapacity benefit in Hastings than in those parts of the county with lower unemployment rates. That would lead to the anomaly of, for example, two people with identical disabilities living on opposite sides of a road, and one would qualify for incapacity benefit and the other would not, because he or she lived in a different area.
<P>
There have been significant reductions in unemployment rates in the past two years and the amendment would cause difficulties when unemployment rates ebb and flow. People who had hitherto qualified for incapacity benefit, because account had been taken of the severe shortage of jobs in their locality, would find that, as employment prospects improved, they would lose the benefit that they had had for, perhaps, a couple of years.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> The text of the amendment covers
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the types of jobs available".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It does not cover the unemployment rate, although that does have an impact on the types of jobs available. For example, someone who did not have effective use of his feet would find it difficult to work in the type of job in which feet are used to operate machinery. The Minister must recognise that the amendment deals with the "types of jobs available" and not the unemployment rate, although that is an indicator.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bayley:</B> It is difficult to imagine a way in which you could make the amendment work without taking into account--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. That was about the fifth or sixth reference to me. I should love my constituency to have an unemployment rate of 8 per cent.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bayley:</B> I stand corrected, Mr. McWilliam.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> I understand the Minister's argument that, ideally, one should not have different incapacity tests in different parts of the country. That is a fair point, but what will happen in the real world? Individuals who live in a northern industrial town whose incapacity level renders them incapable of work might be deemed capable of the same work if they lived in London.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bayley:</B> Let us talk about the real world and deal with the points raised by the hon. Members for Gainsborough and for Beckenham. Incapacity benefit is payable to people who are incapable of work on health grounds. Another benefit, jobseeker's allowance, is payable to people who are capable of work but who are unable currently to find a job. Recipients of jobseeker's allowance are obliged to seek employment. It would be invidious to differentiate between jobseekers in certain northern towns or in Hastings, where it is difficult to find work, and those in other areas.
<P>
People who are incapable of work on health grounds should receive incapacity benefit, which is set at a rate that reflects their incapacity. Those who fail to pass the all-work test, which will be replaced with the personal capability assessment, should apply for the benefit that is payable to people who are capable of, but unable currently to find, work.
<P>
I am not alone in taking that view. Five years ago, when the House debated the Social Security (Incapacity for Work) Act 1994, Alistair Burt, the former Conservative Minister, said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"We have the opportunity to discuss today . . . the key principle of whether it is right to go for a functional, objective test,"--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
the kind of established test that the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford asked for--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"with the safeguards that I have mentioned, or something far wider. Such a wider test would take into account a range of factors about whether someone is employable, which has nothing to do with his medical incapacity and may have a great deal to do with a range of other factors such as his working background or training. They are relevant to whether someone will get a job, but whether they are relevant to medical incapacity is doubtful. The medical incapacity benefit should concern medical incapacity and other aspects of unemployment should be dealt with in other ways."--[Official Report, Standing Committee E, 22 February 1994; Vol., c.325.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I do not agree with everything that Alistair Burt had to say to the House. However, after reading his speech which he made during the tenth sitting of the Committee, I looked at the Committee's voting record.
<P>
The hon. Members for Gainsborough, for Grantham and Stamford, for Brentwood and Ongar and for Beckenham--the latter represented a different constituency at the time--voted to remove any reference to employability from benefit paid to those incapable of work. Although the hon. Members for Gainsborough, for Grantham and Stamford and for Brentwood and Ongar wanted to turn back the clock and examine local labour markets, the hon. Member for Beckenham took a different view. Perhaps she did so because she participated in the Committee and heard the Conservative Minister's arguments.
<P>
The Conservative party was right to make incapacity benefit--

<P>

<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> What did the Labour party say?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bayley:</B> The hon. Gentleman will have to pop down to the Library to find that out. [Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Sedentary interventions are to be deplored. However, the hon. Member for Beckenham should put on the record that she was a parliamentary private secretary at the time, and therefore not allowed to speak on that Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bayley:</B> The last correction was a shade unfair. At no stage did I accuse the hon. Lady of having spoken in the Committee that discussed the Social Security (Incapacity for Works) Bill. I did make it clear that her better understanding of the issue might have arisen from her having been in the Committee, listening to the arguments.
<P>
I agree to some extent with the case made by Alistair Burt. It is right for incapacity benefit to depend on a person's medical incapacity and not on other factors. However, there are differences between members of the Committee. Labour Members believe that it is a mistake for the all-work test to consider solely people's incapacity to work. It should look also at their capabilities.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bayley:</B> I shall give way to the hon. Lady for what I think may be the last time.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I am grateful to the Minister, and I promise that I shall try to make this my last intervention. Can I put on the record that I have intervened, despite the Minister's eloquence, not just to admit to having been the parliamentary private secretary to a Minister on that earlier Bill? 
<P>
Is my understanding correct? Is the personal incapacity assessment being introduced to widen the criteria away from the all-work benefit? Our debate on the amendment is required because the Government have widened the criteria for the all-work test.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bayley:</B> Let me make it clear once again. The eligibility criteria for incapacity benefit will not change. The Government have made that clear to reassure people that it will be no harder to qualify for incapacity benefit through the all-work test or its replacement, the personal capability assessment, than it has been. In addition to the questions that are asked about people's incapacity, which are used to deem whether they are eligible for incapacity benefit, there will also be a discussion with a doctor about their capabilities. Those capabilities--
<P>
<B>Mr. David Rendel </B>(Newbury): Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bayley:</B> No--I must answer. The information on those capabilities will be fed on, so that they can be discussed by people with their personal adviser. Those on incapacity benefit who want to work--and many hundreds of thousands do--will have medical advice and guidance. That will form part of a strategy that people can discuss with their personal adviser to assist them with their search for what they want, namely a job. Those who do not want a job will be required neither to seek, nor to take, a job. Can I make that absolutely clear to the Committee?
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> The Minister has twice made it clear that the eligibility test will be no harder. All those who are currently eligible will remain eligible. I had thought that the Government's point about incapacity was that many people were retiring early and claiming incapacity when, in the Government's view, they should not have been. The Bill was to have made the eligibility criteria for incapacity benefit harder. The Minister now seems to be saying that that will not be so. Will he say what is correct?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bayley:</B> The Liberal Democrat party has misrepresented the Government's position in the past. I would like the hon. Gentleman to listen to my words. The medical evidence required to qualify for incapacity benefit under the all-work test that was introduced by the Conservatives, and that will be required by Labour's personal capability assessment, will be identical. There will be change to those requirements. The hon. Gentleman has differences with the Government concerning later clauses, but we cannot discuss those clauses now. Issues such as the requirement of contribution records will be discussed later. I look forward to those debates, as I am sure that the hon. Gentleman does.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bayley:</B> No, I must reply to other points that the hon. Gentleman and his colleagues have made, especially that made by the hon. Gentleman, by the hon. Member for Beckenham, and by my hon. Friend the Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth about sheltered workshops.
<P>
The hon. Member for Beckenham made an important point--employers should be encouraged to buy the products of sheltered workshops. It is perhaps worth noting, especially at this time, that one of the best customers of sheltered workshops over many years has been the Ministry of Defence, but we want the private sector to purchase their products as well.
<H4>11.15 am</H4>
<P>
The hon. Lady asked how the Government would help to increase the availability of supported employment. The answer is by providing more resources--my right hon. and hon. Friends in the Department for Education and Employment devoted an additional £30 million for specialist disability services, which will, among other things, allow for an expansion of supported employment. The hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar said that he felt that supported employment was gradually on the way out. It may be changing--the number of places providing it was certainly reduced when the hon. Gentleman's party was in power--and it may be the case that more supported employment places, as my hon. Friend the Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth said, will be in mainstream employment, which is welcome, but more resources will go to support that form of employment.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> The Minister clearly misunderstood the point of my quite lengthy speech. It was not whether the Government are supporting sheltered workshops--although if they are, I am sure that the hon. Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth objects strongly, because her view is that they should be got rid of. I wanted to know what guidance the Government were giving to the benefits offices, the Benefits Agency Medical Service and personal advisers in areas where sheltered workshops exist and whether they would encourage the over-supply of disabled people to workshops that cannot employ them because they do not need them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bayley:</B> I understand what the hon. Lady is saying. Under the Government's proposal--the unamended clause--people who are deemed incapable of work will get their benefit whether or not there is local availability of a sheltered workshop place and of other jobs which might appear to be suitable, were it not for their incapacity. They will get the benefit on medical grounds, not according to local employment conditions. If the hon. Lady is arguing that one should also take account of local employment conditions and whether a sheltered workshop place is available when determining whether that person is eligible for incapacity benefit, the Government disagree. We believe that the tests of eligibility for incapacity benefit should depend on medical factors relating to incapacity, not on other factors.
<P>
I am being told by the Government Whip that in view of the Committee's timetable, I need to make progress. I am sure that the Opposition Whip shares that view. However, I just want to say that the Government are providing active support and encouragement to help sick and disabled people overcome barriers to work. The national minimum wage and the disabled person's tax credit will help to make work pay for disabled people. Extending the linking rule in incapacity benefit will make disabled people feel more secure if they decide to try out a job. Moreover, the new deal for disabled people is providing individualised help and support. Measures in the Bill will provide for the single work-focused gateway and the personal capability assessment. The new employment credit for older workers, announced by my right hon. Friend the Chancellor, gives specific help to a group who all too often find themselves written off as unemployable.
<P>
By contrast, the amendment gives a contradictory message. It would mean people in some parts of the country being denied incapacity benefit and required to seek work, while people in other parts of the country with less disabling medical conditions would be written off to a life of benefits. I therefore urge the Committee to reject the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> This discussion has been extremely useful in prising out of the Government something that I did not think we would get as a result of this relatively narrow amendment, which defines work for the purposes of the new personal capability assessment. We may have got a clearer Understanding from the Government of the whole nature of that assessment.
<P>
<B>Mrs. McKenna:</B> To correct the words put in my mouth by the hon. Member for Beckenham, I did not say that I wanted sheltered workshops to close. That is not my position at all. However, we must encourage those people with disabilities who want to work in the main stream to do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I quite understand why the hon. Lady wanted to put the record straight concerning her statements about sheltered workshops.
<P>
Before I turn to the Minister's comments, I shall deal with some other important points raised during the debate on the amendment. Specialised sheltered workshops were initially raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham--that led to a debate that has only just now been terminated. They are, of course, germane to the issue. The question is: does work that is available only in a sheltered workshop count as work for the purposes of the definition that we are discussing? In other words, if someone is capable of doing work that exists only in a sheltered workshop and such a workshop is available, does that mean that that person will be deemed capable of work and denied benefit? That is a crucial point, and it is right that we discuss it.
<P>
On the general point about workshops, I take what I regard as a liberal view that all forms of work that attract people voluntarily to do them are inherently desirable. I can well imagine that some people who are disabled prefer not to feel that they are in some sort of ghetto with other disabled or incapacitated people, and want to be in the main stream. I very much sympathise with and support that. It is important that the state in all its manifestations should do everything possible to remove any sense of discrimination and enourage people.
<P>
However, I equally appreciate that some people who are disabled may not feel terribly comfortable working alongside--as it were, competing with--people who have facilities that they do not have. They may feel more comfortable, more at home and in a more congenial atmosphere in a specialised sheltered workshop. There is no contradiction there. I have no doubt that the people who organise such workshops do a tremendously good job. I am glad that my hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham gave us the opportunity to pay tribute to them, and I am glad that the hon. Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth put the record straight, because I am sure that her second set of comments represent her true feelings on the issue.
<P>
The hon. Member for Winchester, as so often with the Liberal Democrats, fell straight into the trap. He said that the whole issue of availability for and capability of work could be left to the work-focused interview. He made that comment because in typical Liberal Democrat fashion these days, he wanted to be helpful to the Government. Instead, he exposed the Government's confusion. As we know from our debate on amendment No. 78, they are incapable of telling us in what order the interviews will take place. The relationship between the interviews is therefore bound to be extremely confused. As I said earlier, that is dangerous and worrying for benefit claimants, who may well perceive the work-focused interview as another form of filtering for eligibility for benefit. I will not go back over that, but I was rather amused by the counterproductive nature of that intervention, which was intended to protect the Government.
<P>
The Minister was clearly ill at ease on the subject. He began with a set of red herrings--talking about unemployment, and so forth. I know that you do not want me to pursue that, Mr. McWilliam, but if I were to do so, I should tell the Minister that unemployment was falling for the last five years of the Conservative Administration. It is slightly deceptive to take the line that it started falling only in May 1997
<P>
What is more serious and worrying for claimants and potential claimants of disability benefits is the Minister's statement-- it was clearly potentially deceptive--that people come to incapacity benefit by different routes. That is factually wrong, which shows that the Minister either does not understand the benefit regime for which he is responsible or that he was saying something very irresponsible, which is likely to lead to misapprehensions on the part of the public. He used the words "different routes," and I am sure that they will be in Hansard. I am happy to place a bet on that with you, Mr. McWilliam, if you run books on such matters, to give an earnest of my genuine conviction that the Minister used those words. If he wants to withdraw them, he is welcome to do so.

<P>

<B>Mr. Bayley:</B> Does not the hon. Gentleman agree that the route that the self-employed follow to incapacity benefit is different from that followed by the employed?
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> No. The route is exactly the same, as is quite clear from the Bill. It is a contribution route, although the Government are changing it. People have to fulfil the two contribution conditions and then the all-work test. The Government are trying to change the test into the personal capability asessment--to what extent that change is real, we will see later in our proceedings. However, everybody must go through those two gates and take exactly the same route, and it is wrong of the Minister to imply otherwise. It is not the case that comes to incapacity benefit through one of the reviews in new clause 12 or through one of the work-focused interviews, as the Liberal party seems to think.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bayley:</B> I did not say that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> In that case, the hon. Gentleman is accepting my clarification--let me put it kindly--of his remarks. Let us get matters absolutely straight: the same route is required for everybody.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bayley:</B> No. The hon. Gentleman should listen to my words, not put words into my mouth.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> We can discuss that when we have Hansard in front of us; I certainly found the Minister's phrases a bit misleading.
<P>
The most important part of the Minister's contribution was when he made absolutely clear how important it was to know the definition of work in the present context. Availability for work involves two concepts: availability and work. We will discuss availability in other contexts. It is important to know exactly what it means. That is the 
<P>
purpose of the amendment, which seeks to establish a definition of work. What is it? Is it something purely theoretical, which the medical examiner might perceive a person doing, but for which there is no demand and which there is little chance of that person performing, or does it mean availability for work that is actually available and welfare actually exists? That is extremely important.
<P>
It is no use the Minister saying that the confusion existed under the all-work test. That test was called the "all-work test" and the principle behind it was absolutely clear: if someone was capable of any work at all, he did not qualify; if he was capable of no work at all, he qualified for incapacity benefit. The Government are changing that and saying that the new personal capability assessment will review what people are not capable of and what they might be capable of. There is a measure of flexibility, which I do not disapprove of in principle. There is, however, undoubtedly a need for a definition for the reasons that I mentioned.
<P>
<B>Dr. Doug Naysmith </B>(Bristol, North-West): Is the hon. Gentleman arguing for different levels of benefit in different parts of the country for people who may have identical disabilities? He said that he had probed the Government and that they had made their position clear, and I agree. Will he please make clear his position on the Conservative party's attitude to the matter?
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I can think of a very precise answer to that. If the Government's intention under the new personal capability assessment is not merely to consider matters negatively on the old all-work test basis of what people cannot do, but to consider a range of things that they can do and to decide benefit on that basis, the system must be regionally differentiated. We must then take account of work that people can do.
