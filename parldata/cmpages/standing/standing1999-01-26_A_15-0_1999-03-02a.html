Government new schedule 6--Hackney Carriages.
<P>
Government new schedule 7--The Private Hire Vehicles (London) Act 1998.
<P>
<B>Ms Linda Perham </B>(Ilford, North): I welcome to you to the Chair, Mr. O'Hara. I am pleased to speak to new clause 55 on behalf of my hon. Friends the hon. Members for Romford (Mrs. Gordon), for Erith and Thamesmead (Mr. Austin), and for Eltham (Mr. Efford), and myself. The new clause is supported by the London Taxi Board and by London First. I believe that it is the first new clause to be proposed by Government Back Benchers in the Committee.
<P>
The new clause concerns a matter of considerable importance to transport in London. It would allow an administrative charge to be introduced for the Knowledge. It would correct the anomaly by which the testing of applicant taxi drivers--known as Knowledge boys and girls--is funded through the taxi drivers' annual licence fee. That would bring parity with the newly licensed minicab industry.
<P>
The Private Hire Vehicles (London) Act 1998 allows minicab applicants to be charged for their test. The new clause would allow the same principle to be applied to licensed taxi driver applicants. It is therefore of great importance to the modernisation of London's taxi industry. Members of the Committee will be aware that my constituency is home to many taxi drivers. [Hon. Members: "They call it green badge valley."] Yes, that is right. I hope that the new clause will be welcomed by my local and, indeed, by all licensed taxi drivers as a key component of that modernisation.
<P>
To become a licensed taxi driver, applicants devote hundreds of hours to training and testing to demonstrate an awareness of routes around the capital and a street-by-street knowledge of London's topography. The testing procedure is rightly rigorous. However, like all testing procedures, it costs time and money--syllabuses must be produced, appointments made and examiners paid.
<P>
Approximately 85 per cent. of applicants never attain the Knowledge. Knowledge appointments at the Public Carriage Office--the PCO--which cost the applicants nothing, are often missed, thereby wasting more resources. The costs are covered by already qualified drivers through the licence fee. That is the equivalent of the driving test being subsidised by the road tax. London First commented that when the Driving Standards Agency was set up, with the test fees going to fund the service and with clear performance standards, the long waiting times for driving tests were eliminated.
<P>
Applicants take an average of three years to progress from initial application to being fully licensed. Twenty years ago, that process took, on average, less than a year. The increased testing and waiting period is a direct result of the clogged system. The PCO does not have the resources to finance a modern and efficient testing procedure.
<P>
The new clause is intended to allow appropriate change to be made to those structures. I am aware that a management consultant is undertaking a report into reform of the Knowledge. The likely outcome of that study is a recommendation to move to a modern, computerised testing system. The new clause would allow the finances to be raised to fund such a system.
<P>
The charging of fees for the Knowledge should be able also to provide resources to improve enforcement procedures, especially to protect the public from unlicensed operators. That matter is of great concern to licensed taxi drivers and they often discuss it with me. It is the issue most frequently raised by those of my constituents who are licensed taxi drivers. The new clause would be an important step in allowing the taxi industry to develop and modernise its role as a vital component of London's integrated transport network. If my hon. Friend the Minister for Transport in London does not accept the new clause now, will she give a commitment to make proposals at a later stage to include the payment of fees for licences for the black cab trade in London?
<P>
<B>Mr. Richard Ottaway </B>(Croydon, South): Before lunch, the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey (Mr. Hughes) opened the debate on clause 176 stand part. I endorse much of what he said about the London taxi service and I join him in paying tribute to it. London has one of the best public transport systems in the world. That is a completely non-political point--a fact of life. Road, rail, sea and every type of transport that one can think of is available in London, and an integral part of the system is the London taxi service.
<P>
Those of us who travel to various corners of the world and wrestle with the local taxi services will know the affection with which one regards the London taxi service and its cabs. In New York--which is, I have always understood, an English-speaking city in the United States of America--it is fairly rare to find a taxi driver who speaks English, let alone knows where one's destination is.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stephen Pound </B>(Ealing, North): Go to Birmingham.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I find the taxi service in Birmingham almost as good as London's, but it is the London service that we are discussing today. It follows that we welcome the fact that the Government have transferred the old taxi service to Transport for London largely unchanged.
<P>
The Conservatives have no trouble with the proposal set out in the new clause tabled by the hon. Member for Ilford, North (Ms Perham). I hope that the Government will consider it sympathetically.
<P>
I have a sense of unease about the new clauses tabled by the Liberal Democrats about smoking in taxis. They have been proposed by the London taxi services and we have all received the same circular about the matter. The new clauses would simply allow a taxi driver to declare whether smoking should be prohibited in his cab. We have heard quotations from a speech that the Minister for Transport in London made about a year ago in which that principle was endorsed and I deduce from that that, if the new clauses are not accepted, they will be considered sympathetically.
<P>
My sense of unease relates to the fact that smoking is a perfectly lawful occupation, and if people want to smoke they ought to be able to do so as and when they want. I realise that smoking on public transport inconveniences and annoys other passengers. To that extent I understand smoking bans on some aircraft and separate smoking and no-smoking sections on trains.
<P>
The back of a cab is for sole hire and the only person who would be concerned about smoking is the driver, who might feel that he was affected by smoke coming through from the back of the cab. However, there is a partition between the driver and the passenger sitting in the back, and I would have thought that it was easy for the driver to protect himself, particularly as more modern cabs have much more robust screens between the passengers and drivers and communication is by means of an electronic intercom rather than by sliding the window backwards and forwards.
<P>
Nevertheless, we will listen with interest to the Minister's response to the new clauses. There is a conflict of principles in them, and I will be most interested to hear how the Minister responds.

<P>

<B>Mr. Edward Davey </B>(Kingston and Surbiton): Welcome to the Chair, Mr. O'Hara. I begin by speaking to new clauses 67 and 68, which are about smoking, and to which the hon. Member for Croydon, South 915 916 (Mr. Ottaway) has referred. They are important new clauses. As the hon. Gentleman said, the Minister for Transport in London is on record as supporting the thrust behind the new clauses, and we hope that if she does not accept them tonight, she will make positive noises about returning to the Committee with alternatives to them.
<P>
The new clauses were suggested to us by the London Taxi Board. They have received widespread agreement from the industry. I am happy with them technically, and they have also been considered by parliamentary draftsmen and women, who have given them the okay in that respect.
<P>
There have been cases in which drivers have asked passengers not to smoke and have had no-smoking signs in the back of their cabs, but individuals have refused to abide by either the request or the notice. Those individuals can overrule the cab driver, because under other parts of the law governing hackney carriages, the cab driver has a duty to take the passenger wherever he or she requests, within the relevant boundaries.
<P>
While that duty should remain the most important duty, the no-smoking exception that we propose tonight is important. It is unreasonable that a driver who is working in the cab--which is effectively his or her office--for many hours cannot decide the smoking or no-smoking rules that apply to that office.
<P>
The hon. Member for Croydon, South made the valid point that the hatch can be closed, and that some cabs, at least, have a modern communication system. However, many cabs do not have such modern communication facilities, and drivers may want to speak to their passengers to ask them exactly where they want to go, or to talk to them in the friendly way to which many of us are used. The hon. Gentleman talked about how London's cab drivers are world-famous for their service, but also for their conviviality and willingness to talk to tourists and engage them in discussion. If we want to build on that, and allow cab drivers to keep the slide back, whether they are smokers or non-smokers, surely we should allow them to choose whether the environment in which they work for many hours is smoke-free.
<P>
As well as the cab drivers' point of view--whether they want to work in a smoke-free environment--we must consider the passengers' point of view, and the environment that drivers want to provide for their passengers. Whether or not cabs have modern communications, a passenger who enters a cab after someone has been smoking is forced to breathe those fumes. We have read in the press and academic journals about the dangers of passive smoking. Whether or not such dangers exist from the fumes that remain, the unpleasant smell remains.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> The hon. Gentleman talks about passive smoking. Surely he is not suggesting that there is a passive smoking danger from entering a cab in which someone has smoked. Surely the danger of passive smoking arises only when people are sharing a compartment with someone who is smoking at the time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I would not want to press the point about passive smoking. I am not an academic, but if a lot of smoke is hanging around, breathing it in may or may not have an effect. However, my argument does not rest on that. We are all familiar with the unpleasant smells that linger if we have had a party in our house at which people have been allowed to smoke. The cab driver may want to ensure that the back of his or her cab does not contain such smells.
<P>
<B>Mr. Eric Forth </B>(Bromley and Chislehurst): I assume that this is the flippant part of the hon. Gentleman's presentation. If he is to start legislating against odours of which he disapproves, will he please deal with curries and fish and chips in cabs, to say nothing of body odour in cabs? If not, his comments do not make much sense.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> The right hon. Gentleman's point is invalidated by the fact that there are no-smoking areas in many other parts of the transport system. It would not be anomalous to introduce such a provision for London cabs. I am surprised that the right hon. Gentleman is so worried, because I understood him to be a firm defender of freedom of choice. Our new clauses would give cab drivers freedom of choice. Surely the right hon. Gentleman would agree that it would be nonsense for a cab driver to lose his badge, his livelihood and his income--
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B> Mr. Pound:</B> Or her income.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> Thank you, Mr. Euro. A driver could, however, lose his licence, if he persisted in refusing to carry someone in the back of his cab who insisted on smoking. That is the clearest example of what we are talking about, an hon. Members should consider it.
<P>
I hope that the Committee will be persuaded by our argument. Surely, it would be wronge for us to leave in place a law that endangered the livelihood of London cab drivers. I am not making a hypothetical point. I understand that a case has gone through the courts and to the European courts, although the Minister may want to correct me if I am wrong about the details. A driver lost his badge because he insisted on his right to prevent a passenger from smoking. That is surely ludicrous. I am not trying to be politically correct about smoking; I am trying to give the cab driver a choice.
<P>
I want now to deal with one or two other new clauses in the group. The hon. Member for Ilford, North ably spoke to new clause 55, and I welcome her contribution to our proceedings. She was right to say that the new clause was the first provision to have been introduced by Government Back Benchers. We look forward to many more; it is just possible that we will agree with them because we wholeheartedly agree with new clause 55. The hon. Lady was right: there is a need to ensure that the Knowledge system of exams works efficiently. There have been one or two cases--we would probably find many more if we looked more closely--of people who have wasted the time of the police officers who administer the system. A fee would, I hope, bring greater efficiency. I have spoken to members of the Kingston and Surbiton Cab Drivers Association--[Laughter.] There is such an association; it is very influential and has certainly influenced my thinking on the issue. Its members are concerned that they are subsidising people who are waiting to take the test through their fees. It thinks that the proposals offer a much better and more straightforward system of charging.
<P>
I have one question about new clause 55 for the hon. Member for Ilford, North. I have some minor concerns about people who cannot afford the fees, although the Minister for Transport in London could take my concerns on board in her reply. There is no indication of the level of fees, but if we want to encourage the unemployed to train to qualify as cab drivers, it would be interesting to know what assistance would be available to them. The current regulations for unemployment benefit and income support state that doing the Knowledge does not count as a registered training scheme or registered education. Someone who says that he is not available for work because he is studying for the knowledge and going to tests is deemed to be unavailable for work. There is concern that the new clause should not disadvantage people who are not time wasters and who are genuinely studying hard and giving up other employment opportunities to get their badge. I am sure that that is not the hon. Lady's intention, but it would be helpful if the Minister would provide some clarification.
<P>
My remarks reflect the concerns of the Kingston and Surbiton Cab Drivers Association, which it has made known to me in the strongest possible terms. New clause 64 would reduce the area in which cab drivers will be governed by the new authority--at present they are governed by the Public Carriage Office--from the Metropolitan police district as we know it today to the boundaries of the Greater London authority. The drivers are concerned because that reduction in area will also reduce the size of the market in which they compete for business.
<P>
Many areas will be lost to London cab drivers as a result of the two boundaries being made coterminous. Affected areas which border my constituency include Elmbridge, Ewell, Epsom and Esher. Other areas bordering the constituency boundaries of other Committee members include Chigwell, Cheshunt, Borehamwood, Waltham Abbey, Banstead, Bushey, Ashford, Staines, Radlett and Potters Bar. London cab drivers will no longer be able to ply for hire in any of those areas, so the size of their market will be reduced. The market of those who do most of their work in Surbiton in my constituency will be reduced by 30 per cent., which will be a significant change to their working environment and to the dynamics of their business. Not surprisingly, they are very worried.
<P>
I understand that one needs to take an overview of the change. I believe that either the Public Carriage Office or Ministers are considering sectoral reforms within the area that will remain. But even if the sector covering the Surbiton area--which I think is sector 4A--were made larger and we went from the current 18 outer sectors to the previous six, effectively the market for cab drivers on a wider basis would still be reduced, because there would still be more cab drivers working in a smaller area. When I put that to them as a possible option, they said that it would not meet their concerns. They still want to be able to ply for hire in areas that will be outside the GLA.
<P>
The cab drivers in my constituency cited those drivers who make most of their livelihoods from the taxi rank outside Epsom railway station, which is in the Metropolitan police district but outside the GLA area. Most of the drivers who work that rank make a good living, but under new clause 64 they will not be regulated by Transport for London. If they continued to work the Epsom rank, they would be subject to a very different regulatory system from that pertaining in the rest of Greater and inner London. They fear a significant loss of revenue.
<P>
They hypothesise that either the cab drivers who work the Epsom rank will change authority and give up their London cab driver's badge for an Epsom and Ewell cab driver's badge--but they fear that that would lose them a lot of revenue--or they would work in another area, the most obvious one being Wimbledon. They predict, however, that if all the Epsom drivers moved to Wimbledon ranks, there would be a huge increase of cab drivers in Wimbledon with a corresponding loss in income.
<P>
Committee members may feel that these are small points.

<P>

<B>Mr. Forth:</B> Yes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> The right hon. Gentleman says yes, but I am sure that some of his constituents who drive cabs are concerned about the change. I make no apology for speaking on behalf of those of my constituents who will lose income as a result of the proposals. That is what we are voted into the House to do.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jim Fitzpatrick </B>(Poplar and Canning Town): Perhaps the hon. Gentleman could tell us how he squares the inconsistency between his approach, which is that cab drivers will lose revenue because the area that they cover is going to be reduced, and that of his hon. Friend the Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey, who said this morning that there are too few cabs for the Greater London area. Surely, if the area is adapted there will still be too few cabs in the Greater London area to satisfy the public.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes a fair point. The difference is that my hon. Friend the Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey was talking about the number of cab drivers, while I am talking about the territorial size of the market.
<P>
When I spoke to the members of the Kingston and Surbiton Cab Drivers Association at 1 o'clock last Sunday in my office, I put that point to them. I said that in supporting new clause 55, moved by the hon. Member for Ilford, North, we are trying to ensure that the Knowledge system is more efficient so that more people progress through it and there is no logjam. I asked them if they were concerned about that issue, and they said no--they were concerned not about an increased number of cab drivers but the territorial size of their market. I am speaking for them, and I hope that the hon. Member for Poplar and Canning Town (Mr. Fitzpatrick) will accept that. I see him indicating that he does.
<P>
There is a question mark over the practicality of this measure. If the notional areas of the current Metropolitan police district are retained along with the GLA structure, and the Metropolitan police, who police the current badge system of taxi regulations, work only in the GLA area, that would mean, in effect, that cab drivers working in these sectors would be policed by two police forces--the Metropolitan police and, in my constituency for example, the Surrey constabulary. It would not be a problem in practical terms to retain in law the notional Metropolitan police boundaries in perpetuity to help cab drivers. To argue that it would be a problem would be an insult to the Surrey constabulary, which is more than capable of knowing where a cab boundary lies for regulatory purposes and of policing two different cab systems. There are no practical problems involved in implementing what I am suggesting--that is, keeping the current MPD for cab purposes and not accepting Government new clause 64.
<P>
I asked local police officers in Kingston if there would be any practical problems in keeping the old MPD boundaries alongside the new GLA, and they said that there would be none. I discussed alternatives with them and with the cab drivers to determine whether we could put to the Government other approaches to the issue. For example, we discussed in detail the possibility of a dual licensing scheme as a transitional arrangement. However, on closer examination it turned out that all the possibilities had problems and none would be satisfactory.
<P>
The only way around the difficulty is not to proceed with new clause 64 and to keep the old MPD boundaries for hackney carriage purposes. Will the Ministers think again about that? It is not an obtuse point--it concerns the livelihoods of some of my constituents, and I hope that the Ministers take that as seriously as I do.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Brooke </B>(Cities of London and Westminster): I hope, Mr. O'Hara, that the disappointment with which Mr. Winterton said his au revoir to us at lunchtime is matched by your pleasure in being among us again, which is certainly felt by ourselves.
<P>
Before lunch, the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey followed his earlier tour de force as the fare dodgers' friend with a powerful bid to become the cabbies' champion. A separate bid has now been made by the hon. Member for Ilford, North, and it is clearly going to be an even contest.
<P>
I was especially grateful to the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey for asking about taxi ranks, and what the position would be, under the present circumstances, if they were in borough roads. To show that I am entirely even-handed, I record my admiration for the Knowledge, as represented by the hon. Member for Ilford, North. I made my first conscious journey in a cab in 1938, from Hampstead, where we lived--I shall avoid describing the journey as going into jungle country--to the constituency of the Government Whip, because my father was at that time the hon. Gentleman's predecessor as the Member of Parliament for Lewisham, West. In those days, the seat used to go with the change in Government, and I am delighted that the present hon. Member for Lewisham, West (Mr. Dowd) has resisted that development. So I am a supporter of the knowledge.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I was also a supporter last year, on the Floor of the House, of the Bill dealing with private hire vehicles to which the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey referred. I say on behalf of my right hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Mr. Forth), about whose protestations there was some scepticism from those on the Government Benches, that I can recall asking him questions when the Bill was going through the House, and he gave an identical answer to that which he gave today. He certainly gets a mark for memory as well as consistency.
<P>
The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey introduced orange into the debate. The Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, the hon. Member for Vauxhall (Kate Hoey), will undoubtedly know of the best graffiti to have emerged from the troubles in Belfast. The first line read, "Ulster says no" the second line said, "But the man from Del Monte says yes", and the third line read, "Aye, and he is an Orangeman". [Laughter.]
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South took us to New York. In the context of the reference of the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey to advertising and to orange, I share with the Committee the visit to New York before the war by Mr. A.G. MacDonnell, who was following up his great work, "England, their England" with a similar visit to the United States. He coined the happy aphorism that the proprietors of cabs in New York are particularly generous in their welfare to mankind, for they not only paint their cabs yellow, but they write "yellow cab" on the side so that the colour blind will not be in any way disconcerted. [Laughter.]
<P>
I, perhaps uniquely in the Committee, am not conscious of having received any representations from the London Taxi Board on the subject of the Liberal Democrat amendments on smoking. That may be because of confusion with my right hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst, or because I am acquiring a reputation as an opponent of political correctness.
<P>
The main purpose of my rising--everything so far has been simply a preface to my question--is to go back to the fact that the Minister for London and Construction, who I believe is not replying to the debate, ducked my question on clause 170. I asked why the Government were engaged in this large-scale reconstruction of the Bill, when the provisions that they are introducing at this stage appear to have been appropriate and predictable from the beginning. I asked for a motivation; I said that I was not sure of getting a wholly honest answer, and the Minister very skilfully avoided giving me an answer at all. But with a Japanese fanaticism, linked with an elephantine memory, I am returning to the charge on clause 176, where it seems that the question applies just as much.
I was disarmed on the last occasion by a discharge of smoke by the Minister for London and Construction, which in a taxi or private hire vehicle would readily be condemned. I acknowledge that the Secretary of State does not appear in clause 176, but he does appear in clause 177, with which this debate is linked. Therefore, I request the Minister for Transport in London, when she responds to the debate, to explain why these issues are coming up now when they could have been included in the Bill originally.
<P>
<B>The Minister for Transport in London (Ms Glenda Jackson):</B> It is always a pleasure to speak after the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Brooke). I am tempted to wonder what New York cab drivers did to ensure that everyone was aware that a chequered cab was somewhat harder to define.
<P>
I rise initially to speak to the two new schedules and two new clauses, part of eight Government amendments which will replace clause 176. I trust that the amendments were comprehensible by virtue of the explanatory note which was sent to the Chairman and copied to all Members of the Committee. I trust that it will be in order if I speak briefly to the Government before referring in detail to the new clauses tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Ilford, North and the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey and his hon. Friends and replying to some of the matters that they raised.
<P>
New clause 63 and new schedule 6 replace clause 176 and transfer to Transport for London the responsibility for taxi licensing in greater London. They would give the mayor a power to direct the calculation of taxi fares, a key issue both for taxi drivers and their paying passengers, modelled on a provision in clause 134(2)(a), which gives the mayor a similar power in respect of public passenger transport services.
<P>
Government amendments Nos. 885 and 886 transfer to Transport for London most of the Private Hire Vehicles (London) Act 1998. Amendment No. 885 provides that, except as provided by amendment No. 886, the Secretary of State's powers for minicabs transfer to TfL. Amendment No. 886, in consequence, provides for three measures: first, for three sections of the 1998 Act not to transfer to TfL; secondly, for a new schedule 7 for minicabs and, thirdly, for regulations made by or in relation to the Secretary of State under the 1998 Act to continue as if made by TfL.
<P>
New schedule 7 is long, but its purpose is straightforward: it is to amend the 1998 Act by providing for "the licensing authority" to be substituted for "the Secretary of State" and defining the licensing authority as TfL. As with taxis, the effect is to transfer to TfL from the Secretary of State the responsibility for minicab operator, driver and vehicle licensing.
<P>
Government amendment 887 simply adds to the repeals schedule some obsolete provisions on taxis and minicabs.
<P>
New clause 64 is concerned with the effect on both taxis and minicabs of the change to the metropolitan police district. The new clause provides for a transition for taxi and minicab licensing in the eight fringe district councils' areas outside greater London. They are: Epsom and Ewell--referred to by the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton--Hertsmere and Spelthorne, which are wholly within the MPD, and Broxbourne, Elmbridge, Epping Forest, Reigate and Banstead and Welwyn Hatfield, whose boundaries straddle the MPD.
<P>
Once the MPD changes, those district councils will license taxis and minicabs in line with other local authorities outside London. We shall, of course, ensure that taxi and minicab drivers' livelihoods are not adversely affected by the transitional arrangements on which we will shortly be consulting with those affected by the change. I shall speak later in more detail about that matter, which is of special concern to the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton The proposals are a sensible devolution of power from the Secretary of State to Transport for London.
<P>
I said that I would answer in detail the questions asked by hon. Members at this morning's sitting. I trust that hon. Members will accept that it would be most appropriate now if I mention the new clause tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Ilford, North, to which the hon. Members for Croydon, South and for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey) spoke. Each of them, in their own way, paid warm tribute to the importance of taxi drivers in London, not only as part of a public transport system but in the wider sense of what constitutes the image of London and the quality of service that they provide. The hon. Gentlemen highlighted the fact that those who would be taxi drivers are dedicated and hard working. My hon. Friend the Member for Ilford, North also spoke of people who are less dedicated and hard-working, and detailed appointments and tests that were missed. The dedicated and the hard-working seem, as she put it in her inimitable way, to be subsidising those less committed to the work involved before a person can claim that highly prized licence to drive a black cab in London. This point was also made by the hon. Members for Croydon, South and for Kingston and Surbiton.
<P>
The new clause tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Ilford, North would introduce a charge on application for the grant, or for renewal of a licence under the Metropolitan Public Carriage Act 1869, subject to the approval of the Secretary of State. A licence can be granted under section 6 of the 1869 Act to allow a taxi vehicle to ply for hire, and a licence can be granted to a driver under section 8 of the Act to ply for hire in a licensed vehicle.
<P>
We heard that my hon. Friend's concern is less with life as experienced by taxi-drivers and would-be taxi drivers in 1869 than with that experienced here in 1999. There is without doubt an incentive to people applying for licences to ensure that they or their vehicle are ready to be licenced if a charge is imposed. It would, as I said, also mean that existing licence holders would not be subsidising new applicants who were not ready to be given a licence. There is wide support for the new clause not only in Committee but outside the House of Commons, and I am most willing to consider it. I trust 923 924 that my hon. Friend the Member for Ilford, North will find it acceptable if I say that I agree to take it away for further consideration. on that basis, I ask my hon. Friend to withdraw it.

<P>

<B>Sir Sydney Chapman </B>(Chipping Barnet): The Minister tends to do that. Some amendments are acceptable to the Government in principle. Therefore I am at a loss to know why they feel that they have to ask for them to be withdrawn in return for a promise that Ministers will reconsider them. Surely the Minister could say that, yes, her hon. Friend's new clause may have to come back on Report so that a word can be changed here or there if, for some technical reason, it is not quite correct. Can the Minister not be a little more forthcoming? I am sure that she will gain in stature. From all that she has said--and we share her view--the amendment from her hon. Friend the Member for Ilford, North is perfectly correct.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> I am not over-concerned with increasing my stature; I want to ensure that the legislation does what it was drafted to do. I made it abundantly clear to my hon. Friend the Member for Ilford, North that I am prepared to consider the new clause again. I cannot say what changes might need to be made to the drafting. The hon. Member for Chipping Barnet is no doubt aware that before a clause can become part of the Bill it must, I understand, be drafted by Parliamentary counsel. Nor am I able to say at what stage we shall return to the new clause, if we do.
<P>
<B>Sir Sydney Chapman:</B> I understand what the hon. Lady says. I shall not press her further except to say that surely it is perfectly competent for Ministers, if they agree with the principle of an amendment or new clause, to instruct their Parliamentary counsel or whoever to examine it to ascertain whether it is technically correct. One would have thought that that could be done ahead of the Minister's statement--an encouraging one, I willingly concede--this afternoon. Surely the processes and procedures of the Committee and the accountability of Ministers would be further strengthened if my suggestion were accepted.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> I understand the hon. Gentleman's point of principle, but I repeat that it would be incorrect to agree to the new clause proposed by my hon. Friend the Member for Ilford, North here and now in Committee when further work is required, not least because it refers to the Secretary of State's permission and this part of the Bill deals with the powers of Transport for London. I have categorically acknowledged the wide support for the new clause and the inherent common sense within it. I have given a clear commitment to take it away and examine it further. I should also tell the hon. Member for Chipping Barnet that whether my suggestions are acceptable is a matter for my hon. Friend the Member for Ilford, North to decide.
<P>
Before I move on to new clauses 67 and 68, which deal with banning smoking in cabs, I would like to touch on some of the specific questions raised earlier. The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey was much concerned about the bottleneck in the processing of drivers' licences at the Public Carriage Office. I am delighted that the hon. Gentleman welcomed the change whereby the PCO will become part of Transport for London, though I do not accept all his reasons for being so delighted.
<P>
The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey also touched on the shortage of examiners for those who wanted to take the Knowledge. The number of examiners was increased in the second half of 1998 from six to nine, as a result of which, while only 130 drivers were newly licensed in the first two months of 1998, 199 were newly licensed in the first two months of 1999. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will perceive that as a move in the right direction, even if it does not meet his complete satisfaction.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman also asked whether a research study being conducted by my Department had been completed. Not as yet, but we hope that its conclusions will be announced in two months' time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes </B>(Southwark, North and Bermondsey): Will the Minister tell us whether she would allow that study to examine issues other than the appropriate level of fares? Could it assess the number of cabs that London requires? No one ever seems to have assessed that.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> I am not prepared to intervene on the current study, which would be improper. We should wait and see what conclusions emerge from it. It might, however, be useful to examine the number of cabs that are needed in London, and I would be prepared to look into that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for her response to the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston and Surbiton and others, but would she be prepared to link it with other issues? The total number of cabs needed for London is one thing, but there are also pertinent arguments relating to the greater need for cabs in some parts of London than in others.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> The hon. Gentleman seems to be pushing for decisions here, which would be intrinsic when the mayor and the assembly come into force. However, what he is asking for could clearly provide evidence that would be useful when the mayor has to take decisions on these matters.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman was also concerned about Public Carriage Office records--not, I presume, about criminal records, but complaints against drivers, for example, of which records are kept. For the licensing authority, the main issue is fairness, in using rather than keeping the records. In the existing system, a taxi driver can request a personal hearing before a senior officer if he or she is not satisfied with a decision. The system already allows for an appeal at a magistrates court.
<P>
The Committee's deliberations are about establishing the GLA. Part IV of the Bill deals with transport and establishing Transport for London, which will be able to make representations for a review of matters. It will also be open to those outside the GLA and the assembly to make representations. It is possible that the subject that we are considering can be covered.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I understand that. We are, however, in a difficult position. I assume, although the Minister has not yet said so, that the powers will be handed over on 3 July 2000. While I accept that the GLA will examine any anxieties, there is a year and four months to go. The Home Office is still responsible for the matters that we are considering. They are important now, and will be important in that interim period as well as later. I hope that they will be examined before the GLA is established.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> The hon. Gentleman made a point in the context of taxis that applies to transitional arrangements for a range of transport. We shall discuss some of them in detail later. I have already mentioned some transitional arrangements in our earlier deliberations. The process is on going, and warrants discussion.
<P>
Let us consider appeals for advertising. An aggrieved individual can approach the head of the Public Carriage Office, or a more senior member of the Metropolitan police.
<P>
The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey also mentioned the designation of cab ranks. I am sorry that the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster is not in his place because he was also worried about that. As the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey knows, the designation of cab ranks is currently in the remit of the police. In future, the power will rest with TfL. It is entirely right and proper for the licensing body to decide on cab stands. A borough that is in need of a cab rank can apply for one. In a wider context, the siting of cab ranks could be important in providing some aspects of an integrated transport strategy.
<P>
The hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton was rightly worried that, after the change to the Metropolitan police district, there would be potential lack of employment for his constituents who are currently cab drivers and will find that they are not licensed to drive in those local districts which will be outside the GLA boundary. Clearly, no change will be made to their existing potential for earning, as they have a licence that allows them to ply for hire within the GLA boundary. However, should they wish to work in districts that are outside that boundary, they will have to obtain the requisite licence from the requisite licensing authority, which will be the local authority concerned.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> Is the Minister saying that those cab drivers will be allowed to carry two badges and be regulated by two different authorities?
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> In effect, yes. It will be entirely possible for cab drivers to drive a black cab if they hold a licence within the GLA and maintain the requirements for licensing. However, should they wish to drive a cab in districts outside the GLA boundary and outside what will be the Metropolitan police district boundary, they will have to obtain the requisite licence from the requisite local authority. I trust that the hon. Gentleman is now clear about that matter.
<P>
I was anxious about such matters myself, so I inquired how many licensed London cab drivers in suburban zones will be affected by the requirement, which will come into force after the changes within the boundaries. I was told that 1,365 of the total of 22,500 licensed London cab drivers will be affected.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> Before the Minister addresses dual licensing, I wish to remind her that I had detailed discussions with cab drivers about that option.
<P>
I welcome the Minister's assurances, but there are one or two practical problems, most notably with the taxi meter and responding to different fare structures. Furthermore, cab drivers would, inevitably, have to learn the Knowledge for an area wider than that in which they currently ply. That is because the new regulatory authority for the council area outside the GLA covers a larger area than that covered by the MPD. Will cab drivers be able to apply to the relevant councils to do the Knowledge in their areas so as to prepare for dual licensing?
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> We are talking about local authorities setting in train licensing requirements. Once the GLA is established, the authorities that I mentioned earlier will be in line with all other local authorities on such matters. Under the Bill, local authorities must decide their requirements before issuing a licence. There will not be any requirement for any sort of detailed knowledge of the area to which a local authority's licence applies, although drivers may well have such knowledge.
<P>
Local authorities may use medical records and criminal records to decide whether a driver is fit to hold a licence. They will also ensure the safety of vehicles in line with those licensing authorities outside London which currently have responsibility for licensing black cabs and minicabs.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Davey:</B> The Minister is being most helpful, and I am grateful for her clarification.
<P>
However, the Minister did not address the matter of the taxi meter. I accept that councils outside London will be judges on such matters and must draw up their own rules. In the past, dual licensing has been vetoed. If the Minister is saying that councils outside London have the option of dual licensing, that is important. Encouraging those councils to amend their rules to allow such licensing is significant. My constituents are extremely concerned about this. In other parts of the country the councils and regulatory authorities have specifically outlawed dual badges, which has caused problems, particularly in the greater Liverpool area. If the Minister wants to make the dual-licensing option a reality I hope that she can give the Committee more words of assurance.
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> I shall try again. As I thought I had made clear, the possessor of a licence to drive within London at present--a black cab driver--will still have the power to ply for hire within what will be the new GLA boundary, the new MPD boundary. That will not entitle the holder of that licence to ply for hire in those authorities that will be outside the MPD boundary and therefore those drivers will have to apply for a licence from the local authority. That is a licence for the driver, not the vehicle.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman touched on the issue of metering. There clearly cannot be a moveable meter that is set for within the Greater London boundary that can be changed,for outside it. Fares, which have already been referred to, will be set by the mayor. They will not be set in the local authorities outside the boundary. I trust that that has answered the hon. Gentleman's questions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I am sorry, but the more the hon. Lady speaks, the more she disappoints me. I thought that we had made some progress. It sounds from what she suggests that to ply in two areas, the cab driver would need two vehicles, two separate taxi meters and two sets of regulations. That is clearly an unrealistic option. I had thought that she was introducing a realistic option to tackle the problems that I raised. If all it amounts to is allowing them to have two vehicles, two taxi meters and to pay two sets of fees, it will not satisfy my constituents.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> Neither the Public Carriage Office nor my Department expect the change that we are proposing for the GLA boundary to have an adverse impact on the abilities of current cab licence holders to earn a living. Clearly that is a decision for the individual cab driver to make. We do not think that the fact that after the creation of the new boundary current licence holders will be required to obtain a licence from the new authorities will have a deleterious effect on the ability of those licence holders to earn a living. It is always open to them, as I said, to earn an additional living in those areas by applying to the relevant local authority for the relevant licence.
<P>
I move on to new clauses 67 and 68. In essence these would provide for a minicab driver and a taxi driver respectively to remove, with or without the assistance of a constable, a passenger who was either smoking or carrying lighted tobacco. These clauses would make that an offence subject to a fine. As the hon. Members for Croydon, South and for Kingston and Surbiton pointed out, I have publicly supported the principle of designating taxis as non-smoking vehicles. On 29 July last year in a reply to a Parliamentary Question from my hon. Friend the Member for Cambridge (Mrs. Campbell) it was stated that the Government intended, when Parliamentary time permitted, to propose a change in the law to enable licensed taxi drivers to designate their vehicles as non-smoking cabs.
<P>
However, having established that I have no argument with the basic principle, I must tell the hon. Members who have tabled the new clauses that they do not seem the vehicle to carry forward the idea. On one simple level, what is being proposed in the Bill is the transfer of existing powers to the new GLA and assembly. What is being proposed here does not amend or adapt existing powers in regard to taxi drivers' duties to ensure that their vehicles are safe to carry passengers or to their safety as individuals. The proposals would, however, place a responsibility on the passenger. They would warrant much wide and detailed consultation not only within Government, but with the trade and consumer groups. Organisations that are concerned about safety would feel the need to be consulted on some issues.
<P>
Although I have no argument with the basic principle behind the proposals, we could not use the Bill to implement them without gathering knowledge, listening to the arguments--pro and con--and assessing, at a simple level, what offence the passenger would commit. Would it be a criminal or a civil offence? In the main, a taxi is hired by an individual, so there would be the issue of evidence if the driver said that the passenger had been smoking and the passenger said that he had not. A voluntary scheme exists in increasing numbers of black cabs we are politely asked not to smoke. As a smoker, I always abide by such a request.
<P>
The new clause on mini cabs is unnecessary because the situation is entirely different. A mini cab has to be booked in advance; it cannot be hired on the street. The would-be hirer could, therefore, stipulate that he wanted to be driven by a non-smoking driver, while such a driver could make it clear to the operator who was responsible for the bookings that he did not want to carry smoking passengers.
<P>
Although I would support the proposals in principle, the Bill is not the vehicle through which to implement them for the reasons that I gave. The proposals would require the widest possible consultation. They would place a duty on the passenger. The powers that are being transferred relate to cab drivers' duties in regard to their safety and to that of their vehicles.

<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor </B>(Solihull): I would like the hon. Lady to know that I, too, am a smoker. Her technique is absolutely correct--we should always inquire whether we may smoke. If somebody says, "I'd rather you didn't", we should not. In establishing certain techniques of lifemanship, I have found that one of the best is to offer the cab driver a cigarette on boarding the cab. If he accepts, I know that I am all right.

<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> Indeed. I shall not detain the Committee with a story about a cab driver who was a smoker and who attempted to overcome a smoking ban on another form of transport. He had an extremely unhappy experience, which he related to me with some relish as he puffed away in the front of his cab.
<P>
For the reasons that I gave, I trust that the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey will not press his new clauses. I commend our provisions to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> We welcome the Minister's warm response to new clause 55, which would allow charging for applications for a icence. It was moved by the hon. Member for Ilford, North and was broadly supported.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Kingston and Surbiton will on other occasions want to pursue matters relating to the cross-boundary areas. Some issues that were relatively clear at the beginning became less so as the Minister's reply went on.
<P>
I just want to respond to the Minister's comments about new clauses 67 and 68. To put it bluntly, she has changed her position. The truth is that her answer was clear last July:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"When Parliamentary time permits, we intend to propose a change in the law to enable licensed taxi drivers to designate their vehicles as "no-smoking cabs", thereby relieving them of the obligation to carry passengers who insist on smoking."<P>
</UL></FONT>--[Official Report, 29 July 1998; Vol. 317, c. 241.]<P>
If anything is parliamentary time, this is it. We are using parliamentary time; there is the space. With respect to the Minister, that is the weakest argument that I have ever heard her adduce. To say that parliamentary time does not permit when we are debating a Bill that could include the provision is nonsense.
<P>
The Minister can reasonably argue that the Government want to go through the process for the rest of the country, and the Bill relates only to London; but the statutory consultee of her Department on the issue in London is the London Taxi Board, which has agreed to the proposal. The very people whom her Department must consult fully support the new clauses.
<P>
The grounds that the Minister gave then and now are public health grounds. The requirement would not he obligatory; it would be permissive. It would allow cab drivers to opt in to the common London public transport system. The Minister for Public Health and the Green Paper on public health say that where possible we should remove smoking from public transport. For this purpose, cabs are public transport.
<P>
The new clauses would not make cab drivers comply; they would allow cab drivers to say that they wanted their cabs to be smoke free. They set out a perfectly reasonable, normal, standard set of provisions defining an offence. It would be a criminal offence, but not a serious one. It is framed in the same way as other criminal offences; it would give rise to a fine and a liability to pay.
<P>
I would be grateful if the Minister would respond, but we will not let her off the hook. She said clearly a year ago that, parliamentary time permitting, such a provision could be introduced. There is parliamentary time now, and there is no good reason for the provision not to be introduced now.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Dismore </B>(Hendon): I have some sympathy with the Liberal Democrat new clauses about smoking, although I fully understand the reasons given by my hon. Friend the Minister why they may not be appropriate as drafted. Given that there is a considerable attack on passive smoking in the workplace and the serious health hazard that it can cause, it is incumbent on us to act as soon as possible on the issue, especially bearing in mind the action taken by the Health and Safety Executive, which is becoming increasingly tough on employers who do not act against passive smoking in the workplace, and the series of successful compensation claims by people whose health has been damaged by such passive smoking.
<P>
My hon. Friend said that she thought that the way forward might be to adapt existing powers. Has she considered section 34 of the London Hackney Carriage Act 1831. There is no reference to that act in clause 176, but I understand from the Library that section 34 is still in force. That section permits a cab driver to refuse a fare if he has a reasonable excuse to do so: for example, if a passenger is extremely drunk or has a vicious dog. Perhaps by amending that Act we could deal with the issue of smoking in taxis. Will my hon. Friend consider that suggestion? We could also do a little more to promote a voluntary ban in the meantime by working more closely with taxi drivers.
<P>
My hon. Friend mentioned consultation. If we are serious about taking the issue forward--she said that she accepted the basic principle--even if we cannot include the provision in the Bill, there is no reason why we cannot start the consultation process now, so that when a suitable vehicle arrives, the consultation exercise will have been completed. Will my hon. Friend consider whether we can start such consultation now?
<P>
Finally, I ask my hon. Friend to reconsider whether we could use the Bill to introduce the provision. I understand from the House of Commons Library that the legislation relating to London taxis is self-contained and is London legislation, not national legislation. It may well be that we could take the issue forward later. I understand my hon. Friend's reasons for resisting the Liberal Democrat new clauses and her technical arguments relating to evidence and criminality. I am happy to support her position today, but the issue merits further consideration at a later stage.

<P>

<B>Mr. John Wilkinson </B>(Ruislip-Northwood): This is very much a matter for personal discrimination and taste. The permissive style of new clauses 67 and 68 is such that they should be acceptable to reasonable people. Many London taxi drivers drive their own cabs--they ought to be entitled to lay down the law within their own vehicles. If they find it offensive to have a smoker in the back, it is perfectly sensible to have a legal requirement that passengers desist from smoking. After all, it happens on other forms of public transport including the tube, trains and aircraft. I do not see why it should not be done for London taxis.
<P>
I myself, who disapprove most strongly of smoking because of the appalling damage that it does to public health and the ensuing misery, will certainly vote for the Liberal Democrat new clauses.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> I welcome the support for our new clauses from the hon. Members for Hendon (Mr. Dismore) and for Ruislip--Northwood (Mr. Wilkinson) --[Interruption.] Well the hon. Member for Hendon said that he supports them in spirit--like the Minister--but I hope that when we push them to a vote he will have the courage of his convictions. Unlike him, I was not convinced by the Minister's reply.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey explained the Minister's previous position, but her position tonight was rather odd. She suggested that the danger of our new clauses was that they would put a new responsibility on the passenger. Is that responsibility new to Londoners? They are not allowed to smoke on the London underground. They frequently enter places of work, public transport zones and places of entertainment--the cinema, for example--where they are not allowed to smoke. That is a clear rule and it is widely accepted. It is not as if such a rule would be new to passengers in London cabs. The Minister talked about the danger of creating a new responsibility on which we needed to consult, but she did not make a strong case.
<P>
At one point, the Minister referred to the need to consult people who are concerned about passenger safety. I have heard it argued that if a young lady who was travelling late at night in the back of a cab persisted in smoking after the cab driver had told her that it was a non-smoking cab, she might be put in danger because the cab driver would have the right to force her out of the cab. When I put that scenario to cab drivers, they were rather insulted. According to them, when carrying vulnerable people--be they young or old--the standard practice, which to their knowledge all cab drivers abide by, is to take them to the nearest police station. They gave me countless examples of when they had done that. That practice would deal with one problem that the Minister might have with the new clauses.
<P>
We do not propose to create a new offence, but rather to remove one. At the moment, cab drivers can lose their badge if they refuse to carry someone who is smoking. That seems to be a ridiculous state of affairs. I hope that the Minister will seize this opportunity to legislate. As my hon. Friend the Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey said, we now have parliamentary time and it would be possible for the Committee to take such a decision today. Unless the Minister can give us rather more assurance than she gave earlier, we will seek to divide the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> The Minister's response to a question last year and her statement today embody one of the most breathtaking U-turns that I have seen in politics. It is not as if this were something that she said in opposition and then found that it was a bigger job than she thought. She said it when she was a Minister, and had all the benefits and advantages of advice from reliable civil servants. She said it in the clear knowledge of what she was saying and, from my own experience of government, I am sure that it would have been endorsed by the Secretary of State. Now she says that it is not the right time or place to do it and that, in any case, the new clauses go about it in the wrong way. That is hypocrisy. One of the characteristics of this Government is that they tend to raise expectations and then fail to deliver on them.
<P>
Having said that, I think that the Minister is aboslutely right in her conclusion.
<P>
It would be better to take the kind of consensual approach that was described by my hon. Friend the Member for Solihull (Mr. Taylor). The Liberals have gone down too prescriptive a road. There is a straight difference of political approach to the two new clauses. I am aware that there is a wide range of opinions in the Conservative party. I am also conscious of the fact that it is a matter of conscience. Given those circumstances, Conservative Members will be allowed a free vote on the issue, and I challenge Ministers to do the same. A number of Back Benchers will be disappointed about the progress of the undertaking that was given to the taxi trade, and I invite Ministers to lift the Whip and let the issue be decided on truly democratic principles.
<P>
We shall not be voting immediately, and I have a commitment which may mean that I am out of the Committee Room for a few minutes. I should like to put it on the record, therefore, that if I am present I intend to vote against the new clause.
<P>
<B>Ms Perham:</B> I thank the Minister for considering new clause 55, and I look forward to her bringing forward Government proposals at a later stage of the Bill's passage.
<P>
<B>Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> I begin by responding to the contribution by the hon. Member for Croydon, South, which was, I regret, entirely typical.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> In that I agreed with her?
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> No; I was referring to the hon. Gentleman's usual allegations of hypocrisy and major U-turns on my part. I point out to him that we are discussing London. My statements, which I stand by, were not made in the context of a ban being imposed exclusively in cabs within the London area.
<P>
In principle, I agree entirely with the proposal. However, the new clauses have been framed in such a way that they would not produce the desired result. They would require far wider consultation than that described by the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey). For example, consultation with consumer groups would be necessary. The hon. Gentleman mentioned the London Taxi Board, which clearly should be consulted. However, in a wider context, it would be necessary to consult with other licensing authorities and other Government Departments.
<P>
The powers that are being transferred relate to the requirements that are placed on a taxi driver in terms of his ability and the safety of his vehicle, but the new clauses would place a burden on the passenger to conform. The hon. Gentleman spoke of experiences in relation to the safety issue--a taxi driver driving to a police station, for example. We should not include the proposal in the Bill without having considered the fine details and undertaken full consultation. We do not even know if the offence would be civil or criminal. If a taxi driver did drive to the police station, would he charge his passenger for that journey? What would happen if someone who was not smoking got into a cab and then proceeded to smoke, or if the person who lit up some form of tobacco was 18 stone? I have touched on the evidential issue in such cases. With no one around, will the taxi driver take that kind of risk? It is a question not just of danger to passengers, but to taxi drivers as well.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> They have agreed to it.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> One section, the London Taxi Board, has certainly supported the proposal. However, it is an element of the kind of consultation that would be required before the introduction of such a ban in cabs. The issue of a ban being a choice for the taxi cab driver again warrants close examination, as does the idea that it would meet with blanket acceptance. In many instances a cab driver may not be the owner of a vehicle, which could lead to a separation of opinion, if another driver and the owner are driving the same cab. This is not as simple a measure as Liberal Democrat Members would have us believe. As this is an issue of great importance and, as I have said, it is a principle with which I concur, the introduction of such a ban warrants the widest possible consideration and consultation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> The problem with that argument is that it was not mentioned in the Minister's reply. She did not say, "when parliamentary time permits", and "after widespread consultation", but used the conventional form, which is that at the next available legislative opportunity, such a measure would be introduced. The Minister said in July, "We intend to propose" a change in the law.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> On the issue of whether parliamentary time permits, the hon. Gentleman knows perfectly well that before any legislation is introduced by the Government there is the widest possible consultation as to would constitute that legislation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> That is not always the case. We were summoned back last September to put legislation through in a day, with no consultation at all.
<P>
<B>Several hon. Members rose--</B><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Mr. Hughes has the floor.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I shall offer the Minister a way out of a dilemma that I am sure is not of her making. If she will agree that she will, on behalf of the Government, bring forward a proposal for consultation in the period from today until the Committee stage in the Lords, we shall not push the matter to a vote.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> I am not clear about the hon. Gentleman's example which he used to rebut my argument that before the Government introduce legislation there needs to be the widest possible consultation. I must tell him that I am not looking for a way out. I stand by what I have said, and I stand by what I say today. I am not clear what the hon. Gentleman is proposing. I shall be asking him to withdraw his new clauses for the reasons that I have given. I believe that those reasons are entirely valid.
<P>
We are discussing something that is of major importance for a wide range of issues, not least to do with health and safety. The new clauses will not, in my view, achieve the desired outcome for the reasons that I have given. I do not believe that this Bill is the vehicle--that is not a deliberate pun--that can best deliver the desirable outcomes expressed in the contributions made from all sides of the Committee.

<P>

<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> If new clauses 67 and 68 are not the ideal vehicles, as the Minister elegantly puts it, does she not have time to arrange to have appropriate amendments drafted and consulted on between now and the Committee stage in the Lords, as the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey suggests? If the will was there, she could perfectly well do it. It is clear that she has no intention of doing so.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> I must say to the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood that I thought that he was unnecessarily offensive in implying that there was not the will to do this. I repeat: it is not the new clauses that are the inadequate vehicle, but the Bill. However, the new clauses as drafted, and even with excessive work on the wording, do not deliver the desired outcomes. Surely the overwhelming requirement, as I have said, is that for a variety of reasons there should be much wider consultation on the issue than could take place between now and Report.
<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. John McDonnell </B>(Hayes and Harlington): I urge hon. Members not to divide the Committee unnecessarily this afternoon because the discussion has highlighted how, in principle, we want to move towards the position that is largely reflected in the amendments. Our debate is whether these are the appropriate amendments or the Bill is an appropriate vehicle. I urge us not to divide today but to continue the discussion on the appropriateness of the new clauses or the Bill in the coming weeks. If necessary, we can return to this issue on Report. The overall view in the Committee is that we would want to see the legislation enacted as rapidly as possible.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> My hon. Friend has made a very seasoned contribution. I would detain the Committee unnecessarily if I reiterated the arguments that I have put forward. It is a matter of particular importance. I understand precisely why the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey has tabled the new clauses, but I stand by my comments about the wider context. I do not believe that these are the correct new clauses or that this is the correct vehicle for achieving the desired outcomes. That the desired outcomes will be achieved at some point, however, I have little doubt.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I am sympathetic to the mood in the Committee. The hon. Member for Hendon suggested one way forward; the hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington (Mr. McDonnell) wants us to get there in the end; and the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood tried to be helpful. Would not the way forward be to ask the Minister to say that she would happy if, immediately after today's debate, a process of consultation sponsored by the Government could start? There are two geographical areas: the London area, for which there is traditionally separate legislation, and the rest of the country for which there is other legislation. We may need two bits of legislation, one for London and one for the rest. We have done it that way before.
<P>
I have a second suggestion. I understand the drafting point. I did not stand up earlier to defend every word of the drafting; I was merely putting forward the proposal. Consultation would take about three months which would allow us to get the issue into the Bill by Report, but I offer an alternative. If the Government were willing to consult on the matter widely as it relates to England as a whole, which would make it inappropriate for a London Bill, and were minded to accept an initiative in the next Session of Parliament on a London basis--a private Member's Bill or an amendment to a Government Bill--I would be happy to be conciliatory towards colleagues on both Back Benches and not push the matter. However, I will want from her, if I may push her a little further, an agreement to consult both in London and on a wider basis. If she can be bold and give that undertaking, there is a way forward.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> What I can guarantee is that if the new clauses are withdrawn, I will certainly consult Government colleagues on the issues that he has raised. I am happy to consult him and discuss the second part of his proposal, which goes more than half way to meet him.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I will show what a generous man I am. We will withdraw the new clauses on the basis that the Minister, I and others will have discussions; and if we have reached a satisfactory way forward by Report, we will not need to pursue this matter in the Bill. If we have not, we will want to bring it back. On that basis, when the time comes we will not press the new clauses to a vote.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> One cannot say fairer than that.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Having chain smoked on this group of amendments for some time, we shall soon be able to clear our lungs of a lot of business.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> My constituency was divided between two bodies performing local government functions. I choose to use opaque language because I can never summon up the correct technical description of the Corporation of London. Forty-nine years ago, some London constituencies experienced the same dichotomy to that experienced in 1997. I shall reflect that dichotomy by addressing the experience of the Corporation of London under clause 178. I will go on to describe the experience of Wesminster city council under clause 179. It is a case of vice versa as well.
<P>
Clause 178 facilitates the transfer of certain roads to the GLA. In particular, Upper and Lower Thames streets in the City of London, Blackfriars bridge and Farringdon street have been proposed for transfer to GLA, in addition to the existing red route of London bridge to Bishopsgate. The Corporation of London will no longer be the highway and traffic authority for those three streets, which carry more than half of all City traffic. The so-called ring of steel is dependent on measures affecting areas on or adjacent to one or more of those streets. The integrity of the existing scheme for the ring of steel will no longer lie within the remit of the Corporation of London.
<P>
I remind the Committee that when terrorism struck the City of London--not once but twice--many foreign institutions warned the Corporation of London that unless terrorism was prevented by appropriate measures, they would have to reconsider their presence in the City of London. The consequences of the ring of steel passing out of the hands of the Corporation of London is therefore an issue--and I choose my words carefully--that may concern City businesses. Our foreign friends in the City might well describe that as a typical and characteristically English understatement.
<P>
The ability of the City to manage traffic in the manner most advantageous for business--by separating the overwhelming through-traffic element from local movements--will depend, if the clause is passed, on an external authority. Whatever traffic reduction targets are imposed on local authorities by a future mayor will depend on similar or greater reduction on GLA roads. I remark in passing that experience of parallel circumstances has not seen similar Government-planned reductions in the capacity of trunk roads or red routes coming to fruition.
<P>
Potential delay and bureaucratic complications may occur in dealing with planning permission in the hinterland accessible to the new GLA roads. The City is effectively divided--the Committee will recall that I described three major roads--into three parts. I acknowledge that my final considerations about planning are simply a paving artillery barrage for later clauses that deal with the impact of planning on the City. However, I would welcome the Minister's response to all the issues that I have raised in what I hope has been a commendably brief speech.
<P>
<B>Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> As all the right hon. Gentleman's speeches are commendable, I have no argument with his last statement. I understand his perspectives, but cannot accept all his arguments. He believes that the ring of steel is intrinsically and inherently the exclusive responsibility of the City of London and that it is capable of being maintained as such only by the City of London, but that is not entirely the case.
<P>
The right hon. Gentleman was concerned about the division of responsibility, but the Bill establishes an authority--essentially the mayor--whose central duty will be the integration of public transport in London, with all the benefits that such an integration could bring. As to the management of highways in the City, the red route already goes through the ring of steel, so the City is not really the traffic manager.
<P>
The right hon. Gentleman is, however, right that clause 178 adds a new subsection (2A) to section 1 of the Highways Act 1980 and provides for Transport for London to be the highway authority for GLA roads. That will allow Transport for London to undertake, for GLA roads, all functions placed on a highway authority by other legislation.
<P>
As I said, I entirely understand the right hon. Gentleman's feelings, but, equally, he will appreciate that our proposals for the future of London stress the primacy and importance of the City of London--not least for its capacity as a financial centre and for job creation within the Greater London area. Organisations in the City of London which are committed to maintaining its primacy as an attractive place to work tell me that the main concerns of those from other nations who want to work in our great city are transport traffic congestion and ever-growing pollution.
<P>
Although I understand the right hon. Gentleman's perspective, I urge him to accept that our proposals will, in the long term, benefit not only the City of London but the wider London that will be in the GLA's remit.
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> I want to press the Minister, as I believe that my right hon. Friend was highlighting a possible conflict between the Minister's natural desire for the most integrated approach for London as a whole, expressed through the GLA and TfL, and the concerns expressed by my right hon. Friend about security in the City. Will the Minister go further and say how the new authority will approach the circumstances of the City as outlined by my right hon. Friend? What comfort can she give in that respect?
<P>
 I understand my right hon. Friend's fears; those working in the City have, until now, been reassured that the City authorities give absolute primacy to the security of people working there, as has been shown by the ring of steel, which so far has been demonstrably successful. I can understand people's anxieties if they think that the new integrated authority might not give security such a high priority, especially in the City area. I listened carefully to the Minister but I did not hear her say anything that would give them comfort. Can she say more to assure my right hon. and hon. Friends and those in the City that the integrated authority will give security in the City absolute priority?
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> I repeat to the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Mr. Forth) what I said in my opening remarks: I emphasise how important the City of London is to the wider London which will be within the GLA boundary. It would be absurd to presuppose that an incoming mayor would not be cognisant of what could make such a powerful contribution to the City of London.
<P>
I would argue with the suggestion that it is only the Corporation of the City of London that is committed to the security and safety of the people who work and live within it. Given the appalling incidents which prompted what has become known as the ring of steel--we we all know that it is pressed plastic--such considerations are well known. There have been other appalling incidents, but once the initial shock has dispersed, and the necessary work has been done to save human life and to restore the physical environment, safety is seen to be a prime consideration for local authorities as well as trepidation for the City of London.
<P>
I take this opportunity to dispel any scintilla of concern, doubt or trepidation--it would be inappropriate to say lingering doubt as we have only just entered the discussion--that an incoming mayor and an assembly for the GLA will destroy the most central and vital constituent parts of Greater London. We are all cognisant of the sense of pride that emanates from people who live and work within the Square Mile. It is, however, part of our great city. London and the City are the greater for that combination.
<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Fitzpatrick:</B> Is my hon. Friend saying that we will arrive at a consensus between the mayor, TfL and the City that will provide the best possible solution in terms of security and traffic flow? The experience of the Isle of Dogs in my constituency after the South Quay bomb demonstrates that technology has advanced to a great extent. Physical barriers can be tempered by new technological devices that provide sufficient security to reassure the City that it will be protected while improving traffic flows. In that way, everybody benefits from the available advances in technology.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> My hon. Friend makes a good contribution, which is informed by the terrorist activity that took place in his constituency. He emphasised the points that I made earlier about safety, security and making a major contribution to ensuring that the quality of life in this great city improves and is attractive to those from outside. That will depend on the mayor having a properly integrated transport strategy, with all the duties and functions that that entails. Such an approach will benefit all those who live and work within the Square Mile or the GLA boundary.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I am grateful to my right hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst, the Minister and the hon. Member for Poplar and Canning Town. This has been a helpful debate, but I am not entirely convinced by the arguments that have been deployed.
<P>
I must take the Committee back to the circumstances that surrounded the second bomb. Those close to the events will recall that the City brought in the ring of steel under legislation that allowed it to carry out traffic experiments. It did that initially for six months, and had to get better legislative cover thereafter. It would be wrong to say that it was easy for the City to do that. The Department of Transport examined the issue to ascertain whether the City had legislative cover when it conducted the original traffic experiment because there was unhappiness about the way in which it acted. Neighbouring authorities complained that traffic was displaced as a result of the ring of steel being introduced.
<P>
The Corporation of London was motivated profoundly by the determination to put the ring of steel up before there was another incident because of the consequences that such an incident would have had for employment in central London. The corporation drove the issue forward. Obviously, I treat the Minister with good will when she says that there will be exactly the same co-operation between the corporation and the mayor's office when the mayor has responsibility for such matters. History is, however, not wholly on the Minister's side; we should remember the effect that the speedy implementation of the corporation's plans had on relations with other people. Other people will have the ability to influence the mayor.
<P>
The City demonstrated a single-minded drive to achieve its central objective. I should remark parenthetically that it produced a much more 959 960 pollution-free atmosphere in the City of London. We have gone back to a situation in which, everybody in the Square Mile can walk to see the person to whom they want to talk, even in this electronic age. That has been an environmental bonus of the scheme.
<P>
It is, however, also the case that the City of London police, which are funded in part by the Home Office and in part by the corporation, have invested heavily in the technology about which the hon. Member for Poplar and Canning Town talked. The police on the perimeter have the full details of any car that approaches the City of London within four seconds. As a result, many other crimes--quite apart from terrorist ones--have been resolved. I am not absolutely certain that all that would necessarily have happened if responsibility had been with the mayor's office.
<P>
I must stick to my guns. I have told my Front-Bench spokesman that I am not in any way seeking that my hon. Friends in this Committee should go with me, but I propose that clause 178 should be deleted, and I hope that Committee members--all of whom represent constituencies--will understand why I want to press my position.

<B>Ms Jackson:</B> The right hon. Gentleman spoke of history, which can educate us, but we are considering the future and a new form of citywide government. Lessons can be learned simply from the management of traffic within the ring of steel. Both the right hon. Gentleman and my hon. Friend the Member for Poplar and Canning Town talked about how things can be advanced by the sheer speed with which technological improvements come on stream. Although I understand the right hon. Gentleman's concerns, I repeat that we are considering the future. I suggest that it is intrinsic to the future that we can imagine that while the greatness of this capital city in some senses enforces the primacy of the Square Mile, the two are interdependent.

I think that this is the largest number of amendments that I have ever grouped.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> In the Committee debating the Finance Bill in 1978 I had the privilege of tabling a group of 24 amendments, but the group of 43 amendments that you, Mr. O'Hara, are generously allowing me to move today is almost double that. If it is the largest number that you have presided over, it is certainly the largest number that I have ever moved in my time in the House of Commons.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tony McNulty </B>(Harrow, East): The right hon. Gentleman should move them one at a time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I said in the debate on clause 178 that when we reached clause 179 I would refer to Westminster city council, which I shall do in a moment.
<P>
There is no comprehensive statutory legal definition of a highway because the concept of a highway long predates highways legislation. Highwaymen were not just for the suburbs. Where Prince's gate now stands in my constituency, at the highest point between Hyde Park corner and Windsor, there was a pub of ill repute. You will rule me out of order, Mr. O'Hara, if I divert for too long, but this is a preface to what I have to say later about the royal parks. The pub was a haunt of highwaymen, and an embarrassment to Westminster abbey, which owned it because it had owned the land since the middle ages. Eventually, it was bought out by the Government in an early example of privatisation, in order to close it down. When it was bought out, secret passages were discovered between the bars and the stables, to enable malefactors to escape.
<P>
Under common law, a highway may be broadly defined as a way over which all members of the public have a right to pass and repass. The highway authority is the body responsible for maintaining the highway, where it is maintainable at public expense. Clause 178 provides that Transport for London will be the highway authority for GLA roads. The initial GLA roads will be designated by order of the Secretary of State. The Bill also provides that when a trunk road in Greater London ceases to be a trunk road, it will become a GLA road.
<P>
I may technically be out of order now that we have passed clause 178, but I am resting on the dichotomy between the City and Westminster. Westminster city council--I declare an interest in speaking on its behalf--believes that councils should retain their powers as the highways authority for roads on the GLA network. In the days of the Greater London council, while the GLC was the traffic authority for a network of main roads, the local authorities were always the highway authorities.
<P>
If power is transferred to Transport for London, it will be confusing for the public and will affect council responsibilities in respect of mending the roads, street lighting and cleansing. Furthermore, that decision will affect councils' ability to attract sponsorship, as Westminster council and others will coincidentally lose their power to mount material on lamp posts.
<P>
It will be a relief to the hon. Member for Harrow, East (Mr. McNulty), who recommended that I speak to each amendment individually, that I shall spare the Committee further exegesis of my amendments, but I have explained what they are designed to do. I hope that in replying the Minister will acknowledge their comprehensiveness when measured against that objective. What I have said about clause 178 reinforces the argument behind the amendments that stretch in front of us from clause 179 onwards.
<P>
<B>Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> I congratulate the right hon. Gentleman on the comprehensive nature of his seemingly interminable list of amendments. They seek fundamentally to change the role of Transport for London in relation to GLA roads. They are aimed to limit the power of TfL to that of a traffic authority for GLA roads. Implicit in them is that the highway authority role for the GLA network would remain with the existing bodies--for trunk roads, the Secretary of State; for borough roads, the boroughs.
<P>
As I am sure that the right hon. Gentleman is aware, the White Paper, "A Mayor and Assembly for London" sets out our policy for the GLA road network. We made it clear that we would bring together the highway authority and traffic authority roles for the network. Our aim is to put an end to the current arrangements, under which there is dual jurisdiction over many key roads in London. We are talking about some of London's most important roads. The network may represent only 5 per cent. of London's roads; but it carries 30 per cent. of London's traffic. Those roads must be managed as a Londonwide network.
<P>
I well understand the concerns expressed about the practical arrangements for matters such as highway maintenance by members of the Committee and people without. On the other hand, the effect of the right hon. Gentleman's amendments would be to perpetuate the current dual responsibility--on trunk road red routes, between the highways agency and the Traffic Director for London, and on borough red routes, between the borough and the traffic director. There would thus continue to be a blurring of accountability, which has created inefficiencies in the past, that would create even greater inefficiencies in future. That would impact against the strategic nature of the Bill's proposals for the authority. I therefore ask the right hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendments.

<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I hope that I have demonstrated during the Committee's proceedings--we have now reached clause 180--that I am not an obsessive in the way that perhaps one or two other members of the Committee are. I may have a Japanese fanaticism about certain issues, but I do not think that I am an obsessive. I made my point, with the generous assistance of my right hon. and hon. Friends, by dividing the Committee on the previous clause, and I am not sure that it would be in order for me to do so again on exactly the same issue. I shall, therefore, seek the Committee's leave to withdraw the amendments. In so doing, I may again be establishing a record in withdrawing 43 amendments simultaneously. I should like in a moment to to make a point in the clause stand part debate about the royal parks.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I can advise the right hon. Gentleman that he would be entirely in order to divide the Committee on the amendment, but I have to disappoint him in that he can withdraw only amendment No. 905 because that is the only one that has been moved.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I shall be brief. I raised this subject during an earlier debate in response to the hon. Member for Brent, East (Mr. Livingstone), who said that Westminster had not, in his view, always been wholly co-operative with its adjacett and neighbouring authorities.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ken Livingstone </B>(Brent, East): Or ever co-operative.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I take that sedentary intervention in my stride. When I responded to the hon. Gentleman, I mentioned that Westminster suffered from the discontinuity between the royal parks and the rest of the road network. I shall give an example because I am making a real plea on this matter. I recognise that the Government Departments that are represented in the Committee are not those that look after the executive agency which controls the royal parks. However, the agency is under the control of the Government.
<P>
In March 1998, the royal parks put forward a proposal to relax the four-hour limit on parking and introduce a discounted rate for long-term parking in Hyde park and Regent's park. That could hardly have been more contrary to the city council's policies or the Government's traffic management and parking guidance for London, as it would have encouraged commuter parking. The royal parks stated that their reason for putting forward the proposal was to maximise income. Local authorities cannot introduce parking policies simply as a means of raising income--parking charges must be based on policy objectives.
<P>
The proposals were dropped after widespread objections. The royal parks have recently introduced charges for parking on Sundays where there are no Sunday controls in surrounding streets. Better control and co-ordination of street works could be achieved if local authorities took over responsibility for royal parks roads--that has been highlighted by the recent closure of the Mall without due regard for the knock-on impact. The Royal Parks agency's proposals passed before two Ministers in the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, but were not halted at that point. This is a probing question under clause stand part to gauge the Government's thinking. The royal parks are not only in Westminster--they are in other boroughs, including the local borough of the Minister for London and Construction. Those boroughs must also suffer, to a degree, the disadvantages that are suffered by Westminster. With that, I rest my case.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> As the right hon. Gentleman pointed out, Transport for London will have no power over the royal parks and their roads. He is right that the changes to parking controls to which he referred caused anxiety not only for him but for my local authority of Camden. The power in such matters rests with the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. However, I understand that when the Royal Parks agency was planning the current work on the Mall it consulted Westminster city council, the highway authorities and the Metropolitan police.
965 966 I am perhaps reading too much into the right hon. Gentleman's contribution, but I take it to be a plea from the heart that the royal parks--or at least their roads--should he taken over by the GLA so that at least there will be one concise authority involved in the management of such affairs.
<P>
I understand the point that the right hon. Gentleman is making. He is not the only person who has made it on a 
wide range of issues, but I regret that in this case there is little that I can do other than sympathise.
<P>
Question put and agreed to,
