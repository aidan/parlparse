Turner</strong> (Kingston upon Hull East) (Lab):<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000558">&#160;</a>
                           </span> Before we
adjourned this morning, I was about to explain more about clause 52,
which places at the centre of Monitor’s role the obligation to
promote competition where appropriate. In my view, the changes in the
Bill, and the ideology on which they are based, pose a grave threat to
the national health service. Placing a statutory obligation on Monitor
to enforce competition creates a situation in which commissioners will
not be able to act in the best interests of their patients because of a
fear of costly legal challenges lurking in the
shadows.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000013">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Government’s approach to Monitor demonstrates how ill thought
out the plans are. In a clamour to roll back the state and to woo
private health care providers, the Government have set commissioners
off on a long and treacherous journey, without providing them with a
map. I am not alone in thinking that. David Owens, head of commercial
law at Bevan Brittan, has said
that<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000014">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“under
these reforms, commissioners would face a much greater risk of
challenge and potential tensions between what might be best practice
from a healthcare perspective and what a competitive market might
result
in.”<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000015">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>If
the Minister is not satisfied with a legal opinion, shall we take a
medical one? The British Medical Association has
stated:<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000016">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“There
is a risk that it will become difficult or impossible for commissioners
and providers to operate in the best interests of patients, for fear of
being open to frequent and costly legal challenges for anti-competitive
practices”.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000467">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Monitor’s
duty to enforce competition will lead us into a position in which
attention is diverted away from achieving high-quality care so as to
focus on competition. I am fundamentally opposed to taxpayers’
money being used for profiteering. Our emphasis should be
on the promotion of increased quality of patient care.
Commissioners and providers should compete on best quality, not on the
best profit margin, and that view is shared by
others.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000017">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It
is particularly symbolic that Monitor’s first duty under the
clause is to promote competition. That comes before any reference to
quality of standards in the entire chapter, even though quality is the
most important issue in the NHS. That sentiment is shared by many
interested parties. The Royal College of Nursing stated in its written
evidence to the Committee:<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000018">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="hs_brev">“This
issue of promoting and regulating competition must not hinder Monitor
from the most important issue of regulating a national health service

                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Health
care should not be treated in the same way as the privatised
telecommunications and energy industries; the gamble is too great, and
the outcomes far too important. Dr Hamish Meldrum, chairman of the BMA
council, stated that

                        <p class="hs_brev">“The
consequences of failure in healthcare are far more serious than in
other industries… The role of the regulator should not be to
enforce potentially damaging competition but to ensure comprehensive,
high quality care and to protect
patients.”<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000470">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

                        <p class="hs_brev">“One
of the strongest demands of patients, service users, their families and
carers is for ‘joined-up’ services. Patients want
continuous care, integrated around the patient—not, as now, to
get lost in the gaps, or to have to fight their way from one service to
another.”<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000471">&#160;</a>

                        <p>That
is yet another area in which the Government have over-promised and
under-delivered. The Government talked about integration in the White
Paper published last July, but they are failing to deliver, not
slightly but on a monumental scale. There is a basic contradiction
between competition and integration. The Bill does

                           </div>more to fragment services than it does to connect them. The proposed
regulatory framework will not support the delivery of more integrated
care.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000028">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Effective
relationships that have been built up over years through co-operation
and trust will be swept away in an outbreak of litigation and European
intervention. Litigation lawyers, as my hon. Friend the Member for
Leicester West rightly said, will be rubbing their hands at the
prospect of taking on this legislation. What happens when arrangements
between local provider and commissioner, which have worked so well in
the past, are subjected to anti-competition challenges? It is worth
reminding the Committee and the Government of what the experts have
said. Diabetes UK said
that<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000029">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“duties
to promote competition raise concerns about the impact this will have
on the delivery of integrated services, and on commissioners and their
ability to work collaboratively with other colleagues in the design and
commissioning of
services.”<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000472">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
am sure that the Health Secretary’s news release yesterday has
not escaped the Committee’s attention. In his desperate attempt
the shore up support following the widespread condemnation of his plans
at this weekend’s Lib Dem conference, the right hon. Gentleman
claimed that the reforms are essential for helping the long-term ill.
That is another spectacular contradiction. Integrated services are
essential for effectively managing people with long-term conditions.
The NHS-recommended model for long-term care is built on that evidence.
He was right to highlight the concern, although his remedy is
uninformed at best and disingenuous at
worst.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000030">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">If
well established and effective clinical pathways are broken up,
services and patient care will become fragmented and destabilised.
Those who will be affected most are the long-term ill, who take up some
70% of in-patient hospital
beds.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000031">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

                        <p>The

work against the integrated networks needed to ensure that the
long-term ill receive the services that they need and are entitled

logic of the reforms becomes even more confused in the context of the
Nicholson challenge. As we know, the NHS has the challenging task of
finding £20 billion-worth of savings. Many have argued that such
savings are impossible when implementing such a huge, top-down
reorganisation of the NHS, especially given that the Bill will drive in
a raft of new expenditures. As I understand it, giving Monitor the
power to promote competition includes the power to issue fines to GP
consortia and providers, including NHS
providers.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000034">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="hs_brev">“no

                        <p>As
Monitor stamps down its new economic regulatory regime, mistakes are
bound to be made. Litigation will result and continue for some time
afterwards. That means that budgets will be spent on paying fines for
breaching competition law instead of improving quality of care. Public
money will presumably be diverted away from spending on improving
quality to enforcing a regime that will drive down patient care,
fragment services and prevent commissioning in the interests of
patients. In order to deal with its new role, Monitor will need to
massively expand its staff, resulting in another substantial cost to
the public purse. That point is supported by Professor Chris Ham at the
King’s Fund, who has
said:<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000038">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“Monitor
will need to employ large numbers of economists, lawyers, accountants,
and managers to deal with competition issues, providers who fail, price
setting, licensing providers, and other work. Add to this the need for
Monitor to work hand in hand with the Competition Commission and the
Office of Fair Trading on competition, the Care Quality Commission on
regulation of quality, and the NHS Commissioning Board on price
setting, and the complexities of the proposed regulatory arrangements
become
apparent.”<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000475">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
proposal makes the Prime Minister’s declaration of war on red
tape another candidate to be added to a rapidly expanding list of
broken promises. If members of the Committee are not convinced by
Professor Ham, they need do no more than refer to the evidence
submitted by Help the Hospices, which
stated:<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000039">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="hs_brev">“The
new role for Monitor as the economic regulator for healthcare runs the
risk of creating an additional layer of bureaucracy for independent
charitable hospices, and that there is potential for duplication of
information required by Monitor and the Charity
Commission.”<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000476">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Another
unnecessary cost is not far away. The level of training that staff will
need is massive. William Sprigge made the point
that<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000040">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“everybody,
from the most senior to the front-line team will need to understand the
new risks and staff must urgently be trained in competition law. The
Directors of two NHS Foundation Trusts meeting to discuss the use of IT
in health service management, doctors employed by different trusts
meeting to discuss best clinical practice, and former administrative
colleagues now with different service providers meeting socially, must
all be made aware of the risks of discussing prices and how these
prices might move, however harmless the discussion may seem at the
time.”<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000477">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

is a pretty damning appraisal of the impact of the Government’s
new regulatory regime, and that is even without mentioning the fact
that price competition will also increase transaction costs, as
commissioners and providers will spend substantial time on negotiating
prices. I am grateful for the Committee’s indulgence in allowing
me to make such remarks. I have spent a fair time outlining the
objections of a host of professional bodies, but an appropriate
statement was made by the hon. Member for St Ives (Andrew George), when

the Bill is enacted, commissioners will not be able to act in the
interests of patients because of the risk of costly, legal challenges.
Quality will suffer as a focus on competition is preferred to improving
services. Make no mistake, the long-term ill will be denied access to
the integrated services they need and have a right to demand, while the
less frequent user will be left to navigate an expanding and confusing
health sector. The Bill groans under the weight of bureaucracy and
regulation, which will cost money to enforce and promote—money
that could be better spent on improving
quality.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000044">&#160;</a>

most worrying aspect of the Bill is the manner in which the Government
have ignored expert criticism. We see it in Committee today—they
have completely ignored the mood of expert opinion. The divide is
pretty stark: on the one side is National Voices, the Royal College of
Nursing, the Stroke Association, the Royal College of Surgeons, the
British Medical Association, the Foundation Trust Network and the Royal
College of General Practitioners; and, since this weekend, the Lib Dems
have been added to the list. On the other side is the Health Secretary
and private health companies, which are rubbing their hands, waiting
expectantly for their investment in him and his party to pay off. For
those reasons, I urge the Committee to follow the advice of
“Shirl the Pearl” and reject the Government’s

hon. Friend the Minister with his question about the “any
willing provider” provision in last year’s Labour
manifesto. The answer to his question is: because the former Government
introduced the policy. In the past 10 years, patient choice of provider
has been fundamental to the NHS and competition between providers has
been central to all the previous NHS reforms. Patient choice was
enshrined in the NHS constitution. How can there be choice without some
degree of
competition?<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000049">&#160;</a>

the Minister outlined this morning, competition under the previous

a level playing field. It has been pointed out that private providers
were given favourable pricing treatment and allowed to price their
service at 10% above the NHS tariff. It was a very bureaucratic model,

on a system of unfair competition to the NHS, the other point I was
going to make is that, in addition to the price benefit that private
providers had under the previous Government, they were allowed
guaranteed volumes as well. The present Government are trying to create
a regime where there is at least a level playing field between all
potential licensed providers of health care services.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000052">&#160;</a>

Member for Kingston upon Hull East talked about competition and
integration as though the two are mutually exclusive. They most
certainly are not—indeed, the Bill states that the tariff can
comprise two or more services, which together constitute a form of
treatment. That, by definition, means that there will be integration
enshrined in the legislation, and that there is a possibility for
providers to tender, for example, for a year of asthma care, rather
than just single episodes of care. There is therefore no conflict
between integration and
co-operation.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000053">&#160;</a>

see now, and which the Opposition are worried about seeing fragmented,

group of providers tendering together for—for example, in
diabetes care—a collaboration between primary care and hospital

care, there is nothing stopping the system of providing care that goes

looked into commissioning and contracting practices and assessed PCT
practices in relation to the patient’s right to choose—a
right that was enshrined by the previous Government and that the
current Government believe in. The panel found huge variations and the
worst cases of practices that restricted the patient’s choice of
provider via directives given to the general practitioners in their
patch, inserting anti-competitive restrictions into provider contracts,
activity caps, restrictions on procedures and—this is
amazing—locally negotiated prices below the national tariff. I
thought that Labour Members found that an anathema, but it was

King’s Fund<em>. </em>He rightly states that, although most
attention, including that of this Committee, has so far focused on the
Government’s plans for general practice-led commissioning
consortia, such changes are of secondary importance compared with the
proposals set out in part 3.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000072">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Part 3 seeks
to remove Monitor’s responsibility for regulating foundation
trusts and to turn it into an economic regulator with three core
functions: promoting competition, setting and regulating prices, and
supporting the continuity of services. As part of those functions,
Monitor will also have the power to license providers of NHS-funded
care. Part 3 also explicitly adds UK and European competition law to
the NHS—it will be in primary legislation—for the first
time. That was confirmed by the new chairman of Monitor, David Bennett,
and it will have significant implications, which I shall come
to.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000073">&#160;</a>

to explain the purpose of the changes, Chris Ham’s article
rightly points to a speech that I have mentioned before. “The
Future of Health and Public Service Regulation” was made in 2005
to the NHS Confederation by the then shadow Secretary of State for
Health. In that, he specifically invoked his experience as a civil
servant working with Norman Tebbit on opening up the telecoms sector.

                        <p class="tabbed">The
first fundamental question that I want to try to address is whether it
is right to seek to remodel the NHS along the lines of the gas,
electricity, rail and telecoms industries. The second is what the
consequences might be for what I argue is a very different system. The
goals of health care in the NHS are to save lives, reduce disability
and improve health, both physical and mental. Those are fundamentally
different from the goals of the utilities, which are to provide people
with gas or electricity, so that they have heat and light; the goal of
the railways, which is simply to get people from place to place; and 
<div class="columnNumber">

                           </div>the goal of telecoms, which is to ensure that people have access to
telephones, television, newspapers, the internet and so
on.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000078">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
note the slightly amused look on the Minister’s face, but if he
is seeking to base a regulatory system on one from a different sector,
we have to ask whether there are fundamental differences between the
two sectors. I argue that there is. The reason that health is so
different from those other sectors is that people’s health needs
and their ability to benefit from health services are far more
complicated than their need for gas, electricity, railways or telecoms,
and they are influenced by a much wider range of more complex
factors.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000079">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">People’s
health is influenced by some factors that are beyond their control. The
human genome project has increasingly shown that a person’s
genetic inheritance can have a significant impact on the likelihood
that they will develop a particular disease, and that it affects how
they will respond to different treatments. People’s health is
also influenced by factors within their control, such as their diet,
how much exercise they take and other lifestyle factors, such as
smoking. However, those lifestyle factors are in turn shaped by wider
social factors. We all know that there is clear evidence about the
links between health and poverty, levels of employment and equality of
housing. There is also interesting evidence that social networks can
influence health. Work by Robert Putnam on the amount of social capital
within society shows that the quality and range of links within
communities can affect the health of individuals and local
populations.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000080">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
health needs of individuals and local populations are far more
complicated than their need for utilities, telecoms or rail. Their
ability to benefit from health care interventions, and the priorities
that should be accorded to different groups, are far more complicated.
I emphasise that point because—as flows from that—the
nature of and the way services are provided in health are fundamentally
different from those of the
utilities.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000081">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
want to highlight five key differences. First, quality is far harder to
judge in health care than it is in the utilities or rail industries. It
is relatively easy to judge the quality of water, by testing for
impurities, and of a particular rail service, by assessing how many
trains arrive on time or whether there are enough seats on a journey.
Let us compare that to the difficulty of judging the quality of care
for someone with a mental health problem or a complex physical
condition, such as heart disease. In those cases, we have to assess the
effectiveness of a wide range of different interventions, including
preventive measures, the effectiveness of drugs, operations or other
treatments, and the amount and type of emotional and other support
received by the patient and their carers.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000082">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Many
different factors influence the outcomes of these services, which makes
judging that quality of care extremely difficult. For example,
different success rates for particular treatments and even different
death rates between hospitals can be influenced not only by the direct
quality of care being provided, but by the complexity of the case load,
as well as the person’s ability to benefit from that health care
intervention. In addition, judging the true quality of care may be
possible only many years after the operation or treatment has taken
place. This is completely different from judging the quality of the
gas, electricity or water a person receives, or the quality of
broadcasting or internet provision.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000083">&#160;</a>
                        </p> 
                        <div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 738<a class="bkMark" name="Column738">&#160;</a>
                        </div>
                        <p class="tabbed">The second
fundamental difference is that health services are far more interlinked
than services in the gas, electricity or telecoms industries. Those
industries can generally be broken up into quite discrete markets and
products which can then be regulated and monitored to improve outcomes
for consumers. For example, in telecoms, it is relatively easy to
separate the provision of fixed phone lines from mobile lines. I have a
different phone line provider for my mobile phone, occasionally used
for tweeting. There are also different products for home internet
provision and for digital TV channels.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000084">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In health
care, separating different services and monitoring them is far more
difficult. Patients need a more complicated range of services that
should be tailored to their specific needs. That is very different from
having a more standard set of products to choose for home telephone,
internet, television and so on. In health care services need to work
seamlessly together to deliver the best-quality care and to ensure that
patients do not fall through the gap. I would be the first to say that
in too many parts of the NHS we have not got that integrated care as
yet. We need to develop much closer working between services, for
example, by developing specialist cancer networks and integrating
community, primary and social care services for our increasingly ageing
population and patients with long-term
conditions.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000085">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
the King’s Fund rightly says in its briefing on this part of the
Bill:<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000086">&#160;</a>

                        </p>
                        <p>I would argue that
those were the areas where the previous Government brought some
competition into the system. That is simply a statement of fact. The
briefing
continues:<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000087">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="hs_brev">“In
other areas, competition may make it more difficult to commission
services that best serve patients' interests, for example where
partnerships are needed to ensure provision of seamless care between
providers of hospital and community services, or where—as with

wide geographical areas”.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000484">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The hon. Gentleman raises an important point. It
is difficult to separate services entirely. Both the Nuffield Trust and
the King’s Fund have stated that there is some evidence that in
niche markets in discrete areas competition can help to improve
quality. Many others would dispute that. A lively debate is going on
about the impact of competition, but they have found no evidence that
competition improves collaboration; in fact, the opposite. I am sure
that we will discuss this on later clauses, but I believe that
competition law could severely limit the potential for collaboration
between the different health care providers.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000090">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">On the point
about health services being much more interdependent and interlinked,
changing one aspect of the health care market can often have a
significant knock-on effect in other areas. For example, deciding to

                           </div>take a particular service, such as diagnostic services, out of a
hospital can have a knock-on effect on what else that hospital is able
to do. For example, the children’s heart surgery unit in
Glenfield hospital, in my constituency, is currently under review. I am
not mentioning that in relation to competition, but if that unit is
moved to Birmingham, there will be a knock-on effect on adult heart
surgery that is provided and on our fantastic extra corporeal membrane
oxygenation service, which was used during the swine flu
epidemic.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000091">&#160;</a>

saying that that is a result of competition, but I am arguing that
health services within organisations are interlinked. Bringing in a
model that seems to be based on the idea that services can easily be
separated, which is exactly what happened in the utilities and other
sectors, is the wrong approach.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000092">&#160;</a>

is what David Bennett, the new chairman of Monitor, in his latest
interview with <em>The Times</em>, has clearly said the Government are
doing, what the explanatory notes to the Bill say and what many
commentators think. In the Minister’s own words, he is trying to
create a genuine market and turn Monitor into an economic regulator. I
will not go over this
point.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000098">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
want to move on to the third difference between health and other
services, which is important because it determines how effectively an
economic regulator can work. The difference is that there is a smaller
number of providers in the utilities and telecoms industries. The
providers tend to dominate the market and act on a national or regional
level. It means that it is relatively easy for a national regulator to
have good information on each provider and to understand and to predict
much more easily the impact of a provider’s actions. In
contrast, there will be thousands of different providers in the NHS and
social care. A national regulator would somehow have to have detailed
knowledge about each individual provider as well as the health needs of
the local community to fully understand the impact of 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 740<a class="bkMark" name="Column740">&#160;</a>
                           </div>providers’ actions. It would be highly unlikely that Monitor
could achieve that unless it became a huge organisation with thousands
of staff working in every local community in the
country.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000099">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
complexity and inter-related nature of services leads to the fourth key
difference. It is far more difficult to set prices in health care than
it is in the utilities, rail or telecoms industries. Anyone who has had
the pleasure—perhaps that is not quite the best word—of
being involved in discussions about determining the NHS tariff for
different types of health care knows that it is a hugely complicated
process, and far more complex than setting prices for gas, electricity
or water. That is in part because of what I have mentioned about the
inter-related nature of health services, the fact that services need to
be tailored to particular individuals and the fact that an
individual’s ability to benefit from those services differs
widely.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000100">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
final difference between the utilities and telecoms industries and
health care is that the users of gas, electricity and telecoms are the
purchasers, but in health care, the commissioners are the purchasers,
and the Government want the commissioners to be GPs and, ultimately,
the state. Many GPs are closely attuned to their patients’
needs, but some of them do not always know what is in their
patients’ best interests. I have been a long-standing champion
for empowering patients with more choice, more information and a
greater say in their treatment and care, but even if the Government
deliver their promise of an information revolution, there will always
be what economists call asymmetries of information in health care. In
other words, there will inevitably be aspects of health care about
which providers know more than patients, meaning that patients must
rely on the judgment, skills and expertise of doctors and other
clinicians.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000101">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Government say that if patients do not like the services commissioned
by their consortium, they can move elsewhere, but that choice is simply
a fallacy in many parts of the country. In Leicester, for example, one
consortium will cover most of the city. Moving to a different
consortium in the county, for example, might be possible for people who
live on the edge of my constituency, but it would not be a choice for
the vast majority of patients. Relying on markets and competition alone
to drive up quality from the patient’s perspective is different
in health care from telecoms and other
industries.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000102">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The hon. Gentleman spies the issue immediately.
There are difficulties with setting a tariff. Some organisations say
clearly that we need to move to an entirely different approach. Rather
than trying to specify and price each tiny, individual bit of the care
pathway and then summing up the costs, they say, we should move to a
pathway approach. That might be difficult under competition law, as
different providers

			Column number: 741<a class="bkMark" name="Column741">&#160;</a>
                           </div>would have to give one another information about
what prices they are charging, which could be considered to be
collaboration.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000104">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There are
problems with both approaches, but if an economic regulator attempts to
set the price, along with the national commissioning board and in
consultation with commissioners, that is a complicated process, and it
cannot be compared with what happens in telecoms or other sectors. It
is far more complicated, which is another reason why the
Government’s approach is wrong. I have explained in detail why I
think health care is fundamentally different from utilities and
telecoms, which is why the Government’s approach in basing
Monitor’s powers along similar lines is not correct.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000105">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Moving to the
consequences of applying a fundamentally incorrect model to the NHS, I
do not want to stray beyond the scope of clause 52. We have already
debated Monitor’s role and the effect of bringing UK and EU
competition law into the NHS, so I shall simply touch on both those
issues. The first concern, which has been mentioned, is that under the
new system, GPs will be driven by Monitor’s duties and powers to
promote competition and by competition law, not by patients’
needs. Organisations including the British Medical Association and the
Royal College of General Practitioners are rightly worried that instead
of referring patients to their local NHS hospital or community service,
GPs could be forced to put most health services out to tender for fear
of being accused of breaking competition law. As someone who knows many
members of the medical profession, I know that that is what many GPs
are saying publicly and privately.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000106">&#160;</a>

pressure to apply competition rules could divert providers and
commissioners from their key task of designing and maintaining

difficult or impossible for commissioners and providers to operate in
the best interests of patients, for fear of being open to frequent and
costly legal challenges for anti-competitive
practices”.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000485">&#160;</a>

I heard the hon. Lady correctly, she suggested that one concern is that
GP consortia will be fearful about their normal referral patterns being
upheld in a situation in which the competition authorities require them
to put services out to tender. However, she was just talking about the
existence of tariffs and the need to ensure that those tariffs are
robust and effective in terms of pricing health services. She
understands, of course, that when there are tariffs and fixed prices,
there is no need to tender, because there is a price that is paid when
a service is

                        <p class="tabbed">I
shall give an example of why the provision will not necessarily
increase patient choice. Let us take community services. If a
commissioning consortium is required to put, for example, all the
district nursing or health visiting services in a particular area out
to tender, the likelihood is that the contract will be given to one
provider, which will not necessarily increase patient choice. As I have
already explained, if patients do not like the care on offer, they
cannot choose to move to a different consortium. Certainly my
constituents would not, because the Leicester consortium will cover the
whole
city.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000112">&#160;</a>

second major concern, to which several hon. Members have referred, is
that the Government’s proposals could mean that health care
becomes more fragmented, not less. I have already said that many people
who work in the NHS and many users and patients know that the situation
is difficult enough as it is. The hon. Member for Central Suffolk and
North Ipswich made the point about the problems with fragmentation in
the current system. In future, different parts of the patient pathway
could be contracted out to different organisations, which would make it
even harder for patients to navigate their way round the
system.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000113">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> In Suffolk, the needs of patients and the
available support groups for patients in the voluntary sector are
different in Lowestoft, Ipswich, Bury St Edmunds and Stowmarket. The
needs of those patients are different and the support groups available
are different. Is that not a reason to ensure that local health care
providers and the voluntary sector in particular are better recognised
and better
used?<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000114">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I agree that we could do far more to give
voluntary sector organisations a role, particularly in respect of the
support that they offer older people and those with long-term and
chronic conditions. If individual contracts are issued separately
across a patient pathway, that could make a situation that is not
always perfect worse, and I hope that the hon. Gentleman would
agree.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000115">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
shall go further and say that competition law could prevent
collaboration between services and stop developments that would improve
the quality of care. For example, many hospitals are considering how to
provide integrated care across primary, secondary and community
services—the terrible phrase in the policy jargon is
“vertical integration”. There is, however, concern that
they would have to put their plans on hold in case they were deemed to
be behaving anti-competitively. Another example is that hospital
doctors might be far less willing to get involved in redesigning
services with commissioners, either because they feared such
involvement and co-operation with their colleagues in primary care
could be deemed anti-competitive, or because shifting services out into
the community would risk their hospitals’ future
revenue.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000116">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
third major concern is about the impact of Monitor’s duty to
promote competition, and the proposal explicitly to add to primary
legislation, for the first time, the application of UK and EU
competition law to the NHS. There are concerns that commissioning
consortia 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 743<a class="bkMark" name="Column743">&#160;</a>
                           </div>simply will not have the necessary skills and experience effectively to
hold a far greater number of providers to account. We know, and I think
that this was mentioned by both the hon. Member for Stafford and my
hon. Friend the Member for Oldham East and Saddleworth, that many NHS
organisations have already struggled to strike effective deals,
particularly with large private providers that have the resources and
time to employ far greater numbers of lawyers, accountants and contract
managers.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000117">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
point that I really want to emphasise is the significant and serious
consequences of the Government’s plans to create a genuine
market in the NHS and to apply UK and EU competition law for the first
time. EU competition law applies to the behaviour of undertakings,
which the European courts have confirmed as any entity engaged in
economic activity. Currently, primary care trusts, in commissioning NHS
services, are not undertakings and are therefore not subject to
competition law. However, clause 6 clearly
states:<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000118">&#160;</a>

                        <p>and
the Minister confirmed this morning that as competition law is driven
throughout the NHS, commissioning consortia will be considered
undertakings. That is a fundamental change to the current situation,
and it means that commissioning consortia will face the full force of
EU competition law if become undertakings. Where competition law
applies, there are severe penalties for non-compliance. The Office of
Fair Trading, whose functions Monitor will take on in relation to
health services, can fine undertakings up to 10% of their turnover if
they are found to be in breach of competition law. Undertakings can
also be sued by third
parties.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000119">&#160;</a>

first being a somewhat technical one. As the hon. Gentleman will know,
the OFT and the Competition Commission will be merged by the Department
for Business, Innovation and Skills, but the legislation does not
appear to take that in account. It is not clear what that new
body’s functions will be, and how the original bodies’
powers will
change.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000121">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Secondly,
as the hon. Gentleman says, one of the key ways in which referrals can
take place is if there is collusion on pricing. The process by which
Monitor will set prices is unclear. It will not only have to talk to
the national commissioning board, but consult individual commissioning
consortia. There might be some concern that the process in the
legislation by which the tariff will be determined could itself be
challenged, because information will have to be shared not only between
Monitor and the national commissioning board but between Monitor and
commissioners on the ground. That is a legal minefield. There are
lawyers in the room; I am not a lawyer, but I have spent a great deal
of time

to get the OFT’s powers to look at collusion between providers,
and particularly whether there is a market that is not open to other
providers when a provider has a dominant position. Many of us can think
of an example in our own constituencies whereby a dominant provider has
closed the local hospital. It will no longer be up to duty
commissioners to determine what happens in future. It could be up to

because this is an important part of the Bill. In my constituency, an
independent provider wanted to tender for services against the big
incumbent trust, which did not make life easy for that provider.
Eventually, the independent provider was able to take over and produced
excellent results with huge cuts to waiting lists. Does the hon. Lady
think that the clause might improve the chances of such an independent
provider overcoming the kind of obstacles that were put in its
way?<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000125">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I believe that such decisions need to be
effectively managed and planned. If the local hospital loses a chunk of
its services to a different provider, that has consequences for the
income of the trust and whether it remains financially viable. It has
consequences for the remaining services within that trust. The hon.
Gentleman will know why people are so passionate about defending their
accident and emergency services. The A and E is linked to other
services. If the diagnostics go, can they do the operations? I have
always believed that there is a role for different providers in the
NHS. Indeed, I have championed that in the past, but it needs to be
done within a managed framework based on the best interests of
patients, not because a legal challenge is issued by a private
provider. Bearing in mind the impact that it can have on the hospital,
my concern is that the Bill—this is perhaps not the best analogy
in the world—lets the competition law cat out of the bag. When
that happens, it will not be clinical needs and patients needs that
will end up determining future decisions, but lawyers in court and
legal
precedent.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000126">&#160;</a>

My hon. Friend is making an excellent argument on a very important area
for the NHS. Is she aware that the primary work was done prior to the
Bill’s coming to Committee? The Office of Fair Trading published
a paper on the subject in July 2010, which built on the 2006 Serco
Institute and CBI paper “A fair field and no favours:
Competitive neutrality in UK 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 745<a class="bkMark" name="Column745">&#160;</a>
                           </div>public service markets”. That paper also indicates that the

of the consequences for different providers in the local health
economy, is
vital.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000128">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I move on to
the specific issue of EU competition law. The point also relates to
later clauses, so I do not want to stray beyond the issue too far. UK
competition law is obviously very closely modelled on EU competition
law. One of the Bill’s implications could relate to what we have
seen in the utilities sector, where foreign-owned companies, such as
German-owned E.ON UK and French-owned EDF, have come in to provide gas
and electricity. Those companies have been able to provide gas and
electricity in the UK, but our companies have not been able to go into
the European market to do so because they have not opened up those
markets to competition in the same way. Has the Minister taken any
legal advice on whether such a situation is possible in relation to the
health service under his proposed changes?<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000133">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Could the
Minister also tell the Committee whether he can guarantee that
commissioning consortia will have the skill and expertise necessary to
hold private providers to account? If so, will he explain how? Can he
also confirm whether commissioning consortia will be obliged to accept
tenders for goods or services from any operators in any other EU member
states, even those whose health care markets are closed to competition
from UK
suppliers?<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000134">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Hon.
Members will, I am sure, be glad to know that I am about to bring my
comments to a close. My fourth concern about applying the proposals to
the NHS is that driving competition through most parts of the NHS while
removing primary care trusts and SHAs could risk the sustainability of
many hospitals, particularly local district general hospitals. We have
covered most of those points already. However, the hon. Member for
Southport raised the issue about private providers cherry-picking
profitable services and leaving NHS hospitals to run more expensive and
complicated services, such as A and E. The BMA has raised that issue.
Its latest briefing on the Bill
states<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000135">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“Local
health services…may become destabilised if arrangements between
local providers and commissioners that have worked well in the past are
deemed anti-competitive by Monitor. Existing NHS services could be at
risk of closure, despite being popular with patients and delivering
high quality
care.”<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000487">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
I said, primary care trusts and strategic health authorities currently
manage the consequences of bringing different providers into the system
and ensure that the impact of individual contracts and of having
patients moved around the system does not threaten the financial future
of individual hospitals, or the health economy as a whole. However,
those bodies, of course, will be abolished by the Bill, which removes
the ability to manage the often significant consequences of patient
choice and diversity of provision.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000136">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As we have
said before in this Committee, it is unclear who, if anyone, will be
responsible for system management under Government plans. Will it be
Monitor, the NHS commissioning board or the commissioning consortia?
The Bill is unclear about how those different parts of the system will
work together. When PCTs and SHAs are abolished, who will have overall
responsibility for system management? If a service moves out of a
particular hospital, leaving it with major financial consequences, who
will be responsible for ensuring that that hospital is not
destabilised?<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000137">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Can
the Minister guarantee that, if commissioning consortia work together,
including with the NHS board—to reconfigure services, for
example—they will not fall foul of competition law? The
Secretary of State said on Sunday—and the Minister repeated it
this morning—that the Bill prevents any private provider from
cherry-picking services. That returns us to the point made by the hon.
Member for Stafford. If providers cannot compete on price, where is the
danger?<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000138">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">However,
ensuring that providers cannot compete on price will not, on its own,
prevent cherry-picking. In a competitive market, private providers can
choose which services they bid for, and they may well choose not to bid
for more complicated services, or for services for groups of patients
with more complex needs, because, as I explained, it is difficult to
guarantee the quality and care outcomes. Will the Minister tell us
precisely which clauses guarantee that the cherry-picking of services
will not happen under the legislation?<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000139">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">My
final point centres on increased costs under the new system. I think
that my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull East has already
quoted Chris Ham, who said
that<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000140">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“the
government’s proposals run the risk of replacing the bureaucracy
of performance management with the red tape of economic regulation.
Monitor will need to employ large numbers of economists, lawyers,
accountants and managers to deal with competition
issues”.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000488">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>The
Minister stated earlier that Monitor’s costs will increase by up
to six times, from £20 million now up to a potential £130
million in future. I would argue that it is not just Monitor that will
face increased costs. GPs and hospitals could also end up employing an
army of lawyers, accountants and managers to deal with the
Government’s NHS market. GPs and hospitals might also have to
take out expensive insurance against the risk of being fined, taken to
court or even sued because they fall foul of competition law. Far from
reducing the costs of bureaucracy, as the Government claim, the costs
of red tape will
increase.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000141">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
am sure that the Minister will not deny this—perhaps he
will—but if a model is to be applied to the NHS, an assessment
should be made of the new system’s likely costs, so that the
Minister can say what the likely costs are, not just for Monitor, but
for commissioners and providers of the new system. Has the impact
assessment looked at that and the costs of legal advice, insurance and
so
on?<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000142">&#160;</a>

have spoken for a considerable time and I am grateful to hon. Members
for their patience, if not their attention. These are serious issues. I
raise them not in jest or for scaremongering, but because they are
genuine concerns that have been raised with Opposition Members not only
by professional bodies, but by patient groups. The questions have been
raised in discussions that I have had with lawyers who are involved in
both competition law and the NHS. I am sure that the Minister will wish
to answer them as fully as
possible.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000143">&#160;</a>

Government have not, so far, talked about the broad range of changes in
anywhere near as much detail as their plans for GP commissioning.
Ministers may feel that they have done so in this Committee,
but I think it will be big news and a shock to members of the
public that the plan is to turn the NHS into the same system as applies
to gas, electricity, telecoms and rail. Government Members should
understand the real concerns about the fact that competition law in the
United Kingdom and the EU will apply to the NHS for the first time.
Some Conservative Members will be surprised that such a measure is in
the

                        <p class="tabbed">I remember
that you, Mr Hood, and I were members of a Committee in 1989 on the
privatisation of electricity. We were told by the Government of the day
not to worry because electricity would have third-party access
throughout Europe and we would be in a position where our electricity
would be able to go elsewhere, and we could buy in. In fact, my local
electricity company is run by a French state industry, which operates
several utilities in this country. The third-party access that was
talked about for ideological purposes never happened in a lot of areas
where our utilities were once public. All hon. Members should reflect
on such
issues.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000147">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
want to pick up on a number of things that have been said about the
past 10 years and the introduction of the independent sector into the
national health service, known as “competition” to some
people. It is certainly not the same competition as outlined in the
Bill. I will have a couple of questions to ask the Minister about the
Bill’s exact intention.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000148">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Many
independent contractors were brought in to undertake screening and the
immunisation against human papillomavirus under contracts with the
national health service. Where there was a change—designed by
the then Government, in my view, although I was not a member of the
Government at that time—was when a measure was introduced to
reduce waiting times inside the national health service and set targets
on areas of orthopaedic surgery. As a consequence, the Government
contracted with the independent
sector.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000149">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Some
people did not agree with those arrangements. I did. I felt that some
patient choices in my constituency a decade ago were unacceptable, such
as when a consultant would say to someone, “You can wait
two-and-a-half years for a new hip or a new knee or you can go to a
hospital in Sheffield and I will do it for you next week if you
have £3,500.” To get rid of such activity, the Government
had to create a capacity in the independent sector beyond what was
there—such as traditional hospitals, whether or not Bupa-led,
and others. They contracted with independent sector treatment centres
at an increased cost because such centres had capital to take into
account.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000150">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
many cases, such establishments had to be built. Ironically, when I was
on the Health Committee in the previous Parliament, we visited a
treatment centre that had been run by the national health service for
many years. However, in most district general hospitals, that did not
happen and the reason why we had long waiting times for orthopaedic
surgery was that people were in hospital waiting for an operation,
during which time there might have been an accident on the motorway and
so on.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000151">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The surgeons
would be taken away from such lists to deal with the emergencies and,
as a consequence, our constituents were knocked back. Even some who
were getting ready for surgery were sent back home and told to come in
another day. Some parts of the NHS got rid of that practice by having
designated areas in which people were guaranteed to have the operation
on the day they went in. I visited them and during the last Parliament,
the Health Committee took evidence on them.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000152">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It is true,
as the hon. Member for Stourbridge said, that some were contracted by
volume and were never met; I visited the one in north Derbyshire that
serves my constituency, which is on the Yorkshire-Derbyshire border.
One reason was that some GPs in the NHS were reluctant 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 749<a class="bkMark" name="Column749">&#160;</a>
                           </div>to refer their patients to an independent sector treatment centre. I
accept that entirely. I think that they were wrong; the public purse
paid for the centres, and they could have dealt with waiting times in
other surgeries. However, I accept
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000153">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Introducing
the independent sector into the NHS in that way is, however, a lot
different from introducing competition and competition law. Although I
am not a lawyer, I will give my view. The first phase of independent
sector treatment centres had some deficiencies, such as a lack of
training for young doctors. The Government got a number of similar
things wrong that they should have got right from day one. However,
phase 2 in South Yorkshire never took place. I was lobbied by the owner
of one of the two hospitals in Sheffield—I will not name which
one—to prevent phase 2, because the hospital was at about 50%
capacity at the time, and if the proposals went ahead, it would have
been competing with a treatment centre in 10 years’ time. Phase
2 never happened. The initiative was meant to drive down waiting times.
Phase 1 is still being used, and I think that it was the right and
proper thing to do.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000154">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">NHS patients
use the hospitals in Sheffield as well, when local hospitals cannot
deal with them in the time scales laid down. As a consequence, the
independent sector has been used directly by NHS patients. Personally,
I do not think that there is anything wrong with that. That managed
framework for using the independent sector is right and proper. What
worries me is what the future holds. We are introducing competition
under Monitor, which will have a statutory responsibility to promote
it. I am deeply worried about what might happen under the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000155">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The White
Paper published last July discussed Monitor’s scope and powers,
which are wider than what is suggested in the explanatory notes and
include competition. I hope that the Minister will listen to this. I
have some questions about what the White Paper says. Page 39, paragraph
4.28
says:<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000156">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“Like
other sectoral regulators, we propose that Monitor should have
proactive, ‘ex ante’ powers to protect essential services
and help open the NHS social market up to competition, as well as being
able to take ‘ex post’ enforcement action reactively. Ex
ante powers would enable Monitor, for instance, to protect essential
assets; require monopoly providers to grant access to their facilities
to third
parties”.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000489">&#160;</a>

would term—I am not a lawyer—a monopoly provider: St
Thomas’ hospital. What are the implications of that paragraph in

National Audit Office has published year-on-year figures for
procurement in the NHS. That happens in other sectors, too. There have
been one or two headlines in the past few weeks about how we have been
paying far more for NHS goods than we should be. I remember, more than
a decade ago, somebody buying syringe drivers in a hospital for about
£36 a set in October, but a set cost about £73 in March.
The hospital and the supplier were anonymised, but it was the same
hospital and supplier because they were getting rid of the money at the
end of the financial year. I agree with competition in such cases, but
I am not too sure why competition law is better than driving better
procurement in the NHS. I suspect that there are some cosy
relationships between people who buy for the NHS and the people
who supply
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000160">&#160;</a>

                        <p>Again,
I pose a question to the Minister. What is the implication of that?
What does it tell the Committee about whether competition law will be
involved in every aspect of health and social care in this
country?<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000162">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
have a brief from the NHS Confederation, which talks about competition
law. I briefly mentioned two aspects of competition law to my hon.
Friend the Member for Leicester West during an earlier intervention.
The brief states that it does not believe at this stage that PCTs are
involved in competition law when commissioning NHS services and would
not be subject to it. The paper rightly goes on to say that whether or
not commissioning consortia would be covered by such competition law
would depend on how things evolve in the
future.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000163">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">During
an earlier intervention, I said that such competition law is not only
UK-based, but EU and UK-based, which effectively means that any player
could be involved. I do not know whether EDF would want to own my local
hospital or have rights at my local hospital that it does not have now.
I do not say that in a scaremongering way. Given the powers that are
being given to Monitor, as outlined in the White Paper and the
explanatory notes, the Committee has every right to ask, before we go
any further with this aspect, about the implications for the NHS as we
know it.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000164">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It is one
thing to encourage the independent sector to improve the patient
journey and to give patients more choice—I accept that entirely
and support it—but it is another thing to say that Monitor will
have the right to regulate competition throughout all health care in
this country, although it will be dealing specifically with the NHS.
There are major implications for the future of the NHS, and I want to
know the answers to these
questions.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000165">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Will
third parties have the right to go to my local monopoly providers and
use facilities? That has happened for a long time with private patients
in NHS hospitals, but this provision goes far beyond that. I hope that,
before we conclude this clause stand part debate, the Minister will
answer some of these
questions.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000166">&#160;</a>

in managed frameworks, as now. People can grumble about GPs, and I have
grumbled about what some GPs are and are not doing in using the
independent sector. We are talking about a publicly paid-for facility,
never mind who owns it. That seems to be a relevant argument, and it is
entirely different from turning around and saying that competition law
will apply and that lawyers will come in and argue whether facilities
should be used by
individuals.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000167">&#160;</a>

have deep concerns about that, and I hope that the Minister can satisfy
the Committee that we will not see the end of the type of national
health service that we have seen before. The previous
Government—rightly so in my view—used the strength of the
wider health care system in this country to improve the lot of
patients. I do not necessarily think that a fully competitive market
will do that. Indeed, while looking round the world at health care
services during my time on the Health Committee, I realised that there
was no better place for equitable health care than in this country. The
20% of people who could afford it might get better care in places such
as America, but there is no more equitable health service than this
country’s—none is better funded and ours asks nothing of
someone when an ambulance comes to pick them up on the street. I hope
that powers will not be given to Monitor that will lead to people being
asked whether they can afford health care when an ambulance comes to
pick them
up.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000168">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I support the arguments that have been
forcefully and eloquently made by my right hon. and hon. Friends, and I
will try not to repeat them. The key issue with clause 52, which goes
to the heart of the Bill, is the change in the role of the independent
regulator of NHS foundation trusts. It will, instead, carry out the
duties and functions of an economic regulator for the markets funded by
the NHS. As we have heard, its sphere of activity will be to promote
competition, using Office of Fair Trading powers to apply competition
law to the commissioning of both private and—while they
last—public providers and, indeed, social care. There has been a
well-reported, alleged U-turn on price competition within the health
service. Opposition Members are eagerly waiting that being actually
transcribed into the Bill. I will return to that point, and I hope that
the Minister can clarify certain points about price
competition.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000169">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Monitor
will treat patients as consumers of health services. As clause 52 sets
out, Monitor’s role is

Opposition Members, it seems that Monitor’s three core
functions, which are to promote competition where appropriate, to
regulate prices for NHS-funded services and to support the continuity
of services—that definition is from the House of Commons
Library’s briefing—are somewhat in conflict with one
another. In our first evidence session, we heard from Chris Ham of the
King’s Fund, who is often quoted by Opposition Members, who set
out the importance of this part of the Bill. He said that<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000171">&#160;</a>

must be serious concerns about how Monitor will carry out its duties
and what it will decide that its duties are. As the Bill stands, we
have only broad-brush responsibilities and Ministers’ stated
intentions to guide us. As with previous clauses, there is a lack of
explicit detail. Much of the changes and the intent are implied, and we
would like that detail incorporated into the Bill. However, we
fundamentally disagree with the
clause.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000173">&#160;</a>

have already discussed amendment 479, which would have expanded
Monitor’s main duty, which is to protect and promote the
interests of people who use health care services, but would have
removed its rather broad duty to promote competition where appropriate,
through regulation where necessary, in relation to its main duties. My
hon. Friend the Member for Leicester West quoted the new chair of
Monitor, Mr David Bennett. In an interview in <em>The Times</em>, he said
that there is competition in power, rail, water and telecoms and
experience in tackling monopolistic and monolithic markets and
providers and in using economic regulation, and that that is how it
should work in the NHS. There is a clear conflict between what the new
chair of Monitor is saying and what the Minister is saying. That point
of view is utterly out of step not only with the Opposition’s
view, but with those of the BMA and the general
public.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000174">&#160;</a>

said:<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000178">&#160;</a>

fact that two arm’s length, unelected bodies—Monitor and

be rid of any notion of Monitor promoting competition, especially when
competition is undefined in the Bill. None of us knows how Monitor will
interpret its responsibilities. It is disingenuous for Ministers to
speculate about its intentions. Such speculation may turn out to be
completely wide of the

my hon. Friends have said, the clause goes to the heart of a Bill that
puts health on a par with a commodity. Not only is that against the
current constitution, the values of the NHS and what the NHS stands
for, but it is contrary to the principles on the rights to health and
to health care that are set out in the European convention on human
rights. On top of that, because the Bill treats health as a commodity
and not as a right, it is a natural hypocrisy to suggest that some of
the structures that have been developed in the Bill will ensure that
politics is kept out of the NHS. It is that, however, which absolutely
drives the development of Monitor. Evidence suggests that the aim of
improving quality in health care is not helped or supported by
competition. At a systems level, competition does not improve quality
in health care, and there is strong evidence about that. As the Bill
will legally oblige Monitor to promote competition between providers,
it is absolutely contrary to the assertion that we are getting politics
out of the NHS.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000186">&#160;</a>

                           </div>care. The BMA has said that the Bill will lead to an increase in the
fragmentation of services. We have heard in detail about the
application of competition law and how that will divert resources from
what should be the focus of the NHS—to provide high-quality
care. There is a legitimate fear from both commissioners and providers
about anti-competitive practices being open to legal
challenges.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000187">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">If Monitor
deems practices to be anti-competitive in spite of NHS services working
well and delivering high-quality care, such services will have to be
put out to legal tender. That would lead to instability and disruption
in health services, or at worst, health services could risk closure.
The BMA has stated that we—and Monitor, if that is what we end
up having—should be trying to ensure that the NHS is about
caring for patients through co-operation, not competition. If this is
about ensuring that a holistic, whole-systems approach to treatment and
care is taken, that requires collaboration, and many medical

should promote both the concept and constitution of the NHS as a
socially-owned, democratically accountable organisation, through which
society collectively promotes and provides health care on the basis of
need, not the ability to pay. That is not currently advocated in
Monitor’s duties. To that end, Monitor should ensure that
organisations that provide health care are underpinned by such values,
and I hope that the Government will consider that point. Monitor should
promote collaboration, not competition, and it certainly should not
undermine NHS values. On the current basis, however, Monitor is bound
to do just that.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000189">&#160;</a>

from the Minister today, in respect of this crucial clause. It has been
good in parts; my right hon. Friend the Member for Rother Valley had
answers to some of his questions about the extent to which we will see
unbridled competition in the NHS. We heard a very clear exposition from
the Minister on how that will work, and I will come back to that in a
moment. It was bad—rotten—in that we did not receive any
greater clarity about price competition and the extent to which it is
the driving force behind creating an economic regulator. We have heard
lots of warm words about the fact that quality, rather than price, will
drive competition. Truthfully, though, those warm words are leaving us,
and people outside the Committee, more confused about the
Government’s
intentions.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000190">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I notice that the hon. Lady did not come back to
rebut the point that the words “price competition” were
in the mouth of the Minister of State, the right hon. Member for
Chelmsford, only a couple of months ago. We have also heard from the
right hon. Gentleman that genuine competition was going to be the key
driver of reform in the NHS.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000195">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We are not
the only ones who are confused. Many organisations, such as the British
Medical Association, which is representative of doctors’
opinions, and many lay readers are confused about what the Government
intend. Were this straightforward, price-driven, commercial
competition, red in tooth and claw, we would understand it. Instead it
is morphing into a hybrid whereby competition law and its commercial
underpinnings are the arbiter of performance in the NHS, with price
competition somehow not being a part of it. As someone who has worked
in the private and public sector, that seems to me to be a curious
market.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000196">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Let
me move on now to answer the hon. Lady’s second point. It is an
extremely narrow definition of privatisation in the NHS to suggest that
it is about the charging of individuals, consumers, for receipt of NHS
services. No one is suggesting that the Bill will lead overnight to
members of the public being charged for NHS services. Let me go even
further. No one is suggesting that the Bill instantly leads to the
privatisation of the NHS. What it does, however, is lay the foundations
for gradual, creeping erosion of the public provision of NHS services
and allows a challenge to the NHS by private providers, through the
opening up under competition law. On that question, the cat has been
let out of the
bag.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000197">&#160;</a>

the Minister said this morning was so interesting that, sad individual

marvellous though it is, could not report it in time, and I know that
the Minister sometimes worries that he is misrepresented, so I concede
that this is my transcription of his words, not that of <em>Hansard</em>.
However, I am sure that it is pretty accurate.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000198">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The Minister
said, “Another hon. Member mentioned the whole question of EU
and British competition law. Can I just say that the Bill does, with
regard to this area, simply add ‘Monitor’ as an
enforcement body? The OFT already has these powers in respect of the
health care sector, and the Bill itself does not introduce any new
competitive law or extend the applicability of current EU and UK
competition legislation. However”—this is the key
point—“as NHS providers develop and begin to compete
actively with other NHS providers and private and voluntary providers,
UK and EU competition laws will increasingly become applicable. The
safeguards offered by these laws will therefore apply equally to all
providers.” Yes, the safeguards will apply, but so too will the
threat; so too will the prospect that decisions on commissioning and
tendering will be challengeable under EU law. The Minister went on to
say what had happened under the Labour Administration, when only 5% of
the NHS budget was going to private providers. Why is it
different?<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000199">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The Minister
said, “In the health-care sector currently, we have a situation
where 90% of health care provision is being delivered by public
providers fulfilling a largely social function. Organisations
fulfilling a purely social function are not for profit and are not
considered to fall within the definition of undertakings, and therefore
are not subject to European competition rules. Markets have only been
developed in certain limited sectors over the last decade. However, in
a future where a large majority of providers are likely to be
undertaking for the purposes of EU competition law, this law will
apply.” That goes to the heart of the difference between what
pertained under the Labour Administration in respect of the entry of
private providers into the NHS and what will pertain under the new
regulations.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000200">&#160;</a>

radically different from this Bill. The result of that was that only 5%
of the NHS budget was ever in the hands of private providers. The
difference here is that we are talking about opening up the whole of

that. Once it has been opened up, it is hard to imagine how lawyers
will ever be able to unpick it. Competition will be completely
disruptive. This is an NHS that is not built on commercial law, where
doctors do not have experience of operating within a competition
framework, and where the new consortia, let alone the existing PCTs, do
not have the requisite expertise to make decisions on whether their
commissioning decisions are in line with or at odds with EU competition
law. At the very least, as the hon. Member for Stafford said earlier,
it will create concern in the minds of GPs. We can go much further: it
will inevitably lead to risk-averse decisions, to tendering for
services on an open market and to advertising in the <em>Official
Journal of the European Union</em> or elsewhere, for fear of falling
foul of European competition law.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000210">&#160;</a>

risk-averse behaviour, will come inordinate increases in
costs—that is inevitable. There will also be inordinate
increases in the training costs that will be borne by the NHS providers
in order to insulate themselves. One of the big changes that anyone who
works in the private sector will have seen in the past decade is the
growth of compliance officers and lawyers around procurement, precisely
to shield companies from falling foul of aggressive interventions by
competitors under European competition law. That is precisely the sort
of defensive behaviour that the NHS will have to undertake if it is
operating in this sort of framework. Litigation costs, training costs
and so on are all bound to increase.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000211">&#160;</a>

competition lawyer operating on behalf of a private provider referring
to a “cosy cartel of care” when seeking to break up a
long-established, locally welcomed and arguably effective integrated
care pathway. One man’s cosy cartel of care is another’s
carefully calibrated, integrated, locally respected care pathway. That

                           </strong> I am suggesting that that is my interpretation of
what the Minister said earlier, and I think it is legitimate. In the
past, and under the current rules, health and social services have been
excluded from EU competition law and its UK legal framework, which I
believe is the public services procurement regulations 2006, because
they have been designated part B services. They have been
state-protected, publicly provided services, so the bits for which the
NHS has had to competitively tender have been things such as providing
wastepaper baskets or other non-clinical services. However, the very
clear implication of what Minister said was that once there are
multiple providers in a system, that system is inevitably opened up to
scrutiny under EU competition law, and that both NHS and private
providers and will be subject to that. If I am wrong and the Minister
was not implying that, I would welcome some
clarity.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000215">&#160;</a>

naively; they have been engaged in testing the extent to which states
can protect and proscribe health services from the full rigours of EU

that protection. The inevitable consequence will be the disaggregation
and fragmentation of the NHS—the ending of a national service.

conscious that I have been speaking for a long time, so I will conclude
by returning briefly to the issue of price competition and making a
plea for the Minister to clarify what is going on in that respect. Are
we witnessing a volte face, a change of mind by the Government? Have
they read Carol Propper’s paper and looked at the other evidence
and decided that price competition is a bad idea because the evidence
suggests that it drives down quality? Or are we witnessing sleight of
hand—the Minister and others suggesting that there will not be
competition on price when in reality there will, which is why an
economic regulator is needed to deal with
it?<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000222">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">If
there is to be competition only on quality, I have two more questions.
First, what competence does Monitor have to judge quality of health
care provision? Monitor will be full of lawyers and accountants, not
clinicians, so how can it be the arbiter of quality in the national
health service?<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000223">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Secondly, if
quality is the principal driver of competition, why on earth are we
going to subject the NHS to competition law? Why can we not continue
with the status quo that protects the NHS? The Care Quality
Commission’s various committees are peopled by doctors and
clinicians, so why can it not act as the arbiter of quality instead of
Monitor? If quality is the driver, why not employ people who know
something about quality in the NHS to make those judgments? Why employ
a bunch of economists and lawyers to do that for
us?<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000224">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Clause 52 contains the most important measure
in the Bill because it enshrines competition and gives it primacy. The
duty on the economic regulator to promote competition “where
appropriate” is common to other regulated sectors in the UK, and
is stipulated in clause 60. Ofcom, the regulator for the communications
sector, has a similar obligation and a concurrent power with the Office
of Fair Trading to enforce the Competition Act 1998.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000225">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">When speaking
to <em>The Times </em>recently, Dr David Bennett, the newly-appointed
head of Monitor, said that the UK’s experience in privatising
and splitting up the gas, power, telecoms, rail and water
industries,<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000226">&#160;</a>

                        <p>would produce many
benefits that could be replicated in the NHS. Yet the NHS Alliance said
that those comments were “simply wrong”. According to its

                        <p class="tabbed">However, it is
not Mr Bennett who makes the argument for competition in the NHS; it is
in the Bill and, specifically, in the clause. Under clause 52(1)(a) and
(b), it is absolutely clear that Monitor’s function is<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000228">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

                        <p>By
introducing a blanket imposition of a market philosophy, it is clear
that competition will almost certainly reduce commissioning
effectiveness. The privatisation of the utilities industry was based on
the dynamic of supply and demand, with excess supply being key to
regulating the market’s economics. In the health care system,
especially considering the NHS’s limited resources and the
complexity of patient care, that analogy becomes flawed, to say the
least, and extremely dangerous to the future of the NHS.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000229">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Monitor will
have a large role in the NHS under the changes that are outlined in the
clause. Undoubtedly, competition is embedded within the clause and the
entire Bill. When he took up his new role at the beginning of March, Dr
Bennett wrote a letter to foundation trusts in which he said that he
wanted Monitor to become<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000230">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“an exemplary
economic regulator, building on lessons from other sectors and making
sound decisions in an open and transparent way based on dialogue,
widespread consultation and rigorous, fact-based
analysis.”<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000508">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>The
measures under the clause create the risk, however, that the Government
will replace the perceived bureaucracy of performance management with
the red tape of economic regulation. They will demand that Monitor
employ undoubtedly large numbers of economists, lawyers, accountants
and managers—whose numbers will grow over time—to deal
with competition issues, providers who fail, price setting, licensing
providers and other work.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000231">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
complexities of the regulatory arrangements become apparent when we
consider that Monitor will also need to work hand in hand with the
Competition Commission and the Office of Fair Trading on competition,
the Care Quality Commission on regulation of quality, and the NHS
commissioning board on price setting. It will be a hugely powerful
empire within the NHS and a wholly new bureaucracy. It will spend
public money with the sole purpose of ensuring a market, not of
ensuring quality, nor of maintaining frontline services. It will
necessitate huge amounts of power and personnel to police a competitive
system that runs counter to all received wisdom within health economics
since Arrow in 1963.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000232">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">What could be
more counter-intuitive to the Government’s hailed liberation of
the NHS than an NHS reorchestrated for commercial purposes? Price
competition in health care is not the route to take, even though it has
brought gains in other sectors. Peter Smith, who is one of
Britain’s most respected health economists, recently conducted a
review for the OECD. He found that evidence on the benefits of
competition is equivocal and underlined the challenges in applying
market principles successfully. The review concluded that effective
implementation of market-type mechanisms is likely to require
considerable managerial skills and impose substantial transaction
costs, particularly on purchasing and regulatory institutions. Links to
markets have given rise to the argument that there should be increased
collaboration between providers in many areas 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 761<a class="bkMark" name="Column761">&#160;</a>
                           </div>of care—including the provision of specialist cancer and cardiac
services through networks and care for people with chronic
diseases—through the integration of primary and secondary
care.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000233">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Lessons from
the experience of applying market principles in the NHS since the 1990s
also need to be heeded. In a highly visible public service such as the
NHS—the nearest thing we have to a national religion, according
to Nigel Lawson—it will always be difficult for politicians to
distance themselves from controversial matters such as reducing access
to hospital services when providers fail to compete successfully, even
if those decisions are taken by the regulator, Monitor.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000234">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In that
respect, as in many others, health care is different from the former
publicly owned utilities, underlining political and technical
challenges and adapting lessons from one sector to another.
Furthermore, competition in the health care sector is different to that
in other regulated sectors. In most regulated sectors, consumer choice
is now taken for granted, but it is a relatively new concept in the
NHS. In other sectors, the consumer pays for the service they receive,
but in the NHS the service is free at the point of delivery and paid
for only indirectly via taxation. Therefore, the scope for price
competition is more limited. The promotion of competition in health
care and social care services may focus on those areas where patient
choice can be viably introduced, and thus where there is
competition—at least non-price competition—in the market.
That includes an increasing range of elective, diagnostic and other
services. Measures currently promoting competition in the NHS include
the Primary Care Trusts (Choice of Secondary Care Provider) Directions
2009. Monitor will also set the objective of making best use of limited
NHS and adult social care resources, and there will be a difficult
balancing act between short-term austerity measures, and the
longer-term perceived benefits of choice.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000235">&#160;</a>

examination of the consequences the new body will create, and I will
speak specifically about how it must act as an agent in relation to
competition law. Choice is surely not appropriate for services such as
emergency ambulance admissions to A and E, where referral to a local
provider is automatic. However, competition for the market may still be
promoted, for example by requiring that transparent affair procurement
procedures are followed before the A and E providers are commissioned
in a particular area for a specified period. It is not yet clear how
far the promotion of competition in the market will be considered
appropriate within the NHS, and I hope that the Minister will provide
an edifying response to my question on that.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000237">&#160;</a>

will give Monitor concurrent powers to enforce competition law in the
UK health and social care sectors. The scope of those powers is
therefore broader than its licensing powers, which are limited to the
licensing of providers of NHS-funded services. Monitor will have the
power to enforce the Competition Act 1998 against the full
range of health care providers in relation to their NHS, private health
care and social care activities. In addition, Monitor will have the
power to carry out market studies and refer dysfunctional markets in
the health and social care sector to the Competition Commission for
investigation. That power has been used in other sectors by the Office
of Fair Trading to refer the groceries sector, for example, or

                        <p class="tabbed">Historically,
the Office of Fair Trading has been reluctant to get involved in
investigating conduct relating to NHS-funded services, as health care
provision has always been based on quality and not purely on price. The
co-operation and competition panel was tasked with advising Monitor and
the Department of Health on anti-competitive practices by NHS providers
and commissioners, further to “The principles and rules for
cooperation and competition”, the code of conduct drawn up by
the Department of Health. Compliance with the PRCC is encouraged by the
threat of directions imposed by the Secretary of State, against NHS
acute trusts and PCTs, or of licence enforcement by Monitor, against
NHS foundation trusts. The PRCC, therefore, currently exists in
parallel with the competition law
rule.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000240">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Conferring
concurrent competition powers on Monitor marks a departure from the
PRCC and a move towards embracing the application of a more coercive
and independently enforced competition law in the NHS-funded health
care sector. It seems likely that, in time, the clause will undermine
the PRCC, and one can conclude only that the code will be disbanded in
favour of guidance on the application of competition and procurement
law in the
sector.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000241">&#160;</a>

uncertainties remain. Competition law will apply only to the activities
of undertakings, as defined in UK and EU case law. That definition
encompasses the activities of bodies that operate on economic markets.
Assuming patient choice expands and competition is promoted, there will
be an increasing array of NHS markets and thus increased scope for the
application of competition law to both primary and secondary care
services. It seems likely that the move towards concurrency will
simplify the UK rule framework by removing the need for the PRCC. It
will safeguard the promotion of competition, given the severity of the
potential sanctions for competition law breaches, which include fines
of up to 10% of the turnover of the undertakings involved. Competition
will have absolute primacy over quality.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000242">&#160;</a>

be able to consider factors that may put particular providers at a
relative disadvantage, and make proposals to the Government or the NHS
commissioning board to ensure that any differences are fair. One of the
challenges faced by Monitor in promoting competition in the health care
sector is that the types of provider that will be competing in the new
markets have very different characteristics, and that might help or
hinder their ability to compete fairly. A case in point is the current
restriction on a foundation trust’s ability to provide services
to private patients. That restriction is to be relaxed considerably
under the reforms in the Bill, and foundation trusts will thus be
encouraged to find new sources of income from private patients. That
undermines the principle of “free at the point of use,”
and might increase waiting times for non-private
patients.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000243">&#160;</a>

independent sector might question some of the advantages enjoyed in the
market by, for example, foundation trusts. Such advantages might
include not only a position of incumbency but access to NHS staff
pensions and NHS insurance cover. As a result of the clause, the need
to ensure a level playing field will have to be viewed in the context
of the debate on ensuring competitive neutrality in mixed
public-private markets. The OFT published a paper on that subject in
July 2010, building on a 2006 paper written by the CBI and the Serco
Institute, entitled “A fair field and no favours—
competitive neutrality in UK public service markets.” The heath
care sector is one of the sectors in which the inherent advantages of
certain players in the market might lead to competitive
distortions.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000245">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
Bill notes that the Government are to introduce legal duties on the NHS
commissioning board and on commissioners to promote choice, to act
transparently and in a non-discriminatory manner in commissioning
activities, and to prohibit agreements or other actions that restrict
competition. Monitor will have the power to investigate and remedy
complaints about procurement decisions or other anti-competitive
conduct.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000246">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Commissioning
and procurement is another area that is currently regulated by the PRCC
and the CCP, as well as by strategic health authorities. Current CCP
rules state that any providers unhappy with a tender process must
pursue a complaint to the strategic health authority, with a right of
appeal to the CCP. Under public procurement law, health care is a part
B service, as my hon. Friend the Member for Pontypridd elucidated, and
therefore is not subject to the full rigour of the Public Contracts
Regulations 2006. Regulation 4 imposes a duty on contracting
authorities to treat economic operators equally and in a
non-discriminatory and transparent way, and EU law principles require
an advertised tender process where there is a cross-border effect: for
example, where a non-UK provider would be interested in the tender.
Those legal principles are enforced

                           </div>by the courts, but their application to NHS health care services has not
yet been tested. However, it will be if the clause passes into
law.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000247">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As with
competition law, the principles and rules for co-operation and
competition relating to commissioning currently operate in parallel
with public procurement law rules. There will therefore be a growth in
new legal rules and duties to be enforced by Monitor. The Bill will
cause Monitor to metamorphose into a leviathan. The possibility of
bringing a direct action in the courts under the generic public
procurement rules will remain.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000248">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The Minister
must also be mindful that care is taken to ensure that the new
commissioning rules are consistent with public procurement law, given
the need to avoid confusion and given the supremacy of EU law. One key
issue will be how market entry can be controlled fairly and
transparently. How will private providers gain access to markets that
have traditionally been the preserve of NHS trusts? How will foundation
trusts with a national reputation secure out-of-area referrals if
directed by Monitor, paying heed to EU competition law? How will such
practices encourage collaborative relationships between primary and
secondary care?<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000249">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">If Monitor
wants to enable price competition below a regulated tariff cap, tenders
will probably be needed, as the patient will not be influenced by price
in making his or her choice. Again, that demonstrates the patient
alienation at the heart of the clause and the Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000250">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In other
areas where competition for the local market is a possibility, open
tender procedures may be needed before contracts are placed: for
example, with a provider of A and E services. That might be subject to
exemptions where, for example, only one capable provider is
available.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000251">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
Government’s proposals on mergers are equally radical. It is
envisaged that the Office of Fair Trading and the Competition
Commission will have sole responsibility for investigating mergers in
health and social care. Under current law, Monitor, in relation to
foundation trust mergers, and the Secretary of State for Health, in
relation to NHS trust mergers, investigate and approve mergers with the
advice of the CCP on the competition implications, which has led the
CCP to develop complex merger control analysis for NHS mergers, without
any statutory basis for assessing the competition implications of
mergers between NHS
bodies.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000252">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Given
that the Enterprise Act 2002 does not expressly take into account the
specific characteristics of the health sector, the clause applies law
unsuitable to health. Therefore, amendments to the Enterprise Act are
needed before it can be applied to health. In particular, such
amendments should seek to ensure that the full range of NHS providers
are subject to the merger control rules and that the Secretary of State
for Business, Innovation and Skills, not the Secretary of State for
Health, will be able to intervene in health care mergers on public
interest
grounds.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000253">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Although
the OFT has been involved in reviewing many mergers in social care and
private health care, it has not yet considered mergers involving NHS
health care trusts, which we will discuss in a later clause. That will
change under the new rules in clause 60. My question to the Minister is
this: will the definition of an enterprise under the Enterprise Act
encompass NHS trusts and GP partnerships and consortia? If so, it will
highlight the fact that GP practices are effectively small businesses,

implications of consolidation in that area. It is another

current roles of Monitor and the Secretary of State in relation to

fully understand that. Opposition Members’ numerous and lengthy

been raised by different hon. Members, and it would be helpful if I
explain how I intend to make my contribution. I will seek to answer as
many of the questions that hon. Members posed, without taking
interventions, so that we keep to the point and do not start going down
cul-de-sacs. The answers will be in order of contributions given by
hon. Members, so they may not always be symmetrical. I beg indulgence

                        <p class="tabbed">It would not
be useful or helpful for me to reiterate what the clause does.
Opposition Members have a viewpoint considerably different from mine,
and I suspect I will never convince them, because I do not think they
want to be convinced. To be frank, I find some Opposition suggestions
and views rather suspect vis-à-vis what is actually in the Bill.
That is a point of argument or disagreement.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000257">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I would like
to start by agreeing with the hon. Member for Leicester West. She went
into considerable detail, saying basically—and then
elaborating—that health is different from Ofgem, utilities and
so on. I could not agree more; she is absolutely right. Health is very
different from utilities. Quality is hard to judge in health, in the
way that she mentioned. One cannot split up service providers; there
are too many local providers; it is very difficult to set prices; and
purchasers are not users but commissioners. In that respect, there is
agreement. I have certainly never had any intention of treating the
health service as if it were a utility. It just does not work like
that. I hope the hon. Lady is reassured in that respect. However much
it may pain her, we do agree that health is different. The details need
to be different, and one size certainly does not fit all.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000258">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As the
explanatory notes show, we have taken elements where appropriate from
other regimes. Where it is not appropriate, we have customised the
details, such as the special administration regime, to take fully into
account the different situation, circumstances, mechanisms and
mechanics of the NHS. It is true that quality is hard to judge in
health, which is the first point that the hon. Lady made in
illustrating the point. Our plans will radically increase transparency
about outcomes, which is why there will be fixed prices, so competition
is on quality.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000259">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Regarding the
second point that the hon. Lady made, it is not true that regulation is
harder with more providers. Competition works better with more
providers and leads to less work for regulators to tackle
anti-competitive behaviour. She also said that it is difficult to set
prices. Again, I would agree that it is. Setting prices is an

said that competition law would prevent vertical integration by
providers. If I cannot assure her, I tell her that that is not the
case. Competition law does not prevent a provider from expanding its
range of services. Indeed, patient choice and competition on quality
would strengthen incentives for providers to work together in
integrating services when that would improve
quality.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000263">&#160;</a>

hon. Lady also said that commissioners—GP consortia—will
become undertakings for the purposes of competition law. Commissioners,
when purchasing services for the purpose of the NHS, will not be acting
as undertakings. GP practices, when competing for services as
providers, will be acting as undertakings and that is exactly the same
position as now. She said that Monitor would be an economic regulator
like telecoms and gas, but that health was different.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000264">&#160;</a>

underlying legal principles of economic regulation are the same, and we
have drawn on them to help with the Bill. However, of course, as I said
earlier, health is fundamentally different from telecoms and the

a result. That is exactly why we have a dedicated regulator with the

competition is always in a patient’s interest, bound by the

“managed framework” is too often an excuse for
unaccountable regional bureaucracies to subvert the choices of
patients. “System management” is used to mean
propping up poor quality providers and commissioners to give opaque
cross-subsidies. Under the Bill, competition will be fair. It ensures
that money follows the choices of patients

quality, driven by patient choice. Monitor will regulate prices through
the national tariff, and we have tabled amendments to clauses under

fixed price, not a maximum price. That approach would focus competition
on quality, as I have been saying from the outset. Obviously, we shall

                        <p class="tabbed">I
was also asked who decides when matters are appropriate. The
commissioners will decide how best to improve services and increase
choice for their patients, including how best to utilise competition as
a means to that end. Competition law and economic regulation will
ensure that the regulated market operates in patients’
interests.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000273">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There
have been allegations in some hon. Members’ contributions that
commissioners will be forced by competition law to put everything out
to tender. I hope that I will reassure Opposition
Members—although, sadly, I do not think that I will, for reasons
that we all understand—that procurement competition law will not
require commissioners to put services out to tender. It provides that
if services are put out to tender, commissioners must comply with
relevant procedural rules. Moreover, we expect patients to have a
choice in an increasing range of services and that there will be a much
smaller role for competitive tendering.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000274">&#160;</a>

Member for Leicester West believes that GPs will be driven by Monitor
instead of their patients, but I do not accept that at all. The primary
duty of GP consortia is to commission services that meet the needs of
their populations and to secure continuous improvement in quality. I
hope that she will accept that.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000275">&#160;</a>

Member for Pontypridd asked why we cannot just get the CQC to carry out
Monitor’s role. Monitor’s role is to set prices and
ensure a level playing field in competition, so that we put an end to
things such as the example that has frequently been applied. I know
that the right hon. Member for Rother Valley does not accept this, but
I am thinking of the distortions of what happened with independent
sector treatment centres, to which Members on this side of the
Committee are not as attracted as the right hon.

hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull East, who made the first
contribution in the debate, asked why the Government are proposing
reforms that would result in costly legal disputes on the application
of competition law. He seemed to think that lawyers would be rubbing
their hands. The point was picked up by the hon. Member for Pontypridd,
who read, almost word for word correctly—he just left off the
last sentence—what I said in this morning’s debate on EU
law and the Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000281">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">British and
EU competition law already applies. However, as a sector-specific
regulator, Monitor will provide authoritative guidance on complying
with the law and allow for proactive regulation through licensing to
prevent abuses. I do not share the hon. Gentleman’s
fear—or scaremongering, depending on one’s
view—that it will be a charter for lawyers to run riot and make
considerable amounts of money. I do not accept that that is going to
happen.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000282">&#160;</a>

Member asked how the Government will ensure that NHS staff are trained
in the application of competition law. I must tell hon. Members that
the priority for NHS staff will be to improve services for patients.
Improving services would not be anti-competitive, whether that is about
providing clinical advice to inform patients’ choices or
integrating services. Monitor’s role in enforcing competition
law would be to address restrictions on competition when they act
against patients’ interests. The burden of proof is on Monitor
to demonstrate
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000283">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> It is not unusual. We have had a considerably long
debate on the clause, and several of the hon. Gentleman’s hon.
Friends asked a series of questions that they—particularly the

fair to hon. Members to give them the answers to their
questions.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000287">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Member for Leicester West asked why we are proposing a system
where legal arguments on competition would trump patients’
interests. We are not. It is actually the contrary. Monitor will seek
to protect patients’ interests, which is consistent with the
role of the OFT and the competition authorities in protecting consumer
interests. Competition law would not trump patients’ interests.
Rather, as I said earlier, Monitor would apply competition law to
protect those interests.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000288">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The hon. Lady
also asked why Monitor had a principal duty to promote competition.
That is actually not what the Bill states. Monitor’s duty would
not be to promote competition as an end in itself, but to protect and
promote patients’ interests, as clause 52(1) makes
clear.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000289">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Lady asked why we need Monitor if competition is on quality, and
how Monitor would improve quality. Monitor’s role in promoting
competition is about strengthening incentives to improve quality and
efficiency through setting the tariff and intervening where necessary
to address restrictions on competition that could undermine
improvements in quality. As a regulator, therefore, Monitor’s
role is about creating the conditions for commissioners and providers
to improve quality, with patient choice as the key
driver.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000290">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
think it was also the hon. Lady—if it was one of her hon.
Friends, she must forgive me—who asked why Monitor should have
powers to fine GP consortia as commissioners. That is not what the Bill
states, and I hope that she accepts that.

                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Let
me briefly recap where we were when the sitting was suspended. Many of
the questions that arose in the debate are based on a fundamental
misconception of the Government’s policy—that we are
promoting competition for its own sake. That is not the case, as the
clause makes abundantly clear. We are talking about competition only in
the interests of patients. If competition does not promote or protect
the interests of people who use health services, it will not be the
role of Monitor to promote it. I hope that that clarifies the basic
premise within the context of the
debate.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000298">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Another
question that has featured repeatedly during the debate has been
whether competition will undermine co-operation between clinicians
across organisational boundaries. Again, I do not believe that that is
the case because both co-operation and competition have important roles
to play. The Government do not accept that co-operation and competition
are mutually exclusive. In other sectors, and in health care systems
throughout the 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 770<a class="bkMark" name="Column770">&#160;</a>
                           </div>world, providers compete with each other and work in partnership. Our
reforms would simply ensure that opportunities improve NHS services and
are open to providers from all sectors, and that, wherever possible,
patients are given a free choice of any willing provider that has
demonstrated that it can deliver to NHS standards at NHS
prices.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000299">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">One
of the first questions posed by the right hon. Gentleman was whether
the ISTC programme was different from applying competition. It is true
that our proposals are different from the last Government’s
independent sector treatment centre programme. They are different
because we want fair competition on a level playing field and not the
rigging of contracts and prices to favour the private sector. Our Bill
would prevent any future policies to expand the private sector. It
would be patients and commissioners who chose which providers to use,
not, as previously, because Ministers wanted a bigger role for private
providers.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000300">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
right hon. Gentleman also raised the issue of Monitor’s express
duty to promote competition. As the clause makes clear, that is only to
protect and provide for the interests of people who use health care
services. Competition is a means and not an end in itself. He also
asked about the meaning of Monitor’s powers to protect essential
assets and require monopoly providers to grant access to their
facilities to third parties. First, Monitor may need powers to protect
essential assets to ensure continuity of essential services. Secondly,
the powers to grant access by third parties to a monopoly
provider’s facilities would be used only in limited
circumstances, when it was in patients’ interests, which could
in the form of extended hours, more flexible access or more innovative
services; the provider giving access would receive payment for doing
so.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000301">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The right
hon. Gentleman also asked what was meant by regulation to address
abuses by monopoly providers. First, our proposals explicitly recognise
the role of monopoly providers in the NHS, which, to my mind, are not
always a bad thing. In the NHS, there are both natural monopolies, such
as providers of specialist neurosurgery, and local hospitals that
provide essential services where there are no alternative providers. We
have recognised that through our proposals for additional regulation of
designated
services.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000302">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Secondly,
monopoly providers would, in some cases, have the power to abuse their
dominant position, and Monitor would have the power to deal with that.
For example, where a provider refused to co-operate with GPs to provide
integration of primary care within A and E, Monitor would be able to
intervene. However, Monitor would grant GPs the licence to require
access to the monopoly providers’ facilities only if it was in
patients’ interests and on condition that the provider received
payment for granting such
access.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000303">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
right hon. Gentleman asked about the implications for the NHS of the
Government’s proposed role for market investigations by the
Competition Commission. The proposal is that Monitor would have the
power to conduct studies of the health care market and to refer issues
to the Competition Commission for investigation. For example, if
Monitor identified problems with block contracts preventing money from
following patients’ choices, it could refer the matter for
further investigation. If the Competition Commission’s
investigation concluded, on balance, that such arrangements acted
against the

                           </strong> I have three points to make in response to the
Minister’s comments. First, I am glad that he agreed that health
is different from utilities, telecoms and rail and that we therefore
need a different approach from that provided by the regulatory bodies
in those sectors. That, however, is not what the Government
propose.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000306">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
stated quite clearly in the King’s Fund briefing on the Bill,
Monitor’s main duty in clause 52 is virtually identical to that
of Ofgem—when it was first established, not after its remit was
amended in 2010 to ensure that it did not promote competition over the
needs of users. It is interesting that the senior economist at Monitor
used to be the director of wholesale markets at Ofgem; there may be an
interesting link to be made there.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000307">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Additionally,
under both UK and EU competition law, Monitor is given virtually
identical powers to those of the OFT. It gets the same powers as the
OFT under part 1 of the Competition Act 1998 and it gets the same
powers as the OFT under the Enterprise Act 2002. The Minister asserts
that the Government are using a different approach, but he has not
spelt out any of the differences between the legal framework that
applies to the utilities, telecoms and rail sectors and the regulatory
approach set out in the Bill. He has not specified the differences, and
that is why the clause is fundamentally
wrong.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000308">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Secondly,
it is interesting that the Minister gave such assurances in his speech.
For example, he clarified that, at this stage, GP commissioners would
not be undertakings under the new system. I shall double check in the
fantastically accurate <em>Hansard</em> tomorrow whether that is
different from what he told us this morning. I thought that I clearly
heard him say that GP commissioning consortia, in performing their
commissioning role, would be considered as
undertakings.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000309">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
the humblest way, I say to the Minister that it is not his reassurances
that Opposition Members want; we want to see the legal advice that the
Government say they have taken. We want that to be published. I have
huge respect for the Minister and for his hard-working and efficient
civil servants, who provide the useful briefing notes, but I want to
see the legal advice, not simply hear his
assurances.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000310">&#160;</a>

Before the Division, I gave a commitment to the hon. Member for Halton
that I would clear up a point on which he thought that there had been a

<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 772<a class="bkMark" name="Column772">&#160;</a>
                           </div>contradiction. I want to put it on the record, because it will be
helpful in future debates when we discuss
competition.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000313">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Gentleman asked what happens when GP consortia disagree with
Monitor about what is in patients’ best interests and whether
Monitor will have overriding powers to intervene. GP consortia, as
commissioners of NHS services, will decide on arrangements for the
provision of services. They will decide how to commission services in
the best interests of their patients. If Monitor wants to intervene
under powers that may be conferred by the Bill or by regulations under
clause 63, it will have to demonstrate that the arrangements restrict
competition and that that is acting against the patient interest. The
burden of proof will be on Monitor, and it cannot intervene without
demonstrating its case. The short answer, therefore, is no. Monitor
will not have an overriding power to intervene. I hope that that has
been helpful for both the hon. Gentleman and the hon.
Lady.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000314">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I am interested to hear that. That was not the
point that I was making at the time, but I am grateful to him for
explaining it. Lawyers that I have spoken to, however, say that if GP
commissioners are considered to be undertakings, the burden of proof
will be on them to prove that they should not be subject to competition
law. This is a legal minefield, so it is important that we have
clarity. These are not simply thoughts that I have developed over the
many joyous hours spent studying the Bill; my arguments arise from
briefings from organisations such as the NHS Confederation, which has
had legal advice from Mills and Reeve, and which says that it is quite
clear that GP commissioners could become undertakings and therefore be
subject to EU competition law. That is why we need to see the legal
advice and to have it
published.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000315">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">My
final point, which relates to the point that the Minister clarified for
my hon. Friend the Member for Halton, is about who decides. Under the
new system, who has the power to make final decisions? The Minister
says that it is GP commissioners, so why have Monitor? What is the
point of having Monitor, with its role to drive competition, if it will
not look at a particular market? As David Bennett said in his interview
with <em>The Times </em>on 25 February, there may be some parts of the
country that have only one provider of diabetes care, and those are the
sorts of areas that Monitor could look at to see if they can be opened
up to the market. It is Monitor, not GP commissioners, that will be
driving changes, and if the Minister thinks differently, perhaps his
Secretary of State should not have appointed David
Bennett.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000316">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I have just discovered a paradox. Presumably, if
Monitor overrules GP consortia in the interest of patients, which is
what the Minister has just said, that is slightly cross-grained with
the assumption that GPs understand patients’ interests best,
which is the premise of the
legislation.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000317">&#160;</a>

that the changes are huge; their implications are at best unclear, and
at worst extremely risky for patients, the public and the NHS as a
whole. It is not clear who will decide. Organisations such as the

Monitor to adult social care when we have yet to see

                        <p>I
am particularly interested in provider failure, given the terrible cuts
that local authorities have to implement as a result of the
Government’s reckless economic policy. During recent
negotiations on the price of beds for people in long-term care, the
only discussions were about how much the amount that local authorities
pay for long-term care beds was going to be cut by—whether it
was going to be 0% or up to 21%. That is what is going on at the
moment.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000351">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Providers of
long-term care—old people’s homes—are having to
have their money cut. Those who have an interest in the issue worry
hugely about what the future of Southern Cross will be. Its shares were
worth more than £600 before Christmas and, this week, they have
gone down to £5. Southern Cross has unsustainable debts and we
do not know what will happen to a large number of elderly people who
are staying in old people’s homes provided by that
organisation.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000352">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
have been approached by the families of people with dementia who live
at Oakleigh home in the London borough of Sutton, where a
Conservative-Liberal coalition council is closing dementia beds. Given
that we are talking about certain services being effectively guaranteed
by Monitor in the health service—designated services—is
that what is anticipated in relation to social care? Are the Government
considering having an equivalent of designated services in relation to
long-term care? If someone with dementia has been living in one place
for a long time and they are moved out, it has an extraordinarily
tragic effect on them, as I am sure Ministers
know.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000353">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Although
administrators currently have a duty to creditors when winding up
things such as old people’s homes, what is their duty in
relation to the individuals who live there? If Monitor is to take
responsibility for adult social services, particularly for those in
long-term care—I shall use this one example to highlight my
point—it would be interesting to hear whether the Government are
considering whether there might be some designated social
care.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000354">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We know that
it will be a while before Monitor takes responsibility for adult social
care, but those of us in the field also know that social care will be
changing a great deal in the next few years. Whatever it is, the social
care that Monitor will be taking responsibility for in a few
years’ time will look very different from how it looks
now.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000355">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Clause 53 enables the Secretary of State to
provide, through regulation, for specified functions of Monitor to be
exercisable in relation to adult social care. The proposals that we set
out in last year’s White Paper included that Monitor should
become an independent regulator for the health and social care
sectors.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000357">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
consultation highlighted the complexities of applying competition law
to the NHS. In the light of that, the Government announced that
initially they intended to bring Monitor’s powers into force
only for health care. Provision to extend that to adult social care
would be brought into force later. There was support for taking that
phased approach in the consultation responses. What I mean by the
consultation responses is the consultations that flowed from the
publication of the White Paper last July.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000358">&#160;</a>

had a chance to read the consultation. The clause enables that phased
approach. It does not provide that Monitor’s functions will be
extended to adult social care, only that they could be. A joint review
by the Department of Health and the Department for Communities and
Local Government is considering proposals for a role for Monitor in
regulating adult social care services. We anticipate that any such role
would be limited to anti-competitive behaviour and/or provider
failure.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000361">&#160;</a>

only to find them thrown back against me in a contorted way.

Gentleman, so I say in all honesty—and, I believe,
correctness—that the answer to his question is no, because it is
premature. If it is proved, however, that I am incorrect—I do
not think I am—he will be the first to know after the civil
servants have told me. For that reason, I urge that the clause should

                           </strong> I beg to move amendment 481, in
clause 54, page 63, line 40, at
end insert—<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000371">&#160;</a>
                        </p>‘(ca) the need
for enhancing collaboration and integration between health and social
care services,(cb) the impact
that its actions affecting one service could have on related services
and the local health economy as a
whole,’.<p class="tabbed">Clause
54 sets out the matters to which Monitor must have regard when
exercising its functions. Those include the need to maintain safety for
people who use health services, the desirability of securing continuous
improvement in both the quality and efficiency of health services, the
need for commissioners to ensure access to services, best use of
resources, the desirability to promote investment and research in the
NHS, and a couple of others. When we have the possibly brief stand part
debate on clause 54, I shall go into some of the
difficulties of how to balance and reconcile all those different issues
when promoting competition, and how they relate to functions of other
bodies set up by the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000372">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendment would ensure that, alongside those different matters, Monitor
must also have regard to the need for enhancing collaboration and
integration between health and social care services, and the impact
that its actions affecting one service could have on related services
of the local health economy as a whole.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000373">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The reason
for the amendment is clear from the stand part debate on clause 52. I
think all Members would agree that there is a need for services to work
more closely together, both within the health service and 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 777<a class="bkMark" name="Column777">&#160;</a>
                           </div>between health and social care. Members of my party
think the Bill will make that challenge worse; I am sure Government
parties will disagree. Having a clear requirement on Monitor to have a
particular regard to the need to support integration and collaboration
would help allay some concerns people have that competition will lead
to greater fragmentation. That is why I hope the Minister will accept
the
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000374">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
second part of the amendment would require Monitor to think carefully
about the impact that its decisions on one service could have on
others. That is the point I raised earlier. Take the example of
diabetes services raised by David Bennett. If the diabetes part of care
were removed from a hospital, what would be the knock-on effect? The
amendment would explicitly require Monitor to take those issues into
consideration. It would give great reassurance to many people who are
worried about the impact of competition if the Government were to
accept the amendment. I look forward to hearing the Minister’s
comments.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000375">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I would like to start my response to amendment 481
in what the hon. Lady might consider a slightly unusual way. I actually
agree with her, in so far as I believe that these are important issues.
However, I am afraid that, although I understand and appreciate the
sentiment of the amendment, I believe it is not
necessary.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000376">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
have already spoken at length about the need for and benefits of
co-operation and integration between different bodies in the health and
care system. Co-operation between providers is an essential part of
delivering high-quality, seamless care over organisational boundaries,
and it is necessary for patients to be able to choose their preferred
provider. As we have discussed, there is already a comprehensive range
of duties under the National Health Service Act 2006, as well as new
duties proposed by the Bill, which cover co-operation and integrated
working. For example, under section 72 of the 2006 Act, NHS
bodies have a duty to co-operate with each other in the exercise of
their functions. Under section 82 of the same Act, they have a duty to
co-operate with local authorities to secure and advance the health and
welfare of the people of England and
Wales.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000377">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Clause
19 would reinforce those provisions by placing a duty on the
commissioning board to encourage integrated working between GP
consortia and local authorities, and a duty on health and well-being
boards to encourage integrated working, as laid out in clause 179.
However, our approach to clause 54 is to set out the range of matters
that Monitor must have regard to in carrying out its duties, by
focusing on outcomes.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000378">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">For example,
Monitor would have to have regard to the need to maintain patient
safety, to improve quality and to ensure patients had access to the
services that they needed. It would also have to have regard to the
need for high standards of education and training and the need to make
best use of limited NHS resources. Co-operation between providers and
the integration of services, including of health and social care, would
be important means of achieving those outcomes, but not the only
important ones. Other important issues would include high standards of
professionalism, clinical governance and financial management, and
there would be others that I have not mentioned.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000379">&#160;</a>
                        </p> 
                        <div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 778<a class="bkMark" name="Column778">&#160;</a>
                        </div>
                        <p class="tabbed">Similarly,
in relation to the second part of the amendment, Monitor would need to
develop a robust understanding of provider economics and the
interdependency between clinical services, not as an end in itself, but
to inform the exercise of its functions and make its
contribution to improve outcomes. That demonstrates the advantages of
our proposed approach, which is to ensure that Monitor must have regard
to the outcomes to be achieved, rather than attempting to produce an
exhaustive list of the issues that would be important in achieving
those outcomes. Having explained the rationale behind the clause, I
hope that the hon. Lady will consider withdrawing her
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000380">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I am glad that we agree about the need for
services to work together, and I hope that the Minister would also
agree that decisions on one part of the service—for example, in
our hospitals—can have an important knock-on effect on other
services. He did not specifically make that point, but I am sure he
will agree that that is
important.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000381">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Minister says that this area of the Bill is about outcomes, not
processes. I am not sure that that is strictly correct, because it
refers to the need to promote research, which is not an outcome. It
also mentions the need to promote investment, which is supposed to lead
to high-quality, continuously improving care. There are some outcomes
and some processes in the clause—it includes both—which
is why the amendment is relevant. He used a snazzy way of saying that
he did not want the amendment when he said that this area of the Bill
is about outcomes and not inputs, but that is not the
case.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000382">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Monitor
needs a specific requirement to pay attention to such issues. It is not
just about putting duties on other bodies to work together; it is
saying that Monitor, in promoting competition, has to bear those
matters in mind. This is another example of where the Minister and I
will agree to disagree, and I will press the amendment to a
vote.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000383">&#160;</a>

question of staff training has been raised several times in earlier

strategic development of the work force, and particular concern has
been expressed about the lack of that in the Bill. Currently, there is
no requirement for private providers to train staff—I recall the
hon. Member for Stafford voicing concern about that. If there is to be
an increasing number of private providers, they must pull their weight
when it comes to developing and training
staff.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000415">&#160;</a>

about the issue was raised with us by the Chartered Society of
Physiotherapy, which is particularly worried that it would be difficult
to ensure that new physiotherapists receive the proper training if the
Bill is passed and there is an increase in private provision. Concern
was also raised by Unison. Although I realise, from what I have read in
the newspaper today, that the BMA may not be the Minister’s
favourite organisation—he has been doing a Gaddafi for most of
the day and claiming that the BMA does not represent doctors and that
all doctors love him—but at its extraordinary general meeting
today, it passed a resolution stating how concerned it is about

training and development activity, providers of health care services
will have a major role to play as employers and, in many cases, as
providers of training. We want to ensure that providers fulfil those
responsibilities and receive appropriate support to offer high-quality
training to staff. However, we have no plans to expand the remit of
Monitor to include regulation of providers in relation to work force
matters. Monitor will be the economic regulator. It is not part of the
role of other economic regulators to ensure that providers carry out
appropriate training and development of their staff and we do not think
that it should be part of Monitor’s role. Assessing that
activity requires specialist knowledge and expertise that will not be
available to Monitor.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000426">&#160;</a>

England, which will support health care providers and provide national
oversight of work force planning, education and training. HEE will
provide leadership for effective work force planning and the provision
of high-quality education and training. It will also bring together the
interests of health care providers, the professions, patients and
staff. We believe that that is the most appropriate way to ensure
sufficient and targeted investment in developing the work force of the
future. The deadline for responses to the consultation is 31

much as any member of this Committee on either side, want to get this
crucial issue right. We have to wait to see what flows from the
consultation process—what responses, ideas and recommendations
we get from those who take part—before we make any decisions.
While that consultation process is ongoing, it would be wrong to
anticipate, prejudge or seek to influence what will flow from it. That
is the purpose of the consultation process—to get ideas about
how to move forward in the most positive and relevant way, so that we
can get the best training and education for the next generation of

                           </strong> The Minister attempts to have it both ways. On
the one hand, he is abolishing strategic health authorities, the
deaneries and the way that we plan the future development of
our health workers. However, he also says that he wants to be able to
consult—<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000431">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The Minister is consulting. He is also
establishing a new quango and he says that the closing date of the
consultation is some time in the future. I stand to be corrected, but
no attempt is made in the Bill to establish an alternative to the
structure that the Bill is getting rid of, so we are getting rid of
what we have without establishing anything else in the interim, even
though, of all things, work force planning is the sort of thing for
which a long run-up is needed.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000433">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">There is
genuine concern among those who have dedicated their lives to the
health service that there will not be sufficient work force planning
for our NHS. Our NHS rests on our staff. It seems that, if we are not
going to educate them properly with proper forward development, there
is an hiatus in the Bill. If I am wrong, on behalf of a large number of
organisations which are genuinely concerned about such matters, I seek
reassurance from the
Minister.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000434">&#160;</a>

I am more than happy to give her now. There will be no hiatus. There
will be no interruption. It will be a seamless

Trojan horse clause about letting Monitor in to regulate adult social
care, about what will replace the current structure. That is our worry.
Although the right hon. Gentleman makes his representations in good
faith, I am sure he understands that there may be some who do not
necessarily take it on the

to look at training, but given that she mentioned deaneries, does she
agree that one of the main problems was that the time to look at
training was when the European working time directive was introduced
under the previous Government? That was when training really suffered.
It is right that the Government are addressing the problem now in a
comprehensive, but not rushed, way.<a class="bkMark" name="11031623000437">&#160;</a>

Foundation Trust Network is among the organisations that have expressed
considerable concern about the issue, and their anxiety should not
simply be brushed aside. One of the FTN’s legitimate worries is
that, if we are to increase the number of private providers, those in
the private sector should really pull their weight. In a Bill that
encourages the private sector and gets rid of what we have already,
such as the structures of workplace developments, we need to have
something more than the Minister’s assurance that everything
will be okay—because it might not be. I urge the Committee to
accept the
