<H5>4.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory </B>(Wells): On a point of order, Mr. Butterfill. I wonder if you could help us, as you were in the Chair on Tuesday. It surrounds the mysterious affair of the missing words of the Paymaster General. It is beyond dispute that the Paymaster General was replying to Tuesday's debate, in which my hon. Friends had spoken. Indeed, that is confirmed by the selection list, which says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Question proposed: Mr. Robinson called".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is a serious discourtesy that he did not appear this morning to answer that debate. Suspicions were aroused this morning in your absence, Mr. Butterfill, that his absence was connected with the fact that today's debate touches on who benefits from the capital gains tax changes, and matters of overseas trusts, both of which are personally embarrassing to the Paymaster General. So it was a matter of legitimate interest to the Committee why, when the Paymaster General was speaking when the Committee was adjourned on Tuesday, he was not here this morning. In your absence, Mr. Butterfill, Mrs. Dunwoody secured a transcript of the tape, which confirmed that the Paymaster General was speaking at the end of Tuesday's debate. However, his words were entirely absent from the Official Report, and we wondered why the Official Reporters had made a most uncharacteristic oversight, or whether they were acting on instructions or on a suggestion from some other person.
<P>
We all have respect for you as Chairman, Mr. Butterfill, and perhaps, as you were in the Chair on Tuesday, you can shed some additional light on why those words are missing and when they can be restored, and whether, in your view, it remains a breach at least of the conventions of the House that the Paymaster General is not prepared to answer the debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Alan Johnson </B>(Hull, West and Hessle): Further to that point of order, Mr. Butterfill. Is the right hon. Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory criticising this morning's Committee Chairman?
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I am simply seeking information, Mr. Butterfill. This morning, Mrs. Dunwoody said that it was purely and simply an error on the part of the Official Report, and that there was no intervention by any other hon. Member or, presumably, any Chairman of the Committee. That is how it stands, and of course one accepts that from someone speaking in the capacity of Chairman. However, we are seeking additional information from you this afternoon, Mr. Butterfill.
<P>
<B>Several hon. Members</b> rose <P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am on my feet and I shall respond to that point of order. Hon. Members may raise further points of order when I have finished, but I may be able to clear the matter up to everyone's satisfaction.
<P>
The situation was that we had had a long debate on telephonic communications with the Inland Revenue a rather lighthearted debate at the end of which, and before calling Mr. Robinson, I made a fairly lighthearted remark, and said,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"It is good to talk." [Official Report, Standing Committee E, 9 June 1998; c. 712.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is recorded in Hansard. I then called Mr. Robinson, who commenced to speak. As he did so, the Division bell sounded. I have checked the tapes on this matter. I have consulted Madam Speaker, the Clerk and the Editor of Hansard, and we have listened to the tapes together. What is in dispute is whether Mr. Robinson uttered words before I said "Order" because, following the Division bell, I said,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Order. Division in the House."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Immediately after that, the Lord Commissioner to the Treasury, the hon. Member for Coventry, North East (Mr. Ainsworth) moved the Adjournment.
<P>
I have checked precisely what was said before I said "Order." I was under the impression that I said "Order" before Mr. Robinson uttered any words. That is not exactly correct. I have therefore agreed with Hansard that the following words of response should be added to the record. The words amount to a few seconds of speech and I shall read them out.
<P>
Mr. Robinson, in response to my remark
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"It is good to talk." [Official Report, Standing Committee E, 9 June 1998; c. 712.],<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"I have no intention of talking this Bill out this evening, but I would respond in the good humour that has been shown on both sides of the Committee by saying that the Inland Revenue as well as the Government".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
At that point I called "Order." It was my view, after consulting the Clerk and Hansard, that nothing of substance had been said in response to the debate and therefore that nothing should be shown on the record.
<P>
It is also true that Mr. Robinson approached me after the Committee had adjourned and asked whether it would be in accordance with normal courtesies for him to return to the Committee or whether it would be appropriate for Mrs. Liddell to take his place at the next sitting. He wanted to satisfy himself on the normal courtesies. I assured Mr. Robinson, having consulted the Clerk, that the normal courtesies did not require him to return. That decision has been substantiated by further consultations. It took account of the fact that Mrs. Liddell had been present throughout the debate and was in a perfectly competent position to respond at the next sitting.
<P>
I do not therefore consider that there has been any deliberate attempt to fudge the record; nor do I consider that there has been a discourtesy to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I am grateful for that explanation. It is a significant correction to what we were told this morning all in good faith. This is not a criticism of you, Mr. Butterfill, but Mrs. Dunwoody said that it was purely an oversight by the official reporters. It is not clear that you, Mr. Butterfill, had a[Mr. Heathcoat-Amory]
word with the official reporters. Therefore, it was not an oversight by the Official Report. We owe it to them that their unblemished record of reporting what they hear and not what they are told to hear remains unblemished.
<P>
I am not criticising you in any way, Mr. Butterfill, but I think that that is a most useful and significant correction which fully validates our insistence that we get on the record exactly what happened. We also now hear that there were discussions between the Government and the Chair [Hon. Members: "No."] Yes there were. You, Mr. Butterfill, confirmed that fact. It would have been helpful in this morning's sitting, which you did not attend, if the Government had made it clear that those discussions had taken place.
<P>
<B>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Mrs. Helen Liddell):</B> Further to that point of order, Mr. Butterfill. The statements by the right hon. Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory) are outrageous, especially in view of the fact that Mrs. Dunwoody made it clear this morning that she would return to the Committee in the afternoon once she had an opportunity to investigate the issue properly. The right hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friends pushed for her to adjudicate on this matter in the course of the Committee when she was not in a position to consult you, Mr. Butterfill, and others.
<P>
It is outrageous and against the principles of the House to attack a Chairman of a Committee in this way, especially when the Chairman is not present. I confirm the events as they were explained by you, Mr. Butterfill. As a matter of courtesy, the Paymaster General and I sought the advice of you and the Clerk. We were very grateful for the courtesy that you showed to us, and we are very grateful for the opportunity to explain our position. It is outrageous that there should be such slander on a Committee Chairman and, indeed, on someone who is much respected in this House.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael Fallon </B>(Sevenoaks): Further to that point of order, Mr. Butterfill. Is it not the case that the explanation that the Economic Secretary just gave of why Ministers approached the chair last Tuesday could have been given to the Committee this morning? It was withheld from us this morning. If the hon. Lady had owned up to the attempt to lean on the chair this morning, we might have been spared the statement that you, Mr. Butterfill, have had to make.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> There was no attempt to lean on me as Chairman in any way. I was approached as to what was the usual courtesy; I was not leaned on, and will never be leaned on by any member of the Committee. If I had ruled that the usual courtesy would be for the Paymaster General to return, he would have returned. But I was able to assure him that the usual courtesy did not require him to return, especially in view of the fact that another Minister who was competent to reply had been present throughout the debate. If another Minister had not been present throughout and in a position to reply, my ruling would have been different.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robert Ainsworth (Lord Commissioner to the Treasury):</B> May I ask you, Mr. Butterfill, to consult with your co-Chairman on exactly what was said to the Committee this morning on this matter. Such consultation is necessary to ensure that there is no discrepancy, as alleged by Opposition Members, and to discuss the disgraceful press allegations that deliberate doctoring of Hansard has taken place at the behest of Ministers. The allegations in this morning's Committee were deplorable, and I request that you and your co-Chairman should consider that issue as well.
<P>
<B>Several hon. Members</b> rose <P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. This issue has been aired sufficiently. It was not unreasonable for Mrs. Dunwoody to say what she did this morning, as she was not present at the relevant time and therefore not in full possession of the facts. I have made clear what transpired, and I honestly do not think that there is any justification for any further points of order. I hope that I have clarified the matter. If there was any fault it was perhaps mine; I will accept that. It was certainly not the fault of the Hansard writers, the Clerk or members of the Committee. We should now get on with the debate.

<P>

<B>Mr. Ian Stewart </B>(Eccles): On a point of order, Mr. Butterfill. I am a new Member. First, may I take your advice on whether it is parliamentary practice to say that the Chairman of a Committee has exercised an abuse of Parliament? Secondly, is it parliamentary practice to accuse a Minister of deliberately doctoring Hansard and to fail to apologise when it is found that the allegation is not true?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. There have been enough contributions on this matter. It was appropriate for hon. Members to wonder why the record did not show what they thought it should. A provisional explanation was given this morning by a Chairman who was not chairing the Committee at the relevant time. I have explained the full circumstances; we should now proceed with the debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Whittingdale </B>(Maldon and East Chelmsford) rose 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Hon. Members are trying my patience.
<P>
<B>Mr. Whittingdale:</B> May I just ask you one question, Mr. Butterfill? When you had the conversation with the Economic Secretary and the Paymaster General on Tuesday evening, did the Paymaster General say what business was more pressing than attending this Committee this morning? We understand that he was in the Treasury this morning, and is currently on the Front Bench in the Chamber, which arouses the suspicion that he did not wish to attend because the matters under discussion were embarrassing to him.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Ministers are responsible for deciding which of them is in a Committee at any given time. They have busy diaries, and I cannot be responsible for the arrangement of those diaries. I shall take no further points of order on this subject.

<P>
<B>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Dawn Primarolo):</B> It is sad that such allegations have been made against Hansard, Ministers and Chairmen 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I hope that the Financial Secretary will not pursue this line. We have had enough contributions on this subject. We shall now address amendment No. 228.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I was going to say that you owe the Committee no apology, Mr. Butterfill. Members should behave properly in the Committee; they should not have to be required to do so. I will not persist with this point.
<P>
When we adjourned for lunch, I had concluded my comments on amendment No. 227 and had made it clear that the Government intend the new system to have its beneficial effect as soon as possible, both for existing assets and new assets purchased after 5 April 1998. We want to keep to a minimum the compliance effects of freezing indexation. The amendment would fail on both counts, so it will be clear to the Committee why it is unacceptable to the Government.
<P>
Amendment No. 228 seeks to explore the reasons for our proposed use of an asset over the past 10 years of ownership to determine how much of the gain on the asset is to qualify for the business asset taper relief and how much for the non-business asset taper relief. Under the provisions as drafted, the relevant period of ownership is defined as the period after 5 April 1998 for which the asset has been held at the time of its disposal, or a period of 10 years ending with the disposal, whichever is the shorter. It is the use during the relevant period of ownership which determines whether or how much of the gain is a gain on a business asset and therefore qualifies for the more generous business asset taper relief.
<P>
Our sole motive in limiting the relevant period of ownership to the last 10 years is that it will prove a helpful compliance saving to those having to prepare their capital gains tax computation. On disposal of an asset which has been used partly as a business asset and partly as a non-business asset, the seller will have to look back over only the last 10 years and determine the use during that period. The extent to which the seller will have to delve into the past is limited and that will prove helpful in terms of compliance benefit.
<P>
Amendment No. 228 would require the seller to look back over the whole period of ownership and determine the proportion of business use throughout the whole period. The approach proposed in the Bill can, depending on the circumstances, produce results which are favourable or less favourable to the taxpayer compared with taking the whole period of ownership.
<P>
The usual situation will be that the asset is used wholly as a business asset or wholly as a non-business[Dawn Primarolo]
asset and our judgment is that apportioning the gain into business and non-business parts should be simple and straightforward, even though in some circumstances it might produce some rough edges. That remains our view.
<P>
Even if I were not opposed to the amendment, I must tell the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond) that the amendment is technically incorrect. Paragraph 3(3) of schedule 20 refers to an asset that has been used sequentially as a business asset and a non-business asset throughout the relevant period of ownership. Paragraph 9 refers to an asset that is used partly for business purposes and partly for non-business purposes concurrently during the relevant period of ownership. Paragraph 9 works by feeding back to paragraph 3. The amendment would leave paragraph 9 working by reference to the last 10 years, so it would be out of line with paragraph 3, if it were amended by amendment No. 228. For those reasons amendments Nos. 228, 225, 226 and 227 are unacceptable and I hope that the Committee will reject them.

<P>

<B>Mr. John Burnett </B>(Torridge and West Devon): When I spoke before lunch, I asked the Financial Secretary whether the Government want a flexible economy or to stifle investment. I, and several other Committee members, said that crude taper relief should be transferred on an apportioned basis at the roll-over relief stage. That matter is dealt with in amendment No. 226, which I want to zero in on.
<P>
It is important for taxpayers always to keep records for capital gains tax purposes. They should, for example, keep records of improvements to property. Keeping those records and the records of a reinvestment and a reapportionment is not a significant problem for taxpayers, but it is important for a flexible economy and it helps to ensure that investment is not frozen solely for tax reasons. This afternoon the Chancellor said how important it was to maintain a flexible economy. The Committee should respond to that request and ensure that we comply with the underlying principles. If the Government accept amendment No. 226, they will preserve that flexibility and ensure that taxpayers are driven not by tax considerations but by sensible economic considerations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick Gibb </B>(Bognor Regis and Littlehampton): In view of the fact that I did not participate in the debate this morning and that no more Committee members want to contribute, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 224, in page 338, line 42, at end insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"3(A) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (3) above an individual is a full-time working officer or employee of a company if, excluding holidays, sickness and meal breaks and disregarding any other business activity in which he may be engaged, he works at least 35 hours per week for the company, on average.".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Under the schedule, shares will be regarded as a business asset for taper relief purposes if the holder has 5 per cent. of the voting power and is a full-time working employee or a director of a company. The same conditions apply to retirement relief. In respect of retirement relief, the Inland Revenue has always argued that an individual who works for 40 hours a week is not a full-time employee if he has some kind of second employment or is engaged in any other kind of business activity to which he devotes part of his time. That is understood outside the House.
<P>
If the Inland Revenue pursues that line of argument successfully in this context, a significant number of individuals would find that their shares were treated as non-business assets and were subject to the lower regime for tapering relief because those assets were regarded not as business assets but as non-business assets. There is possibly some justification for the Inland Revenue's position on retirement relief, but there can be no economic justification for treating shares as a non-business asset.
<P>
Amendment No. 224 states that a person is in full-time employment if he works on average for 35 hours a week. If he does so, that will prevent the Revenue from pursuing the line of argument that I described. I urge the Government to accept the amendment. If they feel that the 35-hour figure is too small or too large, they should come forward on report with an amendment specifying the number of hours that they find acceptable.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Ruffley (Bury St. Edmunds):</B> I rise in support of what is a very modest amendment, on which I hope the Financial Secretary has positive news.
<P>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton said, the amendment would set the definition of full-time employment at 35 hours. That definition is at the bottom end of the Inland Revenue's own definition, which in practice ranges from 35 to more than 40 hours.
<P>
In addition, the third line of the amendment makes it clear that the definition would disregard any other business activities. The amendment would ensure that, in order to be considered as being in full-time employment, any hard-working entrepreneur with other business activities was not obliged by the Revenue to work in one place for a set number of hours.
<P>
The figure of 35 hours is therefore of itself important. It is also important to consider the modest disregard provision that the amendment seeks to entrench, to which I hope that the Financial Secretary will respond positively.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick St. Aubyn </B>(Guildford): I also rise to support the amendment. It seems incongruous that someone who has worked for a company for 20-odd years, but who has only 4.9 per cent. of the share capital, should be treated in the same way as someone who has a share portfolio of completely unrelated shares. However, that appears to be the shareholder's purpose.
<P>
It is a pity that the 5 per cent. rule is there in any event. However, I support the amendment because at least it would apply the rule to those who have worked for a company for a long time. The amendment allows for the possibility that, while being so employed, such people may have become involved in other activities. Many entrepreneurs work very long hours. It is bizarre to suggest that, in order to qualify under the provision, they should cut back their hours.
<P>
We should be mindful that the Government are making the restrictions on the reliefs dealt with in schedule 20 far too narrow. We should therefore support the amendment. Indeed, any attempt to widen the scope of those reliefs deserves the Committee's support.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I am grateful to Conservative Members for bringing the matter to the Committee's attention. However, I think that they have misunderstood the provision within the schedule. The amendment would in fact be unduly restrictive.
<P>
The definition
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"full-time working officer or employee",<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
which applies for the purposes of new schedule A1 of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992, appears on page 348 of the Bill. As the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb) said, it is based on the corresponding definition for retirement relief. The definition in new schedule A1 was deliberately framed in that way so that the Revenue could draw on its understanding of the retirement relief definition and, where appropriate, apply practices established in relation to that definition. Those practices can be traced back to the 1960s, when retirement relief was introduced.
<P>
The Revenue practice shows that the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton is unduly restrictive, and should be withdrawn. The Revenue practice is published in the capital gains manual at paragraph 63621. In broad terms, if a company employee works for at least three quarters of the normal working week, as far as that company is concerned, he or she is treated as a full-time employee of the company for the purposes of retirement relief. That applies irrespective of the amount of time that the individual devotes to other activities during his or her working time. To specify 35 hours could rule out people who would otherwise have qualified.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
It would not be right for the Committee to accept the amendment because as if it were not serious enough that it would counter Revenue practice it also suffers from other defects. It would impose a minimum limit of 35 hours a week, which will generally be higher than the guidance of three quarters of the company's normal week. That is applied in most circumstances by the Revenue, as set out in the manual.
<P>
The amendment would exclude a director who works a 34-hour week for a company of which the employees have a normal working week of 40 hours and who has a small consultancy that occupies him or her for a further two hours a week. Such a director would qualify under the Revenue's current practice, but he or she would not qualify under the definition proposed in the amendment. I am sure that the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton does not mean to impose that restriction.
<P>
The amendment gives no indication of the length of the period over which the average number of hours a week is calculated. That creates an uncertainty which could make the tests difficult to apply in practice even if we wanted to, which we do not because we want to rely on Revenue practice. The amendment does not modify the definition of full-time working officer or employee, which applies generally for the purposes of the schedule and appears on page 348 of the Bill.
<P>
I think that it is important that the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton wanted to explore the meaning of the schedule. I am sure that he will appreciate that his amendment would do the opposite of what he intends because it would unduly apply restrictions to the Bill for qualification.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I am disappointed that the Government insist on making a link between this relief and retirement relief. It is not fair to do so. We are trying to define what is or is not a business asset, which should be relatively simple. However, in view of the Financial Secretary's helpful quotes from the capital gains manual, which people outside the House will find useful and will, because of Pepper v. Hart, be able to rely on, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 223, in page 348, leave out lines 39 to 48 and insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"`trading company' means a company whose business consists wholly or mainly of the carrying on of a trade or trades;
<P>
`trading group' means a group of companies the business of whose members, taken together, consists wholly or mainly of the carrying on of a trade or trades.".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Another definition of how shares can become a business asset is that a company must be a trading company or, indeed, the parent of a trading company. The definition of a trading company in the schedule differs significantly from what is usually used. I pick up "Butterworth's" and at random select a page that has a definition of a trading company. Schedule 6 of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992 says that a
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"`trading company' means a company whose business consists wholly or mainly of the carrying on of a trade or trades".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is the usual definition of a trading company. But new schedule A1 defines a company as a trading company if it exists wholly to carry on a trade or trades, but excluding purposes that cannot have any significant effect on the company's activities. That is a much tighter definition than the one that is usually used. Despite the tiny concession by the Revenue of those activities that do not have a significant effect on the company's activities, the provision does not go far enough. There may be circumstances in which a company is almost wholly trading, but falls outside the definition of a trading company for those purposes. The shares in those companies would not count as business assets for the purposes of determining which of the two tapering schedules should apply.
<P>
Amendment No. 223 uses the currently accepted definition, which I quoted by way of example, and includes overseas trading companies. I very much hope that the Financial Secretary will feel able to accept the amendment and, if it contains any technical deficiencies, at least accept it in principle and table a similar provision on Report. The principle is important, and it seems absurd to have varying definitions of straightforward phrases such as "trading company". Various definitions scattered throughout the Bill will be unfair when they are applied to an individual taxpayer,[Mr. Gibb]
so that he or she will not benefit from the more generous tapering reliefs. They also increase the complexity of the Taxes Act 1988. I was absent this morning because I was attending a meeting of the tax law rewrite committee. The whole country really does want tax law to be simplified, and introducing further complexities will not help that project.

<P>

<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I rise in support of the clarion call from my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton for simplicity in the wording of statutes During this morning's lengthy debate, the Economic Secretary's plea was for a simpler capital gains tax system. In the name of simplicity, she was prepared to penalise those who benefit from a deceased's estate, and even to penalise the disabled. Yet when a proposal is made to simplify definitions of "trading company" and "trading group", I fear that we shall hear several specious objections from the Financial Secretary because the Government are worried that simplicity will not bring in more tax to the Inland Revenue and that they may actually lose tax. They do not realise that simplicity in the wording of legislation makes investment and business decisions simpler and less costly, and it is the benefit to those business decisions that ultimately yields the tax take.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I know that the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton works diligently on drafting his amendments, but I am going to disappoint him because I have not quite reached the point when I want to join him in the Library to comb through the Finance Bill to ensure that his amendments are correctly drafted. Perhaps he will forgive me for that.
<P>
The purpose of the amendment is to relax the taper relief rules, so that the business asset taper applies to a much wider class of assets. The taper for business assets is intentionally more generous for other assets because it is designed to give real benefits to businesses. Clearly, where the asset in question consists of shares in a company or is used for the purpose of the trade carried on by a company, we want to ensure that the company satisfies conditions that do not allow scope for exploitation. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will understand that, even if he does not agree. Relaxing the conditions in the way proposed would have two major drawbacks. First, it could add substantially to the Exchequer costs of providing relief. The reform package is broadly designed to be revenue neutral, and the costs will have to be compensated for by a corresponding tax rise elsewhere, which we do not want.
<P>
Secondly, it would allow the relief to be exploited in straightforward ways. For example, the proposed definition of "trading group" would enable shares in a holding company to be treated as a business asset, when up to half of the group's activities could consist of holding investment rather than of trading. Our reforms to CGT and to taper relief should not include that result. We want to encourage entrepreneurs to develop new and existing businesses, which will provide employment and benefit the British economy.
<P>
The amendment would fundamentally change the new CGT regime, which promotes enterprise and rewards risk-taking. It would blur the focus of the Government's reforms and leave them wide open to abuse. I know that the hon. Gentleman does not support the Government's reforms, but he would not expect me to accept an amendment that undermined our policy.
<P>
The definitions of "trading company" and of "trading group", to which the hon. Gentleman referred, apply in contexts where the amount of relief in question is restricted and where the company or group in question owns chargeable assets that are non-business assets. No such restriction is made for taper purposes, so the definitions need to be correspondingly tighter.
<P>
However, when a company qualifies as a trading company notwithstanding insubstantial non-trading activities the Bill's approach is less restrictive than that adopted towards retirement relief and gifts relief. For those reliefs, an apportionment would be made and the relief will be restricted. Business assets taper relief will be available without restriction.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman's amendment may not be technically perfect, and policy-wise it cuts across our intentions. It is therefore unacceptable and the Committee should reject it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> That was a rather weak justification of the Government's case. On exploitation, the Financial Secretary claimed that the established definition of trading companies, which uses the phrase "wholly or mainly", implies that a holding company that received 50 per cent. of its income from other companies and which therefore constituted investment income would qualify and would gain from the beneficial tapering of business assets. That involves a definition that distinguishes business assets from non-business assets, and assets that are used in the home by individuals for their own consumption and enjoyment from those that are used in business. It does not involve a distinction between investment income and trading income.
<P>
The Financial Secretary's explanation for not accepting the principle that lies behind the amendment is fallacious, and she should reconsider the point. We are discussing one simple point the distinction between business assets and non-business assets and nothing more. People who invest in a company, 50 per cent. of the income of which is not trading income, are not using that company to hold or receive income that would be regarded as domestic and non-business.
<P>
The Financial Secretary also argued that the amendment would escalate the Exchequer costs of a revenue-neutral reform. Will she give a rough estimate not a precise figure, which I do not expect her to have of the extent of the Exchequer cost which the amendment would cause the Government to lose?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I cannot give the precise figure that the hon. Gentleman requested. The question is not whether he feels that I should agree with his approach. His amendment cuts across the purpose of the Government's CGT reforms and the use of the taper. If more generous relief is available and widens the number of company assets, the cost to the Exchequer will inevitably be greater. I cannot give the precise figure if he is particularly interested and writes to me, I will try to find it but it is not relevant to the amendment. What is relevant is that it would cut across the principal of the reforms, which is why we cannot accept it.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Given the assurance that the Financial Secretary will write to me with the figure I doubt that it is significant, but she assured us that it is, so it would be helpful to have a letter from her explaining what it is I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That this schedule be the Twentieth schedule to the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I listened with great admiration to my hon. Friends and, this morning, to my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond). They used great skill to explain their detailed amendments to the schedule. Their points have not been satisfactorily answered, not just because Ministers have difficulty mastering the full complexity of their own legislation, but, in this case, also because the new capital gains tax scheme is flawed.
<P>
Those flaws are only now becoming apparent and Ministers, whatever their skill and experience, are on shifting ground. The reason goes back to the failure to consult adequately on this huge and ambitious reform to capital gains tax. When big tax changes were contemplated in the past, it was the practice of previous Governments to issue a White Paper or consultation document on the proposals, which in turn allowed the relevant Select Committee and other interested hon. Members, outside practitioners, the press, the Law Society and other professional bodies to comment in advance of the legislation being drafted. In this case, the Government simply invited everyone last November to write in with their bright ideas about reform or CGT. That is a different matter and the consequence is that the proposals, which were not the preferred option of most commentators and interested parties, failed to receive the degree of scrutiny that they deserve. The result has been enormous complexity. Instead of abolishing indexation and replacing it with a new tapering system, the Government have ended up with both. Indexation is not being abolished; it is being frozen, so all records must be maintained. Bolted on to that is a highly complex tapering system and the difficulty is demonstrated by the problem of designing software for outside practitioners to deal with the affairs of their clients and taxpayers. There have been many comments in the press on the difficulties of complying with the legislation in all good faith.
<P>
We are also returning to the old problem of catching inflationary gains. I thought that we had finally recognised the unfairness of taxing gains that have nothing to do with real profits, but which are simply the consequence of inflation.
<P>
As Inland Revenue press release No. 16 published on Budget day makes clear, the Government expect that taper relief will not benefit shareholders in public companies for up to seven years if there is only inflationary growth. Where there is real asset growth of 3 per cent. per year, there will be no benefit until the asset has been held for at least 10 years.
<P>
Those calculations were made on the basis of a press release issued on Budget day. We now know that inflation is likely to worsen, and that the economy is experiencing a persistent inflationary problem. The Government's inflation target has been met in only one month since the election. An associated problem is that the Bank of England will soon be required by statute law to continue to increase interest rates in order to meet that inflation target, during what might prove to be a recession. The effect on taxpayers will be very serious. They will cease to be protected in any way from those inflation gains.
<P>
Taxpayers' behaviour will therefore be induced by the tax system rather than by rational investment decisions. For example, more money already goes into investment trusts, unit trusts and other mutual funds so that investors can continue to derive the advantage from switching between investments without incurring short-term capital gains tax. That is disadvantageous, because this country is seeking to bring about a genuine shareholder democracy in which individuals take a close interest in the affairs of the companies in which they invest.
<P>
However, those who take such an interest, who subsequently decide that they do not like the company in question, and who therefore sell their investment in the short term, will incur the very high penal rates of capital gains tax. They are already being advised to switch their investments into collective funds, so that the manager of those funds can continue to switch investments without incurring any tax penalty. The individual investor will be locked into an investment trust, and therefore be shielded from the operation and performance of the individual companies in which that fund invests. A barrier will therefore be erected between the investor and the performance of the company in the real economy.
<P>
That is damaging, particularly in the context of events overseas. A number of other economic models put the individual investor in the back seat to his or her detriment. In Germany, the holding of shares by banks rather than individuals in fact creates an incestuous relationship between the investor and the investing company. As a result, underperforming assets and companies are not always subject to corrective action.
<P>
A similar problem recently came to light in the Pacific basin, during the Asian crisis. There, the Government, the public sector and the private sector are in collusion. Very few independent checks are made on the performance of individual investments.
<P>
In continental Europe and in the Pacific, admiration is consequently increasing for what has been rather dismissively described as the Anglo-Saxon model. That model is built on the basis that shareholders own and control companies, and that their decisions should therefore be paramount. Indeed, company law and the reporting of companies' accounts is intended to tell shareholders what is going on, so that they can if necessary take corrective action.
<P>
The cult of the active shareholder is clearly being put at risk if shareholders are encouraged not to invest directly in companies but to shield their investments in mutual funds. That is especially damaging for the small-company sector, in particular for small quoted companies because they are often not the favourites of fund managers who, for traditional, safety and risk-adverse reasons, invest in larger companies that are members of the FTSE. That has been explained to the Government by representatives of smaller companies. If the liquidity of their market is damaged, their entrepreneurial spirit which the Government have made so much about wishing to foster and encourage is undermined.
<P>
A private investor who persists in his wish to hold companies individually will be discouraged from switching from underperforming companies. If he does so after a year or two, he will be penalised; but if he sits on an underperforming, unsatisfactory company for 10 years, he will get the advantages that are built into the schedule.

<P>

<B>Mr. Andrew Love </B>(Edmonton): In relation to that, does the right hon. Gentleman agree with the Institute of Directors which said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"there may be a case for taxing short-term gains which are, in essence, of the nature of trading rather than investment"?<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> Yes, The hon. Gentleman takes me to my next point. There is a case for taxing short-term gains, but in no way can a gain over fewer than 10 years be defined as short term. I would look sympathetically on a tax system that taxed short-term gain, perhaps after a year or two, and then tapered steeply down to a near zero or zero rate for assets held for longer. However, that does not fit the Government's model. Their tapering system does not fit in with what the IOD or my right hon. Friend the Member for Hitchin and Harpenden (Mr. Lilley), the previous shadow Chancellor, have suggested.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey </B>(Kingston and Surbiton): Why does the right hon. Gentleman think that short-term gains should be taxed more than long-term gains?
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> There is a case for taxing trading gains more heavily and at a higher rate than investments. The definition of a trading gain could be of a security that is held for a year or two. There is no particular merit I think that this is what lies behind the hon. Gentleman's question in holding on to a security or investment for 10 years rather than two, three or four years. When capital gains tax was introduced in the early 1960s, it was levied on short-term gains, as my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge will remember.
<P>
<B>Mr. Philip Hammond </B>(Runnymede and Weybridge): Does my right hon. Friend agree that there is no case for taxing purely inflationary gains?
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> Yes, I tried to emphasise that point.
<P>
The tapering system is second best. The previous Government tried to reduce the level of capital gains tax. Indeed, we had considerable success in gradually bringing down the lower rate of capital gains tax to align it with the standard rate of income tax. As we took a penny off income tax in each successive Budget, so the lower rate of capital gains tax was reduced accordingly. The tapering system is second best to low taxation.
<P>
I want to draw attention to an anomaly: the Government, who are seeking to free up the economic and trading system and make companies more responsive, will have the opposite effect if they implement the clause and schedule. For example, investors who, after buying shares in BP or the Maxwell group, become convinced after a year or two that the management is not up to scratch, might decide to send the directors of the company a message by selling the shares and buying those of Shell or some other public company.
<P>
They will be inhibited from doing that by the knowledge that they will incur a penal rate of capital gains tax. They will not incur that penal rate if they merely sit on what they have, even though the company is unsatisfactory and run by directors who are incompetent and perhaps dishonest, as was the case with the Maxwell group. That cannot be good for the economy or for Britain's long-term performance as a trading nation. People will be locked into a wrong investment as a direct result of the change proposed by the Government.
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
This highly complex system retains indexation and imposes on it a new and untried system of tapering. It has a perverse incentive, as do the Bill's proposals for retirement relief. It also contains a disguised tax increase for most investors. For all those reasons, we shall oppose the reform unless and until the Government table another set of amendments.
<P>
I seriously feel that the Government are in difficulty with this reform. Too many outside commentators have made known their views at too great a length to be ignored. It would be better for the Government to introduce amendments this year instead of waiting for future Finance Bills.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey </B>(Kingston and Surbiton): I am increasingly worried by the number of times that I agree with the right hon. Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory). I look forwrd to clause 158, which deals with the European single currency. I am sure that our views will not coincide then.
<P>
However, when the right hon. Member for Wells said that the flaws in these proposals had grown more apparent since the Budget, I could not have agreed with him more. On Budget day and in the debate on the Floor of the House, I confess that I and my party were not sure whether we supported the principle behind taper relief. Like the Government, we are worried about short-termism, although we made it clear that we opposed the technical details of the clause. It was evident then that the Government had not thought out clause 119 and schedule 20 properly, and we voted against the schedule on the Floor of the House. We tried to persuade the House to delay the introduction of taper relief to allow another year for consultation. Unfortunately, we failed, but we hope that the Committee will reject schedule 20 so that there can be more consultation.
<P>
Liberal Democrat Members have listened to all the arguments, inside and outside the House. We are utterly convinced that the taper relief proposls are wrong in principle, as I shall explain.
<P>
The Government argue that taper relief will favour long-termism, encourage investment, favour entrepreneurs and penalise short-term speculators. On the Floor of the House, the Financial Secretary summarised the aims of Government policy as being
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"clearly to encourage long-term investment and discourage short-termism." [Official Report, 29 April 1998; Vol. 311, c. 371.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We can agree with those aims, but is this the right measure to achieve them? For three main reasons, we believe that it is not.
<P>
First, the case has not been made we doubt that it can be made to support the Government's decision to deem gains of two or three years as short term. I agree with the definition of the difference between short-term and long-term gains offered by the right hon. Member for Wells. Why are such gains economically worse than long-term gains? Why does the Bill discriminate against them?
<P>
Secondly, the Government's solution of placing a tax incentive in the capital gains tax system does not tackle the real cause of the short-termism and under-investment apparent in the British economy. Thirdly, even if one agrees with the Government's assumptions, the proposed change in the capital gains tax regime would not achieve what they want.
<P>
The problem with the Government's argument that short-term gains are wrong is that in certain instances, short-term gains are clearly beneficial to the company and should, if anything, be encouraged. The Government provided no evidence of the awful nature of short-term gains. Many markets and business opportunities can occur only in a relatively short period.
<P>
In an increasingly high-technology, knowledge-based economy, many new products and processes have a fairly short life cycle. A company may have only a short lifespan and the gains realised by an individual's successful entrepreneurial activity may have been realised over a fairly short period. Indeed, many business opportunities are by their nature time limited, be they related to short-term fads the Teletubbies, for example, to which my hon. Friend the Member for Gordon (Mr. Bruce) was compared by the Financial Secretary's colleague or to fashion.
<P>
Earlier this afternoon, I was over the river in Jubilee gardens viewing an exhibition by student fashion designers. I saw some superb work that had been done by very young people who are now looking to set up companies. Fashion companies typically have a short lifespan, but what is wrong with those companies and the economic benefits that they provide?
<P>
There again, gains may have to be short-lived due to unexpected events affecting business owners or investors. There may be a death in the family, or someone could lose a job. Why should those gains be seen by the tax system as somehow worse than long-term gains? Indeed, I cannot see why short-term gains are not seen as beneficial in some cases. They encourage a vibrant venture capital industry, which may seek to achieve gains over a short period, not a 10-year period. A vibrant venture capital industry is a sign of a healthy and dynamic economy. On the other hand, locking in long-term capital because of tax incentives may be extremely damaging to a company by preventing adaptation and innovation and introducing paralysis into the system. Government Ministers have not made an argument against short-term gains.
<P>
That is not to say that there is not something called short-termism in the British economy. I have read many articles, in publications ranging from the Financial Times and The Economist to more academic journals, that try to analyse what is meant by short-termism, what causes it and what measures could tackle such a phenomenon. There is a case for many industries and firms to think and plan long term and to invest in such areas as research and development and education and training major capital investments that have only a long-term pay-off. Clearly, we should encourage such firms and industries to make those investments.
<P>
Do firms fail to think long term? If so, why do they fail? The evidence of failure is mixed. One of the most successful parts of British industry is the pharmaceutical industry. By its very nature, it must invest in pharmaceutical research and in the development of drugs, which have only long-term pay-offs. If short-termism is endemic in our financial system, one should be surprised that Britain has a comparative advantage in an industry that requires long-term investments.
<P>
It has often been claimed that there is such a thing as merger mania particularly at the height of the economic cycle where takeovers appear to be rampant and driven more by short-term financial considerations than the long-term interests of British industry. Such a short-termist culture may exist in parts of British industry, but I contend that the measure does not address that type of short-termism. There are many theories on the causes of short-termism and the solutions to it. Some people argue that we need to change our management structures. The previous Government, by setting up the Greenbury committee and by trying to promote the roles of non-executive directors, went some way towards addressing that potential cause of short-termism.
<P>
However, other elements have not been dealt with. Pension fund reporting procedures, under which fund managers have to maximise value on one day in a quarter for their reports instead of taking an average, may be another cause of short-termism. Causes of short-termism exist within the macroeconomy. Hon. Members have just heard the Chancellor of the Exchequer talking on the Floor of the House about the need for long-termism in the public sector and in macroeconomic variables such as inflation and exchange rates. Other theories focus on the takeover rules as a cause of short-termism.
<P>
The Government have not put out a paper that reviews those theories and comes to the conclusion that the tax system is the cause of short-termism. They will not make a convincing case until they do so. I have heard few arguments in the debate to the effect that the CGT regime is to blame for short-termism. The schedule provides the wrong solution because the Government have made a misdiagnosis.

<P>

<B>Mr. Clive Efford </B>(Eltham): Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the pressures on companies to maintain investment causes them to make a choice between putting money into research and development or paying dividends to their investors to maintain the value of their commodities? The key problem of short-termism is that the company's investors will seek short-term profits at the expense of investment in research and development. Companies are happy constantly to give money to their investors in order to retain their capital assets.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> The evidence suggests that that is not the cause of short-termism. There have been significant improvements in the standards of communications between public limited companies and pension fund managers, and that has improved investors' understanding of companies' investments in research and development. Increasingly, financial markets understand that the funds that are put aside for investment research and development need to be factored into the City's valuation of a company. There is little evidence to back up the hon. Gentleman's view.
<P>
<B>Mr. Efford:</B> My point is that it is the speed with which money can be transferred to another company for short-term investment gain that creates the disincentive for investment in research and development.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I do not think that the hon. Gentleman has made his point convincingly. Of course investors can move their funds from one company to another. However, if the company can persuade its investors, be they institutional investors or direct shareholders, that the investment that it is making in research and development will give them a decent return, the valuation of the shares in the short term will reflect that. The short-term valuation reflects discounts and future yields. If the financial markets are operating efficiently, as they increasingly do as the quality of information improves, the sorts of problems that the hon. Gentleman outlined will not exist.
<P>
Let us assume for a moment that the CGT change is well-targeted on the problem of short-termism and that the new regime will bring with it an incentive for long-termism. If that is so, why is the long term defined as a rolling 10-year period? That period is arbitrary; it is unrelated to commercial reality. When different types of assets such as software or hardware depreciate, the accountancy profession uses a variety of time periods. Given his background, perhaps the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton can give me some specific examples. As a definition of the long term, 10 years bears no relation to commercial reality.
<P>
If the Government are so concerned about long-termism, why is the change accompanied by the abolition of bed and breakfasting? It has all come too surely. Bed and breakfasting is a system that assists and encourages ordinary investors to stick with their investments. Abolishing it will encourage short-termism, and is against the whole point of what the Government are attempting. If long-termism is their aim, why is the system so complex? That complexity will inevitably lead to greater costs , which will act as a disincentive for individual shareholding.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that in the absence of indexation provision, the ability to bed and breakfast and to take advantage of the annual exemption is an essential protection for small investors?
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I could not agree more, and I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will hear the Liberal Democrats' reasons for supporting his view when the Committee considers later clauses.
<P>
I am concerned about the complexity of the system, which will make it more expensive and more difficult for individual shareholders to invest directly in companies. That will give an advantage to institutional shareholding. As the right hon. Member for Wells told the Committee, evidence shows that money is going into unit trusts and investment trust funds because such investors have a greater advantage than the ordinary shareholder in coping with the complexity. They are being given a comparative advantage against direct shareholding. As the right hon. Gentleman said, there is some evidence to show that fund managers are more short-termist than the direct shareholder. Again, the provision goes against the Government's stated aim.
<P>
The change to a taper relief system is wrong in principle. Short-term gains are often beneficial, and the tax system should not discriminate between short-term and long-term in the proposed manner. It is also wrong because any short-termism in the economy is not caused by the current CGT regime, and because the taper relief regime can itself increase short-termism.
<P>
Those arguments were not fully made in the House, where hon. Members had to grapple with the complexity of the Government's proposals. Perhaps that was partly because the right. hon Member for Hitchin and Harpenden is rather sympathetic to a taper relief system, and published proposals before the Budget announcement. The Conservatives felt unable to mount an all-out attack on the underlying principle.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The hon. Gentleman will be aware that the proposals advanced by my right hon. Friend the Member for Hitchin and Harpenden sought to take the tapers right down to zero after 10 years. They are, therefore, hugely different from the Government's proposals, which leave the lowest rate at either 10 or 24 per cent. Long-term inflationary gains are, therefore still subject to tax under those proposals. Mr right. hon. Friend's proposals would mean that after 10 years, no capital gains tax would apply to gains, including inflationary gains.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> The hon. Gentleman is right. The proposals of the right hon. Member for Hitchin and Harpenden did contain that measure, which is substantially different from the Government's proposals. The principle behind the proposed system, however, was to favour long-term gains over short-term gains. That is the principle that I am trying to argue against.
<P>
The Liberal Democrats are currently the only voice in Parliament arguing against the principle behind the proposed regime. We will continue to do that, because the Government have got their analysis and thus their solutions to the short-termist problem wrong.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Loughton </B>(East Worthing and Shoreham): I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way at this late stage. Given his degree of agreement, and as he appears to be coming over to the Opposition's way of thinking, will he confirm that capital gains tax is in principle a clog in the system, and that it does not encourage the most efficient use of capital? Does he agree that if ways can be found to abolish capital gains tax without abuse through the income tax system, it would be better if it did not exist at all?
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I am happy to agree that capital gains tax causes great distortions in the tax system. The Committee should focus on the rider to the hon. Gentleman's comments. He said that CGT could be abolished only if it could be ensured that the income tax system was not abused. That problem has proved insuperable to many tax theorists. No serious tax adviser has suggested a new regime that would abolish the current CGT regime and prevent abuse of the income tax system. If that had been possible, the previous Government would have abolished CGT. I am sure that they asked their civil servants to produce such a system, but they were clearly unable to do so.
<P>
I conclude by urging the Committee to think again at this late stage and to reject the schedule and the move to taper relief assistance for capital gains tax.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> This has been a wide-ranging debate with many interesting contributions about the philosophy and theology of the taper and about the nature of long-term and short-term gains. I want to ask some specific questions and to seek specific clarification from the Financial Secretary.
<P>
First, we have heard a great deal about the system's complexity. There is much concern among practitioners about paragraph 6 and about the way in which the relief of capital losses will interact with taper relief. Many practitioners identify that as a nightmare for those who seek to fill in forms for self-assessment the typical small investor. In the light of that, as the Financial Secretary made any estimate of the increased cost of collection to the Revenue that will result from the complicated measures in the schedule? Practitioners outside this place believe that they will pose severe difficulties for the Revenue in terms of manpower costs. The suggestion that the taxpayer will get assistance from the Revenue if he sends a form in before 30 September does not relate to the relief of capital losses, with which the taxpayer will still have to deal without assistance from the Revenue. There will be much confusion and many badly filled-in forms. Will the Financial Secretary give the Committee an assurance that there will be no increase in the cost to the Revenue of collecting the tax as a result of the regime that the schedule introduces? If she believes that costs will increase, however, has she made an estimate of the increase?
<P>
My second point relates to the definition of qualifying company and to the 25 per cent. shareholding threshold in paragraph 6. Why does the test not track that used for definitions of close companies? Why can the Bill not aggregate the holdings of associates and trustees to arrive at the 25 per cent. threshold?
<P>
The third point on which I seek clarification relates to paragraph 10(2). It is not unusual for trustees to buy property on the basis of a non-recourse loan. That relates to their unwillingness to incur personal liabilities. Will the Financial Secretary confirm that paragraph 10(2) will not operate if a property drops in value and the equity that the trustees have in it is nil? Such a confirmation would be valuable.
<P>
The fourth and final point on which I seek enlightenment relates back to the interesting debate that we had on the definition of full-time working employees. I listened with great interest to the Financial Secretary's response to our points. Will she confirm that a leading firm of accountants is wrong to state:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"We are aware that the Revenue have argued in respect of retirement relief that an individual who works for say 40 hours a week is still not a full time employee if he has a second employment or other business activity to which he devotes part of his time"?<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If the Revenue argues by analogy with retirement relief, it is indeed the case that we had a point when speaking to the amendment. The comments made earlier by the Financial Secretary to the Treasury do not accord with the advice given to its clients by a leading firm of accountants in the City of London. Will the hon. Lady elucidate on that and on my other points?
<P>

<P>

<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I apologise for not being present for all the debate on the schedule. I listened carefully to the opening speeches by my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells and by the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey). The Economic Secretary should pause to consider the words of the Chartered Institute of Taxation, which stated that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"judged by the criterion of simplicity, the present system of tapering is an abject failure."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The great merit of a system of tapering is that if it is simple, short and sweet, many of the provisions and exemptions in the capital gains tax legislation to mitigate its worst effects can be done away with. A simple regime could be in place if all gains up to, say, three years were subject to capital gains tax, perhaps with a slightly lower rate in the third year, and longer-term gains were all exempt. Retirement relief provisions would not be needed in that case. No other form of tapering would be needed; we would not need to consider business rollover relief and the other complications.
<P>
What justification is there for a capital gains tax? If there is any justification, it is on the type of short-term gain that is akin to income. There is no justification on a longer-term gain, because it reflects an increase in the value of an asset and, by and large, assets increase in value because the income, or the prospective income, from the asset has also increased. Any increased income will be subject to income tax or corporation tax in the normal way. On long-term gains, any system of capital gains tax acts as a form of double taxation. That is why, having introduced capital gains tax in the 1960s, Labour Governments, in a tepid way, and Conservative Governments much more vigorously, cut down the ways in which capital gains tax applied. It is still a vicious and unfair tax, but at least we mitigated the worst consequences of double taxation.

<P>
The double taxation of capital clearly constrains future investment, which in turn constrains future growth and future tax revenues.
<P>
<B>Mr. Derek Twigg </B>(Halton): In one breath the hon. Gentleman tells us that he is in favour of abolishing capital gains tax, and in the next that the Conservatives did their best to mitigate its effects when they were in power. Can the hon. Gentleman tell us more about his party's record on the issue?
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> The record of our period in power is that we introduced a number of important concessions into capital gains tax. We were going to abolish capital gains tax in the long term. That was our policy, which was stated in our manifesto. I regret that we were not able to make more progress in implementing our policy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Love:</B> May I take up the matter raised by the Liberal Democrat spokesman about how the income tax base would be protected if CGT was abolished?
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> The answer is very simple: if CGT is retained with a short and sweet taper, short-term gains would still be captured by capital gains tax legislation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> In answer to the matter raised by the hon. Member for Edmonton (Mr. Love), is my hon. Friend aware that many countries, such as Australia, Canada, Finland, France, Japan, Luxembourg, Norway, Spain, Sweden and the United States have ways of integrating capital gains with income? Many options are available but the Government have taken none of them.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend because he puts his finger on the pulse 
<P>
<B>Mr. Efford rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I will answer my hon. Friend before I give way to the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
<B>Mr. Efford:</B> It is the same point.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I that case there is no need to repeat it. My hon. Friend points to the crux of the matter: we are told that we have a radical Government who are willing to introduce brand new ideas, but when it comes to capital gains tax they merely tinker around the edges, which makes the system far more complex. They retain indexation for companies while introducing tapering for individuals and trusts. They have invented a system judged, as I said, by the CIT as an abject failure in terms of achieving simplicity. Schedule 20 is of a piece with that.
<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman believe that the amendments proposed by the Government in relation to business assets relief are significantly more generous to the wealthiest in the nation than any proposal brought before the House by the Conservative party?
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for making the point that the previous Government, in trying to mitigate the effects of capital gains tax, always took it as their first principle that the little guy and the small business should always be helped the most because they were the big business of the future. The Conservative Government therefore focused their efforts to mitigate the effects of capital gains tax on those at the lower end of the scale. We did not try to ensure that those such as Mr. Eccelestone, who has 1 billion company, should pay only 10 per cent. tax when he sells that company.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman believe that during 18 years of Conservative Government there was a significant export of individuals and their capital to avoid capital gains tax altogether?
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I look forward to the debate that we will shortly have on such issues. We are all aware of one or two well publicised examples of people who have tried to export their capital to minimise their liability to taxation. [Hon Members: "Where is he?"] Indeed, it is a pity that those with the greatest knowledge of such matters are not here today as expected. As regards the hon. Gentleman's general point, those who are the richest have the most able advisers, and a system of capital gains tax will always unfortunately be riddled with anomalies. There will always be potential escape routes. In trying to create escape routes for those for whom the system is hardest, doors will be opened through which others will attempt to move. That is another reason why the massive, over-complicated structure of capital gains tax is thoroughly bad for business, for the future and for the tax base of this country.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> May I say how happy I am to be speaking to a schedule at last. I have sat here cringing at the pronunciation of the word as "skedule" by Labour and Oppposition Members. That is an utter Americanism. Worse still, Ministers have switched from "skedule" to "schedule" with gay abandon.
<P>
It cannot be denied that this country's whole capital gains tax system is highly complex. Despite the Financial Secretary's promise, in answer to a written question, that the Budget changes in capital gains tax would lead to eventual simplication of the current system, we are far from such a simplication.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes much play of the two different pronunciations of the word "schedule". I would not have given the subject so much time, given how long the Opposition have already wasted talking about the record in Hansard, because how will Hansard distinguish between the two pronunciations in the written record?
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I [Hon. Members: "Answer."] It is tempting. I am not aware of an audio version of Hansard to make it any clearer.
<P>
In the interests of no more time wasting, and if we can forget the contribution of the hon. Member for Croydon, Central (Mr. Davies), I was saying that capital gains tax has been made much more complex by these changes. One need only consider the experts who have made pronouncements on the subject, such as the Securities Institute, which said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"There can be no question of the proposed changes simplifying the system. To say so is equivalent to maintaining that black is white.
"</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Institute of Chartered Accountants said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"These changes have not been properly thought through.
"</UL></FONT>
<P>
Arthur Andersen called it
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"An administrative nightmare. Far from simplifying the legislation, as years go by the revised rules will become more and more burdensome. It will be very difficult in the context of self-assessment for taxpayers to calculate chargeable gains."</UL></FONT>
<P>
No respectable professional dealing with the subject has a word to say in support of any of these measures leading to a simplification of the system. If capital gains tax is already complex and destined to become far more complex in the UK, it is especially complex and diverse in the rest of the OECD. I alluded to that earlier in relation to the intervention of my hon. Friend the Member for Guildford (Mr. St. Aubyn).
<P>
In Germany, short-term gains are taxed as income, but there is no long-term gains tax. Gains on disposals of moveable property are taxable as income if they are made within less than six months. In Sweden, there is no liability where moveable property is held for five years. In Denmark, business gains and shares held over for three years are reduced by 30 per cent. a year and exempt after seven years. In Japan, after five years, half the gain is subject to income tax. There is a plethora of different systems throughout the world, some of which charge short-term capital gains to income.
<P>
My point is that there was absolutely no pressure on the Government from the EU, for once, to harmonise capital gains tax rates because they are in a complete mess throughout the whole of the European Union. The Government seem to have taken the most complicated examples from any EU or OECD countries, put them in the melting pot, and come up with the worst possible solution to every possible scenario all after their great consultation exercise.
<P>
No doubt, the Economic Secretary will accuse me of denigrating the consultation process, but I must say that this consultation process, which happened last July, was rather short and sweet, and led to no further consultation, as everyone has bemoaned. I believe that it led to about 171 responses, but despite constant requests from the Opposition to see the full details, the consultation process produced a less than two-page annex to the Budget press release. The annex skimmed over the details of the responses so we do not know the full measure of them. That is not what I call a consultation exercise.
<P>
We all know the shortcomings of the schedule. It abolishes indexation and, despite the denials of the Financial Secretary, it has effectively introduced 18 new levels of personal CGT. It has greatly complicated the last-in, first-out system, so that every acquisition will have to be recorded and worked out, and it is a disincentive to use capital efficiently. In addition, the rates are still too high. One need only examine the rates that prevail in all the other countries that I have mentioned to see that our levels of CGT are too high. The burden of CGT is at the upper end of the world scale.
<P>
The result of all this is that, yet again, the tax tail will wag the investment dog. The extra complexity and paperwork that will have to be introduced would have been ameliorated to some extent if the taper had gone to zero, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Hitchin and Harpenden suggested. It will be very expensive to collect indeed, it already is and it is a most inefficient tax. In 1996-97, it brought in a yield of about 1.4 billion, but more than 4 per cent. of that sum was spent collecting it. That is several times more expensive than inheritance tax, income tax, VAT and all the other major taxes. It is an inefficient tax to collect and to calculate.
<P>
The clauses and schedules relating to CGT are full of anomalies: there will be a two-year no man's land before the taper kicks in; losses will be applied against gains to give the saver the least efficient CGT saving; it will be a nightmare for unit trust holders of income accumulation units to calculate; and it will work to the advantage of the investor only in times of low inflation, which might be okay for the moment, but there may be a different scenario in a few years.
<P>
The taper locks people in for reasons of tax rather than financial prudence. It will encourage people to hold on to badly performing stocks and it will reduce market liquidity. Collective investments will become more attractive to investors, but that will stifle choice, which is at the heart of the Government's thinking on investment matters or so they claim.
<P>
I said earlier that CGT clogged up the system. The Government's proposals are a deterrent to investors who sell investment. They will encourage people to prefer cash and fixed interest over equities at a time when the Government are reducing the gilt market, which has a lack of liquidity, and encouraging investors and savers to make prudent long-term investments for their later life.
<P>
The schedules and clauses relating to CGT involve a backdoor wealth tax. A natural extension of the Government's proposals the alarm bells are ringing about this is that before long they may tax capital gains within pooled vehicles. The new rules are more favourable to assets with faster growth rates, and they are entirely retrospective in relation to the two-year no man's land.
<P>
In conclusion, the proposals will be rushed in, they will not work and in a year or two the Government will have to quietly revisit this whole sorry tale. They should delay for proper and further consultations, and they should not continue with this complete dog's breakfast. Their proposals contain the worst possible combination of all the other CGT systems around the EU and the OECD.

<P>

<B>Dr. Vincent Cable </B>(Twickenham): I should like to make a few further remarks in support of my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston and Surbiton. We spend much time in Committee navigating the more obscure highways and byways of tax law, but it is important to consider briefly the basic principles that lie behind what is probably the Budget's most important tax change.
<P>
Much of our discussion will necessarily centre on complexity and anomalies, but most of the complexity is inherent in the underlying concept. It would almost certainly have been impossible to apply tapering relief retrospectively over long periods of time to replace indexation, in view of the extended periods of variable[Dr. Vincent Cable]
inflation that we have had. Doing so would have produced very unfair and anomalous results. It was inherent in the change that two systems would run in parallel, and complexity was born from the idea of a changeover in the system. The justification for the cost and complexity of the change needs to be demonstrated more convincingly. That involves fundamental questions about whether long-termism is served by the new tax, and the associated problems of short-termism and long-termism.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Kingston and Surbiton covered much of that ground, but some points need to be emphasised. The distaste for short-termism involves a mixture of prejudices, including the alleged problems of asset stripping, anxieties about the lack of research and development and an underlying distrust of markets in general, especially of secondary markets. I began to wonder if such thinking had spread to the right hon. Member for Wells I saw him wrinkle his nose with distaste at the thought of trading and I wondered whether Mr. Will Hutton's books had become part of the obligatory reading at Conservative party weekends.
<P>
Trading, as much as other forms of market activity, performs a useful function. My hon. Friend referred to specific sorts of investor, including fashion industry venture capitalists [Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Will the owner of the device that sounds like an ice cream van switch it off?
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Dr. Cable:</B> We have discussed some of the companies that have a specific need for a short-term outlet, but even if we take the most basic of share-trading activities, it is important to reflect on why that is often an important activity. If a company's shares are seriously over-valued in relation to its earnings potential and efficiency, it will attract a large amount of investment of the wrong sort to be used efficiently. The investor who sells shares and buys others is performing a public service in the same way as a company that invests long term in capital. That is how markets work and has long been recognised in relation to capital gains tax. Government securities were taken out of the CGT framework and that prevented the working of that particular market.
<P>
Even if we accept the Government's premise that there is a serious problem of short-termism in the markets which has to be addressed with this tax change, there are difficulties which undermine the Government's objective. I shall cite three ways in which that will operate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Love:</B> I am slightly confused by the comments that you made in relation to those made earlier 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I have not made any such comments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Love:</B> I apologise, Mr. Butterfill. Is the hon. Gentleman arguing that there is no such thing as short-termism in the British economy?
<P>
<B>Dr. Cable:</B> I have great doubts about how meaningful the idea of short-termism is. It has become a clich\ae and is applied to specific and technical areas such as taxation with damaging side-effects, which are often counter-productive.
<P>
The first example of the way in which the Government's objective will be undermined is long-term pensioner investors who may have held shares for 20, 30 or 40 years and who will now sell them and be penalised for doing so by the way in which the taper system will operate. Such long-term investors will lose out under the new system.
<P>
The second example relates to inflation. If inflation is above the objective target rate, investors will be harmed. An important corollary is that the Government will have a vested interest in higher rates of inflation. The higher the rate of inflation, the higher the tax yield and it will be difficult to sustain inflationary discipline, whatever party is in power. We shall have a form of taxation it is an important source of revenue which will give the Government a vested interest in higher rates of inflation.
<P>
The third example the right hon. Member for Wells put his finger on it is that tax law will encourage investors to invest as part of institutions rather than as individuals. One of the main criticisms of institutional investment, particularly as it operates through pension funds, is that it has precisely the effect highlighted earlier. Companies which try to adopt a long-term approach to research and development and so on are affected by the preoccupation of pension fund managers with quarterly results. I do not buy into that theory, but anyone who does should not be in favour of a system that encourages individuals, who may have a long-term commitment to particular shares, to switch to unit trusts and pension funds, which have a much greater churning of shares. If that is a worry, the provision is a counter-productive way of dealing with it.
<P>
When we discussed the matter on the Floor of the House, we argued that the legislation needed rethinking from first principles and that the Government would be well advised to reflect on it for another year and hold proper consultation with the industry. That argument was ridiculed at the time, but the vehemence of the reaction from so many important players in the United Kingdom economy suggests that it was a correct judgment. We are taking this opportunity to reiterate our fundamental objections to the way in which the tax reform is being managed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown </B>(Cotswold): I want to develop the theme started by my hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham. He raised the matter of the abolition of indexation relief and the introduction of taper relief for chargeable gains. The interaction between the two will at the very least distort investment decisions. At worst, it will result in some very unfair chargeable gains computations.
<P>
I am not surprised that Labour Members have not participated in the debate. They have a selective short-term memory. They have forgotten that in 1975, the monthly rate of inflation for the retail prices index rose to 26 per cent. If the current inflation rate were to increase significantly, the provisions in the schedule would have a severe impact.
<P>
Work conducted in America has shown that the increase in business activity that would follow a reduction in capital gains by a taper to zero over five years would make such a measure self-financing.
<P>
It does not require a genuise to work out the CGT is highly complicated, and that it involves huge compliance and collection costs that distort business and investment decisions. In the pursuit of tax simplification, it should be abolished, and the money should instead be more sensibly recovered through the income tax regime.
<P>
Reference was made this afternoon to the impossiblity of framing legislation to stop the avoidance of income tax through the conversion of income into capital. Given the ingenuity that parliamentary draftsmen of the Bill have demonstrated in the personal portfolio bond provisions, which allow wide scope for secondary legislation, I see no reason why the equally inventive Inland Revenue cannot draft such legislation. It would be possible to frame purposeful anti-avoidance legislation that would place the burden of proof on the taxpayer and ensure that schemes in which the taxpayer was involved were not merely intended to avoid income tax.
<P>
<B>Mr. Love:</B> If it is possible to frame such a law, will the hon. Gentleman tell us why it was never introduced during 18 years of a Conservative Government who were keen to abolish capital gains tax?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> If I may say so, that was a fatuous intervention. We need a manifesto commitment to abolish capital gains tax; had we been elected, we would have fulfilled it. That is in marked contrast to the Government, who have made a hugely complicated tax yet more complicated.
<P>
<B>Mr. Efford:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman define the phrase "long term" in relation to a Conservative Government, as opposed to investment? Presumably, he has in mind two separate definitions. You had 18 years in which to abolish capital gains tax.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I did not have 18 years.
<P>
<B>Mr. Efford:</B> The hon. Gentleman's Government had 18 years, during which they failed to abolish capital gains tax. It is therefore a bit rich to say that that is what should now happen.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> The simple answer is that we inherited such a mess [Laughter.] In 1979 we inherited a supertax regime that, during one year of the previous Labour Government, rose to 101 per cent. We reduced the top rate of tax to 40 per cent. That shows the progress that we made. There was more progress to be made, but unfortunately it has all been reversed by the introduction of the schedule. The taxpayers will rue the day that they elected the Government.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> What an interesting clause stand part debate 
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> Schedule.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> schedule stand part debate. I do not know what I would do without the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham. He brightens up my life every Tuesday and Thursday. I often ask myself why that should be so. It is sad that my life has to be brightened up by the hon. Member, but he is always entertaining. [Hon. Members: "Just weekdays?"] Yes, any weekend that is brightened up by the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham must be a sad one.
<P>
First, I want to deal with the points made by the hon. Member for Twickenham. We debated the Bill in a Committee of the whole House on only 29 April, and although I understand that Liberal Democrat Members have discussed short-termism and long-termism, the hon. Member for Twickenham said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"We have no fundemantal objection to the clause." [Official Report, 29 April 1998; Vol, 311, c. 387.]</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is clause 119, which sets up the taper relief. His amendment accepted the entire clause and our debate today follows from that. The amendment would have required a delay of one year, but not a delay in principle. It is, therefore a little odd that his views shifted during that short period.
<P>
I entirely accept that the hon. Member for Twickenham has now had more time to study the clause and holds a slightly different view. However, a little consistency would help.

<P>

<B>Dr. Cable:</B> If the Financial Secretary had read the whole of my speech, she would have realised that many of the points that we made today about the fallacy of short-termism were made then. The main purpose of my intervention was to persuade her of the importance of delay. The more that Liberal Democrat Members study the clause, the more difficult and problematic it appears.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> There we have it. The critical answer from the Liberal Democrats is that we should delay. At least the views of Conservative Members are clear: sometimes they are for the taper and sometimes they are not. Sometimes they are in favour of capital gains tax and sometimes they are not, but at least they do not ask for delay.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> Will the hon. Lady give way?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I wish to make some progress.
<P>
We have had a long debate and some specific points were made that did not arise when we discussed the amendments. I will not repeat what I said when we debated clause 119 on the Floor of the House. Many points relating to my remarks at that time were made here today and my replies would be the same. Hon. Members can read what I said in those earlier debates in Hansard.
<P>
To put the reforms in context, the Government have designed the reforms to promore enterprise, to reward risk taking and to encourage long-term investment in place of a culture of short-termism and expediency. We want to encourage entrepreneurs to invest in their businesses, to develop those businesses and to create jobs for those in desparate need of employment. The Government have stated those objectives clearly.
<P>
Some questions were asked about consultation. That matter was debated on the Floor of the House. On behalf of the Government, the Inland Revenue issued a press release on 29 July 1997, seeking views on the[Dawn Primarolo]
capital gains tax system and the development of a reform package. Indeed, may Opposition Members quoted from the summary of that consultation exercise in debates on the Floor of the House. The hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham again referred this evening to the number of people who had submitted returns. I am sure that he has studied the code of practice that was published in December 1997 by the Inland Revenue, Customs and Excise and the Treasury. It presumes that all responses to a consultative exercise will be published unless the respondents request confidentiality.
<P>
The hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham asked why we did not publish all the responses. Consultation on capital gains tax preceded the publication of the code and respondents would not have known that they needed to request confidentiality if they did not want their responses to be made generally available.
<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Many of the responses were from individuals and some disclosed personal financial circumstances. I accept that it would be inappropriate to put it mildly to breach that confidentiality. The Government took note of the comments in forming their views of the reform.
<P>
In the debate on clause 119 on the Floor of the House, the right hon. Member for Wells threw in the point that computer systems cannot cope. One minute he criticises the Inland Revenue for not keeping pace with technology, the next he tells us that the work cannot be done. That is nonsense. The Revenue has had discussions with representatives of the computer software industry and most of its concerns have been dealt with satisfactorily. The remainder are being addressed. It is important that those discussions result in the provision of the necessary information to produce the software packages.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> The problem is not the fault of the Inland Revenue, but of the Government for introducing a system that is so complex. Many companies designing software for the new system simply will not have sufficient time to produce it before the system is implemented. With the best will in the world, the Inland Revenue cannot clear up a mess of the Government's own making. Outside practitioners and designers of software cannot cope with the speed and complexity of the change.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> It is nice that, for once, the right hon. Gentleman does not blame the Inland Revenue. There is no sign in the discussions on the development of software systems of the disaster that he forecasts.
<P>
An explanation of why the taper does not reduce to zero was fully debated on the Floor of the House under an amendment proposed by the then Shadow Chancellor, the right hon. Member for Hitchin and Harpenden. I repeat what I said then:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"We do not think that it is necessary to reduce the tax to zero to meet the objectives of the capital gains tax reform, nor do we think it a right or fair thing to do." [Official Report, 29 April 1998; Vol. 311, c. 375.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Today's debate is interesting when compared to the debate on clause 119, and I have quickly flicked through the Hansard report of that debate. It illustrates the utter confusion among Opposition Members. They do not understand what the Government are trying to do and even what they would do if they were in government. They have failed to understand things for some time.
<P>
The Government have been clear. I have said repeatedly that the taper is much simpler for new investors. Indexation will work its way out of the system. Conservative Members are trying to suggest that they are aware of those difficulties, but they know full well that a period of transition is necessary in the change from one system to another.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Will the Financial Secretary give way?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> Of course I will give way in a moment.
<P>
A period of transition is necessary. The Government must balance the questions of fairness to the taxpayer and clarity to Parliament. The hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds (Mr. Ruffley) asked about compliance costs and collections from the Inland Revenue. Although I do not have a copy available to give him, the Inland Revenue published an appraisal on 8 April, which demonstrated the long-term compliance benefits of the reforms and appraised the short-term increases in compliance costs, which, it is acknowledged, result from the transition from the existing system to the new system.
<P>
Hon. Members continue to implore the Government to be fair in the transition period, but decry as complex every measure that delivers that fairness. As we said on the Floor of the House, it is necessary to strike a balance between changing the system and maintaining fairness to taxpayers in that period of transition.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> May I seek clarification? Is the Financial Secretary saying that, apart from the increased costs of collection in the short term, acknowledged in the document published in April to which she referred, there will be no further, long-term costs of collection as a result of the changes introduced by the schedule?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I suggest that the hon. Gentleman reads the appraisal, which shows the long-term compliance benefits of the reforms and appraises 
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> Will the hon. Lady give way?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> Just a minute. Mr. Butterfill, when a question is asked, presumably an answer must be given before an intervention is allowed. This is the second time that I have replied to the point.
<P>
Information is available to demonstrate that clearly to members of the Committee. Before I return to the rest of the specific points raised by the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds, I give way to the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> With the advent of pooling, does the Minister agree that being unable to pool shares will add significantly to the costs of compliance?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> No. I do not agree with the hon. Gentleman. [Hon. Members: "Why not?"] Because he is wrong, and because that is not the Government's view. Our approach is informed by the appraisal's assessment of the long-term compliance costs of the reform. Such matters have been taken into consideration.
<P>
<B>Several hon. Members rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I will not give way. I should like to answer the questions asked by the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds in the debate, as opposed to the to-ing and fro-ing of hon. Members who want to make points now.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> Will the hon. Lady give way?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> No. I should like to answer the questions that hon. Members have asked in their speeches.
<P>
The second question of the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds was about the aggregation of holdings in associates arriving at 25 per cent. What is important is what the holder of the share brings to the company. That is the basic principle of the reforms. Including associates would have been more complex, so we did not do that.
<P>
The hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds asked a specific question I hope that I have it right about sub-paragraph (2) of paragraph 10. He asked what would happen if property value dropped to nil. I would ask the hon. Gentleman to write to me on that point as well, but if he can contain himself, I can tell him that sub-paragraph (2) does not catch the situation as he described it. However, if he wants to pursue that question more fully, I am more than happy for him to write to me.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman's final question was about Revenue practice in the capital gains manual at paragraph 63621, which was the subject of an amendment. I have spoken about the flexibility and importance of that point.
<P>
The Government's reforms are designed to promote enterprise, reward business and encourage long-term investment to replace the culture of short-termism and expediency. The taper is at the heart of those reforms. The percentage of the chargeable gain is reduced the longer the asset is held. It will lead to a fairer system and the rules will counter the wholly tax-driven activities that we shall debate in subsequent clauses which I nearly strayed on to, Mr. Butterfill, as did other hon. Members.
<P>
The schedule is an important part of the Government's reforms; it will improve the performance of United Kingdom businesses, promote enterprise and reward risk-taking. It will produce a fairer system once the new system is in operation in its entirety.
<P>
Question put. That this schedule be the Twentieth schedule to the Bill:

<P>

<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 79, in page 349, leave out lines 12 to 32.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it may be convenient to take amendments Nos. 269, in page 349, line 14, leave out "77, 86".
<P>
No. 270, in page 349, line 30, leave out "77, 86".
<P>
No. 81, in page 349, line 38, after "provides" insert "and".
<P>
No. 80, in page 349, leave out lines 40 to 41.
<P>
No. 82, in page 350, line 11, after "made," insert "and".
<P>
No. 83, in page 350, line 13, leave out from "2(2)(a)" to end of line 17.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> These are technical amendments. The purpose of all of them is to permit the attributed gains to the settlor to be taxed on the same basis as would actual gains had they been attributed to a normal individual that is, to permit tapering.
<P>
The Chartered Institute of Taxation is concerned about the provisions in paragraph 2 of schedule 21, which one of the amendments would delete for UK-resident trusts. It points out that the purpose of section 77 must be to ensure that where a settlor may benefit from a trust, the settlor should not gain any capital gains tax advantage from holding assets in that trust, but that he or she should not be disadvantaged by doing so.
<P>
Even prior to the Budget, there was such a disadvantage because a loss realised in the trust could not be offset against a settlor's personal gains in the same period. Paragraph 2 provides that an individual's capital gains tax loss cannot be offset against a gain made by the trustees attributed to him under the measures. The Chartered Institute of Taxation states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"We can think of no policy for this unfair change."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I urge the Government to consider the principles at stake. If they cannot accept the amendments because[Mr. Gibb]
they are defective in any way, but they accept those principles, perhaps they will come forward with their own amendments on Report.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> The amendments would upset the whole structure of taper relief by allowing untapered personal losses to be set against tapered gains that have arisen to a trust and been attributed to the settlor under sections 77 or 86 of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992.
<P>
By way of background, let me briefly remind the Committee how we approach the treatment of losses. Where allowable losses arise to a person, whose losses can be set against the gains of the year or, if they exceed those gains, they can be carried forward and set against gains in subsequent years. Taper relief will operate after setting losses against gains. The losses will be set against the gains in the most beneficial way for the taxpayer, and the net gains are then tapered. We decided to make the taper operate in that way to eliminate the distortion that would be present in alternative approaches.
<P>
Gains that arise to trustees of resident and non-resident trusts can be attributed to the settlor of the trust where that settlor, or his or her immediate family, have retained an interest in the trust property. Those gains, less the losses arising to the trustees, will have been tapered in the hands of the trustees before being attributed to the settlor.
<P>
To ensure that personal untapered losses arising to the settlor cannot be set against tapered attributed gain, schedule 21 ring fences the trustee's attributable gains, keeping them separate from personal gains and losses. That seems wholly right. The gains and losses arising to the trustee are offset against each other; the net gains are tapered and attributed to the settlor.
<P>
It would be wrong in principle to allow personal, untapered losses to be set against tapered gains. The trustee's gains have arisen to a different person. They are taxed on the settlor to prevent the settlor from getting a tax advantage from the gains being taxed at a lower rate.
<P>
Accepting the amendments would overturn the anti-avoidance provisions in sections 77 and 86. There would be a built-in incentive for the settlor to realise further gains through a trust because the losses would be more valuable when set against tapered gains. The amendments would give rise to avoidance opportunities. The Government do not want to provide such opportunities.
<P>
We have listened to the imploring of the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, but if he does not withdraw his amendments, I will ask the Committee to vote against them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The amendments were not tabled to assist tax avoidance. They were tabled on the grounds of equity. However, I am grateful to the Financial Secretary for explaining the Government's proposals, and, in view of the time that is available to the Committee, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I wish to give some information to the Committee and to the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon (Mr. Burnett) in particular. Hon. Members who wish to raise a point of order while a Division is taking place, and who wish to clarify the question, must do so before the Clerk takes the vote. Hon. Members may raise a point of order to correct their vote after the vote has been completed, but before the result has been announced. They must not interrupt the taking of the vote.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 114, in page 349, leave out line 39.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss amendment No. 41, in page 350, line 13, leave out "and" and insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(ba)applying taper relief in accordance with section 2A to the extent that it would be applied if there were no amounts falling to be deducted in accordance with section 2(2)(B); and".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> These amendments deal with an important technical point about losses that are brought forward. Losses are not tapered on the basis of the period of the ownership of assets that produced them. They are set against gains before those gains are tapered. There is confusion among practitioners about how that will work in practice.
<P>
The Institute of Directors believes that the Bill makes provision for the gain to be calculated under the old rules. Gains are then added, and current year losses are knocked off. The annual exemption is deducted and losses that are brought forward are deducted from the gain. The annual exemption is added back. What is left is attributed to the gain in the best possible way, as the Financial Secretary explained, and tapering is carried out. Finally, the full annual exemption is knocked off.
<P>
I will use an example to clarify that process. A taxpayer has a gain of 8,000 on an asset that he or she has held for 10 years, for which losses brought forward exist. After the tapering. the gain would be reduced to 60 per cent. of 8,000 4,800. Of course, that is less than the annual exemption of 6,800 that every individual has. However, 1,200 of losses brought forward would have to have been used in accordance with the order that I described. That would have been wasted; there would have been no need to use any losses brought forward, because the gain after tapering would have been less than the annual exemption. The legislation is currently drafted so that that element of losses brought forward must be lost. The explanatory notes and press release suggests that that is not the Government's intention.
<P>
The amendment would stop what I have described happening and embody the Government's stated policy in the Bill. I urge the Financial Secretary to accept the principle, if the amendment is not technically correct, and amend the Bill as the practitioners concerned would want.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> My hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton described the current states of affairs admirably. I have one point to add. The new section 3(5)A and (5B) of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992 would deal with the circumstances that he mentioned. The proposed section 3(5C) would deal with the definition of adjusted net gains. As the Committee will know, those are based on untapered capital gains of a particular year. Many practitioners think that that may be the wrong definition, and that the adjusted net gains should be based on the tapered gains, which would produce a more equitable result. I hope that the Financial Secretary will be able to explain, if she does not agree, why I am wrong about that.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> The amendments explore the interaction of losses brought forward and the operation of the taper. As the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton acknowledged, the subject is complex.
<P>
Under existing legislation, losses brought forward to a year must be used only to the extent necessary to reduce the net gain to the annual exempt amount. The taper adds a new dimension. For gains and losses that arise in a particular year, the losses are set against the gains before the taper operates on the net gain.
<P>
Neither amendment would disturb that treatment of losses of the current year. However, where losses arising in an earlier year cannot be used in that year, and are brought forward to the current year, the treatment proposed is that the losses brought forward should be set against the net gains of the year again, before the operation of the taper relief. The hon. Members for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton and for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown) both raised queries about that. The arrangement is consistent with respect to the treatment of losses that have arisen in a current year and can be offset against gains of that year, and losses that arose in an earlier year and are brought forward to the current year. That seems right to the Government.
<P>
It would be a strange result if losses brought forward to a year were treated differently from those arising in that year, with respect to their interaction with the taper relief. However, amendment No. 41 would achieve exactly that, by applying taper relief to the net gain of the current year before a decision was made on how many of the losses needed to be used. It would introduce inconsistent treatment into the system. For that reason alone, I have concluded that the amendment is unacceptable. However, I also must advise the hon. Gentleman that while in some circumstances the amendment would produce a result which is favourable to the taxpayer, in other circumstances it could disadvantage him. The use of losses brought forward could be restricted to such an extent that tax will be payable in the current year, even though losses remained available to carry forward to a future year. I assume that that is not the intended result. On that basis I ask the hon. Gentleman to consider withdrawing it.

<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I shall just finish this point about amendment No. 114. The point seems to be to maximise the amount that can be exempted by the annual threshold. However, the Government have been unable to construct any circumstances in which it would produce a different result from that produced by thecurrent proposals in the Bill. On that basis, particularly given the interest that the hon. Gentleman takes in the complexity of legislation, there is no reason to accept the amendment. It does not change what the Bill as currently drafted will 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> Yes, I will give way in a minute. I am trying to concentrate on finishing my sentence. It is difficult to do when constantly punctuated by requests to give way. I have completely lost my thread now. I will give way to the hon. Gentleman and then resume my point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I am grateful to the Financial Secretary for giving way. Perhaps I will give her a chance to regain her thoughts. Does she accept that if the amendment is not accepted, there will be situations in which people will have to use their annual capital gains allowance and their brought-forward losses will be restricted? Those are real losses that people have incurred and there is no reason why they should not utilise them fully against gains.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I have carefully explained the Government's intention. If the hon. Gentleman scrutinises the record, he will see that I have dealt with that point. I have now regained my concentration on amendment No. 114 and I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving me that breathing space.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I am always helpful.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I appreciate his support and encouragement at these times. Amendment No. 114 is unnecessary. It does nothing to change the operation of the legislation. I ask the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton to withdraw it. If he feels unable to do so, I will ask the Committee to vote against it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> If I have understood the Financial Secretary correctly, she appears to be changing the Government's policy towards this issue. I am sure that a number of outside bodies will read her words carefully and she will doubtless be inundated with correspondence on the issue. In view of the time, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
