<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office (Mr. Adam Ingram):</B> I beg to move,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> That, during proceedings on the Police (Northern Ireland) Bill, the Committee do meet on Tuesdays at half-past Ten o'clock and at half-past Four o'clock and on Thursdays at half-past Two o'clock.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I welcome you to the Committee, Mr. O'Hara. You have chaired other Committees on which I have served, but I am sure, as the hon. Member for Knowsley, North&#151;
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland </B>(Mr. George Howarth): Knowsley, South.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I am reminded that that should be Knowsley, South. My geographic knowledge of that part of Liverpool is not great. You, Mr. O'Hara, as the hon. Member for Knowsley, South, will be pleased to see my ministerial colleague the Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, my hon. Friend the Member for Knowsley, North and Sefton, East (Mr. Howarth), as you both represent that very important area. I therefore look forward to this Committee being chaired by you and Mr. Malins.
<P>
Clearly, we are dealing with very significant legislation. The aim of the Bill is to provide the legislative framework for a new beginning for policing in Northern Ireland, as set out in the report of the Independent Commission on Policing for Northern Ireland&#151;throughout these proceedings, that will no doubt be shortened to the Patten report, as it has become known.
<P>
We are clearly dealing with a substantial Bill and we have a great deal of work to get through. The selection in front of us belies the reality that underlies all this. Those who have looked at the order and the amendments that have been tabled will realise that we have a considerable body of work to take on board.
<P>
On Second Reading, we had an informative and wide-ranging debate and I know that we will have an informed debate here. Many of the issues dealt with in the Bill arouse strong feelings. The Second Reading debate exhibited some of those, but in a structured and informative way. There may be strong feelings, but we must move forward on this issue. Although the Government do not want to curtail debate&#151;it is not even in my power to do so&#151;it should be made clear to the Committee that they are determined to get this Bill through. This Committee is an important part of that.
<P>
We have undertaken useful consideration of the detailed clauses of the Bill with the various parties, which has helped to clarify many of the main issues that will be debated and will assist in the way these matters are dealt with. I hope that we will make progress.
<P>
My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State said on Second Reading on 6 June:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the Bill will require fine tuning&#151;[Official Report, 6 June 2000; Vol. 351, c. 178.]
<P>
</UL></FONT>He went on to say that the Government were willing to listen to reasoned argument. I am sure that this Committee will fulfil that function, as have the others on which you, Mr. O'Hara, and I have served. Therefore, I look forward to a constructive debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor (Solihull):</B> I share the Minister's pleasure at sitting under your chairmanship, Mr. O'Hara, and also that of Mr. Malins. This is important, sensitive and potentially difficult legislation.
<P>
At this initial stage in the proceedings, it is fair to say that my party will want to address all the new issues that may arise. Amendments may be tabled by the different parties, and we would not be surprised if they were tabled by the Government, too. I know from my experience of our parliamentary affairs that the Government are a prolific author of amendments to their own legislation. We shall have to address those changes when they occur.
<P>
We will, however, remain faithful to and consistent with the arguments that we raised on Second Reading and, in particular, in the reasoned amendment that we tabled at that stage. In that reasoned amendment, we drew attention to our disappointment at the fact that the Bill
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>fails to preserve the proud title and insignia of the Royal Ulster Constabulary&#151;
<P>
</UL></FONT>the George cross. We said that we thought that it enabled
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the political representatives of paramilitary organisations to sit on the Policing Board and District Policing Partnerships without a start to the decommissioning of illegally-held arms and explosives; provides inadequate safeguards against people convicted of terrorist offences serving on the Policing Board or the District Policing Partnerships; and threatens significantly to increase the politicisation of policing in Northern Ireland.
<P>
</UL></FONT>We addressed all those matters on Second Reading. I also said on that occasion that I had seldom seen
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>a Bill with so many collaterals to it&#151;so many codes of practice ... and so many reserve powers for the Secretary of State.&#151;[Official Report, 6 June 2000; Vol. 351, c. 185-248.]
<P>
</UL></FONT>until now unpublished. Perhaps the Minister will say how many of these items which so far we have been asked to take on faith he can specify for us.
<P>
There is another weakness in the Bill, about which I am not sure I personally can do anything, because it shows a weakness in principle and timing. The Bill, some will say, falls short of the Patten report on policing in Northern Ireland. Some will say that it goes further than the Patten report. I would not take either of those positions. I will say that it is premature in that the Patten report was written against a predication, an expectation, an anticipation, a premise that the Belfast agreement would be discharged in all its aspects, and it was a prescription or a recipe for policing in Northern Ireland in peace on the far side of the fulfilment of all of the Good Friday agreement.
<P>
Mr. O'Hara, I am afraid we are not there. The prescription in the Patten report is debatable as a formulation for policing a peaceful Northern Ireland&#151;and perhaps it has merits as such. However, as we have not reached the far side of the Belfast agreement, I am afraid that it has to be argued that the Patten report and the Bill are premature. The Patten report anticipates the reduction in the number of police in Northern Ireland. We should probably encourage that, if all the components were in place for the expectation of peace; sadly, I suggest that we do not do that.
<P>
A less grave point still remains to be considered. To an Englishman, reading the Bill in good faith and attending the police liaison committee, which is the consultative body which lies between the citizens and the police in my constituency, and learning of all the consultative bodies that are expected in the Bill&#151;the Northern Ireland Policing Board, the district policing partnerships, community committees, police liaison committees, to name but four&#151;there seems to be a heavy burden of consultation that must be discharged properly by the police if the legislation is to be enacted.
<P>
 I know that too much consultation is always better than too little, but the police must keep their eye on the necessities of crime prevention and law enforcement and I would not wish them to be overly burdened with consultation. So far, in my view, that anxiety has not been nourished. I think that I may be capable of being satisfied on the consultation point, because not long ago I had the opportunity to speak informally with a senior policemen in Northern Ireland. He said that he thought that the consultation was useful and helped policing. I shall reserve my criticism, but I may wish to revisit the matter of the time that the police will have to spend in consultations.
<P>
Given the amount of work that we shall have to do on the Bill, that may suffice for my opening remarks under the heading of a sittings motion. I have given a general view of the points that we shall visit, but as to those items that have yet to arise, Conservative Members, like everyone else, will have to think them through as they arise. I have no objection to the sittings motion as moved by the Minister, although part of me suggests that at some stage we may revisit it through an amendment. As the Government have a majority about which I can do nothing for at least a year and their majority on the Committee is unstoppable, we shall have to consider whether to amend the sittings motion. At present, we do not have to anticipate that; we should deal with what is before us, and with that I am content.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lembit &#214;pik </B>(Montgomeryshire): This is an important Bill. As the hon. Member for Solihull (Mr. Taylor) has said, numerically the Government have an unstoppable majority, but they can be stopped by the power of argument. I say that with optimism and confidence, Mr. O'Hara, because the Secretary of State, no less, committed the Government to listening with an open mind to all views and all suggestions for improvingthe Bill. I hope that we can expect consensual debateand respect for the different views. I should like to think that the Government will be true to their word and take on suggestions, from whomever they come. That will help the Bill.
<P>
As hon. Members may know, I am greatly concerned about the quota arrangements. When we come to recruitment, I shall table appropriate amendments. We wish to explore the subject through amendments and modify the strength of the board versus the influence and strength of the Chief Constable.
<P>
The role of individuals formerly convicted of scheduled offences by the police in Northern Ireland was touched on on Second Reading, but the Committee is the appropriate place to explore it in depth. We recognise that that will be an uncomfortable debate, but we must set aside the taboo and face full square what we mean to do strategically in regard to that category of people. Some minor challenges will be raised about the complexity of the Bill and the importance of its completing its passage this Session. I have no problem with the sittings motion: three sittings a week is the least that we can expect if the Bill is to complete its passage on time.

<P>

<B>Mr. Seamus Mallon </B>(Newry and Armagh): I, too, look forward to working in the Committee under your chairmanship, Mr. O'Hara'. First, I thank the Government and the Whips for facilitating us in our request about numbers, due to extraneous circumstances over which I have no control.
<P>
 I am broadly in agreement with the sittings motion, but for the benefit of hon. Members who have to catch aeroplanes, can you tell us the finishing time of sittings, Mr. O'Hara? It might be helpful if the Thursday start, which is difficult for all of us, were 2 pm, not 2.30 pm. This is not an issue, but I ask for that request to be considered.
<P>
As you said, Mr. O'Hara, this is an important Bill. The Patten report required
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>a new beginning to policing in Northern Ireland with a police service capable of attracting and sustaining support from the community as a whole.
<P>
</UL></FONT>That mandate came directly from the Good Friday agreement which stated&#151;and it is worth remembering&#151;that we were seeking a police service that was
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> Fair and impartial, free from partisan control, accountable, representative, conforming with human rights norms ...and delivered in constructive and inclusive partnerships with the community.
<P>
</UL></FONT>That was what the agreement required and Patten recommended.
<P>
I am afraid that the Bill does not measure up to that. My hon. Friend the Member for Hull, North (Mr. McNamara) described it on Second Reading as a miserable Bill. It is miserable and minimalist, first, because of its failure to implement the recommendations of the Patten report on name, badge and flag. Secondly, it is a failure in respect of delegation to the Chief Constable of critical Patten reforms on the code of ethics, human rights appraisal, plastic bullets, and training and development. Let us remind ourselves that police have never reformed themselves. It is naive to believe that they will do so now. Thirdly, the Bill virtually nullifies the Policing Board's powers to commission reports and inquiries and to ensure that the police are efficient and effective. Those restrictions are so grave that the even the Government-appointed Police Authority, of which I am no fan&#151;nor is it a fan of mine&#151;has described the recommendations as ``ludicrous and totally unacceptable''. For probably the first time, I agree with the Police Authority. Fourthly, the key Patten recommendations on the power of the police ombudsman have not been implemented in the Bill. Fifthly, the office of the new oversight commissioner has not been placed on an adequate statutory basis. Those are the major defects in the Bill.
<P>
Dr. Lynch from the United States, a member of the Patten commission who has remarkable experience of the issue, described the Patten report as having been ``gutted'' by the Police (Northern Ireland) Bill. That was not the only observation that was made. I refer to the statement made on behalf of the hierarchy of the Catholic Church, not because it is a Church, not because it is the Catholic Church, but because its position is relevant to the debate, as we shall see as we progress. The statement said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> Any appeal to the Catholic Church to make it a priority to encourage Catholics to join the police is unlikely to be taken up by Church leaders in the context of this Bill.
<P>
</UL></FONT>I shall put our party position clearly and without equivocation. We want a system of policing that we can support, in which we can involve ourselves and ask others to be involved, and which we can defend. We want that to be put in place for the first time since the Northern Ireland state was formed and we want it badly. It may have been suggested that Patten was premature. Patten was 86 years late, but even now we have to get it right; otherwise, our party will not appoint people to serve on the Policing Board and we will not appeal to Catholics&#151;young Catholics especially&#151;to join or support the police. I say that without equivocation because I do not want any doubt in anybody's mind as to where we stand.
<P>
A few miserable crumbs thrown at us by way of amendments will not keep us quiet. We shall not be happy unless the Bill is fundamentally changed, not in my direction or in that of others who comment on it, but in that of the Good Friday agreement, to which we all subscribed, and in that to which the Patten commission has pointed. I say that not as a threat, because I do not believe in threats, or as rhetoric&#151;I do indulge in that sometimes, but it does not get me very far. I say that simply as a statement of political reality.
<P>
I look forward to working with everyone on the Committee and to getting it right so that the resulting legislation will allow all of us to go into a new dispensation of policing for the first time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ken Maginnis </B>(Fermanagh and South Tyrone): I welcome the opportunity to look at the Bill in detail. As well as welcoming you to the chair, Mr. O'Hara, I am happy to be a member of the Committee. You will recall that, on Second Reading, most of us were confined to a 10-minute contribution, analysing the background and how the Bill has to be moved forward. That was totally inadequate and did not give us the chance fully to set out the past, present and future basis of policing in Northern Ireland.
<P>
Like many experienced and responsible policemen, I do not look forward to what we are almost destined&#151;given the Government's majority&#151;to produce as a result of the Bill. There is an element of deja vu in this because I remember the previous police Bill about two years ago. We cautioned the Government at that time that it was totally inadequate and so it turned out to be&#151;a Bill full of flaws, that addressed political issues with more vigour than policing. Today, we are embarked on a similar exercise and that is something to which the Committee will have to attend.
<P>
No doubt a number of people will stress that a new beginning is required in Northern Ireland, without recognising what that entails. Policing is a matter not for the police, but for society&#151;it must decide how it wishes to be policed. The function of the force is to fulfil the needs of society within a modern democracy. When I speak about a new beginning, I am not considering how we can dismantle a police force that has served society well during many difficult periods and has been politicised, not so much by those who support it as by those who oppose it for political reasons.
<P>
In our society, we have a hugely dangerous mafia sub-culture. I do not know whether that is a sign of the times, an inevitable outcome of liberal democracy in the 50-odd years since the end of the war, or a result of the 30 years of terrorism, but it exists. Society has to be prepared to embark on a new beginning that indicates respect for life and property, for young and old, and for all the things that most of us believe are ethical and proper.
<P>
To draw a brief comparison between policing and the health service, particularly in Northern Ireland, a few years ago it was fashionable to reform, to change and to make more professional&#151;to move training in the health service away from the wards and into universities. Yesterday, there were two debates. One was about the abuse of the health service and of people by professionals who fell short of the ethos of their profession. We heard about a health service in Northern Ireland in which the waiting lists are longer than they have ever been and which, as I know from personal experience, is falling into chaos.
<P>
I am a village schoolteacher by profession. I would be the last to denigrate raising education standards, but life is not only about book learning, hence the problems in our health service. Similarly, we must beware the problems in policing. In Northern Ireland and throughout the United Kingdom, many things are going wrong in policing at present. That is not simply connected to our new, sophisticated culture or to huge, complicated financial fraud. It is an undercurrent that pervades society. Some people call it the Bramshill syndrome, and I have a great affinity with that term. The idea that policing is primarily about education, books and university degrees is nonsense, if one looks at what the highly educated RUC command has achieved over the past six years since the violence started to reduce in terms of the increase in the drug culture in Northern Ireland. There is an inbuilt prejudice against the drug culture throughout society, yet it is frightening to see what it has achieved.
<P>
I apologise if hon. Members have heard me say this before, but if one compares the &#163;1 billion tax fraud relating to smuggled motor and heating fuel with the &#163;8 billion budget for Northern Ireland that was introduced yesterday, one begins to understand the extent to which evil people are beginning to grasp control of our society in Northern Ireland. Those issues must be addressed.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
There are other, more emotional tribal issues&#151;if I may call them that&#151;and more emotional political issues, but the crux of the matter is this: how do we introduce a Bill that will create a new beginning in which the people in the society of which I am a part can function with confidence? In other words, how are we going to create a happy society? The police cannot do it for us. A new beginning does not apply to the police. It applies to society, and when other hon. Members use that phrase, I hope that they will bear that in mind.
<P>
I must also caution against the idea of foreshortening and restricting the terms of our debate by addressing the Bill, as the Minister has suggested, in terms of the one word ``Patten''. Over the past few days, I have heard quite a few contributions being made about Patten. People talk about the spirit of Patten. The reality is that the Patten report was a sloppy report, in so far as Patten set himself above, beyond and outside the terms of reference on which his commission was supposed to function. He did not recognise that politicians from all sections of society in Northern Ireland had spent many years bringing forth the Belfast agreement in May 1998.
<P>
It is not, therefore, the spirit of Patten&#151;the spirit of sloppiness&#151;that must guide our thoughts when we discuss the Bill, but the spirit of the Belfast agreement, which came to the only conclusion possible if we are to have a politically stable community. That was that Northern Ireland will remain part of the United Kingdom for as long as the people of Northern Ireland so desire. That was stated in such a way in the agreement that it was not aggressive and did not impose on people with different aspirations a sense of guilt that they had not achieved those aspirations or that the majority wanted to dominate the minority and its views. The agreement recognised the de facto situation and the Irish Republic withdrew its territorial claim. Its realistic approach was to bring two diverse traditions together to work, live and function with stability and mutual trust, although that will take some time to achieve.
<P>
When Patten was given his mandate or direction to examine policing in Northern Ireland, he was told that the agreement provides the opportunity for a new beginning for policing in Northern Ireland with a police service capable of attracting and sustaining support from the community as a whole. It seems to many of us that Patten chose the lowest common denominator. He tried to satisfy those who are currently dissatisfied without considering those from both traditions--I emphasise both traditions--who, for years and years, supported the police quietly and faithfully, recognising the extent to which they had to operate in difficult circumstances. Patten was told that his report needed widespread support, but it was so radical and challenging that, instead of satisfying anyone, it has brought two political friends--the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh (Mr. Mallon) and me--here today with totally different opinions of the Bill. The Patten report was divisive and has not served Northern Ireland well.
<P>
When the report was published, Patten attended a news presentation and then disappeared with some fellow members of his commission--not all of them--to America to explain it to the Americans. He did not explain it to those of us who live and work in Northern Ireland and make decisions on how to move the process forward.
<P>
Perhaps the ad hoc committee for foreign affairs, Mr. Gilman and Congressman King, were more important in terms of selling the Patten report than the people of Northern Ireland. Congressman King approved of the mortaring of Newry police station, which resulted in the death of Protestant and Catholic policemen and women, and has been an overt supporter of the IRA. We have been left to struggle through with many of the changes. I say again that it is not the spirit of Patten but the spirit and letter of the Belfast agreement that most people look forward to, and that has yet to be recognised. Not a single bullet or ounce of Semtex has been delivered up by those who for 30 years have held society to ransom.
<P>
The hon. Member for Solihull (Mr. Taylor) referred to the codes of ethics and codes of practice that are mentioned in the Bill. If Committee members are not given some idea of what those codes will be, our work will not have been worth the crack of your finger, because such codes can be manipulated to undermine our intentions for Northern Ireland. They can be manipulated to pander to the most forceful elements in our society, which are still the loyalist and republican paramilitary organisations that have a finger in every single pie in Northern Ireland.
<P>
We are approaching what ought to be a celebratory season of the year, yet many of us hold our breath, given what the next few months may herald. We hear that one person who has a say over every tablet in the drugs trade is peripherally involved&#151;perhaps not peripherally&#151;in likely events in Northern Ireland in the next few months. We hear such things about some of the most evil people in our society. If Committee members think that I am straying from the point, I remind them that I am talking about policing and how to protect society in Northern Ireland.
<P>
We have been told that the last drugs murder in Northern Ireland was carried out by the Provisional IRA on the orders of the senior command. That makes matters exceedingly difficult for those such as me who have struggled for years to create an equitable society in Northern Ireland. We do not want confrontation. We want a society that respects the police force, and a police force that provides reassurance for ourselves, our children and our children's children.
<P>
Human rights will be an essential element of the Bill. It will place a huge emphasis on human rights. If one teaches a policeman anything now, one teaches him about human rights: everything revolves around those two simple words, as though somehow they were new words. We used to refer to implementing law and order. If we were worthy of our name of legislators, that law and order meant protecting and sustaining the human rights of the society that we represented. So what is new? What is new is that the term ``human rights'' is being used again and again to constrain the police as they try to do their work in our society.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
It is not just in Northern Ireland that we find disrespect for the law. One must congratulate the English supporters last night on the fact that there was no recurrence of the football hooliganism that has beset this society for years now. Would one send the organisers of football hooliganism to oversee the way in which the police handle football hooliganism? Would one put the drugs barons in charge of the way in which the police tackle the scourge of drugs? One might say that this fellow from Fermanagh and South Tyrone has gone slightly mad, but we will be asked to give people with criminal records oversight of the police, without any constraints. In some areas we will find that there are constraints, but not when it inhibits the worst elements of our society, the real godfathers of terrorism. We build these provisions into a Bill and we call it human rights.
<P>
There are so many inconsistencies in the Bill that I wonder whether the sittings schedule is realistic. I spoke about the 10 minutes accorded to each of us on Second Reading. I say this to the Minister: we do not want to be strung along until 6 July, going through the Bill line by line and word by word, as we must, only to have the Government say, ``That's it, time's up,'' and for the whole process to be guillotined. Therefore, although I understand that at this stage we are giving ourselves only three sittings a week, I caution that that will not be enough to deal with the complexities of the Bill and, I hope, remedy its inadequacies, before 6 July. I hope that the Government will address that issue realistically. If my party can do anything to indicate where we believe the Bill should go and the time that it might take, we shall co-operate with them.
<P>
There are many other issues about which I should like to speak at some length. We should examine the way in which the police have performed, and do so more honestly than has been the case heretofore. We should assess the job that the Royal Ulster Constabulary has done under exceedingly difficult circumstances. As I walked to the House this morning, I thought of an important yardstick that might be applied to policing. We could compare the number of prisoners who died in custody in Northern Ireland, during the most difficult period in the United Kingdom's modern history, with the number that occurred in other constabularies in the United Kingdom and in the Irish Republic. The figures would provide startling revelations about the way in which policemen in Northern Ireland conducted themselves during that 30-year period, although they were under fire day and night in their homes and on duty.
<P>
If I stray out of order, Mr. O'Hara, I am sure that you will bring me back to the straight and narrow. Although the RUC will be reduced in size by 6,000 men, we have not heard about the generous packages that the Government should provide to those who will be required prematurely to leave the RUC and the RUC Reserve. I am worried about the future of policing and the treatment of those who are asked to leave the RUC. In that context, we also need to consider the 8,000 men and women who retired from of the RUC and those who have been widowed. There would be major discontent among RUC members and the public if they were not treated generously.
<P>
On Second Reading, I discussed a young widow of a police sergeant, who had young children, and I make no apology for discussing her case again today. I add, for no particular reason, that he happened to be a Roman Catholic. Many people feel that no opportunity was afforded to members of the Roman Catholic tradition to join the RUC. It was, however, difficult for them to join because they were targeted by the IRA. On Second Reading, I was disappointed by the contribution of the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh. That young widow, who had young children, was awarded &#163;4,000 in 1975. That minuscule amount meant that she has had to live her life in virtual penury, but our society should have done better for her.
<P>
The spirit of the Stormont or Belfast agreement is not about doing down the RUC, although some people&#151;and the Bill&#151;appear to suggest that it is. The spirit of the Belfast agreement is about creating an equitable, peaceful and stable society. It seeks to ensure that Northern Ireland remains part of the United Kingdom until the people decide otherwise and that those things that go with Britishness are respected, in a quiet, unobtrusive and non-aggressive way. Those aims are not reflected in the Bill's treatment of the name and emblems of the RUC.
<P>
Patten must be made better. The Bill should not be about implementing Patten; it should be about implementing the Belfast agreement and creating something of which our society of which we can be proud for the next 25 or 40 years&#151;even though some of us cannot think even that far ahead, for obvious reasons. People must believe that we have done an honourable job for society and not merely paid lip service or pandered to political pressures, some of which are of dubious.

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. It is in the nature of sittings motion debates that discussion can range across the extent of a Bill and the context in which it has been brought forward. I listened with interest and respect to the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone (Mr. Maginnis).
<P>
The hon. Gentleman acknowledged the need for disciplined procedure throughout the passage of the Bill, so that we do not end up with a rush and a guillotine at the end. It is my responsibility and that of my colleague, Mr. Malins, to ensure that, when we debate the clauses and schedules of the Bill and amendments thereto, we focus properly on them. I trust that hon. Members, including the hon. Gentleman, will co-operate in that, so that we achieve the progress through the Bill that he desires.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tony McWalter (Hemel Hempstead):</B> I wanted to express disappointment at the form that the debate has taken since the Minister made his initial remarks. In a sense, there has been a lack of generosity in the three contributions that have been made since. I shall focus on the remarks made by the hon. Member for Solihull and by my hon. Friend the Member for Newry and Armagh.
<P>
The hon. Member for Solihull adopted the position that the Bill is premature and should come only after some other process. On Second Reading, I suggested to him that the radical change in policing is, itself, designed to make an integral contribution to the evolution of the peace process. It is a causal factor in the generation of the kind of lasting settlement that was mentioned by the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone, who said that that was his aspiration. If this is designed to be a causal factor in that process, we cannot wait for the peace process to be consolidated before we do something about the policing issue. It is a vital component of the evolution of the peace process. The logical result of saying that the Bill is premature and that loads of other things should have been done first, so this is not the time for it, is that the Opposition will oppose the Bill, not simply in detail but root and branch. As a result, our debates will not be characterised by generosity and by a feeling that Opposition and Government are moving forward together to evolve a new police settlement for Northern Ireland that will make the Belfast agreement stick; instead, we shall be left with a general feeling that one side of the Committee wants the Bill and the other side does not, which will gainsay the necessary working together.
<P>
On Second Reading, the hon. Member for Solihull agreed with me that the Bill will contribute to the evolution of the peace process. He takes seriously the idea that that is what we are trying to do here. I do not want to suffer a governmental steamroller on 6 July or be part of a corralled vote. I hope that my wish to respond constructively to good suggestions, from wherever they come, will supervene on the other observations that the hon. Member has made.
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B> I am not sure whether the hon. Gentleman and I are divided by a chasm, but I want to hear his view on Patten's expectation that police numbers should be reduced while terrorists are still armed. How does the hon. Gentleman deal with that?
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. McWalter:</B> Inevitably, as the security situation is eased somewhat, the quasi-military policing organisations will also be able to be phased back somewhat, but I would have full confidence in the Chief Constable's judgment of the precise relationship between the phasing back and an improved security situation. I am pleased to hear the hon. Gentleman say that there is no chasm here. We must continue to talk in that way, rather than in tones of fundamental opposition.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Newry and Armagh talks about the Bill, which is designed to implement the Patten commission report, as if it is gutted. He mentioned half a dozen important matters.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> I regret to say that I did not say that the Bill was gutted. I quoted the exact words of one of the Patten commissioners, Dr. Gerrard Lynch, who said that the Bill gutted the Patten commission. I regret that I did not make that observation first.
<P>
<B>Mr. McWalter:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman, but he quoted approvingly someone who said that the Bill had been gutted, which boils down to much the same thing.
<P>
If one started from the view that the Government have sought to tear up the Patten agreement and that any changes they make to the Bill will grudgingly reinstate something that they should perhaps have included at the beginning, that would make the sittings timetable unrealistic. Does my hon. Friend accept that 80 per cent. of the Patten report is already in the Bill, that the Government have made a genuine effort to try to incorporate its key proposals and that, even if it has been gutted, the rest of the body is still there and the Government are willing to reinstate such guts as are appropriate to make it a functioning body? If so, instead of starting from the point of view that the Bill is kind of betrayal, he could start from the point of view that it is a real effort at implementation, albeit one that still has some distance to go. If he could accept the 80 per cent. formula, or something similar, we might get a little closer to appreciating the precise job that the Committee has to do, and what will be appropriate as a timetable to enable it to carry it out.
<P>
I hope that, as our deliberations advance, the hon. Member for Solihull and my hon. Friend the Member for Newry and Armagh will demonstrate greater generosity of spirit than was represented by their first contributions. I believe that we can make tremendous progress with the Bill, and hence with the better organisation of a more normalised police force in Northern Ireland, which is what all members of the Committee want to see.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Hunter </B>(Basingstoke): I add my welcome to those already expressed to you, Mr. O'Hara. We look forward to many challenging weeks under your wise and reasonable direction, as we consider this extremely significant and sensitive Bill.
<P>
The Committee will be grateful to the Minister for outlining his thoughts on the sittings motion. Personally, I welcome the relatively unusual practice of the 2.30 pm sittings on Thursdays. I imagine that that will be particularly convenient for the two Ministers andfor Northern Ireland Members.
<P>
Given the Bill's significance and sensitivity, I expected the Minister to say more about the need for structured debate, which is an expression that I have heard him use on several occasions in other Committees. When he has done so in the past, I have somewhat cynically suspected that his ulterior motive is largely to do with speeding a Bill through Committee.
<P>
However, this is no lightweight Bill. It has a total of 73 clauses&#151;admittedly of varying importance and controversy&#151;and six schedules, and it is important that they receive adequate and proper scrutiny. For my part, there will be no question of delaying tactics; I do not believe in such measures. On the other hand, nor can there be any question of giving the Government an easy ride when critical issues are at stake. If the Minister hopes that the Bill will have a speedy passage through the Committee, I suspect that he will find that he has been over-optimistic.
<P>
One should see the Bill as the culmination of a great deal of activity&#151;most immediately, of course, the findings of the Independent Commission on Policing in Northern Ireland. Although the Bill derives some of its most distinctive features from the report, the report itself borrows significantly from earlier ideas. As we scrutinise the Bill, we will find echoes and reflections of the Northern Ireland Police Authority's report on community consultation, ``Everyone's Police, A Partnership for Change''; the Labour party's 1996 paper, ``Policing in Northern Ireland''; the Conservative Government's 1996 White Paper, ``Foundations for Policing''; Dr. Maurice Hayes' report on the police complaints procedure, which proposed the idea of a police ombudsman; the RUC's 1997 fundamental review; and, not least, the Police (Northern Ireland) Act 1998.
<P>
It will be appropriate, from time to time, for the Committee to challenge, through amendments, the differences between the Bill and the 1998 Act, and to question the Government on the changes in emphasis and content. I have no quarrel with some aspects of the Bill taken in isolation, outside the wider political context of which the Bill forms a part.
<P>
The heart of the Conservative party's position on policing in Northern Ireland was set out in the previous Government's White Paper, ``Foundations for Policing''. The ideas in it were based on the strengths of the tripartite relationship. It was designed to clarify lines of accountability between the tripartite partners: the Secretary of State, the Police Authority for Northern Ireland&#151;now to become the Policing Board&#151;and the Chief Constable. It was also designed to define more clearly the roles and responsibilities of the partners in that structure, and to create new structures to facilitate greater community involvement and, more important, greater public identification with policing.
<P>
During the timetable of sittings that the Minister has proposed, we shall explore and probe the extent to which the Bill is consistent with those principles, and the extent to which it will reasonably implement them. I have serious misgivings about the ability of certain parts of the Bill to achieve those aims.
<P>
I referred a moment ago to the wider political context of which the Bill forms a part. On the basis of my understanding of that context I voted against the Bill on Second Reading, along with the hon. Members for Fermanagh and South Tyrone and for West Tyrone (Mr. Thompson), and others. I tried to make the point on Second Reading that there is no organisation or institution that cannot, from time to time, benefit from reform. Efficiency and effectiveness can generally be improved, and, in that respect, the Royal Ulster Constabulary is no exception.
<P>
It has been pointed out that many of the Patten proposals are non-controversial, and, indeed, many reflect the findings of the RUC's own 1997 internal fundamental review. However, I find it wholly unacceptable that the RUC should effectively be abolished at the behest of those who have murdered its officers. We shall return to that issue in due course.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> We should always be careful about how we make observations like that. I have sought for 30 years to bring about changes in policing in the north of Ireland, and I have never killed an RUC officer or anyone else. The hon. Gentleman might like to recognise that sensitivity in this matter goes a long way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> I accept and note what the hon. Gentleman says. No comment that I have just made, or ever made, would include him in the category of those who have murdered officers of the RUC.
<P>
Nevertheless, the arrival of the Bill represents a significant victory for the Provisionals because, along with the unconditional release of their prisoners and the retention of their weapons until they have achieved their political objectives, the abolition of the RUC, has been one of the Provisionals' key demands. Their on-going participation in the process and the continuation of their so-called ceasefire have depended to a significant extent on this demand being met.
<P>
<B>Mr. &#214;pik:</B> Why does the hon. Gentleman think that the releases were unconditional?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> Because the continuation of violence in the province on the part of republicans and loyalists did not result in a discontinuation.
<P>
<B>Mr. William Thompson (West Tyrone):</B> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the Prime Minister has broken his promise, which was made during a visit to Northern Ireland, that there would be no releases without a cessation of violence?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> Yes, the hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. Those assurances were given verbally during the referendum campaign and in the House of Commons, and repeated in the handwritten note that the Prime Minister composed shortly before the referendum.
<P>
The realisation to which I refer will guide and determine my opposition to the Bill as our proceedings advance, and I endorse the sentiments expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for Solihull. The Bill is premature, and so is restructuring policing in Northern Ireland.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Temple-Morris </B>(Leominster): I am grateful for the opportunity to say a few brief words, Mr. O'Hara. My hon. Friend the Member for Hemel Hempstead (Mr. McWalter) deserves some support, and I underline everything that he has said. I, too, have had my optimism a little diminished by one or two things that have been said. It is clear that there are elements on this Committee who will not reach a consensus. In the light of what my hon. Friend and I are saying, the main players&#151;they know who they are&#151;must at least agree to differ, and I hope that we can adopt a medium course which will carry the Bill through. This is a reasonable Bill, and its distance from Patten was greatly exaggerated on Second Reading. We shall soon consider the detail.
<P>
I can sincerely say that the views of my hon. Friend the Member for Newry and Armagh have been a model to me during many years of association with the island of Ireland in general, and Northern Ireland in particular. Should any vote of mine differ from his as the Bill progresses, I shall cast it with a heavy heart. I point that out because he, like everyone else, will have to compromise. He has said today that we must get the Bill right. He made the same point very effectively on Second Reading, and prompted Unionists&#151;Ulster Unionist Members were not responsible&#151;to cry, ``For whom?''
<P>
We should not try to get the Bill right for any particular person; we must get it right for Northern Ireland, and that spirit should infuse our debate. My hon. Friend the Member for Newry and Armagh said that, in certain circumstances, his party might not nominate for the board or encourage anyone from the Catholic community to join the force. In such a circumstance, we would have failed, and we cannot afford to fail.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> I agree with the hon. Gentleman&#151;we would have failed and we cannot afford to fail. He mentioned the need for compromise, but there has been compromise. Patten's report is a compromise between two absolute positions. The difficulty is that the Bill involves a compromise of the compromise and it will not help us to realise the objectives of the Patten report. The point is that Patten is sacrosanct not in a personal sense but because it contains the objectives that we must obtain. I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving me an opportunity to state that I shall be reasonable at all times, although I should prefer not a reasonable failure but an unreasonable success.
<P>
<B>Mr. Temple-Morris:</B> I am pleased to have given my hon. Friend the opportunity to make those remarks. The only way to sort out such a historical situation is through compromise and more compromise. We must ensure that no one gets dug in at any stage during our consideration of the Bill or the assessment of the Patten report. We shall be in real trouble if certain elements get dug in.
<P>
The Bill will be examined in detail. When it completes its passage through this House and another place&#151;I trust that it will do so&#151;it will still be just a beginning. It is part of the developing peace process, which has some way to go. I am sure that it does not constitute the end of the whole process.
<P>
Although certain safeguards are necessary, we need to discuss which should remain in the Bill and whether its provisions should be as tightly drawn as they are. I believe that they are necessary at this stage. When there is devolved government in Northern Ireland&#151;I hope and pray that that will work and can think of no reason why it cannot&#151;the Bill's safeguards will by definition be less necessary. We should not regard the Bill, or any of its provisions, as the very last word. As my hon. Friend the Member for Hemel Hempstead said, it is an integral part of the process.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> With respect, is not the hon. Gentleman talking nonsense? The Bill is about the way in which Northern Ireland will be policed. He cannot persuade me or, I hope, other hon. Members that it is simply a stage in the process. I wonder whether a strange ulterior motive lies behind his remarks. Will he clarify his position?
<P>
<B>Mr. Temple-Morris:</B> With respect, I was certainly was not talking nonsense. Nothing is cast in stone. I was trying to be reasonable, but the hon. Gentleman has resorted to being unnecessarily aggressive and combative. I do not need to teach him any lessons&#151;he knows far more about Northern Ireland than I ever shall&#151;but he knows about the House's legislative process. All of the Bill's provisions are serious and must be argued out and, when the Bill is enacted, it will apply to Northern Ireland. If the peace process succeeds, does he really think that there will not be more devolved Government in Northern Ireland? If there is, the Bill's powers will be reassessed. If he cannot take that on board, we still have a little way to go. I hope that, as we proceed, the light will dawn and that we shall conduct our debate in a spirit of reasonableness&#151;for the moment, the hon. Gentleman did not show that spirit to me.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. As several Committee members have pointed out, there are deeply held principles on both sides. Our consideration of the Bill must take that into account. Even if Committee members cannot agree, it is important that they listen to each other, especially in this context&#151;the precise words used and the semantics and shades of meaning are so important. During the debate, an undercurrent of conversation has prevented members of the Committee from hearing each other clearly. If hon. Members need to discuss matters at length, as is sometimes necessary, I appeal to them to do so outside the Room.
<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> Thank you, Mr. O'Hara. I also welcome you and note your remarks. The Bill is important to those of us who live in Northern Ireland. It will arouse deep passions, but I hope that, despite those passions and the robustness of the debate that we will have here, it will be debated in a satisfactory way. I hope that you will not be bored on any occasion, Mr. O'Hara, and that you will not have the problem of the judge who recently fell asleep on the Bench. I am sure that that will not happen during our deliberations.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I can think of no other Bill that would be more likely to keep me on my toes than this.
<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> On the mainland, there are two political parties: the Labour party, which is in government, and the Conservative party, which aspires to be in government&#151;some day, it will happen. There are great differences between Conservatism and socialism. In recent years, that difference has grown narrower, so that the Labour party is now more Tory than socialist.
<P>
In Northern Ireland, there are also two parties: Unionists and nationalists. The Unionists wish to maintain the Union between Great Britain and Northern Ireland and are, undoubtedly, a majority in Northern Ireland. It is reckoned that more than 70 per cent. of the people of Northern Ireland wish to remain within the United Kingdom and to continue to enjoy the wonderful benefits of membership. On the other hand, a nationalist minority wishes to break the Union and join a foreign state, believing that they will have a better future there. They are, of course, greatly mistaken.
<P>
With Conservatism and socialism, it is hard to imagine that there is a point at which they can agree; it is hard to see how Toryism and socialism could reach an accommodation. However, in Northern Ireland, we are told that there must be an accommodation between Unionists and nationalists. Many of us believe that it is not possible. In Northern Ireland, whether we like it or not, it is them and us. Unionists&#151;``us''&#151;look on nationalists as ``them'', and vice versa. That is the reality.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stephen Pound </B>(Ealing, North): I am always grateful for the opportunity to be educated in the realities of politics in the north of Ireland. The hon. Gentleman talks about the two competing groups, but does he not accept that more than 70 per cent. of the people of the north of Ireland voted for the Good Friday agreement? That offers what we might describe as a third way.

<P>

<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> Of course, I accept that 72 per cent. of the people of Northern Ireland were fooled into accepting the Belfast agreement. Like the people on the mainland, they were fooled by the Prime Minister, who came over and promised wonderful things if they would support the agreement. The people of Northern Ireland have now discovered that they were fooled by the Prime Minister and people on the mainland, including many women, are also discovering that they are being fooled by the Prime Minister. Being fooled once does not mean that people will be fooled again.
<P>
<B>Mr. McWalter:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman accept that the logical conclusion of his comments is that Northern Ireland would be in a permanent state of civil war?
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for his intervention, but he is talking rubbish. Believing that there is a middle way and a compromise is more likely to promote and continue civil war than to reduce it.
<P>
Mr. Patten produced a report. We all know that he was a wet Tory and that he was governor of Hong Kong when it was returned to China, so Unionists do not have much confidence in him. However, Mr. Patten chaired the commission. Some people believe that he is God and that he produced a report that, like the laws of the Medes and Persians, cannot be changed. Every jot and tittle must be fulfilled. Sinn Fein-IRA believe that it does not go far enough and want more and the SDLP accept it completely.
<P>
When the report was published, there was a consultation process. What is the point of a consultation process if every jot and tittle of the report must be obeyed? The purpose of consultation is to discover what ordinary people think of the proposals and what the Government think about them. During the consultation process, it was made clear that the majority of people in Northern Ireland do not support many of the proposals. They certainly do not support disbandment of the Royal Ulster Constabulary, which has borne the burden of terrorism for more than 30 years, but that is what is happening and it will be replaced with some sort of neutral police force that is neither Unionist, nationalist or anything else. That policy does not have the support of the majority of the elected Members of Parliament in Northern Ireland or the majority of the people in Northern Ireland.
<P>
We object to the proposal that the name and insignia of the Royal Ulster Constabulary should be changed. It is insulting of the Government, after awarding the George cross to the Royal Ulster Constabulary, to kick the RUC in the face and say that they have done with the RUC and do not want it any longer. The majority of people in Northern Ireland, including many Roman Catholics, have no problem with the name of the Royal Ulster Constabulary. Unionists realise that any police force must change with changing circumstances and that, with a return to normal security and policing, there must be changes. We want more Roman Catholics to join the police force, but there has never been any objection to Roman Catholics joining it. Many have courageously done so and have made a valuable contribution to the RUC. In my experience of Northern Ireland, many young Roman Catholic men would happily have joined the RUC.
<P>
In the plane last night, I was reading the Belfast Telegraph and I noticed this letter from a frustrated Roman Catholic from County Tyrone. He said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> I am a nationalist and come from a very republican/nationalist stronghold in Tyrone&#151;
<P>
</UL></FONT>I would not be surprised if he came from my constituency, where there are many such areas&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> For years Sinn Fein and the SDLP ostracised Catholics who joined the RUC.
<P>
</UL></FONT>He is right there. In the 30 years in which the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh claims to have fought for peace in Northern Ireland, he has never at any time suggested that Roman Catholics should join the RUC. We wait with hope that the SDLP will suggest that young Roman Catholics should join this new, so-called neutral police force. The letter goes on:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> I have always wanted to join the police but like many other Catholics, the fear of being killed by the IRA, and the loss of family and friends who turned their backs on you, was the overriding decision not to join.
<P>
 We are a silent minority. We can't speak out, as it is politically incorrect.
<P>
 Any Catholic who has joined the RUC should be commended on their bravery and courage, because as the old cliche goes ``your own kind are the worst''.
<P>
 In the end it wouldn't matter--
<P>
</UL></FONT>That is important because it is so true, and the Government should take note of it. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will take notice of it, because the Roman Catholic&#151;he is not a Unionist--writing the letter says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> In the end it wouldn't matter what sort of police force we would have, Sinn Fein wouldn't want it, as they don't believe in the proper rule of law.
<P>
</UL></FONT>I believe that the young man who wrote that letter is correct. That is the big danger of the Bill.
<P>
We shall seek to change many provisions in the Bill--on human rights and fair employment provisions. It will be hard to justify taking a group of Protestants and Roman Catholics, training them and putting them in a pool, then taking out a number of Roman Catholics and the same number of Protestants, putting them in a police force and leaving some behind. That is contrary to human rights law. We will have a crucial discussion about that when we discuss the relevant part of the Bill.
<P>
I have discovered that those who talk the most about tolerance are, if one scratches them, generally the most intolerant people one meets. People shout about fair employment and all the rest of it, but when one begins to discuss fair employment with people who do not agree with it, one finds, equally, that they are different people.
<P>
The hon. Member for Hemel Hempstead said that a radical change is taking place in Northern Ireland. It certainly is, and it will not work. He says that the new Bill will begin the evolution of the peace process. There is no such thing as the evolution of a peace process. In fact there is no such thing as a peace process. Peace is a state, not a process: one either has it or one does not. The idea that somehow a peace process can evolve is nonsense.
<P>
<B>Mr. McWalter:</B> On a point of accuracy, I did not say that the Bill would begin the process; I said that it would continue it. That is an important point because, as the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone rightly said, that process has a continuing history, of which this is simply a component.
<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> We are all in Committee to make changes to the Bill. However, what we say about it will not make much difference, because the people who influence the Bill most, and have influenced it most so far, are not here. That is Sinn Fein-IRA. It has said that it will have nothing to do with the Bill; that the Bill will have to be completely changed and the RUC completely disbanded; and that there must be a new beginning for a police force in Northern Ireland that they will support. They are different from each of us here, because we do not have an illegal army behind us.
<P>
The threat made by the leader of Sinn Fein recently was, ``If we don't get the police force we want, the peace process will be in great danger.'' He was effectively saying, ``If we don't get what we want, we will go back to violence.'' That is the threat that hangs over the Bill, no matter what we say here in Committee. I put it to Minister of State that he is far more concerned about what Sinn Fein says than about what the Ulster Unionists say.
<P>
The hon. Member for Newry and Armagh said, ``Unless we get what we want, we will not recommend that young Roman Catholics join the new police force.'' That is nothing but political blackmail. Of course, he now has the audacity to say that it was no threat. Of course that is a threat. Given the situation in Northern Ireland, the SDLP can say nothing else because they are the surrogates of Sinn Fein. When Sinn Fein says, ``We will not join this force,'' one can rest assured that&#151;
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> On a point of order, Mr. O'Hara. Is it right that allegations of that nature and all the implications contained in that statement should stand on the record? I seek your judgment.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. It is not for me to take responsibility for the words used by the hon. Member for West Tyrone. However, I invite him to consider whether he would wish to rephrase that description of the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh.
<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> I do not think that I have said anything that I wish to withdraw, or anything with which I have any problems. If Sinn Fein says, ``We will not join this force. We will not recommend that young Catholics join this force'', the SDLP will not then recommend that young Catholics join the new police force.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for giving way. I invite him to examine our position on policing in the past 30 years. I would also ask him to remember that Sinn Fein does not support Patten. It has never given any indication that it would do so. I say to the hon. Gentleman in relation to the allegations that has made, with their subterraneous implications, ``Put us to the test. You will find out whether we can stand on our own two feet or not.'' I can assure him that we will, and that we have always done so. I can assure him that, on this issue, we will stand on our own two feet, if Patten is reintroduced into the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for those remarks. He asks us to put him to the test. I suggest that he has already been put to the test, because he once said that he would not participate in an Executive with Sinn Fein if it maintained its arms, but now he is doing it. Therefore, we have little confidence in any promises that were made in that respect.
<P>
This is an important Bill, which will engender a lot of emotion, but I trust that the Government will respond to the legitimate views of the people of Northern Ireland and maintain the honour and integrity of the Royal Ulster Constabulary. We must move forward, recognising the realities while seeking to live together peacefully.

<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I said in my opening remarks that this debate was likely to stir strong emotions, and such emotions assist the debate when they are genuinely and clearly expressed. The contribution of the hon. Member for West Tyrone reflected the absolute certainties in his mind, but I ask him to listen to the points of view of others, and to approach the debate in a genuine way and with an open mind. Is there something that he has not considered? Is there a new way forward for Northern Ireland that does not rely on the old certainties? The Government&#151;and, indeed, other Committee members&#151;will find it difficult to convince the hon. Gentleman of the merits of what they are trying to do, but such efforts are the purpose of our deliberations. The Government are expected to listen, and I ask the hon. Gentleman to listen as well.
<P>
<B>Mr. Shaun Woodward </B>(Witney): Does my right hon. Friend agree that Committee members face a simple choice? We can entrench our respective&#151;and respected&#151;positions, or take the view that the acid test of the Bill is whether it will treat communities fairly, and whether the new, transformed police force will respect the traditions and interests of those communities. The choice is therefore between entrenching the past, or respecting the communities of Northern Ireland, both now and in the future.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> Obviously, I agree with what my hon. Friend says. He made similarly strong points on Second Reading, and I hope that the hon. Member for West Tyrone will respond generously to them because that will assist our debate.
<P>
We have covered considerable ground. We shall return to many of the arguments in due course, but I shall deal now with those that require a response.
<P>
The hon. Member for Solihull based his arguments on the premise that nothing should happen until everything has happened. He applied that principle to the release of prisoners and any change that would lead to a different approach in Northern Ireland. He also made similar comments in relation to specific and important matters that are dealt with in the Bill. I say to him gently that we should consider what happened under the previous Government.
<P>
The previous Government commissioned the North report on the future of marching and parades in Northern Ireland. It was an authoritative and detailed document and it contained many challenging points, but the previous Government did not implement the recommendations that everyone else recognised as necessary. It was left to the Labour Government to take on that issue. The process was difficult, because there was strong opposition to it, but I offer that as an example of an authoritative study on a sensitive issue that the previous Government requested but did not address. The reason why is a matter for them, but we cannot make progress in Northern Ireland if we merely stand still. When that happened in the latter days of the previous Government, it had an adverse impact on the progress that could have been made in other areas as the sensitive issue of parades was approached. The Government&#151;and, more important, the society of Northern Ireland&#151;are still having to deal with that problem.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> I was involved in the discussions at the time. My recollection is that the previous Government did not implement the North report not because they backed away from difficult decisions, but because they disagreed with some of its fundamental conclusions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I would take issue with the hon. Gentleman, but do not want to get into a debate about a previous report on existing legislation. I made the point that the previous Government backed away from making difficult decisions in response to the hon. Member for Solihull. If we were to do that, we would make no progress. Sometimes the issues involved are extremely difficult to tackle and take on board.
<P>
The hon. Member for Solihull said that the Bill contains a large number of consultative processes. Northern Ireland is not like any other part of the United Kingdom; I thought that that was an accepted point of view. If it were, we would not have to deal with such legislation or address such trauma.
<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> No. These parts of the Bill deal with the Policing Board, the DPP, the CPLCs and similar local consultative processes&#151;which are about tackling the issues as far down the chain as we can, getting into the heart and guts of society, to engage people in the process of dealing with the police at all levels.
<P>
The Bill is structured as it is to try to inspire confidence in the police and promote the concept of inclusivity in society, which are not easy things to do. I could give the Committee many good examples of the success of existing consultative arrangements in doing that on a cross-community basis. However, more has to be done. Many people at the sharp end of trying to deliver that increased confidence and normalised policing would tell the Committee the same thing.
<P>
The hon. Member for Solihull asked whether the Committee would consider subordinate legislation. I give this commitment: we will do our best to provide outline drafts of statutory instruments and, if we cannot do that, we will provide memorandums explaining their effects. That will help the Committee to understand what may be important aspects of the Bill. Many of the matters on which Patten made recommendations are entirely appropriate for subordinate legislation and, thereafter, for administrative action. Such issues will not be dealt with only in Committee&#151;key elements of the Bill will have to be taken forward by those in positions of responsibility, such as the Chief Constable.
<P>
The hon. Member for Solihull referred to the premise that Patten was envisaged as being introduced into a peaceful Northern Ireland, arguing, as I understood it, that the Bill is therefore premature. I acknowledge that it would have been better had Patten been introduced into an environment other than that with which we are now dealing. However, Patten did not simply say, ``Here are my recommendations: implement them some time in the future when this new type of environment has been created.'' He and his commissioners argued that immediate change was needed in certain key areas. He pointed up a number of areas in which security would impinge upon the progress and the rate of change in the policing environment. The Government have pointed that out repeatedly. Those areas include the question of the unarmed police force, the changes to special branch and its integration into the normal criminal investigation division, the phasing out of the full-time reserve, the down-sizing of the police service and the other issues relating to the softening of police buildings and changes to police vehicles.
<P>
There is no question of change in any of those areas, unless the Chief Constable advises the Government that it can take place. The decision will not be taken because of political direction; it will be based on the Chief Constable's security assessment, and he will advise the Government on those issues. That goes back to the Chief Constable's operational independence. I see that the hon. Member for West Tyrone is shaking his head.
<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> Many Unionists do not consider it mere coincidence that, a few days after the Government have made some concession to Sinn Fein, we hear an announcement from the RUC that certain security measures are to be stood down.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I shall not respond to that. It diminishes the Chief Constable and all the Government's security advisers to suggest that, somehow, they are dancing to someone else's tune. I refute the allegation entirely. We are trying to deal with a complex situation. We have normalised society in Northern Ireland as much as we can and the vast majority of the people there welcome those changes. Eight out of the 10 police divisions no longer need Army support, and that could be done only where the RUC wanted it to happen.
<P>
When I had responsibility for economic development, the hon. Gentleman lobbied me on a number of occasions to bring industry and commerce to his constituency. The more we normalise Northern Ireland, the better the prospects for bringing in that industry and commerce; the more confidence that we create among the people of Northern Ireland, the sooner we can begin to create a stronger and more stable economy. That cannot happen in an armed camp; industrialists do not readily invest in such an environment. The hon. Gentleman has a big part to play, not only by asking for more, but by giving more, so that we can move forward.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> Before the right hon. Gentleman ends his comments on RUC command&#151;we should not personalise it by referring exclusively to the Chief Constable&#151;as the Minister responsible for policing, is he satisfied about the issues that I mentioned: the huge growth in drugs and the huge related trade and embezzlement from the Exchequer of up to &#163;1 billion a year? Does he believe that there is any evidence that RUC command is grappling with those? Is he preoccupied with the politicisation of policing, or do the practicalities ever come into it?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> The practicalities do come into it. The more normal we can make society, the more police officers can be involved in normal policing, rather than security-related policing. I chaired a co-ordinating group dealing with the drugs issue. We announced new initiatives, put money into them and made it clear that the RUC had to be a key component in them. Some of those issues have been devolved to the new Administration, and we are considering ways to ensure cross-departmental momentum. It is a difficult issue for Northern Ireland and, although I hope that it will not, it has the potential to grow.
<P>
Clearly, the police must be proactive in tackling smuggling and organised crime, but I will not listen to criticism of their efforts to discharge their functions in that area, unless there is evidence to back it up. Mere assertions do not prove a case; they must be borne out by good evidence. In making those allegations and charges, the hon. Gentleman is saying that the police are not doing their job in Northern Ireland.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I am grateful to the Minister, but I shall not concede the point. Ten years ago, I pressed for co-ordination in tackling drugs. I know the difficulties that exist now, but we have, as the Minister constantly tells us, comparative peace. However, I see no signs of RUC command. I am not talking about the ordinary policeman on the ground, and the Minister knows that. I am talking about RUC command failing to co-ordinate activity between his own force, Customs and Excise, health and safety and planners--all those people who could be sitting in a co-ordinated command and control room dealing with that business, which defrauds the Exchequer of 10 to 12 per cent. of Northern Ireland's total budget, or a comparative amount.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I am only too happy to deal with that point. I agree that the level of crime, particularly in relation to smuggling, is high. Northern Ireland is the only part of the United Kingdom that has a land border with another part of the European Union, so many opportunities for smuggling across that border exist.
<P>
The RUC is seized of that problem, as are Customs and Excise and all the Government agencies, which seek to tackle that issue where a crime has been committed. I know that the hon. Gentleman would not suggest that the police are failing in their duties in this area, but that is the inference that can be drawn. We had that kind of co-ordinated approach; we were regularly looking right across the sector that dealt primarily, on this occasion, with the growing menace of drugs to ensure joined-up government in all the key areas. The police and the RUC were important to that process, as was Customs and Excise.
<P>
I want to reply to the remarks of the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire (Mr. &#214;pik). In my earlier comments I quoted the Secretary of State's words on Second Reading when he said that the Government would be prepared to fine tune the Bill and to listen to reasoned arguments as it proceeded. I make that statement again. The hon. Gentleman asked whether that was the case and he said that it was important. As usual, I look forward to debating with him a number of the wide range of amendments that he has tabled. If we can reach agreement on fine tuning some of those points, that will be all to the good and I shall compliment him and his party for bringing those issues to our attention.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Newry and Armagh asked about the finishing times of sittings. I am not giving anything away on that, other than to say that we must get the Bill through. I make that point strongly. The Government want to see the measure on the statute book. If that means long sittings, we will have to have them. I do not think that we need to. I believe that we can take the key issues, consider the amendments, discuss the best way forward and, I hope, find points of agreement in Committee and perhaps elsewhere as the Bill progresses through its later stages.
<P>
I take issue with my hon. Friend, as I did on Second Reading, about his criticism that the Government are not standing by the main thrust of Patten and the Good Friday agreement. The Government should not be ashamed or hesitant to say what we have sought to achieve by implementing the Good Friday agreement. We have taken on every tough key issue and tried to take it forward, sometimes in a difficult environment and scenario, not least because of the extreme opposing views.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> And the lack of reciprocation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I shall not respond to that sedentary interruption because I did not quite hear what was said.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> The Minister should respond.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. If there is to be an intervention and a response, the intervention should be made from a standing position.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> In their approach to the Patten recommendations and the Bill's framework, the Government have been honest. We need to get the balance right, but if we are to do so, others need to accept that that is necessary.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Newry and Armagh catalogued various concerns. We are prepared to listen, to take on board reasoned arguments and to find a way through these difficult issues. He said that he was looking forward to getting the matter right&#151;I do so, too.
<P>
The hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone criticised the previous Police Bill, which was introduced about two years ago. He and I spent many hours trying to secure its passage through the House. It laid down the ground rules for the establishment of the office of the ombudsman. We are further along in that process than we should have been if we had waited for this Bill. That approach will help to create confidence&#151;the community should feel secure about the way in which the police will be examined after a complaint and about the way in which complaints are handled. The hon. Gentleman agrees to the concept of an ombudsman in principle. That system will establish a better relationship between the constituent parts of the tripartite structure involving the Government, the Chief Constable and the Police Authority. Whether our approach is right is a matter for debate, but we have clarified some key matters.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman discussed human rights. If I understood his point correctly, he said that the Bill could use human rights as a way to constrain police activity. I do not accept that. I am sure that most Committee members accept that human rights should be the cornerstone of any actions that are taken by the police, who should be conscious of the law and the way in which human rights impinge on and underpin all that they do.
<P>
I fully understand the opposition of the hon. Member for Basingstoke (Mr. Hunter) to the Good Friday agreement and all that flows from it. One of my hon. Friends pointed out to him that a majority of the people of Northern Ireland support that agreement. They are not starry-eyed about it, and they were not conned; they are mature citizens, they understood the complexities and challenges that were involved and they were prepared as a society and a cross-community to adopt such an approach. We should not stand still&#151;we need to listen to what the people are saying and understand how Northern Ireland is evolving and the ways in which to progress that process. The Good Friday agreement helped that approach.
<P>
I shall conclude by responding to the comments of the hon. Member for West Tyrone, who made very loose use of language in his descriptions of people. He made charges and allegations against people, which can have serious implications in Northern Ireland. To put a label on someone in Northern Ireland can sometimes put them under threat. He knows that society probably better than I do, but I hope that he agrees with me that labelling someone wrongly can have serious implications. He should be careful in Committee and elsewhere about the way in which he tries to lay charges against people or parties.
<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> I must let the Minister know that I do not need to be patronised by him.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I am not trying to patronising the hon. Gentleman. I am trying to encourage him to use a different form of words. He is answerable for what he said, and if he remains in order we must live with that, but the implication of some of his phraseology could have a serious effect outside. That is not patronising. I am making an accurate statement of fact which anyone with close knowledge of Northern Ireland would understand and accept.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before I put the Question, I want to say that I accept the Minister's closing comments. The comment of the hon. Member for West Tyrone that was challenged was in order within my terms of reference as Chairman of the Committee. However, I trust that the Committee will take to heart the Minister's comments.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Resolved,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> That, during proceedings on the Police (Northern Ireland) Bill, the Committee do meet on Tuesdays at half-past Ten o'clock and at half-past Four o'clock and on Thursdays at half-past Two o'clock.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind the Committee that there is a financial resolution in connection with the Bill and copies are available in the Room.
<P>
I also remind hon. Members that adequate notice should be given of amendments. As a rule, my co-Chairman and I do not intend to call starred amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I beg to move,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> That the Bill be considered in the following order, namely, Clause 1; Schedules 1 and 2; Clauses 2 to 13; Schedule 3; Clauses 14 to 66; Schedule 4; Clauses 67 to 70; Schedules 5 to 7; Clauses 71 to 73; new Clauses; new Schedules.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Our previous debate showed that we have a lot of work to get through and the purpose of the proposed order of consideration is to lay a framework that will allow us to proceed through the Bill in a logical and structured way. There is a slight departure from the normal order of consideration in the suggestion that the schedules will be taken with their enabling clauses. That should allow reasoned and structured debate on the important issues arising from the schedules and their enabling clauses.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<H4><center>Clause 1</center></H4>
<H4><center>The Northern Ireland Policing Board</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I shall give a brief outline of clause 1 because the important debate will flow from schedule 1. The clause establishes the Northern Ireland Policing Board to replace the Police Authority for Northern Ireland. It dissolves the Policy Authority on the creation of the board and transfers its property, liabilities and staff to the board.
<P>
I want to take the opportunity to pay tribute to the work of the Police Authority for Northern Ireland and its staff. The threats to its members and, indeed, the murder of two of its members must never be forgotten. They have carried out their duties and their difficult role to the best of their abilities. I have had points of conflict with them and they with me, but we have tried to deal with those maturely. When they have raised issues of concern we have met them--as we have when we have been concerned--to find a way through for better policing and better management of the police service in Northern Ireland.
<P>
The board's membership is determined by schedule 1 and depends on whether there is devolved government or direct rule. In either case, the board will have 19 members. During devolved government, 10 members will be nominated from the Assembly using the d'Hondt method of selection; the other nine will be appointed by the Secretary of State. Assembly Members will give the board a democratic mandate to hold the police to account. That was recommended in the Patten report which stated in paragraph 6.11 that a majority elected membership is essential if the board is to command ``respect and credibility''. That will bring the board into line with practice in Great Britain with a democratic presence in relation to that part of the tripartite structure relating to policing anywhere in the United Kingdom.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. &#214;pik:</B> I should like some technical clarification. The Minister said that the board will have 19 members. Am I correct in believing that that is the upper limit and that there is no lower limit?
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> As it stands, that is so, but it could be subject to amendment as our consideration of the Bill proceeds.
<P>
We would not want to reinstate direct rule, but we must make provision for it. All members would be appointed by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and he is required to ensure that membership of the board is representative of the wider community of Northern Ireland.
<P>
Those are the main elements that we want to achieve in the clause and its associated schedules, but many amendments will be tabled to schedule 1. I have no doubt that we shall have some important debates and I look forward to them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> This is a hugely important clause, as are the associated schedules. I keep trying to bring the Minister back to the fact that we are making decisions not about political issues but about the administration of law and order in Northern Ireland. If we bear that in mind, we have a chance of getting the provisions right. However, if we lose sight of that and brush it aside for new beginnings and so on, we shall get it wrong. We can try to create within a troubled society such as that in Northern Ireland a formula in which everyone can be included in the political process with a metamorphosis of those who once relied on violence to acceptance of a democratic way forward and the implementation of that democratic way forward. During the years, many of us have taken huge risks in trying to convince a sometimes reluctant society, especially our own supporters, that unless such processes are attempted, there are unlikely to be any Damascus road conversions. Political structures are one thing, but law and order is quite different. One of the difficulties with the new Northern Ireland Policing Board is that if it goes ahead as the Government propose, poachers will become gamekeepers. That is not a sensible way of protecting the rights and interests of ordinary members of society.
<P>
I concur with the Minister's tribute to the outgoing Police Authority for Northern Ireland. Throughout the life of the authority, people have shown immense courage at considerable risk to themselves and I must emphasise that that includes people from both traditions. They have served on the Police Authority and given unstintingly of their time and their energy.
<P>
I do not wish to be controversial, but one of my huge regrets over the lifetime of the Police Authority for Northern Ireland is that the SDLP&#151;whatever else it may have done to move things towards normality&#151;failed to meet the challenge of the Police Authority. It did not play its part in that, as it should have done.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> In a moment. Much has been said about the use of language, and I want to be careful of what I say. However, it has not been helpful to the evolution of peace in Northern Ireland that the largest nationalist party&#151;a party that has given a lead in many other ways&#151;divorced itself so completely and so publicly from a recognition of the difficult work that the RUC has had to do over the past 30 years.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> May I point out, first, to the hon. Gentleman that he should perhaps examine the very substantial records that I know he keeps? He should look at the number of people who have felt obliged to resign from the Police Authority over the years because of the way in which policing in Northern Ireland has been handled. It might be salutary for him to consider that.
<P>
Secondly, I notice that attacks are again being made on the SDLP in relation to its position. Let me repeat this very clearly. I know that the hon. Member for West Tyrone finds it hard to hear, so I shall raise my voice. Perhaps that will help his hearing; what it will do for his understanding is another matter.
<P>
Since the state was formed in the north of Ireland, there has been a fundamental dichotomy relating to allegiance, to belonging and to identification with that state. That was compounded by the way in which the policing service became a wing of Unionism, exemplified by the A specials, about which I could say plenty; the B specials, about which many others here could say plenty; the police service itself; and the police reserve. I do not want to embark on a dredging exercise on policing since 1921, but if I have to do so, I will. Let me make it clear that Unionism looked upon the whole concept of policing as its own service.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. That intervention has become rather lengthy. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will make his point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> Thank you, Mr. O'Hara. I look forward to the opportunity of expanding on that issue in due course. What we see here is the refusal of Unionism to give up the concept of their police service, out to cater for their political needs. That is why it is hurting them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh for allowing me to intervene on his speech.
<P>
The SDLP was formed to promote a new approach to politics in Northern Ireland. What was supposed to make it different from the old nationalist party was that it would take a pragmatic approach. While not shelving its political aspirations, it was supposed to take a new, pragmatic approach to enabling, to quote his party leaders, two traditions to live together and share this island.
<P>
I make the point simply. If anyone wishes me to do so, I can go in detail into those who resigned from the Police Authority, not only because they disagreed with the way in which Northern Ireland was policed. I can think of one chief education officer who was forced, through threat of violence, to resign from the Police Authority, much to his regret. I do not want to go down that road. I want to bring the SDLP back to its tenets, back to its own raison d'etre, and to say to it, ``You cannot have it two ways. You cannot see yourself merely as a party that is competing for the nationalist aspiration.''
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman is departing from the terms of the clause and should come back into order.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I am grateful, Mr. O'Hara. I am trying not to depart from the terms of the clause but to explain why membership of whatever authority has been in existence requires a common-sense and principled approach. If I dare use the Patten word, we cannot cherry-pick the way in which we serve society. When we attempt to form a new board, parties cannot sit on the periphery saying, ``If it's not exactly to our liking, we will not participate, and if we don't participate, the new beginning with the police interfacing with society cannot happen.''
<P>
It may not be something with which you are familiar, Mr. O'Hara, but I have republican families in my constituency who would not join the RUC if it were gold-plated. Moreover, they would not join the Garda Siochana if it were gold-plated. There are those who hang on to an old, late 19th-century philosophy that prevents them from addressing the issues that we are having to address here in 21st-century terms.
<P>
I am not picking on the SDLP. I simply implore it to be more rational, and not to think primarily about the competition between it and another republican party for the nationalist vote but to think of society, as it promised it would do at its inception and endorsed at the acceptance of the Belfast agreement.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> I am delighted to hear that the hon. Gentleman and the hon. Member for West Tyrone are not ganging up on me. If I thought that they were, I would be terribly worried.
<P>
Let me make this clear, because I have seen a pattern emerging in the short time that the Committee has been sitting. This will not be an SDLP-bashing exercise for three months. I have been the spokesman in this area for upwards of 30 years and will not allow any of those implications to go unchallenged. It may sound like good fun to the hon. Gentleman and to the hon. Member for West Tyrone, but more than one can join in that fun. I hope that we can get on with the work and are not side-tracked by frivolities, because more than two can play at that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I shall not be distracted by the belittling of the serious point that I am making. Ulster Unionists are not the only ones who must examine their conscience and the way in which they play their part--
<P>
It being One o'clock, The Chairman adjourned the Committee without Question put, pursuant to the Standing Order.
