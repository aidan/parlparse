<P>
<B>Mr. Erick Pickles </B>(Brentwood and Ongar): I beg to move amendment No. 321, in page 52, leave out lines 34 and 35 and insert--
<P>
(2) The restrictions mentioned in subsection (1) are:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) The relevant benefit shall not be payable to the offender for the prescribed period and shall be replaced by the presentation to the offender of vouchers to the value of the relevant benefit which may be redeemed by the offender in exchange only for such goods and services as may be prescribed; or
<P>
(b) A proportion, determined at the Secretary of State's discretion, of the relevant benefit shall be replaced for the prescribed period with vouchers of the type mentioned in (a); or
<P>
(c) Subject to subsections (3) to (5), the relevant benefit shall not be payable in the offender's case for the prescribed period.
<P>
(3) the Secretary of State shall upon receipt of notification in accordance with regulations under section 51 that the information has been laid elect which of the restrictions mentioned in (2) shall apply in the offender's case.
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss amendment No. 323, in page 53, line 21, at end insert
<P>
unless the restriction applied was imposed under either subsection 2(a) or 2(b) in which case no adjustments shall be made and no compensation shall be payable.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> The amendments are a tribute to the Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Social Security, who laid down the doctrine that benefits should be conditional on the fulfilment of responsibilities to society--a view that we share. The amendment's intent is almost identical to the Government's, with the exception that we suggest the use of vouchers as payment in such circumstances, rather than, for example, cash.
<P>
Before we embark on consideration of the specific use of vouchers, I should say that the amendment, like the clause, would remove people's benefits if they defaulted on, for instance, community service orders. I shall not repeat everything that we went through this morning--I shall take that as it stands.
<P>
The amendment has been tabled to explore the matter. I meant to check before I came to Committee, but I am almost certain that a character in the George Bernard Shaw version of the Anthony and Cleopatra says that, if someone is about to embark on a foolish course, they always say that it is a matter of national duty. We must ensure that neither Government nor Opposition Members embark on a foolish matter on the basis of responsibility and duty.
<P>
The Under-Secretary mildly disappointed me this morning because she sought to persuade us that there was nothing new about the plan--that it was common practice to place conditions and was part of a trend. It is not. It is an extension of something that has existed for a while, and which is part of the Government's general philosophy. It has its roots way back when the Labour party was in Opposition, and owes much to the Prime Minister's lecture for The Spectator. I cannot understand the Under-Secretary's reticence about saying that it is one step beyond what already exists.
<P>
I recall the Secretary of State for Social Security saying that he was trying to create consensus around welfare reform, and that might be possible on clause 49. Admittedly, our amendment goes further than the Government's proposal: it would extend the conditions, to use the Under-Secretary's words. Nevertheless, it is in the spirit of what has been suggested. I want Labour Members to understand that the amendment is serious. It is not an attempt to go slightly to the right of the Government on welfare reform and penalties. The Opposition have long understood that it is virtually impossible to go right of the Government, but we enjoy the race.
<P>
The amendment would improve the current system because it would go furher than basic conditions. It relates to social responsibilities that may be outside the particular circumstances of the benefit. We are considering such an approach for the first time, and it is to be welcomed. The amendment is not only about compliance, fraud or single parents and cohabitation, which were mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for New Forest, West (Mr. Swayne). Nor does it relate to attempts to seek work--a condition of the benefits--or to proposals made by the previous Government on truancy. We have tried to build a consensus.
<P>
I referred to the Prime Minister's lecture for The Spectator, which was the precursor of the clause and, to some extent, of the amendment. In preparing for this debate, I paid particular attention to ``New Labour, New Welfare State? The Third Way in British Social Policy''. The book was edited by Martin Powell, who comments on the Prime Minister's speech, and says that the third way for Labour has meant articulating a philosophy of citizenship that conjures up notions of rights and duties.
<P>
That was more explicitly stated in the Prime Minister's 1995 lecture for The Spectator, in which he spoke of the rights that we enjoy and the duties that we owe. Mr. Powell suggests that, in the light of that, Labour has adopted a more conditional approach to citizen's rights on social security, retaining many of the ideas that surround the Tories' jobseeker's allowance. Many of us rather welcomed the Prime Minister's lecture, which contained more than a grain of truth. It led to the appointment of the Minister of State's predecessor, the right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field), to start the whole process of thinking the unthinkable. I suspect that provisions such as the clause would have been unthinkable five years ago, at the time of the lecture.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Birkenhead began to consider the paternalistic welfare approach of the American model. I was especially struck by a contribution that he made to an Institute of Economic Affairs health and welfare pamphlet, No. 39 in the institute's ``Choice in Welfare'' series, entitled ``From Welfare to Work: Lessons from America''. The leaflet had a number of contributors, the most notable of whom was the right hon. Member for Birkenhead, who wrote a response to an analysis conducted by Mr. Lawrence Mead. He wrote:
<P>
One of the arguments he puts forward for his ``paternalist welfare'' is that the taxpayer will only be willing to fund a system that helps the poor on the explicit basis that the poor behave themselves, or rather behave in ways of which they approve.
Those are the words of the right hon. Member for Birkenhead, and they tell us something that is probably right. He speaks of why people should earn benefits, but states:
<P>
On the other hand, perhaps the reason social security is sacrosanct is because people feel that they have a real stake in it, and a say in how it operates. If the contributors have a bigger role in drawing up the rules, the system will become more stable and more sustainable, so it can draw directly on the deep natural resource of civic values. The key goal of welfare reform is inclusion: giving all of us a stake in our nation's future.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I do not want to disturb the trend of the hon. Gentleman's thought, but I remind him that the amendment is about vouchers. I am waiting to hear him refer to them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I shall get round to vouchers, but as you will see, Mr. O'Brien, the amendment seeks to impose vouchers on the model proposed in the clause. It is intended to explore the Government's policy and to ask why they are introducing the new duty. I am following a useful practice by trying to avoid a stand part debate and to explore only the matters of concern. Indeed, the Minister of State was kind enough to say that there had been no time-wasting in the Committee. I said that we wanted to debate two items, and I am speaking about the second.
<P>
I want to put on record the Government's reasons for thinking that a duty exists and to obtain an explanation of the ways in which people should fulfil it. The clause makes an important change that we want to support, but we want to be clear on it. One thing is certain: if we can formulate a clear statement of the citizen's duties, our actions will be running with the grain of society. It makes a pleasant change for us to do something of which the public approve. We spend most of our time passing laws that make us more and more unpopular, so why not do something that will make us popular? The add-on proposed in the amendment would ensure that we go with the grain of society. I know that it is fashionable to do something that the public dislike, but I cannot see a problem if they think that it is a good thing. Our voucher system is appropriate.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for New Forest, West cited two interesting examples when he discussed whether benefit should be withdrawn. There are distinctions to be made. He talked about the receipt of social security benefits that are subject to satisfying certain conditions--they are often linked to entitlement--and the receipt of benefit by single parents and those who cohabit. To receive jobseeker's allowance--a contributory benefit--claimants have to satisfy three conditions: they must be available for work, actively seeking work and willing to enter into a jobseeker's agreement. A jobseeker's direction may be issued to require claimants to apply for a vacancy, to make a speculative approach to an employer or to attend an interview. As we know from our discussions in January, sanctions can be applied to income support or income-baseed jobseeker's allowance for non-co-operation with the Child Support Agency.
<P>
The decision to introduce vouchers builds on the new welfare contract. The part of the contract entitled ``Duty of us all'' sums up the genesis of the amendment and the Government's approach as being:
<P>
To help all individuals and families to realise their full potential and live a dignified life, by promoting economic independence through work, by relieving poverty where it cannot be prevented and by building a strong and cohesive society where rights are matched by responsibilities.
I commend in particular the words
<P>
building a strong and cohesive society.
<P>
Why are vouchers, which are used in some parts of the United States of America, worth while? We are concerned about how family budgets are allocated. What seems to happen is that the man of the family decides what he needs from his income and the family shares out the rest. The Association of Chief Officers of Probation is also worried about the effect that the proposals will have on the typical household. Its submission to us states:
<P>
research shows that for many households the typical pattern is that the man takes what he considers he needs and the woman is left with the rest for the children and herself. Loss of benefit will clearly have a significant impact on the rest of the family's income.
That is clearly not desirable. Neither we nor, I suspect, the Government intend to hurt the family. That is the reason for the amendment, substituting vouchers for cash or other payment. It is intended that the money should be spent on necessities for bringing up the family.
<P>
The Under-Secretary said that the relevant period would be only a month. Amendments have been tabled that would give the Secretary of State some discretion to extend it a little. We want to ensure that even with so short a period as a month, there would be no possibility of the family's suffering because an individual defaulted on a community service order. After all, they would have been through the process of that family member's committing a crime, being caught, appearing in court and being sentenced. They would have wondered whether they would be separated from the man of the household--and the offender is usually a chap, as the Under-Secretary said; we should not shy away from that fact. I do not see why, following breach of the community service order, the family should face additional punishment, should the man decide just to keep the amount suggested by the probation officer. The real losers would be the family and children.
<P>
The voucher would be redeemable only against necessities. It would not be exchangeable for money. If the Under-Secretary accepts the amendment we shall co-operate in the introduction of regulations to make it an offence to cash the voucher. We would ensure that it could not be exchanged for cigarettes or alcohol. It could be exchanged only for necessities for the children.
<P>
In the process that is being set up under the Bill, there would be one shot across the chap's bow when he was told, ``One more mistake and your benefit will be cut, and you will be back before the courts''. Then a second shot would be fired when he would be told the consequences of not co-operating with the courts or the order. The third shot across his bow would be making him face his responsibilities by seeing that purchases were made for the family. That would help to bring people back to be useful in society, in much the same way as a community service order.
<P>
We would not for a moment describe our amendment as elegant and we know that it would require some attention. However, it is right to protect families and children from the consequences of cutting the father's benefit. We know that the measure would affect only the element of benefit pertaining to the individual concerned. The Under-Secretary said that there was no intention of extending the provision to council tax or housing benefits.

<P>

<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Social Security (Angela Eagle) indicated assent.</B><P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> The hon. Lady nods. Extending the clause to those benefits would impinge on the family. If the Government do not intend to affect the family--their decision on council tax and housing benefits leads me to believe that they do not--the amendment is a natural extension of their aim. It would protect other members of the families of those subject to community service orders. I look forward to what the Under-Secretary has to say.
<P>
<B>Mr. Desmond Swayne </B>(New Forest, West): I shall not detain the Committee long because my hon. Friend has been so eloquent in his exposition of the amendment. Earlier, I required some convincing, but no longer. The amendment would be a measured approach to the promotion of what might be called socially responsible shopping.
<P>
Members of the Committee might think that the procedure was novel, but I do not--it has a long history. There was a time when a significant proportion of the work force was so remunerated under the system of truck. I would agree with hon. Members who believe that the system was discredited. The fact that it was discredited is perhaps why some might hark back to a memory that leads them to disapprove of such systems. However, more recently vouchers have been used in comparable benefit systems--for example, the use of food stamps in the United States.
<P>
I was subjected to such a regime in my youth. In 1969, my income was 8s 6d a week; 2s was payable for good behaviour, 4s was payable for completing chores and 2s 6d was paid as of right, but as a fruit voucher redeemable only at Macfisheries. Such systems are subject to abuse--people can circumvent them by swapping vouchers for cash--but it is difficult in practice. Try as I might, over many months, I could never find anyone prepared to swap a Macfisheries fruit voucher for 2s 6d. One inevitably ended up having to redeem the voucher for the intended purpose. The person paying the voucher--here, the Secretary of State--would be given a powerful tool for enforcing socially responsible behaviour.
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Department of Social Security (Mr. Jeff Rooker):</B> At least it was a healthy diet.
<P>
<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> Indeed it was; the Minister anticipates me. He must recall that the vouchers would be payable to miscreants who have breached their orders. They would be a punishment, but would also provide an opportunity for a healthy diet. The Minister will undoubtedly be aware of the work that has been done linking poor diet to bad behaviour, especially in respect of food additives. The Secretary of State might be able to use the power that the amendment would give him to draw up regulations to condition voucher recipients' consumption, to promote better behaviour. I see the potential of the amendment, which would be only to the benefit of society.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paul Burstow </B>(Sutton and Cheam): Having listened to the hon. Member for New Forest, West, I think that I need to create some distance on the matter. I should love to have been a member of the Committee that considered the regulations described by the hon. Gentleman. We could have a useful debate about what might constitute an appropriate voucher for various types of foodstuffs.
<P>
The approach set out by the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. Pickles) seemed very attractive, especially as it was couched in the language of new Labour. I understand why he is trying to coax the Government along the path on which they have started, but it seems to me that such a scheme would create even more administrative burdens and costs of the sort that I fear it will produce anyway. For those practical reasons, it should not be included in the Bill. Although the amendment might go some way towards addressing the concern that I raised earlier about the impact on families, its proposals for dealing with the problem are unacceptable. Therefore, I shall oppose the amendments if they are pressed to a vote.
5 pm
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Leigh </B>(Gainsborough): We had an interesting debate this morning when we all agreed that people who break their side of the bargain with society should face the consequences. However, it is very easy to sit in one's armchair and say that because people have misbehaved, their benefits should be cut, without considering the consequences of introducing such a measure. Therefore, I do not envy the job of Department of Social Security or Home Office Ministers. It is easy to take a hard line when framing legislation, but if one sits in court, as I have done--not as a judge, but as prosecuting or defence counsel--in mitigation, one discovers that there are all sorts of difficulties with imposing harsh sentences.
<P>
The problem with imposing harsh sentences is that it is often not the offender but the offender's family who suffers. We no longer believe in creating the sort of society in which we punish people irrespective of the consequences for their families. That places a heavy burden on society because we know that certain elements in society have lost any sense of moral compass and do exactly as they please. Certain families have made life on certain estates a living hell, and I understand the Government's determination to tackle the problem. Equally, one cannot simply take away benefits from families who have nothing else to live on. I hope that the Under-Secretary will reassure us that measures to withdraw benefits from individuals will have no effect on innocent parties, children or spouses.
<P>
We should regard the amendment not as a hard-nosed attempt to grind down such people but as a way of trying to find a solution to the problem. We need to consider how to make clear society's determination to grapple with the problem. We need to establish a real sense of retribution and an understanding that people who are bound by orders must obey them, but we need to consider how we can do that and ensure that individuals or their families are not caused undue hardship. The reference to vouchers might seem to be a retrograde step and a harsh proposal, but it might be a humane way to proceed. We all know that the Government have accepted such a concept for asylum seekers so, as my hon Friends have said, it is not entirely new. It is at least worth debating.
<P>
<B>Mr. Laurence Robertson </B>(Tewkesbury): It seems easy to design rules, laws or systems for the middle or upper classes. It is probably quite easy to design rules, systems and ways of life for working class people like me, who have never been unemployed or sick. Things get tricky when it is necessary to decide what benefits to pay to people, and who should qualify.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar mentioned the possible difficulty of withdrawing benefits from people, and on whom that responsibility might fall. We discussed that this morning, but I did not go into detail about the role of community service and probation officers. I did not think it relevant.
<P>
My experience came from the fact that 20 years ago my wife was a community service officer. She sometimes had to report to her superiors people who had failed in their community service. Twice she was subjected to bad behaviour. Once someone fired a gun through the window of her house, and another time someone set her car on fire. The car was at the side of the house, which almost burnt down. Those incidents were very serious. We must never give in to violence or the threat of violence, but my hon. Friend's point about withdrawing all the support relied on by such people and their families is valid. The amendment is worth considering very seriously.
<P>
<B>Mrs Jacqui Lait </B>(Beckenham): My hon. Friend the Member for Tewkesbury (Mr. Robertson) made a graphic point about the pressures that families can experience when already low incomes are reduced, whether or not we approve of behaviour that breaches a community service order. The thinking behind the amendments is that replacing the withdrawn income with vouchers would be a way to help people who probably already have difficulty in managing budgets and would find any reduction in income extraordinarily difficult to cope with.
<P>
As was discovered with child benefit, children and mothers are often the ones who suffer in the circumstances that we are thinking about. When child benefit was introduced, the arguments were all about the pattern of spending by which the man would take the bulk of the family income, leaving the woman in real hardship looking after the children. Hence it was decided that payment should be made into the purse rather than the wallet. We tried to pursue that principle last year in the Welfare Reform and Pensions Act 1999. Unfortunately, the Government did not accept our approach then, but it is still a valid way of ensuring that innocent victims do not suffer.
<P>
I must apologise for having this morning attributed the voucher suggestion to probation officers. In fact, that was a read across from their comments about the hardship fund to the amendment. I apologise if I inadvertently put into their mouths words that they would not claim.
<P>
If, by some unconscionable process, the Under-Secretary decides not to accept our amendment, how will mothers whose income is reduced under the clause be affected? The Under-Secretary might deny it, but the British public would accept that the reduction was being used as a punishment. The innocent parties are the mother and children, and the only help that they will get is that the benefit reduction will be less than it would have been had hardship not been established. However, those on a tight budget will nevertheless experience distinct hardship.
<P>
What help will be given? For example, as a result of the reduction, will a woman who accesses the social fund constitute a greater priority for a grant or loan? Will any other interim payment benefit only the mother and children? I cannot recall such a payment off the top of my head, and I certainly do not want to encourage the creation of yet another special fund. Were such a fund to be established, the administrative burdens would be huge, and Committee members would probably spend several additional weeks arguing about the matter. However, we must not alienate even further the innocent victims of a mistake that was made perhaps by the husband or male partner. The Minister must reassure us on this matter; otherwise, the Opposition will be even more concerned that a voucher system should be made available to help the mother and children.

<P>

<B>Miss Julie Kirkbride </B>(Bromsgrove): I rise to support my hon. Friends. Although I am in favour of the proposed reduction or removal of benefit for those who are in breach of community service orders--which was discussed this morning--I nevertheless recognise that, for those with families, the withdrawal of benefit constitutes a problem. Our amendment, which would introduce a voucher scheme, could provide a solution. People in receipt of vouchers would be obliged to spend them in a certain way, and families might find that less of a punishment for the person whose benefit has been docked.
<P>
One presumes that, when considering whether they could legally get away with removing benefit, the Government had in mind a recent comparison that can be made. When the previous Conservative Government tried to remove asylum seekers' right to benefit, they were taken to court. It was decided that, the National Assistance Act 1948, the Government were not allowed to deny right of benefit or support to vulnerable individuals, particularly children. [Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order.
<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> Thank you, Mr. O'Brien.
<P>
I wonder whether the present Government have taken the court's decision into account. Given that benefits may not be denied to asylum seekers, children or other vulnerable people--a description that also includes those with mental problems--and that the state must assist them, the Government's proposal could give rise to difficulties.
<P>
Our voucher scheme offers a way forward, and we would welcome its introduction through legislation, so that it would be paid for by the national taxpayer. A frustrating consequence of the court decision to which I referred was that the bill in respect of asylum seekers had to be picked up not by the national taxpayer, as it was in the past, but by local councils, which are required to provide support under the National Assistance Act. That has created all kinds of difficulties. For example, Kent county council has had to raise its council tax by some £3 per household, merely to support young people who have to be looked after by the local council and cannot be deprived of that support. That is unfair on local council tax payers.
 <P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
Individuals who may fall foul of the measure are likely to live in the more deprived areas. Sadly, bad behaviour often occurs in those areas, where greater numbers of people tend to be on benefit. That means that people on benefit who might become a burden on the local taxpayers are likely to be clustered in one particular area. That is an extra unfairness on the taxpayer, who already experiences the difficulties that arise out of such deprived areas.
<P>
Have the Government taken into account the courts' view that children have to be looked after under the National Assistance Act, irrespective of what the Government may have decided about the benefits regime? If so, they should find our proposal for a voucher scheme attractive. It offers them a get-out in that it would provide a form of punishment for people not obeying the law, who could no longer spend the money as they wished and would be obliged to spend it in the way that society wished.
<P>
The amendment would enable the Government to get round potential problems in terms both of the European Court of Human Rights and domestic law, in the form of the National Assistance Act. It offers an interesting and sensible way forward, and I shall be interested to hear what the Under-Secretary has to say.
<P>
<B>Angela Ealge:</B> I do not want to keep Conservative Members in suspense, so I shall start by saying that we do not intend to introduce vouchers, which may give a flavour of the nature of my reply. Some interesting points were raised, but some suggested confusion, especially the assertion by the hon. Member for Bromsgrove (Miss Kirkbride) that asylum seekers are relevant in this respect. She is wrong, as I shall explain in a moment.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 321 and 323 would give the officer acting on behalf of the Secretary of State discretion in determining the nature of the benefit sanction to be imposed on an offender who has been referred to court for breaching a community sentence. Such a discretion would detract from the simplicity of the measure, which is designed to ensure that the rights to benefits are clearly linked to the fulfilment of responsibilities to society. That is a simple message, which is easy to understand and administer. We shall pilot the measures to test whether, as we suspect, they will act as a deterrent to behaviour such as breaching community sentences, and it is therefore important to keep the message and actions simple and predictable.
<P>
Introducing vouchers would inevitably complicate matters. It would also dilute the effect of the sanction. The sanction of having money taken away is a clearer, simpler, harder message to people than that of having their money transformed into vouchers that they have to spend on particular items. We have learned something interesting about the childhood of the hon. Member for New Forest, West and how he spent his pocket money. [Hon. Members: ``That explains a lot.''] I hesitate to go into detail about what it explains, but we can all draw our own conclusions. I presume that, as a result of his upbringing and his regular use of the fruit vouchers, the hon. Gentleman eats five pieces of fruit a day, as he is supposed to.
<P>
The hon. Minister for Brentwood and Ongar was right to say that this is a more conditional approach to benefits. It is an approach that we are taking in other areas, as I said in the earlier debate--for example, in regard to the new requirement that will take effect in April, where those applying for a range of benefits will have to submit themselves to an interview about their availability for work. It applies not only to jobseeker's allowance but to other non-work-related benefits such as income support.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I do not want the Minister to go too far down that path. She may have been distracted by the amount of fruit that my hon. Friend the Minister for New Forest, West may have eaten, although I always regard him as a carnivore. Our amendment is not, as she said, an alternative to taking away benefit; it would act as a cushion, which the Secretary of State can prescribe, once benefit is taken away. It offers as a voucher the bit that may still be paid as a proportion.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> Let me explain the hardship arrangements, so that Opposition Members are reassured that systems exist to ensure that the innocent do not suffer. We are as anxious as Opposition Members to ensure do not.
 <P>
One might think from some of the comments that no sanctions are applied at present, but they are, and a hardship payment forms part of the employment sanctions. The clause simply extends the existing sanction system in the benefits system into this area to emphasise rights and responsibilities. The nature of the sanction system has not changed. As we pilot the scheme, we shall also check that the balance is right.
<P>
Let me take hon. Members through the hardship provisions. There is no hardship fund for jobseeker's allowance, but reduced jobseeker's allowance is paid in certain circumstances when a benefit sanction for employment purposes has been put in place. Vulnerable groups--not people made vulnerable by the proposals but, broadly, those with children or with sick or disabled people in their families--can apply for hardship payments immediately. Those who are not in vulnerable groups can apply for hardship payments after two weeks. Payments are likely to be made if the people would otherwise suffer hardship--in other words, if they have no alternative sources of finance. If, for example, a claimant had £400 in the bank that could tide them over the temporary loss of benefit, hardship payments would be unlikely to be payable, but if they had nothing in the bank and no other obvious means of support, hardship payments would almost certainly be payable.
<P>
Hardship payments equate to the normal rates of benefit less 40 per cent. of the single person's allowance--so allowances for children are not affected--or 20 per cent. in the case of somebody who is seriously ill or pregnant. Income support claimants do not get hardship payments as such, but receive at the outset a reduced amount of benefit of an equivalent amount--that is, normal rates of benefit less 40 per cent. of the single person's allowance or, again, 20 per cent. if they are seriously ill or pregnant. We skirted that issue when we debated child support. Those hardship arrangements will be in place and available for those who have been subject to sanction under the clause.
<P>
The hon. Member for Beckenham (Mrs Lait) referred to the more extreme case, where a claimant is denying a family access to benefits and making the innocent suffer. In such cases, arrangements can be made to pay all or part of the benefit to another member of the family. Hardship payments will, therefore, be calculated on a similar basis to that already applying to recipients of jobseeker's allowance who are subject to employment-related sanctions.
<P>
The hon. Lady made a point about the social fund. Claimants sanctioned for breaches of community sentences who receive hardship payments in lieu of jobseeker's allowance, training allowances or income support will be eligible for crisis and budgeting loans. However, sanctioned jobseeker's allowance or training allowance recipients who are not eligible for hardship payments will have only restricted access to crisis loans for expenses such as the consequences of a disaster, or in respect of items required for cooking or heating. They would have no access to budgeting loans or community care grants. We must not allow the circumstances to arise in which we sanction someone, then restore their entire benefit in the form of hardship payments. There will be a financial penalty for breaching a community sentence.

<P>

<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> Does not that undermine the argument put forward by the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam (Mr. Burstow) and by the Association of Chief Officers of Probation that the measure might tempt people towards crime because they have no other way of obtaining money? Does it not emphasise the philosophy that there should be no necessity to commit further crimes?
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> Yes, I agree. The hardship system exists to prevent destitution.
<P>
The hon. Member for Tewkesbury spoke of his wife's experiences of aggressive behaviour. As I mentioned earlier, there are required standards of behaviour for those serving a community sentence that prohibit violence or threats of violence towards probation staff and others with whom they come into contact. Any violent conduct towards a probation officer would be regarded by the court as aggravating the seriousness of the breach of the order. Clearly, we cannot give benefits unconditionally to those who are violent while applying sanctions to those who are not. We are aware of the worries of probation officers in relation to this issue, and we shall work with them to address their fears. We shall also examine those practical issues in the pilots. As the hon. Gentleman said, the potential for such threats should be taken into account, but should not provide a reason for not proceeding with these issues.
<P>
The hon. Member for Bromsgrove spent some time talking about asylum seekers. They are in a different category from other benefit recipients. They are temporary residents who should support themselves. We are committed to providing a safety net for asylum seekers when needed, but in a way that provides no incentive for abuse of the system. That is why we introduced the voucher system, but it would be a very different matter to introduce it in any other context.
<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> I may not have made myself clear. My point was related not to what the present Government are doing with vouchers for asylum seekers, but to how the previous Conservative Government sought to deprive certain categories of asylum seeker of any state assistance if they arrived in certain circumstances. We were taken to court, and our policy was subject to a judicial review. It was decided that vulnerable asylum seekers--perhaps young or mentally disturbed people--should be looked after by the councils under the old National Assistance Act, no matter what the circumstances of their arrival. It is therefore not possible merely to remove state support. With regard to removal of benefits, the Minister intends that people with families who have defied community service orders--
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> The hon. Lady is again mixing up two systems. I explained--in some depth, I hope--that our proposals would apply under existing benefit sanction systems and different parts of the law. The part of the law to which she refers relates to people who are temporarily resident, who have not been in the country, and who have not established a right to stay in the country but are asylum seekers. Such people are protected, as the previous Government found, by local authority social services under the National Assistance Act. We would not expect people who would lose benefits under this clause to be eligible for support from that Act, as there must be grounds of destitution. As I explained, that is partly because of the hardship scheme, which is tried and tested and used for other benefit recipients all the time. While the Act places duties on local authority social services with respect to people who are destitute and have no means of support, the exclusion from benefit in this case will be temporary. Those who would otherwise be in hardship can quality for hardship payments, after two weeks at most, or immediately in the case of vulnerable groups. Claimants will still have access to housing and council tax benefit. Those two groups are not remotely the same, and the hon. Lady should not mix them up.
<P>
The imposition of a sanction by paying all or part of benefits by voucher would be a major departure. Our proposals ensure that recipients of jobseeker's allowance who are liable to be sanctioned under the measures will be treated in a similar way to jobseeker's allowance claimants who are subject to employment-related sanctions. We have made it clear that vulnerable groups will be protected, and hardship payments will be available to protect jobseeker's allowance and training allowance recipients. Again, the hardship payments will be similar to those that have been a long-standing feature for jobseeker's allowance recipients who are subject to an employment sanction. We should always bear in mind that those who comply with a sentence of a court will suffer no loss of benefit under the proposals. The only people affected by the measure will be those who, having been found guilty of a crime, have subsequently failed to comply with a community sentence.
<P>
The amendments introduce unwelcome complexity and discretion into what are simple, easy-to-understand proposals. I urge the Committee to reject them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I am mildly disappointed--I put it no more strongly--that the hon. Lady could not accept my invitation to provide some explanation of the duties and responsibilities. Clearly, they constitute a change in the way in which the child benefit system operates. We shall now have to wait and see the result of various judicial reviews. I may have made a mistake in my choice of language. It is probably a mistake to quote the modern Labour party, the Prime Minister and the right hon. Member for Birkenhead at the same time. Perhaps I should have looked to other heroes of the Labour movement as a means of enticement.
<P>
I am saddened that the Government cannot accept the amendment, although it was designed to probe two issues: the new responsibility and exactly how to protect the family. Although teh Minister has gone some way towards assuring the Committee on the second of those, she has moved from a bold statement in a written answer in January to a guarded response on the last day in February. A month can be a long time in politics. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> We now come to amendment No. 322, which is a very limited amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 322, in page 53, line 11, leave out from ``period'' to end of line 12.
<P>
I am most hurt Mr. O'Brien. I am reminded of Monty Python and the Spanish inquisition: there was always one more point that they wanted to make. I was genuine in wanting to discuss two more matters in detail. As you said, Mr. O'Brien, this is a limited amendment and it is not our intention to delay the proceedings. We are as keen as mustard to make progress--as keen as the Government Whip. The hon. Gentleman should stop worrying and place his trust in me to get us through.
<P>
This is a short amendment. I want the Government to explore why some training is exempt. It is as simple as that. I have every confidence that the Under-Secretary, who will be on her feet in a few seconds, will be able to put us right.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> Amendment No. 322 would remove from the Bill the power to make regulations that allow some training allowances in certain cases to remain in payment following a community punnishment sanction. As drafted, it also removes the first line of sub (6), which deals with the restoration of benefits when a court has decided that a community sentence breach has not occurred. I am sure that that is not what the hon. Genteleman intended.
<P>
Training allowances are equivalent to, and paid instead of, jobseeker's allowance for some unemployed people undergoing training. The Bill links receipt of training allowances to compliance with community sentences because of their close links with jobseeker's allowance.
<P>
The state's efforts to help unemployed people to train and prepare for work should not be offered irrespective of whether their other obligations to society are met. Those efforts will be significantly undermined if people continue to be in trouble with the criminal justice system.
<P>
We intend the sanction to apply to participants in work-based learning for adults and the new deal for young people. It will affect only the basic element of their training allowance equivalent to the benefit they would have got if they were unemployed and not participating in a training scheme. Any premium or top-up payment will continue in payment if they continue training. That may encourage offenders to complete their training courses.
<P>
Top-up payments and premiums are designed to help with the extra costs of attending training programmes. Top-up payments of £15.38 a week are made in the new deal for young people and training premiums of £10 a week are made in work-based learning for adults. Hardship payments will also be available in appropriate cases. The amendment would mean that top-up payments and training premiums could not continue to be paid to people who continued to participate in their programme following a community punishment sanction. I therefore urge the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I have only one question to ask before I consider asking leave to withdraw the amendment. In previous debates, we discussed the effects of the European convention on human rights and we are aware that contibutory benefits are a particular worry; the hon. Lady kindly agreed to write to my hon. Friend the Member of Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh) on the subject. Does her reluctance to accept the amendment in its imperfect form have any connection with the relationship between those matters and the jobseeker's allowance?
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> I thought that I had explained that we want the system to be broadly the same for jobseeker's allowance and training allowance payments, which are made when people attend the training courses that I mentioned earlier--the work-based learning for adults and the new deal for the under-25s. The Bill will achieve that objective, because training allowances are similar to jobseeker's allowance. That is what motivated the measure, not worries about compliance with the European convention.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I accept the hon. Lady's assurances, although I am not entirely convinced. However, as it was a probing amendment, and in the interests of making rapid progress, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am impressed.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mrs Lait:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 297, in page 53, line 12, at end insert--
<P>
(5A) Where the relevant benefit is the additional pension in a widowed parent's allowance or bereavement allowance under section 39C of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 or a Category A retirement pension payable under section 45 of that Act, no restriction shall apply unless the offender has been convicted of one or more offences specified in section 92(4) of the Pensions Act 1995.
<P>
This is a probing amendment and given the Under-Secretary's assurances about the age of people being targeted, all references to pensioners should be deleted. However, some widows are younger than 59; will the hon. Lady tell us whether there will be any effect on widows allowances? [Interruption.] The hon. Lady points to the Minister of State, who will reply to the debate; I assure him that my contribution will be brief.
<P>
The list of benefits being targeted does not appear to include the bereavement allowances and the widowed parent's allowance. However, paragraph 367 on page 93 of the explanatory notes refers only to the pilot phase of the scheme; I want to know what will be the effect on their benefits if a widow or a widower breaches a community service order. Widowed people are very vulnerable and we are anxious to have the right hon. Gentleman's assurance that the Government are not considering extending the proposal, in any shape or form, to widows or widowers.
<P>
I note from the explanatory notes that any extension of the list of benefits would be introduced by affirmation resolution procedure in the House, so the matter would be debated. However, I put it on the record that we do not want widows' and widowers' benefits to be targeted.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I shall be brief, as I want to make rapid progress. The Under-Secretary, in reply to an earlier debate, went some way towards reassuring us that the proposals would exclusively target people aged 18 to 59. I discussed with my hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham whether we might withdraw the amendment, but questions about the widowed parent's allowance and the bereavement allowance are unresolved. Until last year's changes, there would not have been a problem, because, as the hon. Lady said, it is mostly men who will be subject to the orders. Under the old system, widows' benefits went only to females. Now that they have been extended to both sexes, there is a possibility that the effect on benefits will apply more widely. Widowhood is no respector of age or class, as we know from our own sad experience.
<P>
During the Committee stage of the Welfare Reform and Pensions Bill we saw evidence of how emotionally vulnerable people can be when they are widowed. It therefore seems sensible to take account of that in the Bill. After all, the widowed parent's allowance is available only for people with children. It would make no sense at all to take it away, given what the hon. Lady was saying to the last but one set of amendments.
<P>
The Minister will rise in a few moments--and it will be a few moments, so I hope that he has read his brief.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I have read the hon. Gentleman's amendment.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Pickes:</B> That is good, I am flattered. The Minister will tell us not to worry about this, that it is not required to be in the Bill and that there are various things wrong with the way in which the amendment is drafted. We accept that. That is the way the Opposition are. We do our best with no finance to put such things together. In practice, I dare say that this will not happen, but such safeguards should be written into the Bill. The Minister would please us enormously if he simply allayed our fears and told us how this would not happen. However, if he tells us that we shall be taking away widowed parent's allowance or bereavement allowance under such circumstances, we shall be profoundly unhappy. We are ready to give the Minister an opportunity to put our minds at ease.
 <P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> It is a long time since I made my point of order this morning. What I am about to say is not a criticism of the hon. Gentleman. It is to make it absolutely clear what we do not intend to do and what we would not support.
<P>
The amendment is about the state earnings-related pension scheme, because it refers to
<P>
the additional pension in a widowed parent's allowance or bereavement allowance ... or a Category A retirement pension.
My hon. Friend told the Committee this morning about our intention to pilot from age 18 to 59, and I do not know how anyone could have the additional pension paid under the age of 59, tied into the other allowances. We are talking about someone who may be deceased who built up the benefits during their life.
<P>
The Government have not the slightest intention of moving beyond the benefits that we plan to pilot. The thrust of the amendment is pensions. From my and my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary's point of view, pensions are decidedly different from other social security benefits. One can recognise a pension as opposed to a savings pot or income support; it is different. The amendment refers to section 92(4) of the Pensions Act 1995, which provides for those who have committed treason and offences under the Official Secrets Act and are serving more than 10 years to have their pensions docked, but we are talking here about community service. We are not assuming that anyone found guilty of committing treason will be awarded a community service order.
<P>
<B>Mrs Lait:</B> It would be nice if the Minister were to go on to quote the other offences mentioned in section 92(4); I, too, was tempted to mention treason. It is related to clause 49(3), which deals with prescribed offences.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> Yes. I am reading out part of my brief, but I shall not read another bit that I have crossed out. I make it clear that, for many of the additional pensioners referred to, SERPS is an alternative to an occupational pension from which they did not contract out. Therefore, occupational pensions would not be touched. It would be wrong for SERPS or any pension to be touched for a community service punishment, as pensions are different from the generality of social security benefits. For the purposes of Pepper v. Hart, I cannot make that any clearer. As the Minister responsible, that is my view.
<P>
<B>Mrs Lait:</B> I am grateful to the Minster for making it clear, as we did, that we did not refer to pensions. As my hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar said, there are difficulties in drafting amendments, and I concentrated on the subject of widows and widowers under the age of 59. That is the drift of our concern.
<P>
Although the Minister concentrated on pensions, he made it clear that the Government do not intend at the moment to go beyond the three allowances mentioned in the explanatory notes. I am happy to accept that as it will be recorded in Hansard, and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 324, in page 53, line 23, leave out ``twenty-six'' and insert ``thirty-seven''.
 <P>
In the interests of speeding matters up, we propose a simple probing amendment that would give the Secretary of State 37 weeks rather than 26 in which he might take away benefit. We want to reach an understanding of what will be the norm. The Under-Secretary got rid of most of the debate by telling us that the period would be about four weeks. Why four weeks?
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> Why 37 weeks?
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> Why 26 weeks?
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> It is half a year.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I am shocked at the heckling. If the period will be only one month, why specify six months? We want that reasonable question answered. I do not intend to vote for a change to 37 weeks; I simply want to know why there will be a month, and why 26 weeks has been mentioned.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> We were racking our brains about what 37 weeks could possibly mean, so I am glad that the hon. Gentleman has explained. The amendment would extend the maximum period for which a sanction could be prescribed in regulations from 26 weeks to 37. The design of community sentence sanctions mirrors as closely as possible the design of employment related sanctions under the Jobseekers Act 1995, and ONE sanctions in income support.
<P>
The Jobseekers Act places an upper limit of 26 weeks as the maximum length of an employment related sanction. We think it sensible to adopt that approach, a long standing feature of jobseeker's allowance, in the arrangements for community sentence sanctions.
 <P>
As I said, we intend to test the effectiveness of four-week sanctions in the pilot phase of the scheme. The success of the length of the sanction period will be carefully evaluated. If the results of the evaluation show that a different period would be more effective, we would need the flexibility that the clause allows to alter the length of sanction. The amendment would allow for sanctions of more than 26 weeks to be prescribed in regulations. We do not believe that a period of more than 26 weeks would be appropriate for community sentence sanctions, as it would not be consistent with sanctions in the rest of the benefit system. That is a simple explanation of why 26-weeks is an appropriate limit. I urge the Committee to reject the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I am surprised that the Minister was surprised at the figure we proposed. That is the way it operates in Committee: we table probing amendments, particularly when we are in broad agreement with the Government. The Minister is possibly guilty of adopting a belt and braces approach in seeking 26 weeks. I take it that she does not envisage any significant increase beyond a month. That would probably be about the time that it takes to get people to court; there would be something severely wrong with the system if that could not happen within that time. Why should someone be penalised if the judicial system is not operating properly? Four weeks is a wholly sensible period.
<P>
I suspect that hon. Members are right: when the measure is in force, we will see a significant reduction in the 30 per cent. figure for breaches, which will generally ease the system. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 325, in page 53, line 24, leave out subsection (8).
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> Again, this is a probing amendment. It removes some of the wide discretion given to the Secretary of State and substitutes a period of three years. We have no particular attachment to that period; we merely wish to know why the Secretary of State needs such strong powers.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> Amendments Nos. 325 and 326 would replace subsection (8), which provides a power to make regulations prescribing a maximum period after which a community sentences sanction could not take effect, with a provision that prevents the sanction from taking effect after three years have elapsed since the laying of information.
<P>
It is anticipated that the decision to impose a sanction will be made promptly, following the receipt of the notification from the probation service. However, it is possible to envisage occasional circumstances in which things may go wrong, and administrative delays could lead to some incongruous results. The provision allows us to put such problems right by allowing for the setting of a maximum time limit on the currency of the notification from the probation service. In the unlikely event of, for example, a claim being mislaid between offices, perhaps due to the mobility of the offender, so that it reaches the relevant benefit office only when the community sentence is completed, we would still be obliged to impose the benefit sanction.
<P>
By allowing the measure to be subject to regulations, we will be able to react to any relevant findings that arise from the evaluation of the pilots. Our intention is to set a limit in regulations that is likely to be considerably less than three years. The link between rights and responsibilities would be lost by having such a long period of time. Neither a fixed period of three years, nor the removal of the provision, would allow us the flexibility to respond to information that we may collect during the pilot phase. I therefore urge the committee to reject the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

 <P>
</UL></FONT><B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 301 and 303 to 308.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> The amendments are technical drafting changes to clauses 49 to 53. Clause 53 covers loss of benefit in Scotland, but we have redrafted clauses 49, 50 and 51 to cover the Scottish element, and in due course I shall ask the Committee to oppose clause 53 standing part of the Bill. All the Scottish aspects have been transferred from a separate clause for Scotland to the relevant clauses. We have had a second opportunity to consider our approach, and the amendments make it much clearer how the different aspects relate to Scotland. The Scottish Executive was fully consulted. It was consulted originally, but more detailed consultation has taken place about the clauses since, and the amendments are a much more satisfactory way of dealing with the Scottish aspect. I am happy to deal with any aspects that the Committee would like to explore.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> The right hon. Gentleman said that consultation had taken place with the Scottish Executive. What would happen in the event of a conflict? Would the right hon. Gentleman report to the Committee the Scottish Executive's views? What would happen if we wanted to reject the amendments and have a different provision for Scotland?
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I am happy to satisfy the hon. Gentleman on that point. Because of the nature of this Session, many hon. Members have no experience of considering Bills in a devolved context. Fortunately, or unfortunately, I dealt with the first such Bill, the Food Standards Bill, just as the Scottish Parliament was being set up.
<P>
Two aspects are involved. Social security is a reserved matter for Westminster. It is not a devolved matter. However, criminal justice is devolved. The country contains two criminal justice systems, and it is more satisfactory to pilot a proposal in one of them, in this case, England and Wales. The House makes the rules that govern social security. In due course, the Scottish Administration will deal with the aspect for which they are responsible--the criminal justice system--and they do not need permission from the House to do so. The social security aspect of the Bill is a matter for the House. It is not a question of seeking permission, but we are consulting fully. When we legislate on a reserved matter, arrangements exist for the Government and the Department to discuss matters that affect Scotland, simply because Scotland's law-making powers differ from those of Wales. We are trying to work in partnership with the two devolved authorities.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> That was lucid and straightforward: my knowledge base has increased.
<P>
However, I was getting at something else, although I accept that I did not make it clear. We have often borrowed from the Scottish system, adopting Scottish precedents and vice versa. If the Scots devised a scheme in their criminal justice system analogous to community service orders but not quite the same, how would we make provision for that in social security?
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I know little about the technical differences between the two systems, so I shall give the hon. Gentleman an example that I discovered only when reading material relating to the drafting of the Bill.
<P>
In Scotland, local authorities--not the probation service--are responsible for the supervision of community service orders. I do not know why they do that, as I am not familiar with the history or background. However, the result is a major operational difference in what flows from the Bill.
<P>
I do not think that the hon. Gentleman is suggesting that local authorities in the rest of Britain should follow the Scottish example. However, such an arrangement is satisfactory for Scotland, and is a matter for them to decide. It is no longer our place to tell Scotland whether such decisions are good or bad. Nevertheless, once the Bill is enacted, there will be a difference in the conduct of matters relating to breaches of community service orders.
<P>
<B>Mrs Lait:</B> As a Scot, I understand the differences between the two legal systems and how many of them have evolved. However, not for a moment could I say why, in Scotland, community orders--as community service orders are known there--are supervised by local authorities, not the probation service. It may be that the probation service is part of local government.
<P>
The amendments refer to the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995 and the High Court of Justiciary. The Scots are proud of their legal system, which is based on a totally different philosophy from the English one. The Minister referred to discussions with the Executive. However, the Executive is neither the Parliament nor the judicial system. It may have said that Government plans for social security are correct, but what power or authority does it have to make that pledge on behalf of the Parliament or the judicial system? As the Minister said, the Scottish Parliament will have to introduce its own legislation amending the judicial elements of the provision.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> There is a misunderstanding. There is no argument or negotiation about social security rules, which are laid down in law.
<P>
To make matters easier, we are removing clause 53, which applies exclusively to Scotland, and putting the Scottish elements in three other clauses. I am not qualified to reply to detailed questions about the Scottish legal system. However, the social security system is a matter for the Department of Social Security in Westminster, whose Ministers are accountable to this House. The operation of the provision in Scotland is the responsibility of staff in the Department of Social Security and in the Benefits Agency.
<P>
Procedures for operating community service orders are different. In Scotland, offenders must consent to a community sentence before it is passed. They must be warned of the possibility of benefit loss before sentencing, not on sentencing, as in England and Wales. Those differences will continue. There is no change in the Bill. The Scottish legal system is there by statute, operated by the Scottish Parliament. I do not fully understand the details of the delineation in Scotland, but I suspect that the Executive do not order the judiciary about. The judiciary will operate under devolved Acts of Parliament, or new Acts of the Scottish Parliament, and will act as an independent judiciary under the relevant legislation. I do not know how the Scottish Parliament will operate this, but it will be accountable for what happens to those offenders who breach community service orders. It will not be something in which the House can be involved.
<P>
In effect, because social security is a reserved matter, the House is giving to the Scottish devolved area of the criminal justice system, the enabling powers to operate the sanction on benefit in the Bill. How and whether the Scottish Parliament do it is entirely up to it. It is accountable for that. We are accountable only for the social security side. Ministers in Westminster cannot tread beyond that. These are early days for devolution. I cannot go into further detail. I refrained from going through all my detailed brief on every amendment simply because I was trying to encapsulate that clause 53, which relates to Scotland, comes out and that the bits relating to Scotland are planted in each clause, because that is better administratively. If I am pushed, I can explain what each amendment does. I cannot go any further than what I have already said about the difference between the social security and criminal justice systems.

<P>

<B>Mrs Lait:</B> I should like to come back briefly to this. I fully understand that Westminster has the overall control of everything to do with social security. The Minister understands that the judicial system is peculiarly Scottish. What discussions have taken place with the Executive, which I understand is not the Parliament, about whether the Parliament would be prepared, if necessary, to amend the judicial system to ensure that this social security measure is carried out? How can the Executive guarantee that the Parliament will amend the judicial processes if that is required?
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I am sorry. I have missed the whole point. No amendments are needed to the criminal justice system in Scotland to make the Bill operational. Because this is a reserved matter to Westminster, we are legislating for the United Kingdom. If we had accidentally missed out Scotland, they would not have had the legal authority in Scotland to sanction the benefits. That legal authority can only come from Westminster legislation, so no amendments are required.
<P>
The hon. Lady asks me about matters for which it is still early days. There is a system to deal with any change, even in a reserve matter. We were not taking the approach that because it is a reserved matter, it has nothing to do with the Scottish Parliament. That would not create good Government between London and Edinburgh or London and Cardiff, when that arises, although the Welsh situation is different. We have arrangements to discuss with the Scottish Parliament anything we are legislating for in reserved areas that may impinge on potential changes north of the border, which may be discretionary. Arrangements exist to discuss such matters with the Scotland Office, with the Scottish Executive. Because social security is a matter reserved to Westminster, the elected representatives of people in Scotland cannot go to the Scottish Parliament on matters of social security. They must come to Whitehall, whether they be Members of the Scottish Parliament or Scottish Members of Parliament in the House of Commons. However, that does not mean that we simply say, ``It's nothing to do with you.'' There is a range of machinery for discussion to make sure that we conform and consult about legislation at Westminster. In the case of one or two Bills, with consent in a devolved area, for convenience matters have been dealt with here. Therefore, consent would be required. Consent is not required for social security, but it would be madness not to consult and simply to say, ``This is what we propose to do.''
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
The clauses are being changed to take account of Scotland after more detailed consultations, and consideration of the practical effects. But how people decide to prosecute in the Scottish courts is a matter for the Scottish courts, not the legislation passing through this House. There is a slight difference in how community service orders are issued and that is entirely a matter for the Scottish devolved Parliament. It has nothing to do with any Scottish Member of this House. Gradually the reality of devolution will figure more as we gain more experience.
<P>
I cannot be any clearer or I shall end up in deeper water. If I try to explain the Scottish criminal justice system in any more detail I shall start to make mistakes.

<P>
( ) of such information about the offender, and in the possession of the person giving the notification, as may be prescribed;
<P>
The amendment corrects an omission in the drafting and ensures the Secretary of State's powers to require the issue of a notification from the probation service are wide enough to cover the inclusion of details such as the address, national insurance number and benefit receipt as well as the name of the offender and the fact of the alleged breach. There have been one or two technical and drafting amendments that the Government were not in a position to make before because the Bill was published before Christmas in the hope of for an early Second Reading. It is a tidying-up amendment to make sure that we can have that extra information.
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I have a simple question. The wording of the amendment is:
<P>
in the possession of the person giving the notification.
Does that mean that incomplete information would be acceptable and, if so, how incomplete? In other words, what is the minimum information about the offender that is acceptable in the notification? I may have misread it, but I should like more information.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I could be better advised, but the key is the last four words ``as may be prescribed''. The Secretary of State does not have the power to require the notification for the probation service to be wide enough to cover the material necessary to identify the person. There may be only a name and the alleged breach, without an address, a national insurance number or any other identifier--perhaps a date of birth--that could match the benefit with the person.
<P>
Regulations are needed to allow the probation service to notify the benefits office when it has information that an offender has breached the terms of a sentence. The regulations will ensure that the information is dealt with correctly and professionally. Information will be limited to what is essential to effect the measures--name, address, national insurance numbers, benefit receipts and so forth.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman asked about the wording: it is intended to ensure that the probation service is not required to provide information that it does not possess. It will be covered in the regulations. There is no ulterior motive or intention to gain more information than is required.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I want briefly to put some questions on the clause and the clause stand part debate provides the best opportunity as the amendments to the clause are narrowly drawn.
<P>
The explanatory notes to subsection (4) state:
<P>
In practice, the Benefits Agency will not need, before implementing a sanction, to check with the Court that the information has indeed been laid if they receive a notification to that effect.
Will there be monitoring of whether that occurs--a potential cause for concern? What will happen when notification that the information has been laid takes place but it is subsequently decided that the decision to make a notice was incorrect or invalid, as a result of which it is withdrawn before it arrives at the court? Where does that leave the procedure? Will the Benefits Agency still proceed and the process of withdrawing benefit be triggered? Or, if the probation service notifies the Benefits Agency that the information has been withdrawn, will that be enough of itself not to trigger the sanction?
<P>
My next question is about paragraph 400 on page 98 of the explanatory notes. It says that the information that will be required under subsection (5)
<P>
will not include details of the original offence in respect of which the original Order was made.
However, the notes say:
<P>
Information for evaluation, statistical and research purposes will also be included, which may go wider than that required for implementation purposes.
It would be helpful to know how much wider, and what information might be included. The explanatory notes do not give details, so perhaps the Minister could write to members of the Committee to clarify that.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> First, I must repeat that notifications are wrongly issued for breaches in only about 1 per cent. of cases, which is a tiny number. I cannot imagine circumstances in which a probation officer would inform the Benefits Agency about a breach, but forget to inform or decide not to inform the court. I expect that the probation service would send the two notifications at the same time. However, if the notification of a breach was withdrawn because of a mistake--mistakes can be made, but they are unusual--the Benefits Agency would proceed no further with the sanction, if it had not been applied. If it had been applied, the agency would restore the benefit in full and pay arrears as soon as it received the correction. I hope that that reassures the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
The clause is tightly drawn, as my right hon. Friend said, to require only the minimum information for the Benefits Agency to do its job with respect to sanctioning. That includes identity, address, national insurance number and benefits claimed, but nothing else, to protect the privacy of the individual concerned. For research, however, wider sets of information need to be gathered to allow us to monitor and evaluate the pilot schemes appropriately, as the hon. Gentleman insisted that we should. When gathered, that information will be treated like all such research information. Individuals will not be identified and the researchers will make no connections to names, so the information will be rendered harmless. We are still commissioning the research and evaluation, and I cannot, off the top of my head, give the hon. Gentleman the absolute details about what will be collected. However, I hope that I have reassured him about the privacy issues.
<P>
Qeustion put and agreed to.

Clause 51, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 52<p5>Loss of benefit regulations<p4>Amendment made: No. 308, in page 56, line 44, at end insert--</center></H4>

<P>
({**EN**}) Where regulations made under section 49(9) prescribe a description of order made under the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995 as a relevant community order for the purposes of that section, the regulations may make such modifications of that section as appear to the Secretary of State to be necessary in consequence of so prescribing.--[Mr. Rooker.]

<P>
This is a technical amendment. The subsections that it covers bring regulations under the loss of benefit provisions within the remit of the Social Security Advisory Committee. Powers to ensure that the committee continues to have oversight of these measures will be contained in the new clause tabled yesterday, which will bring together all the provisions in the Bill where we need to specify a requirement to refer regulations to the committee. It is therefore necessary to remove these provisions from this part of the Bill.

<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Pickles:</B> We need to spend a little time on this and on another group of amendments. They are clearly important, as they are part of the Government's attempts to introduce taxation through the back door. The Government have become famous for their taxation by stealth. Conservative Members regard the amendment as part of that.
<P>
Hon. Members will see within the group of amendments a series of proposals which seek to extend taxation through national insurance. Is that sensible? We have highlighted a number of issues, which we have laid out carefully in amendment No. 331. We are dealing with practical circumstances, which all members of the Committee will have experience as employers or employees. They stretch from the pleasantries of the Christmas party--
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker rose--</B><P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I cannot believe it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I want to get the debate off on the right foot. Does the hon. Gentleman seek to defend £75 a head, as an employer's contribution to a Christmas party, which is taxable? Above £75 a head it is untaxable. National insurance would apply only if the employer spends more than £75 a head. I should hate the hon. Gentleman to wax lyrical about this imposition, not appreciating that employers have to contribute £75 of food and drink per head before the national insurance provision is triggered.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I am surprised that the right hon. Gentleman did not complete his peroration with the expression ``bah humbug''. The pantomine season has come late to the Committee. The right hon. Gentleman is getting himself ready for his credentials. He is leaving Parliament at the next general election, sadly. I did not realise that he was preparing himself to be the Ebenezer of Birmingham. The measures have stretched from Christmas parties to rape alarms. The whole coverage needs to be considered.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> No.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> If the right hon. Gentleman wants to intervene again he may do so. I simply want to go through the problems. I will happily return to the subject of the Christmas party, though I may want to do that when we are discussing a set of amendments that deals with grossing up.
<P>
First, there is a problem relating to private medical insurance. This afternoon I attended Health questions. The Secretary of State was considerably agitated over private medical insurance. With the health service virtually on its knees, we shall be looking for funding for additional cover. Many companies now provide private medical health insurance for staff. That is a taxable benefit, so from April national insurance will apply. So far as I understand it, the Inland Revenue does not tax medical checks for staff, but it does tax specific medical treatment. What problems will that cause? An obvious one that was on our minds at the beginning of the winter is the flu jab. Many employers make flu jabs compulsory or, at least, force them upon staff, and the consequence of getting flu for someone who has not had the jab might not be pleasant.
<P>
<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> Is my hon. Friend aware that in a Department of Health advertising campaign, health authorities were encouraged to persuade their employees to have a flu jab? It was difficult enough in the circumstances of the last 12 months to achieve that. They might be further discouraged in the future by the additional national insurance costs consequent upon any such policy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> My hon. Friend makes a good point. We have received advice from a leading accountancy firm to suggest that it might well be taxable. It is silly to try to squeeze a bit extra out of individuals. It will not be up to the right hon. Gentleman to make the decisions. The Greek chorus is saying ``You've got nothing to worry about.'' but that will be down to the Inland Revenue itself.
<P>
<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> A flu jab will not be taxable if the Inland Revenue is persuaded that it constitutes a check up, but I suspect that it will be regarded as a treatment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> My hon. Friend is right. It would be stretching the definition of a check up to suggest that it covered a flu jab. If immunisation from influenza is not a treatment, what is? The Government have already gone some way to taxing premiums for private medical cover, and that affects people on relatively modest incomes.
<P>
The Government must decide where they stand--they are schizophrenic. I listened to a Minister today praise private medical insurance, but I have listened to others complain bitterly about people who have taken out such insurance. We have had several hours of general consensus, but we do not support the government on this matter. They should be defeated for the good social reasons outlined in amendment No. 331.
<P>
Let us consider the proposal's impact on a model employer. We have seen such employers through history; I think back to my times in Bradford and to Titus Salt, the great entrepreneur who developed a model village just outside Shipley. One might also think of Bournville. An entrepreneur might want to create facilities for his work force.
<P>
Sporting facilities will be covered by the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> My hon. Friend is not fully aware of the implications of the provision. A public-spirited entrepreneur will incur the additional national insurance tax only if he is sufficiently public spirited to make the sporting facilities available to the general public. His public spiritedness would be punished.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> My hon. Friend anticipates the climax of my remarks, but the point is worth repeating. People such as Titus Salt wanted to bring benefits not just to the work force. I know that you, Mr. O'Brien, are better aware than I am that there are parts of the world in which large employers almost run the town; without them, it would cease to function. They want to give something back to the community.
<P>
The Government talk about stakeholders and our place in society. We have just spent the best part of four hours discussing people on benefit and putting something back. If an employer decides to put something back into the local economy and offers sporting facilities, for example--perhaps for adolescents and children--the facilities will be taxed. There is much talk of joined-up government.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> Of course I shall; I am pleased to hear from the right honourable Gentleman.

<P>

<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I want to answer during our next sitting points made by the hon. Gentleman and others, but so that we have it clear in our minds I should ask whether he is talking of facilities wholly owned by the company and meant for its staff, but into which the public are allowed? Is he referring to a situation in which an employer has contracted with, say, a private golf club and bought membership for his staff? I want to know so that we will not be at cross purposes; there might be a difference between the two.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I have not yet referred to the latter example. If an employer wanted to encourage health and fitness among employees by providing subsidised membership of a local gym, national insurance at 12.2 per cent. would be payable. Similarly, if an employer owns a sports field that is used by staff and he decides to be community spirited and allow public access to the facilities, national insurance would be payable on the full cost of the facilities to the staff. We must deal with that problem.
<P>
<H5>6.45 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
We have all had experience of that because, by its nature, politics requires people to work anti-social hours, and we do not live normal lives by any stretch of the imagination. We happen to be located in Westminster, which is a fairly nice part of the world, although there was some suggestion this morning that the disparity between those who have a lot and those who have virtually nothing is most noticeable in the Westminster area. If we decided to provide personal alarms to our members of staff, whom we sometimes keep late, to offer them additional protection--I am sure that we have all seen them; they make an incredible noise, which is supposed to deter the attacker and summon help--we would be taxed through national insurance contributions. Some Members of Parliament are expected to take on difficult positions in Government, such as Prime Minister or Northern Ireland Secretary, and certain arrangements are made for our personal safety, such as extra protection on windows and doors, but that would not be taxable. The Bill would create two kinds of Britain; one thing for Members of Parliament and something different for our staff. That is not right.
<P>
We have talked about living in a dodgy area, but just suppose the hon. Member for Doncaster, North (Mr. Hughes) had a brainstorm and decided to take the Committee through the night--as he is perfectly capable of doing, because we are perfectly capable of talking through the night if necessary.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robertson:</B> Some more than others.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> We shall rely on my hon. Friend during the next few days.
<P>
If we sat late and decided that it was sensible to send our hard-working staff home in a taxi at 2 am when we thought that we had done enough, we might have to pay national insurance contributions. Before the right hon. Gentleman jumps up, there is a difference, because we would have to apply a reasonableness test and define what is and is not late. What is late to us might not be late to normal people. To some people, the early hours of the morning is not late, so let us think about a normal workplace, where someone is sent home by taxi. That employee might live in a dodgy area and might have to travel on the tube. Sometimes, tube travel is not easy, especially for females who travel late-ish in the evening, after the rush hour, when carriages tend to be deserted. As a caring employer, I might think it sensible to pay for taxis to ensure that my employees get home safely and, more important, that they come to work the following day refreshed and happy. Also, if I ask whether they mind working a little late, they will not need to say, ``Oh, heck, if I do that I shall have a difficult journey home.'' I might not otherwise pass the right hon. Gentleman's test of reasonableness. We should not have to rely on arbitrary decisions about what is reasonable. We are supposed to be encouraging good employers. It is part of the stakeholder economy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robertson:</B> My hon. Friend makes a good case, but is it not even more complicated than that? Do not companies already provide some of those facilities for their employees, and could it not be considered a normal business expense?
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> That is right. We should not be encouraging employers to regress, or to go through an Ebenezer Scrooge phase. We do not want them to say, ``And mind that you are back earlier in the morning if I give you Christmas day off or put a little extra coal in the scuttle.'' We want to encourage employers to behave better and to treat their employees like an extended family.
<P>
<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> My hon. Friend has drawn the attention of the Committee to what might be called a travel perk. The reasonableness test is entirely inadequate, because it traditionally deals with the length of the journey; and ``late'' is inadequate because late is considered to be after 9 pm. The consideration that my hon. Friend has drawn to the Committee's attention is primarily one of safety--for example, the safety of those who have a long walk at the end of a tube journey. Those considerations do not come within the ambit of the Inland Revenue's definitions of ``reasonableness'' and ``late''. Under the scenario that my hon. Friend proposes, such benefits would be taxed.
 <P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> My hon. Friend is absolutely right. I was about to make a similar point.
<P>
Amendment No. 331 deals also with catering provisions. No income tax will be charged to those staff who have subsidised meals at work, but if not all staff receive such a benefit, the rules are more complex--my hon. Friend the Member for New Forest, West will doubtless explain why. In general, it is necessary to provide meals in canteens to escape the tax. However, let us suppose that it is a necessary part of someone's contract to stay close to his desk--he might be a purveyor of the new stakeholder pensions and have to stay close to the computer screen to deal with incoming telephone calls. If his employer supplied him with sandwiches and a fizzy drink--and even some fruit, as advocated by my hon. Friend the Member for New Forest, West--he would find himself having to pay a higher national insurance contribution.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robertson:</B> I do not mean to be pedantic, but how far should we go? For example, it would cost Members of Parliament way more than £75 a year to pay for their secretary's lunch a couple of times a week. Would that be covered by the Bill?
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I do not know whether it is possible, but can that suggestion be struck from the official record? It might set a precedent, for which none of us would thank my hon. Friend.
<P>
I also want to mention nursery facilities. According to the newspapers, there is a demand to increase those facilities in the Palace of Westminster. There would be no problem with national insurance contributions if we provided nursery facilities that had no educational facilities. Children could be dumped at nine o'clock, but there would be nothing in the nursery to entertain, educate or stretch them. We could sit them down, turn on the television and collect them when we fancied. That would be fine. But if we believe that the early years are an important time and that children need to be stretched, it is crucial that they enjoy educational opportunities and develop their young lives to full potential.
<P>
Children need to know that life is not just about watching the box, whether the programme is on the proceedings of Westminster Hall or the Chamber--what a terrible way to blight young people's lives--or cartoons from the American cartoon network. There is no question of national insurance contributions coming into play when we do not provide educational facilities, but if we provided educational toys from the best suppliers, we would be in all kinds of trouble with national insurance contributions. One side of the Government is trying to stretch young people while the other is trying to impose a cost. That is not satisfactory.
<P>
Whether we are trying to provide a fitter nation, security for our staff, a perk during the Christmas season--no doubt we will return to the Christmas do--or sandwiches to staff--
<P>
<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> My hon. Friend missed the principal anomaly with respect to sandwiches. He painted a picture of the trader at his desk, maximising the future income for recipients of the stakeholder pension. If the nature of his employment requires him to stay at his desk and he receives a free sandwich, which is not available to all members of the organisation, the tax would be payable, but it would not be payable if free sandwiches were provided for all.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> My hon. Friend could well be right.
