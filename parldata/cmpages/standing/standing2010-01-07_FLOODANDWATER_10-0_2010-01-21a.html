<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012154000288"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural
Affairs (Huw Irranca-Davies):</b> I welcome you to the Chair,
Lady Winterton. I look forward to serving under your stewardship on
this final and very important sitting of this well supported
Bill.</div><a name="10012154000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
was making my concluding remarks, and I simply wanted to say that the
Bill itself provides 100 per cent. clarity on the arrangements for
approval and adoption of sustainable drainage systems in new
developments&#151;ones that have not yet been built. Unitary and
county local authorities will be SuDS approving bodies, and they will
be responsible for both functions. Those with responsibility for
adopting and maintaining SuDS should also lead on approving their
design and construction. That will mean that robust, well designed SuDS
that can be efficiently and effectively maintained are built.</div>
<a name="10012154000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">The SAB,
which is also responsible for surface water and is lead local flood
authority, will consider the wider impacts of the development. County
and unitary authorities will be responsible for approving drainage
systems in  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column364" />Column number: 364</div>new developments. Where planning permission is required, the developer
can apply via the planning authority to streamline the process, but the
decision on drainage lies with the SAB and it will be guided by the
national standards, which will set out connection to the sewer as a
last resort.</div>
<a name="10012154000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">Water and
sewerage companies, as well as the Environment Agency, are statutory
consultees to the approving process. Let me be clear: the process holds
significant weight. The SAB is liable for approving any SuDS
application. As a result, it will be subject to judicial review
proceedings should it fail to discharge its duties. It is clearly
strongly in the interests of the approving body to consult effectively
and listen to the advice of the water company regarding sewer capacity.
However, it must equally be emphasised that water and sewerage
companies are under a general duty to provide, maintain and extend the
public sewerage system in their areas.</div>
<a name="10012154000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">County and
unitary authorities are also responsible for adopting and maintaining
new SuDS that serve more than one property. Where those SuDS are in
roads, the Highways Authority will maintain them. SuDS are also located
at county and unitary level. Developers welcome that as it sets out
clear arrangements for maintenance and provides an incentive for SuDS
to be built, which is what we all want to
see.</div><a name="10012154000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
me quickly pick up on the question asked by my hon. Friend the Member
for Selby. In Scotland, the water company is state-owned, but here they
are private. In Scotland the arrangements are more fragmented, with
local authorities adopting SuDS in roads, and Scottish Water adopting
other SuDS and so on. This measure is much
clearer.</div><a name="10012154000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">Returning
to the Bill, arrangements have also been made to protect private SuDS
by way of designation under schedule 1, and enforcement arrangements
are provided for in schedule 3. Under the Bill, the SAB can also adopt
existing SuDS voluntarily. Such arrangements for approval and adoption
are very clear; they cover all types of new SuDS and are all already
set out in the
Bill.</div><a name="10012154000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
me add some further clarity on adoption functions in order to address
the view of some&#151;but not all&#151;water companies that they
should adopt and maintain SuDS, and to address concerns about who is
accountable. If flooding occurs because a SuDS that the local authority
has adopted has not been maintained properly, the local authority will
be responsible. It will have failed in its duty, and&#151;I hope this
does not happen&#151;it could be sued if damages are caused through
negligence. There is nothing in the Bill to prevent unitary and county
local authorities, in their role as SABs, from transferring their
adoption functions to water and sewerage companies by agreement should
they choose to do so, and that may happen. The SAB would retain
responsibility and liability for the SuDS, and that is right. However,
arrangements for funding in that respect would need to be
agreed.</div><a name="10012154000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Bill also makes provision for the Minister to appoint, by order, a body
other than the unitary or county council to be the SAB under
sub-paragraphs (3) to (5) of paragraph 6 of schedule 3. We have spoken
to the water industry and both it and we are content that the spirit of
what it wants can be delivered via the guidance on the process of
seeking and maintaining approval, which is the subject of Government 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column365" />Column number: 365</div>amendment 159, accepted this morning. The same applies to the
following group of amendments. We are content that the spirit of what
is wanted can be delivered via the guidance. We will speak to the
industry between now and consideration on Report, so that if there are
any residual issues, amendments can be tabled on Report. The water
industry will be involved in the development of the guidance. As
statutory consultees to the SuDS approval process set out in the Bill,
the SAB must take notice of the advice of water companies. I will
clarify in guidance exactly what that means.</div>
<a name="10012154000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">With those
reassurances and clarifications, I hope that the hon. Member for Vale
of York will consider withdrawing the
amendment.</div><a name="10012154000029"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10012154000289"></a><b class="B">Miss
Anne McIntosh</b> (Vale of York) (Con): I warmly welcome you
to the Chair, Lady Winterton. It is a great pleasure to serve under
your chairmanship. As the Minister said, this is the last lap of the
Committee stage, so it is a particularly important
sitting.</div><a name="10012154000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">Unfortunately,
the Minister has not satisfied us on many aspects. Immediately before
lunch, he referred to his letter of 19 January relating to SuDS and the
automatic right to connect. In particular, we have concerns over new
developments. On the second page, the letter states that it is already
open to planning authorities to impose a planning condition deferring
development or, ultimately, to refuse consent for a new
development.</div><a name="10012154000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">Water
and sewerage companies should be recognised as statutory consultees on
the same basis as the Environment Agency. They should be able to set
conditions to avoid the outfall from SuDS into the sewerage system
causing spillage, as was described by the hon. Member for City of
Durham and other hon. Members. I want the companies to be able to say
that the capacity required for a new development requires changes to
the infrastructure, and for those changes to take place as part of the
planning conditions. Everybody I have spoken to informs me that under
the current provisions, what the Minister is assuring us will happen
will not
happen.</div><a name="10012154000032"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012154000290"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> I want simply to reiterate my commitment
that, subject to discussions with the water industry next Tuesday, I
will come back and give time should the hon. Lady or other hon. Members
think amendments are needed subsequently. The water industry should be
able to indicate whether it is reassured or
not.</div><a name="10012154000033"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012154000291"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> I am most grateful. As we learned this morning,
the problem is that the Government&#146;s track record on issuing
guidance is woeful. We are still waiting for the guidance to be issued
on the adoption of private drains and sewers. We are told that that is
on target to be brought in by
2011.</div><a name="10012154000034"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10012154000292"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Laurence Robertson</b> (Tewkesbury) (Con): On a point of
order, Lady Winterton. Can we confirm whether it would be in order to
table on Report amendments similar to those we are
discussing?</div><a name="10012154000035"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012154000293"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I reassure the hon. Gentleman that that would be
entirely in order. Of course, I cannot give an undertaking about the
selection of such
amendments.</div><a name="10012154000036"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012154000294"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> I am most grateful.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column366" />Column number: 366</div><a name="10012154000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister&#146;s letter and remarks show that we are still in a bit of
a muddle on this matter, and we seek clarification in the Bill. We do
not want water and sewerage companies just to be consulted on guidance,
but for the guidance to stipulate that they will set conditions. Can
the Minister give us a commitment in Committee that water and sewerage
companies will be in a position to set conditions, so that they can
advise the planning body&#151;the SAB? That goes to the heart of the
Bill. I believe that the developer and the owners of the new houses on
a major new development should pay. Any costs that arise from works to
the infrastructure owned by the water and sewerage
companies&#151;because of the potential for surface water relating to
the major new development to come into the sewerage
system&#151;should under no circumstances fall to existing customers.
Is the Minister prepared to put that commitment on record? He shakes
his head, so I am afraid that he does not satisfy us.</div>
<a name="10012154000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">Furthermore,
the Minister just said that the arrangements for funding the SuDS
approval body have yet to be agreed. He has gained a great deal of
celebrity and popularity during the Committee&#146;s proceedings, and
I hope that he is not now playing us for fools. Why should we let this
part of the Bill go without an assurance about what the funding will be
and who will provide it? He knows that the so-called SuDS approving
bodies, namely local authorities, have made representations at every
opportunity, saying that they do not have the necessary
funds.</div>
<a name="10012154000039"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012154000295"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> I say only that I have made my commitment
clear and outlined what we intend to do about the whole range of
funding burdens. Will the hon. Lady make it clear that, if she were in
my post after a general election, she would honour those commitments?
With those assurances, local authorities, water companies and others
would have to have faith in Ministers to fulfil the
commitments.</div><a name="10012154000040"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012154000296"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> To which commitment is the Minister specifically
referring?</div>
<a name="10012154000041"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012154000297"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> We have committed to considering the whole
range of burdens&#151;SuDS, sewers, skills, training, capacity and so
on&#151;and to sitting down formally with the Local Government
Association and others to decide the way
forward.</div><a name="10012154000042"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012154000298"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> My hon. Friends will hear me make this
commitment: my understanding is that we are totally committed to doing
that. We forced the Minister to this point by saying that if he were
not prepared to introduce the Bill, we would introduce it as an
emergency measure if our positions changed. We are seeking his
assurance now so that water company customers know that they will not
pay, that there will not be an extra charge on the local council tax
and that the new developers will pick up the bill.</div>
<a name="10012154000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another point
of difference is that we believe that the SuDS approval body is not
best placed to maintain SuDS once they have been
approved.</div>
<a name="10012154000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not wish
to detain the Committee further. I simply wish to press the amendment
to a vote.</div>
<a name="10012154000045"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question
put, </i>That the amendment be made.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012154000317"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> This group follows on from the previous one so
we do not need to debate it in quite such depth. It is entirely
complementary to the previous
group.</div><a name="10012154000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
the Bill is drafted, the SuDS-approving body, which the Minister
explained will be a county council or unitary authority, has the right
to allow the connection of a SuDS to the public sewerage system after
consulting the sewerage undertaker. This matter is about the rights of
a third party. Could the Minister take this opportunity to explain what
is meant by consultation? Does the SuDS-approving body have a duty just
to consult, or will it be bound to take notice of the water or sewerage
undertaker&#146;s opinion? Will the Minister define consultation?
What will be the nature of the consultation, what response will there
be to it and will any legal obligations flow from
it?</div><a name="10012154000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
purpose of this group of amendments is to ensure that a SuDS cannot be
connected to the public sewerage system without an application being
made to the sewerage undertaker. That goes to the heart of our
discussions about ensuring that we meet the Pitt recommendation that
there ought be an end to the automatic right to connect, and that it
cannot just be assumed that the infrastructure will take the weight of
the water coming into the sewerage system. To put this in a positive
way, we want a specific connection, with a specific application being
made to the sewerage
undertaker.</div><a name="10012154000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under
the amendments, the sewerage undertaker would, within 21 days, refuse
or grant permission for the connection, subject to conditions. That is
crucial. There would be a right of appeal, as prescribed by Ministers.
The Minister will be delighted that we have recognised his role. He has
expressed disappointment on previous occasions that we have
not.</div><a name="10012154000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
making its decision, the sewerage undertaker would have to take account
of whether a proposed connection could cause sewer overload, which in
turn could cause the flooding of property or pollution downstream. That
point relates to many discussions we have had, not just on the previous
group of amendments. Often, people who have just moved in to recent
developments face flooding or suffer pollution because of sewage coming
from major new developments built nearby.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column369" />Column number: 369</div><a name="10012154000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">Unamended, the
Bill will give the SuDS-approving body the authority to approve a
connection, but no accountability for the consequences of that
decision. If the connection causes flooding and pollution, the sewerage
undertaker and its customers will have to meet the cost of repairing
the sewer. It should fall to the occupants of the major new
development, whether it is business property or housing, to pay the
charge for the increased capacity that is needed for the development.
With major new developments, we are not talking about one or two odd
houses, but 20, 50 or 200
houses.</div><a name="10012154000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
think the Minister might respond by arguing that the public sewerage
system will be protected by the planning system and the prescribed
national standards for SuDS, which are required to be administered by
local authorities&#151;I am beginning to read his mind. However,
recent Committee discussions and past experience indicate that sewerage
undertakers and water companies, and their customers, cannot always
rely on local authorities to protect their
interests.</div><a name="10012154000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
grant that these are substantial amendments, which insist on a change
to the existing section 106 agreements&#151;my hon. Friend the Member
for Upminster alerted us to the fact we have to make that change this
morning. The purpose of amendments 152 and 153 is to ensure that the
consultation will take place. Approval needs to be sought, consents
need to be given and, where appropriate, conditions will be made. I
have no hesitation whatsoever in recommending this small
group of significant amendments to the Committee
for
approval.</div><a name="10012154000076"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012154000318"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> I am pleased to respond. I think we are
trying to do the same thing, but a substantive point of difference
seems to be emerging in the way we should do
it.</div><a name="10012154000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments would enable the sewerage undertaker to refuse drainage from
some developments and highways. That could place barriers in the way of
development, including housing, because it would give water
companies&#151;although I have acknowledged that they have a privotal
role to play in this, they are nevertheless private companies with a
commercial interest&#151;a disproportionately powerful role in the
planning and development process. Furthermore, it would allow them to
reject applications for connection on the basis of sewer capacity,
rather than continuing with investment in infrastructure, which is part
of the normal dialogue with the regulator. The amendment would enable
those companies to protect their own financial managings&#151;I am
not saying that they would&#151;rather than provide a public drainage
service fit for households and businesses. That is made explicit by the
conditions, which are included in the amendment, whereby the water and
sewerage company could reject the
application.</div><a name="10012154000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
recognise that the amendment provides for an appeals mechanism, but the
point remains that it could lead to delays in the planning system, and
to further burdens for developers and public bodies. As stated during
last week&#146;s discussions on clause 11, under paragraph 15 to
schedule 3, connections to the sewers are conditional on the drainage
system&#146;s being approved&#151;the hon. Lady was reading my
mind&#151;by the SuDS-approving body as meeting the national
standards for SuDS. I have circulated some details to hon. Members
about how that process would work.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column370" />Column number: 370</div><a name="10012154000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">A developer
would therefore be required to look for alternatives to connection or
reduce the flow of the volume of surface water to the sewer. That is
directly in keeping with Sir Michael Pitt&#146;s review
recommendations. However, amendments 152, 153 and 154 could mean that
even if the drainage were constructed according to the approved plan
and national standards, the water and sewerage company would be able to
reject a connection to the sewer. After going through the hierarchy,
the process and satisfying the conditions, it could then say,
&#147;Ah, but we&#146;re not happy with it.
Sorry.&#148;</div><a name="10012154000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Bill places the role of the SuDS-approving body not with water and
sewerage companies, but with county and unitary local authorities.
Local authorities are more responsive to local feedback and are
democratically accountable for their decisions. Responsibility for SuDS
fits well with the local authority&#146;s wider role, about which I
have spoken before.</div>
<a name="10012154000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand
the need to take account of the impact of new developments on sewerage
capacity&#151;indeed, that is exactly why we have set out the
proposals for sustainable drainage in the Bill. However, we must
consider how we deliver the measure in practical terms. The Home
Builders Federation set out its concerns about the amendments on the
right to connect to the sewer and the role of commercial water and
sewerage companies directly in the planning and decision-making
processes. It has urged me to consider the impact on the house building
sector, both in terms of the cost to developers and the supply of
housing, which is a concern for all of us. That is exactly what we have
done in the balance of the
Bill.</div>
<a name="10012154000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">In deciding
on a permit, the proposed amendment would allow the undertaker to
consider whether a connection would contribute to the problem of
overloading the public sewers. However, the current system already
provides for improvements to be made to the public sewer network to
deal with capacity issues. Under section 94 of the Water Industry Act
1991, water and sewerage companies are required to &#147;provide,
improve and extend&#148; the system of public sewers. Moreover, when
a planning authority recognises a need for the public sewer system to
be extended before a development can go ahead, the planning authority
can seek to impose a condition on planning consent to defer the
development or to seek a planning obligation from the developer. Such
an obligation would require the developer to provide a contribution to
the financing of the sewer network extension, so that the network
covered the new development. Again, that provides for additional
capacity.</div><a name="10012154000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
the Bill provides for water and sewerage companies to be statutory
consultees to the SuDS-approving body where a connection to the sewer
is proposed. Water and sewerage companies are well placed to feed in
their local knowledge and expertise about the capacity within their
sewers. They can also feed into plans for future provision, and the
issue of hot spots. The role of a statutory consultee will give them
the opportunity to consider the drainage applications and the impact on
the sewerage network.</div>
<a name="10012154000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was asked
why the approving body would not simply ignore the advice. Paragraph
11(3)(a) requires that the approving body must&#151;not
may&#151;consult</div>
<a name="10012154000254"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;any sewerage
undertaker with whose public sewer the drainage system is proposed to
communicate&#148;.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column371" />Column number: 371</div><a name="10012154000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">If it fails to consult,
it would be in breach of the provisions. In terms of how the
consultation will work, it is well established that the consultation
must be carried out properly to satisfy the common law principles of
procedural fairness, so consultation must be taken while the
authority&#146;s decision about whether to approve is at the
formative stage&#151;not at the end. The authority must ensure that
the undertaker has been given sufficient information and adequate time
to respond. The authority must conscientiously take the responses into
account and if the authority goes against the undertaker&#146;s
advice, it will be expected to provide reasons and transparency.
Ultimately, if the authority makes a decision without consulting
properly, the undertaker is very likely to have it overturned on
judicial review, because the authority has not carried out its
duties.</div>
<a name="10012154000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">With
that clarification of what is in the Bill and why this is
necessary&#151;<i class="I">[Interruption.]</i> I suspect that we may have a
point of substance, so I will give way.</div>
<a name="10012154000087"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10012154000319"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Andrew Turner</b> (Isle of Wight) (Con): I wonder whether the
Minister would go over the point once again, because I am slightly
confused. Is he saying that if someone brings forward an application
and it is felt locally that there is a need for extensions to the
sewers and so on, the matter would be determined by the planning
committee? Is it possible for the planning committee to go ahead and
give its permission without requiring those sewers to be input even
though they are
necessary?</div><a name="10012154000088"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012154000320"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> Let me read into the record once again for
complete accuracy. If a democratically elected planning authority
recognises the need for a public sewer to be extended, and it has
concerns about it, before development can go ahead, the planning
authority can seek to impose a condition on planning consent either to
defer the development or even to seek a planning obligation on the
developer that would say to them, &#147;You will have to contribute
to the costs of extending the sewerage network.&#148;</div>
<a name="10012154000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">After those
clarifications, I will reiterate an offer that I made this morning. On
clauses to which amendments have not been tabled, I would be more than
happy to write to hon. Members about any concerns that they may have on
stand part debates. That would help us to get through today&#146;s

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012154000340"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> I will try to speak to this batch of
amendments as clearly and concisely as I can, so as not to detain the
Committee. They are all sensible amendments. They relate to paragraphs
18 and 22 and aim to protect sustainable drainage systems within roads.
Amendments 71 and 74 require the designation of roads with SuDS
as</div>
<a name="10012154000255"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;streets with
special engineering
difficulties&#148;</div><a name="10012154000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">under
section 63 of the New Roads and Street Works Act 1991. The result is
that whoever is responsible for maintaining SuDS that are part of a
road will be able to ensure that the drainage system is protected from
damage arising from statutory work on the road, such as when utilities
lay or repair cables in the road, and that any damage is
repaired.</div><a name="10012154000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
71 requires that when the highways authority is the maintaining
authority it must designate the street. Similarly, amendment 74
requires that the SuDS-approving body designates the street when it is
responsible for maintaining the SuDS in that road. In most situations,
works on a road do not present a problem because the local authority
can protect the SuDS from damage through enforcement of property
rights. However, statutory undertakers, such as utility companies, have
the statutory right to place and maintain  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column373" />Column number: 373</div>their apparatus in the highway, and that could put the SuDS at risk and
result in their not functioning as designed. Designation of a road
as</div><a name="10012154000256"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;streets
with special engineering
difficulties&#148;</div><a name="10012154000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">means
the road cannot be broken up or interfered with until a plan of the
works has been approved by the relevant
authority.</div><a name="10012154000252"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent">Amendment
78 seeks to ensure that the requirements are signposted in the New
Roads and Street Works Act 1991 by making an amendment to
that Act. Amendments 69, 70 and 73 are what are referred to in
draftsmanship terms as &#147;stylistic points.&#148; They are
simply designed to reformat paragraphs 18 and 22(6) to reflect the new
subparagraphs 18(3B) and 22(6)(i) proposed by amendments 71 and 74.
They do not affect the purpose or effect of the
Bill.</div><a name="10012154000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
72 would insert at the end of paragraph 18(4),</div>
<a name="10012154000257"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;and a reference
to a road includes a reference to part of a
road.&#148;</div><a name="10012154000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment seeks to avoid a situation in which a SuDS is not adopted and
maintained by a highways authority because it does not affect the road
in its entirety&#151;for example, where SuDS are on, in or under part
of the road only. The amendment would provide clarity in that
regard.</div><a name="10012154000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">Government
amendment 161 sets out a regulation-making power on the process and
requirements for statutory undertakers to work with the SAB when
carrying out the works on public land that affect, or might affect,
SuDS. As with the previous amendments regarding SuDS and roads, the
amendment extends the same protection for SuDS located in other public
land from damage by a statutory
undertaker.</div><a name="10012154000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">SuDS
on public land owned by a designating authority do not have the same
protection, so damage to them could seriously hamper their ability to
prevent surface water flooding of households and businesses. It could
also lead to increased costs for the SAB, which would still be under
its statutory duties to maintain the drainage system, but would find
that inadvertently it has been damaged and is not functioning
effectively through no fault of its own. The amendment would allow
regulations to be made to require a statutory undertaker to notify the
SAB that it is undertaking works and to either return the drainage
system to its original state or build an alternative facility that
would provide equivalent satisfactory drainage in accordance with
national standards and with the agreement of the
SAB.</div><a name="10012154000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
proposed regulations may also provide powers for the approving body to
undertake work and recover its costs from the utility company, should
the utility or other undertaker fail to restore the SuDS or if it has
built a different drainage system that is not up to the standards or
has not been
approved.</div><a name="10012154000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that amendment 69 is helpful. I look forward to moving subsequent
amendments.</div><a name="10012154000124"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment

Irranca-Davies:</b> Amendment 75 is another signposting
amendment, signposting the effect of schedule 3, paragraph
25(2) in section 59(1)(c) of the Building Act 1984.
Paragraph 25(2) provides for local authorities to act when
non-maintenance or damage to a SuDS asset on one property is causing
problems that are prejudicial to health or are a nuisance for those who
own or occupy another property. The amendment would not change the
purpose or effect of the provision in the Bill, but would signpost its
effect under section 59(1)(c) of the 1984 Act. The amendment would
harmonise both pieces of legislation and ensure that paragraph 25(2)
operated effectively and fairly in
practice.</div><a name="10012154000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">Government
amendments 76 and 77 are technical rather than stylistic amendments to
the provision in paragraph 25(3), which in turn amends the 1984 Act.
Under section 84(1) of that Act, local authorities can issue a notice
requiring remedial work to a passageway or a courtyard that is not
satisfactorily drained. The current drafting of that Act could
unintentionally capture some sustainable drainage systems, where, for
example, permeable paving is designed and used specifically to allow
rainwater to drain to the ground rather than into a conventional piped
drainage system. Our original amendment sought to close that loophole.
However, in doing so we have created a technical issue in respect of
section 84(1) of the 1984 Act, as it applies to buildings and their
surroundings with conventional drainage. The amendment would rectify
that by making two technical changes to the last line of paragraph
25(3), which ensure that where SuDS are built into a property or its
surroundings the 1984 Act provision could not be used to require a
drain to be put in its place in passageways, courts and yards, but can
still apply as originally intended where traditional drainage is in
place.</div><a name="10012154000134"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012154000346"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> I am most grateful for the opportunity to set
out our concerns, which are dealt with in amendment 34,
regarding the provisions in schedule 4 on the safety of reservoirs and
dams. I am sure that the Minister was in his place during Prime
Minister&#146;s questions yesterday afternoon and that he will have
heard&#151;or 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column376" />Column number: 376</div>read, or his Department will have informed him about&#151;the question
asked by my hon. Friend the Member for Lichfield. A reservoir is
leaking in his constituency, which raises the issues of maintenance and
who pays if there is a specific
leak.</div><a name="10012154000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Select Committee mentioned in its report that smaller reservoirs should
be examined to see whether they can be excluded from the system of
inspections and procedures in an effort to reduce the costs. The
regulations that deal with that cover those points. The National
Farmers Union is, among others, particularly concerned about the
potential impact of the proposals on small farm reservoirs. I am not
suggesting that the NFU is asking to be exempt but, taking at face
value what the Environment Agency is saying, we understand that the
reason for the reservoir safety provisions is to reduce the threat to
life and limb. I argue that the smaller&#151;10,000 cubic metres or
under&#151;reservoirs do not pose a threat to life and
limb.</div><a name="10012154000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">Looking
at the regulatory impact assessment, my understanding is that the costs
associated with the provisions are, in fact, high, so the regulatory
burden on those responsible for the smaller reservoirs would be great.
The NFU has raised its concerns about the potential impact of the
proposals in the Bill on small farm reservoirs, particularly regarding
the increased bureaucracy associated with the Bill, which will lead to
an increase in the registration and risk assessment work of farmers. I
am sure that, as a matter of course, farmers would wish to investigate
and would not want to have dams or reservoirs that were inherently
unsafe. However, we believe that the provisions go too far and we want
them to be
reduced.</div><a name="10012154000253"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent">The
NFU is also concerned about the proposal to make the failure to
register a reservoir a criminal liability. Is the Minister prepared to
concede that point? As he is aware, there are a number of reservoirs
whose location and ownership is unclear. There is a concern that a
previously unknown reservoir might be discovered and a criminal
liability might attach to a farm or a small
business.</div><a name="10012154000262"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.45
pm</div><a name="10012154000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
NFU has asked for there to be safeguards to ensure that the Bill does
not become an enabling piece of legislation to be used at a future date
to put additional costs and bureaucracy on to the farming sector. The
Environment Agency supports the introduction of a risk-based approach
to reservoir safety control, with more rigorous measures applying to
reservoirs if failure would pose a risk to life. I simply argue that
the amendment addresses that point by increasing capacity to 15,000
cubic metres.</div>
<a name="10012154000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Association of Drainage Authorities states that the Bill makes a change
to reservoir safety and checks to include all reservoirs of more than
10,000 cubic metres, instead of 25,000 cubic metres. Will the Minister
explain the reason for the change? The Bill would give regard only to
those that may have potential flood risk problems, and that would
exclude quite a few from the regulations.</div>
<a name="10012154000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
association also raises the technical debate about rivers whose
embankments are above ground. If they flooded, would they be treated in
the same way as reservoirs that leaked or flooded? For clarification,
it 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column377" />Column number: 377</div>would welcome the reservoir clause being taken out of the Bill and put
into a wider Bill that would become unifying legislation covering all
major water issues. I am sympathetic to that view, but we have not
concluded our thinking. We may want to remove the provision from the
Bill on Report, but I welcome this opportunity to debate the
matter.</div><a name="10012154000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">Thames
Water has said that it is important that communities next to reservoirs
feel safe, and its position will depend on exactly how the changes
under the Bill are made. The Country Land and Business Association is
pleased with the introduction of a risk-based approach, but it is
concerned about the 10,000 cubic metre threshold and the requirement to
register. That will require several thousand low-risk reservoirs to sit
on a register, because the threshold is too low. We are sympathetic to
its view, and we want to know the reason for that threshold. The
Minister may say that the limit was selected because incidents have
been recorded of the public being at risk from a reservoir below the
current threshold of 25,000 cubic metres. I hope that we have addressed
that by suggesting an interim capacity of 15,000 cubic
metres.</div>
<a name="10012154000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">The CLA
suggests that the Government have not given a strong enough reason to
justify the regulations&#146; potential impact on businesses such as
farmers and landowners who depend on reservoirs to do their work. The
Government may feel obliged to adopt a risk-averse approach, and the
CLA suggests a review of the impact of the threshold in, perhaps, a
year. Is the Minister minded to agree to such a
review?</div><a name="10012154000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
safety and maintenance of reservoirs is an important aspect of flood
defence, and we should ensure that we are protected, but that should
not be done in a way that adds administrative burdens and costs to
farmers, landowners and small businesses. We have concerns, which we
have addressed in the amendment. We believe that the Bill&#146;s aims
can be reached more efficiently and effectively, and impose fewer
regulatory burdens, and it may be best to accept the amendment, or to
remove the provision from the
schedule.</div><a name="10012154000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister will be aware that the Committee has received representations
from the English Golf Union and, perhaps more importantly for him, the
Golf Union of
Wales.</div><a name="10012154000154"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012154000347"></a>Huw

What?</div><a name="10012154000155"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012154000348"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> I hope that the Minister has seen the
representations about clause 33 and schedule 4. The organisations state
that that the proposal to lower the above-ground volume, which is
covered by the Reservoirs Act 1975, from the current threshold causes
them real concern, and that the lowering of the qualifying volume will
have a negative, unintended consequence. In recent years, wherever
possible, golf clubs have worked towards responsible storage of excess
winter water. I declare an interest; there are many golf courses in my
constituency. The organisations believe that they are being unfairly
caught by the memorandum because they store excess water in winter
storage reservoirs within non-impounding offline reservoirs, for
subsequent reuse as irrigation during summer
drought.</div><a name="10012154000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
City of London Corporation would like to share its concerns over the
change to criminal liability:</div>
<a name="10012154000258"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Bill would move from the current position where an actionable failure
has to result from &#145;the wilful default of the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column378" />Column number: 378</div>undertaker&#146; to one where criminal liability results from a
failure. This major change for those managing reservoirs is likely to
result in additional
expense.&#148;</div><a name="10012154000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
does not have the means to meet that expense. Finally, this is also a
key issue for the London councils. They have great concerns over the
reservoir aspect, the regulatory impact and the criminal liability
aspect.</div><a name="10012154000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
urge the Minister to review this matter. I have put everybody&#146;s
concerns to him. I hope that he will be minded to reach a coalition on
amendment
34.</div><a name="10012154000159"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10012154000349"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Roger Williams</b> (Brecon and Radnorshire) (LD): I will be
very brief. The hon. Lady has trespassed, albeit with the best of
intentions, on to the next amendment. The Bill would reduce the figure
of 25,000 to 10,000, and we are discussing an amendment to take it up
to 15,000. Those are arbitrary figures that are not supported by good
arguments. There must be a balance because we want to safeguard the
public while not discouraging the use of reservoirs to trap surplus
water when there is surplus rainfall, to minimise abstracting water
from aquifers or rivers. I believe that the following amendment is best
placed to address this matter, but I will listen to the
Minister&#146;s
reply.</div><a name="10012154000160"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10012154000350"></a><b class="B">Mr.
David Drew</b> (Stroud) (Lab/Co-op): Welcome to the Committee,
Lady
Winterton.</div><a name="10012154000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will make a couple of quick points. There is a danger in the last
afternoon of the Committee that we will all get a bit fatigued.
Understandably, we want to get through the Bill. As was said by the
hon. Member for Vale of York, who is a member of the Environment, Food
and Rural Affairs Committee, the situation with reservoirs&#151;let
alone the way in which we look at flooding and water
management&#151;is probably one of the most important parts of the
Bill. It behoves us not to just nod this through and hope that it will
be all
right.</div><a name="10012154000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
all remember the problems between Sheffield and Doncaster when there
was the potential for a reservoir to break its back, although I cannot
remember the name of the reservoir. There are organisations that wish
to be statutory organisations. It is fair to say that we will table
some amendments on behalf of the Fire Brigades Union on Report, when it
will be more appropriate. If there is an incident around a reservoir,
it must be absolutely clear who is responsible and who will work
together to deal with that responsibility. That is not as easy as it
sounds because one water company could own a reservoir in the area of
another water company. It would therefore not have manpower that it
could suddenly put into the area. We need co-ordinating activities,
which I hope is what we are creating with this
schedule.</div><a name="10012154000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope we have all the emergency powers we need to deal with a
contingency if we see another situation like the 2007 floods. As we
have said in other debates on the Bill, the critical infrastructure is
not ideally located. We have not looked much at reservoirs, but many of
them are in areas at risk of flooding. Of course, it is no good just
putting flood water into a reservoir because that has immense
implications for people&#146;s drinking
water.</div><a name="10012154000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will use just one example to finish. During the problems in
Gloucestershire in 2007, we were looking at bringing in water from
Bristol Water, which takes it from the Gloucester-Sharpness
canal&#151;that could have 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column379" />Column number: 379</div>been done. However, one of the measures to take flood water away that
the Environment Agency has in place&#151;it took me several years to
get this from the agency&#151;is by using the Gloucester-Sharpness
canal. We have a flood alleviation measure that goes into the drinking
water, which we would now need if we had a wider flooding
problem.</div><a name="10012154000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
cannot just wish away such problems. The issues are really serious and
I hope and pray that we are getting them right in the
Bill.</div><a name="10012154000166"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012154000351"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> I know that the hon. Member for Vale of
York was accused of a criminal activity&#151;trespassing on another
amendment. I will be interested when we reach that amendment because,
heaven knows, I might be open to some persuasion, depending on the
strength of the
argument.</div><a name="10012154000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
I shall refer to amendment 34. To make clear what we are trying to do,
which I think has been welcomed by all hon. Members, we are moving to a
system of risk-based assessment of reservoir safety. That is what we
have to do. The Reservoirs Act 1975 is not risk-based and we need to
look at those reservoirs that pose a risk to people if they are
breached&#151;not just those that are large, but those that pose a
risk. I do not think that anyone would expect me, as a Minister, to
apologise for regulating to protect the public, but the aim is to make
the regulation not only risk-based but proportionate. Where regulation
needs to be light touch, it will be light touch. The regulatory burden
will be kept to the absolute minimum required on those reservoirs that
pose little threat, including some reservoirs currently regulated and
some on the properties of individual landowners, who will see a
reduction in burdens if the risk assessment shows that to be
appropriate. However, there is not a non-regulatory
alternative.</div><a name="10012154000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
me say why we have come to the figures that we have and what we might
be able to do. The amendment would make the meaning of &#147;large
raised reservoir&#148; in the Reservoirs Act apply to reservoirs with
a volume capacity of 15,000 cubic metres or more, in place of the
10,000 cubic metres in the Bill. We have considered in some detail what
the minimum figure should be, balancing it against advice from
professionals and the existing records. That is what we have gone on.
We have records that are not complete, because many reservoirs are not
recorded, as they are not of that scale. However, we know that we have
had incidents involving water holdings between 10,000 and 12,000 cubic
metres, or between 10,000 and 15,000 cubic metres. We know they have
occurred, and I shall come back to that in a
moment.</div><a name="10012154000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
reached the figures on the advice of professionals and on records of
actual incidents involving potential breaches of reservoirs. First, the
profession considers that the 10,000 cubic metres is a realistic
minimum for risk assessment purposes, which&#151;let me make it
clear&#151;was supported by the vast majority of experienced
engineers who responded to the consultation. By the way, to say who
else has rallied behind the proposal, the Institute of Civil Engineers,
the British Dam Society and the Environment Agency have coalesced
alongside independent, professional engineers. The mode is bang on
10,000 cubic metres, rather than 15,000 cubic metres. This is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column380" />Column number: 380</div>not a matter of a Minister plucking a sum out of thin air; there is not
an exact science, but that is where the figure is at the
moment.</div>
<a name="10012154000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
can give further assurance of where we go with the figure now and in
the future. First, the extension to 10,000 cubic metres does not mean
that all reservoirs with that capacity will be regulated beyond the
need simply to register and comply with certain requirements on new
builds and major alterations. As part of the risk-based approach that
we are introducing, reservoirs not designated as high risk will not
have to meet the needs for more routine supervision and inspection
requirements. That aspect is getting the burden right&#151;doing the
risk assessment and matching it to the appropriate
requirements.</div><a name="10012154000171"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10012154000352"></a><b class="B">Martin
Horwood</b> (Cheltenham) (LD): One of the issues highlighted
by Pitt for high-risk reservoirs&#151;he quoted the terrible example
of the Ulley reservoir in Rotherham, from where 1,000 people had to be
evacuated at very short notice in the middle of the night&#151;was
not only evaluating the risk but communicating it to local communities
and first-level responders. Will such reservoirs be part of the
critical national infrastructure we discussed in earlier sittings,
which the Cabinet Office is supposed to deal with, and what measures
may be put in place to communicate that risk and inclusion on the
register to local
communities?</div><a name="10012154000263"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2

reservoirs will be, but I will return to that point in a
moment.</div>
<a name="10012154000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the impact
assessment we published, we included a summary of a known incident in
which lives are at risk from the potential breach of a reservoir with a
capacity of about 12,000 cubic metres. A more recent example in the
midlands involves a reservoir of between 10,000 and 12,000 cubic
metres. We have taken the view, alongside that of the professionals,
which has coalesced around the 12,000 figure, that risk assessment
should start at that level.</div>
<a name="10012154000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">Many
organisations and groups have raised concerns about whether the figure
is correct and what can be done if it is wrong. One point is that
farmers and landowners might benefit from deregulation, as some of the
reservoirs will be not only low risk, but remote, so they would not be
caught as part of risk assessment. They would not pose a risk to people
because they are on farmland far away from built-up areas. Any release
of water in those remote locations, away from houses and building,
would not be catastrophic.</div>
<a name="10012154000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">We recognise
that several small reservoirs on farms might come within the 10,000 to
25,000 cubic metre range. I can give an assurance that we will not
launch the measures pre-emptively and will consult with farmers and
landowners when we come to frame the detailed rules for regulating the
reservoirs that pose a risk. We want to ensure that, where those rules
can be light touch, they are. We will also look at how we can provide
farmers with advice, both on that and on new
reservoirs.</div><a name="10012154000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">With
regard to criminal liability, the Reservoirs Act 1975 is
concerned with public safety, so that is the focus. That is consistent
with the paramount important of public safety, but failure to
register&#151;we are talking about a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column381" />Column number: 381</div>risk to individuals as well as to homes and businesses&#151;is a
criminal offence. However, clause 37 of the Bill also provides for
civil sanctions, on which we will consult before they are produced, so
there is an ability not only to go for criminal sanctions, but to deal
with such matters appropriately. The change of criminality from wilful
default to strict liability is the same as the need for criminal
liability in relation to registration. Strict liability offences are
appropriate for public safety legislation. We also intend to introduce
civil sanctions as an alternative.</div>
<a name="10012154000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
hon. Friend the Member for Stroud mentioned emergency powers. Schedule
4 includes updated provisions on emergency response plans and extends
them to reservoirs larger than 10,000 cubic metres, but based on the
risk analysis. Emergency services will therefore also have to provide
their plans for handling flood impacts, and we have agreed to give
&#163;1.2 million to support their work towards that. We have made
the outline inundation maps I mentioned earlier, which show the
potential extent of flooding, available to the public because we
believe that they have a right to see them. We will make more detailed
maps available to emergency planners, who need to drill down to a more
detailed
level.</div><a name="10012154000178"></a>

more detailed information into which emergency planners might need to
drill down will be provided directly to them. Those maps for the
emergency planners might contain secure information on assets at risk,
for example, so we would not make them generally available. There will
be arrangements, however, to inform the public of risks and provide
warnings, and plans to do that in 2010 are now being developed by the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012154000362"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> The amendment highlights an unintended
consequence of the Bill that the Minister may not be aware of, and the
difficulty that the Government have created for themselves. We believe
that when allowing major infrastructure projects to be tendered, it is
regrettable that under proposed new part 2A, water companies would be
prevented from tendering. I do not know whether it is intended, but
proposed new section 36B(2) states that water companies are excluded
from tendering. The amendments, therefore, are exploratory probing
ones, to ask why water companies are excluded, and why a water or
sewerage undertaker would be prevented 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column383" />Column number: 383</div>from tendering when they might have the expertise and might be best
placed to submit a tender. They might come up with the most competitive
tender for a major infrastructure project, and that would help the
consumer or the developer. We seek to allow water companies and
sewerage undertakers to participate in the tendering
process.</div><a name="10012154000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
19, which would perhaps be more elegantly phrased if it said
&#147;regulations&#148; rather than &#147;regulators&#148;,
would allow a water or sewerage undertaker not just to undertake an
infrastructure project but to tender in accordance with the
regulations. Amendment 20 would allow an incumbent water or sewerage
undertaker to tender for and carry out projects from which they are
currently excluded, and amendment 21 would enable the sewerage or water
undertaker to prepare its own plan for a specified infrastructure
project, and therefore participate in the competitive process for major
infrastructure projects.</div>
<a name="10012154000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments, I hope, recognise the skills, experience and expertise that
the water and sewerage companies hold for the benefit of the customers
in those circumstances. Amendment 20 would allow the incumbent water or
sewerage undertaker to carry out a project itself, if there had not
been a successful outcome to the tender project within a year. We would
allow the tendering to run for a year. We believe that it is a missed
opportunity that the Government would exclude those water companies,
whom we believe might be best placed, from participating in the
process.</div><a name="10012154000199"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10012154000363"></a><b class="B">Dr.
Roberta Blackman-Woods</b> (City of Durham) (Lab): It is a
pleasure, Lady Winterton, to serve under your
chairmanship.</div><a name="10012154000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
thank the hon. Member for Vale of York for tabling the amendments. I
have great sympathy with her sentiment, and wish to ask the Minister
for some clarification as to why water companies or their associates
are not able to bid for those large-scale infrastructure
projects.</div><a name="10012154000201"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012154000364"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> I thank the hon. Member for Vale of York
and my hon. Friend the Member for City of Durham for their introduction
of, and response to, those amendments, which probe why the Government
are where they are on the matter. It is worth while putting some
comments on the
record.</div><a name="10012154000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have carefully considered these amendments on large, exceptional and/or
high-risk water infrastructure projects. The Bill amends the Water
Industry Act 1991 to allow undertakers to carry out preparatory work
for such projects, but prohibits them from delivering the projects for
two main reasons, the logic of which is important. First, the
undertaker will manage the tendering process, so it would be a conflict
of interest to allow it to participate further in that process by
submitting a bid, for example. We have to avoid that conflict of
interest.</div><a name="10012154000264"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.15
pm</div><a name="10012154000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
because regulated projects will be exceptionally large and/or high
risk, prohibiting undertakers from participating in their delivery
should reduce customers&#146; exposure to what could be the
far-reaching effects of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column384" />Column number: 384</div>cost overruns, for example, which as we all know are far too common on
such large projects. To take advantage of their considerable
experience, the Bill requires undertakers to manage the tendering
process for such projects. They know the areas and how the projects
should go ahead in detail. Nevertheless, the projects subject to the
regulations will be of a nature that has not been delivered by the
water industry since at least privatisation, if not longer. As such,
elements of the projects will require, for example, construction and
financial expertise that undertakers may not currently possess,
although that is not the same for all of them.</div>
<a name="10012154000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is not
appropriate for undertakers to take risks of which they have little to
no recent experience. To return to the point made by the hon. Member
for Vale of York, that is all the more important as the customers will
ultimately bear such risks. There is the question of assessing where
the risk and the burden should lie in such a project. It is worth
countering the remarks made, because I think that all hon. Members
acknowledge the impressive achievements of the industry in delivering
some &#163;85 billion of infrastructure since privatisation. We do
not wish the new regulations to be perceived as punishment for a job
well done. On the contrary, the regulations will catch only a very few
projects in the first
place.</div><a name="10012154000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">Eligibility
criteria will be clearly specified on a case-by-case basis after the
statutory consultation process. Moreover, if a project meets the
criteria that require the provisions to be applied, the resulting
tendering process will be planned carefully and executed deliberately.
The undertaker will manage the tendering process, and, subject to
consultation with Government or Ofwat, will be permitted to define the
terms of the tendering proposal. I am going somewhere with this, so
bear with me. In that way, the provisions provide scope for the
undertaker to the deliver project elements in which it is expert, while
tendering for those elements in which it is not. The provisions also
expressly permit undertakers to conduct preparatory work, which may, on
a case-by-case basis, also include run-of-the-mill project
elements.</div><a name="10012154000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
the Bill also accommodates the possibility of a failed tender, even
though we do not expect an exhaustive process to produce such an
outcome. A lengthy tendering process will also make it clear, on a
case-by-case basis, whether undertaker-led project planning is
warranted. To dictate that an undertaker may always conduct detailed
project planning, as amendment 21 does, exposes customers to the
possibility of paying for work that ultimately might serve no eventual
purpose. We must be aware of that.</div>
<a name="10012154000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill does
not prohibit affiliates of undertakers from taking part in the
tendering process, including project planning, provided that an
undertaker is insulated from its affiliate in case of the
latter&#146;s financial distress, which is an important point. That
brings us back to the point about not exposing the customers of a
company to the consequences of a large infrastructure project going
belly-up. It is crucial to maintain that financial insulation,
particularly in light of heightened concern about financial
risks.</div><a name="10012154000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
acknowledge that establishing affiliates will require several very
highly indebted undertakers to renegotiate existing debt covenants at
uncertain, and potentially high, cost. Those incremental costs may make
their bids less competitive than they would have been without 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column385" />Column number: 385</div>them. However, we note that the covenants that require renegotiation
were drafted specifically to protect lenders from risks different from
those in the traditional regulated water and sewerage business. The
Bill is equally alert to those risks for the very good reason that
those very highly indebted companies do not have as much capacity to
absorb cost overruns as a less indebted company might
have.</div><a name="10012154000209"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012154000365"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I am interested in the Minister&#146;s
argument. Is there not a risk that the best will be the enemy of the
good? If companies think they have a good opportunity to tender for the
projects and are willing to take those risks, why should they be
excluded? Surely that is a decision for them and financiers, not for
the
Government.</div><a name="10012154000210"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012154000366"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> It is about them and their financiers and
Ofwat, but also, crucially, the customers. This is the dilemma: if a
company overextends itself on a large or potentially high-risk project,
and the burden of that does not lie on an affiliate or separate company
but on the water and sewerage company, that is literally where, on this
occasion, the buck stops, but ultimately the cost will be passed on to
the
customer.</div><a name="10012154000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is a real issue here. I have already undertaken to meet representatives
of the water companies next week regarding other issues that we need to
resolve. I have had a brief discussion with representatives of the
industry already, and I am happy to put the item on the agenda, to see
whether we can find a way forward that squares the triangle. We do not
want to expose customers to risk, or to allow companies that do not
have expertise, even if they think they do and then go belly-up, to
land all that damage on their customers. There is an issue about how we
allow companies to use their expertise in some way, perhaps to the
benefit of the customers, to get involved in such
projects.</div><a name="10012154000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again,
I am happy as part of the meeting on Tuesday to put this issue on the
agenda and then to come back promptly to members of the Committee with
the outcome. Either we will have a way forward or, alternatively, hon.
Members can table amendments if we have not made satisfactory progress.
With that, I ask the hon. Lady to consider withdrawing the
amendment.</div><a name="10012154000213"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012154000367"></a>Miss

deliberations over the past two weeks had proceeded as smoothly. If the

35, 36 and 37 might appear obscure, but we are seeking to restore in
the Bill the definition of &#147;private motor vehicle&#148; that
exists in the Water Industry Act 1991, which the proposed new section
amends. This little group, particularly amendments 35, 36 and 37,
provides the Minister with an opportunity to explain why the Government
have decided not to include, but definitely to exclude, the definition
from the Bill, as my understanding is that the definition of private
motor vehicle would go some way to protecting certain businesses at
times of hosepipe bans, as well as allowing public vehicles to be
cleaned. We can all imagine the nature of the public vehicles that
would be encompassed by the

can think of no apparent reason why the Minister would need to reserve

Perhaps he will take this opportunity to explain why he is seeking to
do so. In our view, the definition in the 1991 Act is clear and
sufficient for the purposes, and we hope that he will agree to
reinstate it so as to avoid any evidence of doubt when the Act is
interpreted.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column387" />Column number: 387</div><a name="10012154000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
145, 146 and 147 are consequential on a previous amendment. Proposed
new section 76(2)(c) will allow the Minister to define by order the
terms in section 76(2). The Bill requires water companies to offer
reasonable reductions in charges when restrictions are placed on use,
but there is no definition of what reasonable reductions might be. The
Minister should have the power to set out in more detail the reduction
of charges expected if water companies cannot, do not or will not offer
reductions that consumers consider to be reasonable. We invite the
Minister to comment on that.</div>
<a name="10012154000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">We propose to
omit lines 16 and 17 on page 21 of clause 36. The provision raises
concerns about the role of the Environment Agency by giving it the
ability to carry out work that might increase flooding or erosion and
the responsibility to balance whether the benefits of the work will
outweigh the damage caused to human health, the economy, infrastructure
or the environment. The amendments question whether the Environment
Agency is in the best position to balance those competing interests
and, ultimately, to take decisions that could affect many
people&#146;s lives. We think that such decisions might best be taken
by elected representatives, albeit with the support and co-operation of
the Environment
Agency.</div><a name="10012154000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
original draft Bill that was consulted on&#151;I know that a number
of issues were raised&#151;did not give the Environment Agency the
power to balance those competing interests. Rather, it allowed the
agency to carry out potentially damaging work only when it explicitly
would not create or increase the harmful effects. Our amendment would
restore the original drafting, which is not perfect, as it still leaves
too little a role, but would involve local authorities. The Minister
must take this opportunity to explain to us why he thinks the new roles
are
better.</div><a name="10012154000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
also seek clarity on the types of work envisaged and what weight will
be given to councils, internal drainage boards and local flood
authorities during the consultation process outlined in the conditions
set out. Concerns about the water restriction purposes have been
expressed by horticultural groups, particularly Johnsons of Whixley,
which is based in Vale of York and with which I currently enjoy good
working relations. We are trying to balance what the role of the water
companies should be, but we are also mindful of the horticultural
interest.</div><a name="10012154000229"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012154000371"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> I was desperately trying to think of a
horticulturist in my constituency that I could mention in a brazen
attempt at product placement, but I will hold back. If I name one, the
others will all be after me.</div>
<a name="10012154000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">Once again, I
will be an extremely reasonable Minister. Amendment 36 suggests a list
of additional uses for water that a water company may restrict under
its own powers, similar to the one that the Department for Environment,
Food and Rural Affairs considered should be added when we published the
response to our 2007 consultation on changes to the hosepipe ban
legislation. The reason why we did not propose the same list ourselves
in this clause is that we need to obtain further information on the
costs and benefits&#151;as we set out in the impact 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column388" />Column number: 388</div>assessment&#151;by which I mean the potential of each activity to save
water and the cost of restrictions to
customers.</div>
<a name="10012154000265"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.30
pm</div><a name="10012154000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
sought further evidence on that issue in the consultation on the draft
Bill, but we did not get back anything of any great use in response. It
is the sort of list that we will be bringing forward, and we do not
think that it is far off the mark. If the hon. Lady will consider
withdrawing her amendment, we can rapidly turn this round, go back,
have a look at the matter and ensure that we have got it right and put
it in the Bill. Ideally, we would like to consider each amendment in
turn, but we can happily get this on to the Bill.</div>
<a name="10012154000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">Other
amendments include one that defines a &#147;private motor
vehicle&#148;, and one that removes the provision that enables the
Government to define words and phrases in relation to the specified
uses of water that can be prohibited. I can see that the amendments
have been tabled in the hope and expectation that by including the
definition of a private motor vehicle, we will remove the need to use
secondary legislation. Our intention is to use the provision for
secondary legislation to define not only what is meant by a private
motor vehicle, but what is meant by a private garden or &#147;using a
hosepipe&#148;, as there has been some uncertainty about the exact
scope of those
phrases.</div><a name="10012154000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
future, we will also use the provision to define new words and phrases
as appropriate, as further uses are added or existing uses amended. As
hon. Members have said before, future-proofing holds very true here.
Future-proofing in legislation allows the Government to clarify any
uncertainties on scope that arise over time. Given the potential impact
on customers, it is important that we have this ability to address
uncertainties that emerge and refine definitions.</div>
<a name="10012154000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">In addition,
hon. Members have suggested redrafting section 76(6) of the Water
Industry Act 1991 to clarify the requirement for a water undertaker to
make a reduction in charges if it has made a specific charge for a use
that is subsequently banned, such as in the case of the hosepipe and
sprinkler ban. However, we believe that the section as drafted already
has that effect, and it does not impose a more general requirement for
a reduction in charges simply because restrictions are put in
place.</div><a name="10012154000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">Hon.
Members are also seeking an amendment to include provision for the
Minister, by order, to set out the reduction in charges to be made by
water undertakers in respect of prohibited uses. It is entirely right
that, where appropriate, reasonable reductions should be made, and that
is what we are seeking to ensure. The precise detail of tariffs and
reductions is a matter for the economic regulator to agree with the
water
undertakers.</div><a name="10012154000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
hon. Members have proposed an amendment to remove the requirement for
water undertakers to publish details of how representations may be made
in respect of any temporary bans. That would remove a basic but
important element of the duty to act fairly when exercising statutory
powers, which enables customers to draw attention to potentially
unforeseen impacts and to ensure that the water undertaker considers
them before imposing those restrictions. The processes outlined in this
clause will help to ensure that water undertakers 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column389" />Column number: 389</div>act proportionately in response to water shortages. It strikes that
balance between the needs of the water undertakers to conserve water
and the interests of the customer who may be affected by that decision.
Given that clarification and the offer to come back with an amendment
on clause 36 once we have considered the drafting, I hope the hon. Lady
will consider withdrawing the
amendment.</div><a name="10012154000237"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012154000375"></a>Mr.
Williams:</b> After three comparatively wet summers in most of
the UK, it seems a long time since hosepipe bans were part of UK life.
However, in anticipation of a drier summer in future, they are worth
considering. The 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column390" />Column number: 390</div>amendments would effectively place a duty on the Secretary of State and
Welsh Ministers to issue a code of practice for hosepipe bans, and a
duty on water companies to conform to it.</div>
<a name="10012154000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I understand it, water companies issue codes, but they are not very
coherent or uniform, and that makes it difficult for people to comply
with them. Subsection (2) of proposed new section 76D of the Water
Industry Act 1991 would require each code to aim for three
goals. They are, broadly, our old friends proportionality and fairness;
minimum variation between neighbouring companies; and adequate
information for consumers about what is and is not permitted. They are
designed to respond to the concerns explained in the Horticultural
Trades Association&#146;s comments on the Bill.</div>
<a name="10012154000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection
(4)(a) would make it clear that proportionality includes a graduated
approach to the exercise of powers under section 76. The code should
clarify that, unless there is good reason to the contrary, a water
company should introduce narrower, more tightly focused
restrictions&#151;such as hosepipe use on alternate days or for a
particulate purpose, such as gardening, rather than car
washing&#151;before broader, indiscriminate ones.</div>
<a name="10012154000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection
3(b) would provide that fairness includes taking account of differences
in the efficiency of water use.</div>
<a name="10012154000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">The proposed
new section is not prescriptive, so the Secretary of State and Welsh
Ministers will have discretion over the exact provision that should be
made to further the goals.</div>
<a name="10012154000246"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10012154000376"></a><b class="B">Angela
Watkinson</b> (Upminster) (Con): Is it the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s intention to include in the amendment protection
for, for example, the horticultural industry and those who run garden
centres and so on? In conditions of severe drought, they can be in
danger of losing their stock, which would have a grave financial impact
on the viability of their
businesses.</div><a name="10012154000247"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012154000377"></a>Mr.
Williams:</b> I thank the hon. Lady for raising that point. As
I understand it, commercial organisations are not covered by the
restrictions. The horticultural industry is concerned because a broad
ban makes people&#146;s gardens difficult to maintain and leads to
death and disease in plants, which could be avoided in the case of a
more discrete ban.</div>
<a name="10012154000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection
(3) would provide flexibility by enabling a code to be varied or
revoked, but a code must be in place at all times while section 76 is
in force. When a code is revoked, a new code would have to take effect
at the same time.</div>
<a name="10012154000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">The proposed
new section does not set out any formal procedure for issuing, varying
or revoking a code, but subsection (5) requires consultation before a
code is issued or varied. The requirement is drafted in identical terms
to the equivalent provision in clause 35&#151;proposed new section
36G(2) of the 1991 Act.</div>
<a name="10012154000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection
(4) would also require the current version of the code to be made
available to the
public.</div><a name="10012156000007"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012156000073"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> I appreciate the spirit
of the amendments, which would require the introduction of and
conformity with a statutory code of practice, whereby water undertakers
used their powers to introduce temporary bans in times of water
shortage.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column391" />Column number: 391</div><a name="10012156000008"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the hon.
Gentleman said, water undertakers have a statutory duty to supply water
for domestic purposes, such as drinking, cleaning and cooking. When
water is in short supply, water companies must be able to restrict the
use of water for non-essential purposes. Their drought plans, on which
they rightly have to consult publicly, set out the way in which each
water undertaker would deal with drought in their own area. That varies
from area to area, depending on the topography and other local factors.
The plans also include the triggers that cause the water undertakers to
initiate a range of actions.</div>
<a name="10012156000009"></a><div class="hs_Para">The water
industry has indeed responded to Government proposals to produce a code
of practice, and it has done so. The code concentrates on exactly the
principles that the hon. Gentleman is trying to achieve, particularly
those in respect of proportionality, consistency and
transparency.</div><a name="10012156000010"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
we acknowledge that, as we have seen in the past in the UK, droughts
are not uniform events in terms of either location or duration. We
firmly believe that undertakers must be able to react speedily and with
flexibility to conditions in their area of supply, working with others
to ensure that they have the plans right, so that they can achieve the
objective of conserving water for domestic uses and for preventing the
need for more restrictive measures to be put in place.</div>
<a name="10012156000011"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
order-making power at proposed new section 76(A)(2) allows the
Secretary of State, or Welsh Ministers in Wales, to provide further
detail as to the extent of the power by defining a word or constraining
the extent of the power, for example, or by providing for exceptions to
the restrictions&#151;by preventing water companies from restricting
certain businesses from using water if the negative impact on their
business would outweigh the benefits of conserving the water, for
instance.</div>
<a name="10012156000012"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government will keep under review how each water company exercises the
powers and, taking into account the public interest, may adjust the
powers using the secondary legislation provision in proposed new
section 76(A)(2), if they think that appropriate. We can do what the
hon. Gentleman suggests, and we will&#151;we have to&#151;keep this
issue under close review. I hope that, with that assurance, he will
withdraw the amendment.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012156000077"></a>Mr.
Williams:</b> I will not detain the Committee for long, but
clause 38 is important. It gives considerable powers to the agency to
carry out work for the purposes of natural and cultural conservation
and amenity. However, the power does not extend to the protection of
commercial interests&#151;including agriculture or the protection of
people&#146;s homes, all of which could be put at significant risk by
flooding. Moreover, it suggests that we put the agency in the position
of having to tell someone who lives on the coast and whose home is at
imminent risk of destruction by flooding, that, while it can intervene
to carry out works to protect biodiversity, it cannot intervene to
protect the dwelling.</div>
<a name="10012156000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">As such, the
proposed power needs to be extended. We are not saying that it should
be exercised as a matter of course, but it will probably be needed only
in exceptional circumstances. Where it should be needed, it should be
available. On that basis, I am prepared to listen to the
Minister&#146;s explanation.</div>
<a name="10012156000021"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012156000078"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> I hope that I can give reassurance and
work with the hon. Gentleman in the spirit of his amendments.</div>
<a name="10012156000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 123
will allow the agency to cause flooding in the interests of dwellings
or the protection of agricultural or other commercial interests. It
sounds like a wholly reasonable suggestion and I appreciate the
intentions behind it. However, it is not
necessary.</div><a name="10012156000071"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.45
pm</div><a name="10012156000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
agency already has the power to reduce the potential harmful impacts of
flood erosion under the Coast Protection Act 1949, the Land Drainage
Act 1991 and the Water Resources Act 1991. All amendments to
those Acts will be made under schedule 2, when the Bill is enacted. It
might be helpful to explain that clauses 38 and 39 are necessary to
enable authorities to carry out works that cause flooding, an increase
in the amount of water below ground or coastal erosion for the
beneficial effects of the environment, as opposed to reducing the risks
from those processes. That is necessary because certain important
aspects of the environment depend on those processes to sustain their
interest.</div><a name="10012156000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
it is just not clear how causing flooding or erosion could benefit
dwellings or the protection of agricultural or commercial interests,
other than for the purposes of general flood or coastal erosion risk
management, so the capacity to do what the hon. Gentleman is proposing
already exists within our legislation. His amendment is not
necessary and is a wee bit
confusing.</div><a name="10012156000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
me move on to amendment 124. It would require the agency to have regard
to the views of owners and occupiers of land likely to be directly
affected by works carried out under its powers in the clause. I could
wax lyrical about why that is not necessary, but I understand the
spirit in which it is intended. Unlike the previous amendment, it would
not affect the Bill materially, but 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column393" />Column number: 393</div>signal what we are intending to do. If we can take the proposal away and
have a look at it, we are pretty confident that, with a bit of
redrafting, we can bring something back that would do exactly what the
hon. Gentleman wants. I hope that he will accept my assurance and,
hopefully, when we debate the Bill on Report, we shall table
an amendment that will have the same
effect.</div><a name="10012156000026"></a>

necessary because the Bill already takes account of such issues. I
accept that she is probing at something, and it might be useful to
clarify the role of local authorities and others. There are similar

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012156000085"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> The Committee will note that amendment 125
stands in our name and amendment 128 stands in the names of
both official Opposition and Liberal Democrat Members.</div>
<a name="10012156000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">These two
important amendments go to the heart of the debate we had on day one or
two of the Committee, regarding the far-reaching powers of the
Environment Agency, particularly under clause 38. The Bill has no
appeals mechanism against the Agency by any who run foul of its
decisions taken under clause 38. We would like to see among the duties
that the Environment Agency is asked to carry out in this regard,
reducing, by regular maintenance, the incidence of flooding.</div>
<a name="10012156000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 125
insists:</div><a name="10012156000067"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;(16)
The Minister must by regulation provide a right of appeal against a
decision by the Agency to exercise the powers in this

The regulations
must&#151;</div><a name="10012156000069"></a><div class="hs_brev">(a)

make provision about
procedure.&#148;</div><a name="10012156000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are slightly alarmed by clause 38. We support the role of the
Environment Agency in this regard and believe it is best placed to act,
but it is important, as in other clauses earlier in the Bill, to have a
right of appeal. We ask the Minister to share our concern and express
his view as to why no right of appeal has been given.</div>
<a name="10012156000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">There must be
a difference between amendments 128 and 125 but I do not immediately
see what it is. We hope that amendment 125 will meet with the support
of the
Committee.</div><a name="10012156000040"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012156000086"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> We have been making good progress and I
hope we can here. The amendments seek to place the additional safeguard
of a right of appeal against the Environment Agency&#146;s decisions
under the powers of clause 38; and, in the case of clause 39, a right
of appeal against local authorities and internal drainage
boards.</div><a name="10012156000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is right for people&#146;s rights to be protected and I believe the
Bill provides adequate safeguards, through the rights of appeal for
property owners, through provisions in respect of compulsory purchase
and compensation, which are based on those in the Water Resources
Act 1991. Projects implemented under the powers in clauses
38 and 39 will be subject to the same regime of consents and safeguards
as any other project carried out under different powers by public
bodies, developers or individuals. For works that go beyond minor
improvement or routine maintenance, planning permission will generally
be needed under the Town and Country Planning Act 1990. The local
authority planning process ensures that interested parties are
consulted and the opinions of the community are heard and taken into
account. Well-established safeguards are associated with the process
and the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column395" />Column number: 395</div>planning authority is, of course, accountable for its decisions, which
can be judicially reviewed. It would not make sense to establish a new
process that duplicated the checks and balances of the existing
planning process.</div>
<a name="10012156000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
work of a more routine and minor nature that would not require planning
permission, a wide range of consents and permissions is required in
different circumstances. To add a further appeals regime specifically
for works carried out under these clauses would be disproportionate,
inappropriately bureaucratic and highly burdensome for the Environment
Agency, local authorities and internal drainage boards.</div>
<a name="10012156000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">Furthermore
any change of agricultural land use that does not need planning
permission, but is nevertheless likely to have a significant effect on
the environment, will require an environmental assessment and consent
from Natural England under the Environment Impact Assessment
(Agriculture) (England) (No. 2) Regulations 2006. This assessment must
include consultation with the public, thus providing an opportunity for
interested parties to make their views known to the decision
makers.</div>
<a name="10012156000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, any
person wishing to challenge the exercise of the Environment Agency
powers under clause 38 would have the option of judicially reviewing a
decision. I therefore believe that there are already adequate
safeguards in the system to ensure that these powers cannot be used to
promote inappropriate projects, so the amendments, while well
intentioned, are not
needed.</div><a name="10012156000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
128 refers to a right of appeal against a decision by the agency in the
exercise its powers under clause 39. However, clause 39 gives powers to
local authorities and internal drainage boards&#151;the point that
the hon. Lady was pushing towards there&#151;not to the Environment
Agency. I assume therefore that the amendment was intended to refer to
right of appeal against the decisions of local authorities and internal
drainage boards. If this is the case, the argument against amendment
128 is the same as that against 125 and, again, I do not agree that it
is necessary. I therefore ask the hon. Lady to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="10012156000046"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012156000090"></a>Mr.
Williams:</b> These amendments in some ways mirror amendments
123 and 124, only clause 39 applies to local authorities rather than to
the Environment Agency. The amendments are the same. There is a concern
about the powers that local authorities have to enter land and do work
that does not include houses and commercial businesses. The Minister
has given his answer to that. The other concern is to get the agreement
of the landowner before the work is done or certainly to inform the
landowner about the extent and nature of those works. The Minister was
very generous in replying to the previous amendment. If he could be
equally generous on this one, we could come to an
arrangement.</div><a name="10012156000072"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012156000091"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> I will endeavour to come to some
arrangement now if I can. Amendment 126 sounds wholly reasonable. It
would give local authorities and IDBs powers under clause 39 to cause
flooding, an increase in the amount of water below ground or coastal
erosion in the interests of dwellings or the protection of agricultural
or other commercial interests. However, it is not necessary because
local authorities and IDBs already have the powers to do things to
reduce the potentially harmful effects of flooding or erosion on
dwellings and agricultural or commercial interests under the Acts that
I referred to
previously.</div><a name="10012156000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
may be helpful to explain that clause 39 is about enabling authorities
to carry out works that cause flooding, an increase in the amount of
water below ground or coastal erosion for the beneficial effects on the
environment, as opposed to reducing the risks from those processes.
That is necessary because certain important aspects of the environment
depend on those processes to sustain their interests. However, it is
not clear how causing flooding or erosion could benefit dwellings or
the protection of agricultural or other commercial interests. The
debate is similar to the one that we had on clause
38.</div><a name="10012156000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
respect of amendment 127, my comments will be similar to what I said
before. I think that the thrust of the amendment is broadly there. We
need to consider the drafting and I am happy to take the amendment away
and consider it, with a view to bringing something back on Report that
achieves a similar result. I think that, on balance, what we have in
the Bill already will deliver it, but to sum up the intention behind it
and put it clearly in the Bill, I am happy to give that
assurance.</div><a name="10012156000055"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012156000092"></a>Miss

am delighted that we have had the opportunity to debate them and I hope

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012156000093"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012160000132"></a>Nia
Griffith:</b> Clause 41 is extremely important because it will
safeguard new house owners from the nightmare of having to pay for
repairs. Many people across the country might not even know that they
were going to be responsible for such repairs, and they find themselves
faced with enormous bills. It is extremely important that we have the
clause to tighten up the legislation and make it absolutely clear that
from now on, no one will face that situation.</div>
<a name="10012160000010"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, my
concern regards the long delays that we have had in the adoption of
existing sewers by the water companies. We still have people who have
been waiting for some considerable time. They know that a survey has
been undertaken and that work has been done to ascertain the magnitude
of the problem up and down the country. However, they are very anxious
now to see that the appropriate measures are put in place for those
sewers to be adopted. If there will not be anything in the Bill to do
that, will the Minister explain why that is the case? What I can say to
my constituents on such an important
issue?</div><a name="10012160000011"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012160000133"></a>Dr.
Blackman-Woods:</b> I rise to seek some reassurance from the
Minister that the new sewers and natural drains will not be connected
to the public sewerage system until they comply with the universal
building standards that are to be prescribed by him, and that those
regulations will link to the current building
regulations.</div><a name="10012160000012"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012160000134"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> I think I can bring good news to my hon.
Friend the Member for Llanelli&#151;we have spoken about the matter
on numerous occasions. The good news is that the powers for
transferring in Wales already exist. We established them in the Water
Act 2003, so that Welsh Ministers can make regulations about
transfer. Of course, that is a devolved issue.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column398" />Column number: 398</div><a name="10012160000013"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me put on
my MP&#146;s, rather than my Minister&#146;s hat for a moment. Like
my hon. Friend, I have a desire for the measure to apply to some of the
estates in my area, where the sewers have not been adopted, and houses
that were built in the &#146;50s, &#146;60s and &#146;70s have
been extended. The sewers were substandard&#151;they are now
crumbling, and the bills are landing on the doorsteps. I therefore
share my hon. Friend&#146;s desire to see the urgent roll-out of the
measure.</div>
<a name="10012160000014"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have made
it clear in England that transfer will be effected in 2011. I can tell
my hon. Friend that, while it is a devolved issue, the approach to be
taken in Wales has been set out in the strategic position statement,
which I have seen on the website and is worth looking at. The timing
and the detailed roll-out are, as both of us powerful
pro-devolutionists know, a matter for Welsh Ministers. However, as MPs,
I am sure that we will lobby the relevant Ministers in the Welsh
Assembly Government to take the matter forward as quickly as
possible.</div><a name="10012160000015"></a><div class="hs_Para">On

<div class="Column"><a name="Column399" />Column number: 399</div>We Conservatives are delighted to have secured this concession. I pay
tribute to my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs (Nick
Herbert), who leads for us as shadow Secretary of State on such matters
and was instrumental in achieving the concessions. We welcome the
Government&#146;s decision to follow our course and introduce
provisions to deal with the problems caused by companies moving to site
area charging for surface water drainage. It is fair to say that not
all water companies were caught out. I pay tribute to Yorkshire Water
as being exemplary, and bringing in provisions that did not do that. I
am delighted that other water companies will achieve best practice in
this
regard.</div><a name="10012160000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
should be up to water companies, who know their customers, to be
responsive to their needs, with the input of the Consumer Council for
Water. However, the Government have not published guidance and without
it, it is difficult to know how Ministers intend to implement such
schemes.</div><a name="10012160000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
39 is a probing amendment that is designed to give the Minister the
opportunity to explain in more detail the Government&#146;s plans and
say whether they intend to publish guidance and on what date they will
do
so.</div><a name="10012160000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">Similarly,
amendment 40 sets out the minimum for community groups qualifying for
concessionary charges. The amendment provides the opportunity for the
Minister to set out in more detail those organisations to be covered in
a concessionary charging scheme. We accept that many organisations
might be eligible for concessionary charges, but the Committee will be
impressed that the list should</div>
<a name="10012160000122"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;include as a

as well as finding it difficult to meet the extra charges, can ill
afford mitigation measures such as the installation of other drainage

from reduced revenues during the
recession.</div><a name="10012160000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again,
this is a probing amendment tabled so that the Minister can place on
the record today which groups the Government plan to include in their
guidance, how advanced the guidance is and when they intend to publish
it. I should also like to know how they intend to advise water
companies to proceed, because I think that those companies would accept
that
guidance.</div><a name="10012160000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
accept that water companies know their customers and are best placed to
judge them, but they are not agents for social policy. We hope that the
guidance that the Minister intends to publish will make clear, in
recommending it, the test that water companies should apply to
potentially eligible customers. We hope that Ministers will also make
clear whether they intend to allow publicly run premises, such as
schools, hospitals and other public buildings, to be included, because
that is a slightly grey area. Their inclusion would increase the
cross-subsidy required from other customers to a potentially
unacceptable level. That would not be fair, given that they should have
the resources to mitigate the charges and that they should see the
benefit of reduced bills in future.</div>

the Minister accept that it would mitigate the expense and the

to mitigate the cost across the board. I know that the Select Committee
on the Environment Food and Rural Affairs&#151;I have the honour of
being a member&#151;is keen on the idea. However, we have not had the
opportunity to debate it, and I would like to return to the
subject.</div>
<a name="10012160000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">Nevertheless,
there will be a cost. Yorkshire Water seems to achieve this without
going down the path of having a cross-subsidy. Can we mitigate the cost
by asking those groups to store water?</div>
<a name="10012160000032"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012160000138"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> On that point, I have discussed the matter
with Scouts, churches and other organisations, and they are powerfully
behind such an amendment. Indeed, the Bill will not only encourage but
incentivise the uptake of SuDS, regardless of the concessionary schemes
for which the clause provides. The hon. Lady is right to say that will
act as an incentive in the drive towards more sustainable
systems.</div>
<a name="10012160000033"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012160000139"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> I am absolutely delighted. The Energy Saving
Trust gave evidence to the Select Committee, and there is a huge amount
of work going on. I am delighted to have won a concession, but there is
a slightly difficult situation with the water companies, and we would
welcome any guidance that the Minister can give us on amendments 39 and
40.</div><a name="10012160000034"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012160000140"></a>Nia
Griffith:</b> Different circumstances pertain in different
part of the country. Scout and Guide groups in Wales that are supplied
by Welsh Water have not yet had these bills landing on their doorsteps.
I seek an assurance that companies will not be pushed into
unnecessarily inventing or making charges, but that if they decide go
down that route, we will have appropriate mechanisms to protect such
community groups and to ensure that they are not unfairly
charged.</div>
<a name="10012160000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">If we have
too prescriptive a list, valuable organisations could be missed. The
danger is that they might be offended that some were included but not
others. I would prefer it if we could stick to generalities, which
guaranteed that affected groups would be subject to the strictures of
the clause, whether or not they had yet been involved.</div>
<a name="10012160000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">While we are
on the subject of fairness, and trying ensure that we do not unduly
penalise anyone, will the Minister tell us what progress he has made on
other forms of social tariff? I ask in case we do not have the chance
to debate the relevant new
clauses.</div><a name="10012160000037"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012160000141"></a>Mr.
Drew:</b> I am delighted to speak to amendment 162,
which deals with the third part of the arrangements that voluntary
bodies have asked us to provide. It follows directly from what was said
by the hon. Member for Vale of
York.</div><a name="10012160000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
pay tribute to my hon. Friend the Minister; he must have met more
Scouts than the leader of the scouting movement. We know more about his
woggle and the colour of his neckerchief than some would
like.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column401" />Column number: 401</div><a name="10012160000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">Charging is
still something of a running sore for the organisations, which ran a
major campaign, but it was not helped by one water company, United
Utilities. With amendment 162 we seek to clarify exactly what the
Government intend for the water companies as we move towards site
charging. The Government have been very clear and want to rule out
unaffordable increases in the water bills of those organisations.
However, they have not quite said what unaffordable is. We need clarity
on what is meant by that. As my hon. Friend the Member for Llanelli
rightly says, some companies did not rush towards site charging. Other
water companies such as my own, Severn Trent Water, were very fair and
were willing to look at percentage discounts, which is the model I
would prefer us to follow. However, United Utilities, almost gleefully,
wanted to maximise the impact on charities and voluntary organisations
by moving towards site charging.</div>
<a name="10012160000040"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012160000142"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> I congratulate the hon. Gentleman both on
tabling the amendment and on moving it in such a courteous manner. How
prescriptive should the guidance be, bearing in mind the changes across
the various water
companies?</div><a name="10012160000041"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012160000143"></a>Mr.
Drew:</b> I heard what my hon. Friend the Member for Llanelli
said and I would make the guidance quite prescriptive because we have
seen the problems when water companies are allowed to indiscriminately
make the rules up as they go along. It may be that it is not
appropriate for us to do it in Committee, but by Report the Government
should bring out a clear code of practice that lays down the
methodology they believe should be put in place to deal with the issue
of affordability, and rule out any form of unaffordability in terms of
the social tariff that those groups should
pay.</div><a name="10012160000042"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10012160000144"></a><b class="B">Angela
Watkinson</b> (Upminster) (Con): In support of the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s amendment, as an ambassador for guiding, which is
one of the listed organisations, I know that a lot of community
organisations do not have any income. They operate on a break-even
principle if they are lucky. If water companies examine their income,
it will be a very difficult way of establishing any charge at
all.</div>
<a name="10012160000043"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012160000145"></a>Mr.
Drew:</b> Of course that is the case and that is why we need a
clear template to ensure some consistency and that there are fair water
companies who are not trying to usurp their authority.</div>
<a name="10012160000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clearly, the
organisation that should be overseeing the process is Ofwat. Yet again
there is no clarity in Ofwat&#146;s role. It would be very useful for
the Minister to say that if we have the template in place, Ofwat should
be the arbiter of how it is applied. It should have a very clear
responsibility to ensure that we do not go through another situation
such as the one we went through last year.</div>
<a name="10012160000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">Being very
parochial, I am hopeful that the Severn Trent Water approach is the way
we proceed with percentage discounts. That is subject to discussion
and, dare I say, argument, but we need to ensure that Ofwat is the
appropriate organisation to oversee what is happening, so that it is
fair and reasonable and not subject to the sort of things we
saw before, and subject to the changes.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column402" />Column number: 402</div><a name="10012160000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am very happy for us to move towards more innovative thinking in that
regard. I never believed, in all the debates and lobbies that have
taken place, that organisations in the third sector should just carry
on as they are. Clearly, many of the organisations have a site area, so
they could look at ground water harvesting. However, to do that, they
have to have the means. If we are talking about a scheme, I am happy
for us to have some flexibility so that we could move towards different
forms of water management, but there has to be investment in the
operation of those schemes.</div>
<a name="10012160000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have given
the Minister a lot to answer, but it is an important issue and
Parliament in general and the Government in particular took a lot of
flak on it. I am glad that we have listened and I am glad we responded,
but let us actually nail down now how the water companies should be
asked to respond, what role there is for Ofwat, how we could move to
new forms of water drainage, and how it is to be
funded.</div>
<a name="10012160000048"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012160000146"></a>Dr.
Blackman-Woods:</b> I congratulate the hon. Member for Vale of
York on introducing these probing amendments&#151;they are very
helpful. My hon. Friend the Member for Llanelli is very fortunate if
community and Scout groups in her constituency have not yet received
higher bills. I am afraid that situation does not pertain in Durham. I
am pleased that the Minister has listened to the many representations
made by the voluntary community, MPs and so on, and that he has brought
forward the clause. Nevertheless, a number of water companies would
like some guidance about how to operate the provision effectively,
particularly on how they could do so in a fair and consistent manner. I
am keen to hear my hon. Friend&#146;s comments on
that.</div><a name="10012160000049"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012160000147"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> This is my first opportunity to say what a
pleasure it is to serve under your chairmanship this afternoon, Lady
Winterton. It is a shame that it is only for one sitting, but we seem
to be making efforts to prolong the pleasure, so that is fine. I am
pleased that the clause has been included in the Bill, but it is
unfortunate that, as the hon. Member for Vale of York rightly said,
although area-based charging has been successfully introduced in many
areas with enough sensitivity to avoid many of the problems, poor
implementation in just one area has threatened community groups,
churches and others with wholly unfair and unreasonable charges. The
measure raises issues regarding the proactive role of Ofwat in relation
to such matters, but that is something we might return to shortly when
considering other
amendments.</div><a name="10012160000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
certainly welcome the fact that the clause puts beyond doubt the
unacceptability of the practices that have been mentioned. We welcome
all three amendments, because they would put the matter even further
beyond doubt. That would be helpful. The second reason why I welcome
the clause is that it sets a rather important precedent in terms of
timing. It is a proposal for a concessionary charging scheme, and it
clearly demonstrates the Government&#146;s ability to legislate at
short notice, when necessary, on what might be called socially
responsible charging or tariffs. If that can be done for the Scouts and
for churches, it should be done for some of our least well-off citizens
as well. If, for any reason, we do not actually reach the debate on new
clause 1 this afternoon, I put on the record my desire to return to the
broader issue of social tariffs on Third
Reading.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column403" />Column number: 403</div><a name="10012160000051"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012160000148"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> I am extremely grateful for this
opportunity to respond. There is clear support in the Committee for the
thrust of the clause. I will turn to the amendments in a moment. Hon.
Members will be pleased to know that I will not go through the history
of the matter, and I will not try to attribute praise either. I am glad
that all parties have coalesced around the measure.</div>
<a name="10012160000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">I had some
interesting meetings in my office with Mr. Brian Moore of
England rugby fame and Mr. Mike Gatting. Those meetings were
lively and punchy&#151;although there was no physical
violence&#151;but also productive. Probably the most attended and
populated meeting that we members of the Committee and many other MPs
have ever had was the one that the Scouts organised in Portcullis
House.</div><a name="10012160000130"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3.30
pm</div><a name="10012160000053"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012160000149"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> On that point, the hon. Member for Colchester
(Bob Russell), who is, of course, a member of the Chairmen&#146;s
Panel, will be hugely disappointed if we do not congratulate the
Minister on convening that
meeting.</div><a name="10012160000054"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012160000150"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> The simple fact is, for all the
denigration of Parliament, an incident such as that shows that we do
respond and listen. I take no credit for that.</div>
<a name="10012160000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">Many of the
points have already been made, so let me give a short history of the
subject. Four companies introduced the schemes and, by and large, in
three areas at least, those schemes had been progressing well. We
always felt, curiously, that we had the structure to make the schemes
work. However, I made it clear that if that could not be done and it
was necessary to fix the problem legislatively, I would do so. So here
we are today. That shows that this place can sometimes do the right
thing.</div><a name="10012160000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
thank my hon. Friend the Member for Stroud and other hon. Members for
tabling the amendments and for speaking in support of them. Amendment
39 would require, rather than allow, water and sewerage companies to
set concessionary surface water drainage charges. Amendment 40 would
place certain community groups in the Bill. Amendment 162 would require
the Secretary of State and Welsh Ministers to say in guidance what
constitutes a fair and affordable surface water drainage
charge.</div><a name="10012160000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
refer Committee members to the copy of the draft guidance to water and
sewerage undertakers. This is an exclusive sneak preview for Committee
members because it is not yet in the public domain. The draft guidance
deals with the issues that they have raised. It elaborates on, and
lists, the types of groups that should and should not be
included.</div><a name="10012160000058"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012160000151"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> We are not short of papers, but I wonder if I
have missed something, because I do not think that I have seen the
draft guidance. That is very remiss of
me.</div><a name="10012160000059"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012160000152"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> I apologise for the fact that the hon.
Lady has not seen the guidance. I have just sought clarification. The
hard copy was sent on the first day of the Committee. I will ensure
that she and other hon. Members receive a copy if they do not have one.
It has also been sent by e-mail.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column404" />Column number: 404</div><a name="10012160000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have done a
lot of work. Who should and should not be included in the guidance is
laid out copiously. I reassure my hon. Friend the Member for Stroud
that there is an indication of the type of charge, but the charge is
not specified because the document must be future-proof. It goes into
detail about the type of consultation that is necessary to bring
forward any charging
scheme.</div><a name="10012160000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">When
we met the Scouts, the Churches, community associations, the Central
Council of Physical Recreation and others, it was interesting that they
did not want individual householders to be disadvantaged as a result of
the concessionary scheme, and did not want disproportionate bills to
impact on others. They understood that it will be the responsibility of
the water company, the regulator and the consumer bodies to sit down,
talk the matter through and come up with a scheme that is appropriate
for the area. A church should not suddenly find that it is saved from
excessive bills, only for the parishioners to go to their parish priest
or minister and say, &#147;Thanks very much, my bill has gone through
the roof.&#148; We need to get the matter absolutely
right.</div><a name="10012160000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
know that hon. Members will look at the guidance, and I would be
grateful to hear, perhaps on Report, whether they think it is right or
whether it needs tweaking. The spirit of the guidance is to say to
water companies, consumer representative groups, voluntary sector
groups and so on that if a company has a proposal that provides the
incentive to develop surface water drainage schemes, they need to sit
down and talk through the implications. The hon. Member for Vale of
York should not have representatives of businesses in her constituency
walking through the door saying, &#147;Thanks for nothing. You have
saved others, but you&#146;ve just skinned us alive.&#148; We
therefore have to get the matter absolutely right. Rather than
prescribing a set amount and fixing it for ever and a day, we are
instead fixing for ever and a day the idea that if a company brings
forward one of those schemes, it has to consult, get it right and
balance the equation, as regards different
groups.</div><a name="10012160000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">Turning
to the principle, I applaud the idea behind the campaign; that is why
we brought the guidance forward. As the hon. Lady said, many voluntary
groups and others live from hand to mouth. Money comes in, and it goes
out. They spend what they need to spend to bring children in, to enable
them to do activities, or to take them camping, and then it is gone.
The church raises enough money to keep the roof on&#151;it does not
do it for other reasons&#151;and so on. So the principle is
absolutely right, and I think that we have met it with the combination
of the guidance and what is in the
clause.</div><a name="10012160000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Secretary of State and Welsh Ministers will issue guidance to
undertakers that will cover the need for concessionary schemes from
which community groups should benefit, and set an affordable charge. It
will be very much in line with what is in the amendments. Undertakers
are required to have regard to the guidance. I have made the Secretary
of State&#146;s draft guidance available, and if anyone has not
received a copy, we will send it to them
again.</div><a name="10012160000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
will expect all companies that move, or have moved, to a site area that
charges for surface water drainage to assess whether a concessionary
scheme is necessary for community groups, and to ensure that such
groups do not face unaffordable charges. I hope that the draft guidance
makes that clear.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column405" />Column number: 405</div><a name="10012160000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">The draft
guidance has not been out for consultation. It has gone only to
Committee members, but we would put it out rapidly, subject to the Bill
getting Royal Assent, which I hope it will, with the will of the House
and the other place. As soon as that happens, we can get the guidance
out for
consultation.</div><a name="10012160000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph
3.1 on the need for a concessionary scheme states
that:</div><a name="10012160000124"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Government is clear that they do not want to see community groups
facing unaffordable increases in their water bills as a result of site
area charging for surface water drainage. We expect undertakers to
ensure that this is the case and Ofwat will ensure that undertakers
have had regard to this guidance in its approval of individual charge
schemes.&#148;</div><a name="10012160000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I have said, we must not forget that other customers will be
subsidising the concessionary schemes for community groups, to a lesser
or greater extent, so the profile of each company&#146;s customer
base will differ markedly. I have seen some of the differences, and
they are quite
stark.</div><a name="10012160000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
guidance will also make it clear that we expect companies to undertake
impact assessments and consultation, not only with community groups but
with their wider customer base and the Consumer Council for Water,
before implementation of concessionary schemes. Our approach will give
companies the flexibility to reflect local circumstances&#151;that is
right and proper&#151;and local needs, and it will ensure that
schemes are fair for all
customers.</div><a name="10012160000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am happy to reveal some of the elements in the draft guidance, and I
know that Members will look at it as well. Paragraph 4.2 of the draft
guidance states that, as a minimum, we would expect to see the groups
that the hon. Member for Vale of York has identified in amendment 40
included in concessionary schemes. However, we do not want to include
those groups in the Bill because it would mean that any changes
necessary in the future could be made only by revising primary
legislation.</div><a name="10012160000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
addition, if we specified eligible groups in the Bill, it would have to
be absolutely clear in legal terms who the members of each class were,
and that is not simple. We have been through this before&#151;the
issue of trying to identify specific community groups&#151;in
previous legislation. It can be done, but it is notoriously difficult.
Any legal ambiguity would lead to poor legislation and would risk the
clause becoming the subject of litigation to establish the scope of the
classes.</div><a name="10012160000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
accept that the hon. Lady&#146;s amendment refers to community groups
that should be included in a concessionary scheme &#147;as a
minimum&#148;, but there is a real risk that specifying any community
groups in the Bill will open the floodgates for further amendments to
include additional cases from additional groups in the primary
legislation&#151;believe me, I have been through this already. Let us
deal with that in secondary legislation and in the guidance, and let us
get the guidance absolutely
clear.</div><a name="10012160000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">Concessionary
schemes could include charities, but are we then talking about
charities&#146; headquarters, or their shops, which compete with
retailers on the high street? It could include schools, but are we then
talking about private schools, public schools or every school? It could
include hospitals, and so on. For all those reasons, I am firmly of the
view that we do not want to specify the groups in the Bill. We need to
work together on the guidance, and get that absolutely
right.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012160000153"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> The Minister may be making a bit of a meal of
this. Having worked in a number of charity headquarters and visited
many charity shops, I do not think that many of them would have much of
a problem with area-based
charging.</div><a name="10012160000075"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012160000154"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b><b class="B"> </b>Let us get it right in the
guidance, because we have the future-proofing and flexibility there to
do
so.</div><a name="10012160000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Vale of York mentioned schools and hospitals. We
acknowledge that one scheme currently in place includes local schools
and hospitals to some extent. We have said in the guidance that schools
and hospitals should not be included in perpetuity. They are big
organisations and involve big surface water areas, but if we were to
move, particularly where a scheme might include them already, there
would be a transition from where we are now to where we need to go. To
pick up on the point that the hon. Lady made, we are trying to
incentivise a change to using well-managed surface water otherwise,
rather than putting it straight down the plughole and into the drains.
However, we must do that over time, and the guidance, again, explains
how that might
work.</div><a name="10012160000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
affordable charges, Severn Trent, in the constituency of my hon. Friend
the Member for Stroud, runs a concessionary scheme that has come in for
plaudits. It has worked well. Under the scheme, organisations that
benefit from the concession tend to pay about &#163;100. It varies
slightly, but that is the average.</div>
<a name="10012160000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, as I
said, I do not want to stipulate a charge in the Bill or elsewhere,
because it will change over time. We need to set the criteria, and then
companies need to go out and talk to people about what they are going
to implement so they can decide which band to place organisations in,
based on impact assessments and consultations. As I said, I have issued
draft guidance to the Committee, and Ministers in Wales will issue
guidance as appropriate.</div>
<a name="10012160000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">Turning
briefly to amendment 162, I assure my hon. Friend that the
Government&#146;s guidance will include a section on an affordable
charge.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012160000156"></a>Huw

that we might have during debate on a subsequent amendment, time
allowing, but I note the fact that four hon. Members have now raised
that point and the wider issue of social tariffs and affordability for
individuals and home owners as well as community groups. I hope that we
get to debate that amendment, because I hear what hon. Members have
said and have been lobbied a fair bit on the issue of social tariffs as
well as on Scouts, voluntary groups and community associations. I note
the comments that have been

Government amendment
164.</div><a name="10012160000089"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012160000160"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> I am pleased that we are making such good
progress. Our amendment is fairly straightforward. Its specific purpose
is to require the Government to implement the provisions covering
surface water charging within three months of the Bill becoming law.
Following last summer&#146;s flooding, we have made progress and it
is timely to introduce those provisions. That was a new form of
flooding, and surface water charging is
pertinent.</div><a name="10012160000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">Water
companies have already planned their charging schemes for next year in
the expectation that surface water charging will not be in place, but
if implementation is delayed beyond the summer, companies&#146;
ability to plan the following year&#146;s charging schemes will be
impeded. We would welcome certainty from the Minister about when the
changes will take place, and that would be welcome to the companies
concerned.</div><a name="10012160000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment would also have an impact on customers, who have already had
a long wait for a solution. The Government could have acted before last
summer, but chose to wait for the Bill. I am sure that customers would
also welcome clarity about when they may expect their bills to be
reduced.</div><a name="10012160000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is the purport of amendment 41, and I have great pleasure in inviting
the Committee to support it in the spirit in which it was
moved.</div><a name="10012160000093"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012160000161"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> I appreciate the spirit in which amendment
41 was moved. It would automatically bring clause 42 into effect if the
Secretary of State or Welsh Ministers do not commence the new provision
within three months of Royal Assent. I recognise the need for early
commencement of clause 42, but it would still be too late to use it to
introduce concessions for the next charging year of 2010-11 even if
Royal Assent were obtained within the next month.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column408" />Column number: 408</div><a name="10012160000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
charging year for water bills is from April to March, and bills for
unmeasured customers are sent out even before that. That follows the
granting of Ofwat approval of charging schemes that require companies
to prepare them by September each year and on which there is
consultation with the Consumer Council for Water. Final approval of
charging schemes is usually obtained in February, before the bills are
sent
out.</div><a name="10012160000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment would not cause a problem in Wales, although one of the four
English water and sewerage companies, Severn Trent Water, supplies many
customers in Wales. It would also not cause a problem for companies
that do not intend to move to site area charging. However, the four
companies that already charge in that way would either have to work out
a hasty timetable with Ofwat to introduce new schemes by April 2010, or
carry out an expensive bill-adjustment exercise to meet the timetable
proposed in the
amendment.</div><a name="10012160000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
intend to consult on the draft guidance that has gone out to the
Committee when the Bill has completed its parliamentary stages, and to
commence the relevant part of the provision in plenty of time for water
companies that want to move to area-based charges and/or introduce
concessionary schemes for the 2011-12 financial year to develop their
schemes. Given that clarification of why it is nigh on impossible to
achieve the objective in the amendment, I hope that the hon. Lady will
withdraw
it.</div><a name="10012160000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">Government
amendment 164 is a technical amendment to ensure that the power to
commence provisions in the Bill is consistent with devolution
arrangements. The general position is that the Secretary of State has
power to commence provisions in relation to England, and Welsh
Ministers in relation to Wales. This is provided for in clause 46(3)(b)
and (c). Exceptions are set out in clause 46(3)(a), (d) and (e). This
amendment sets out further exceptions to that general position, which
have been agreed with the Welsh Assembly Government and were deemed
necessary properly to reflect the basis on which the clause, to which
the commencement provision relates, is devolved. So it is a technical
issue.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012160000164"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I certainly welcome new clause 29, about which I
hope we will hear a little more. Bad debt is an issue that definitely
needs to be tackled, but this new clause is another example of welcome
flexibility from the Government, in that they extracted a
recommendation from the Walker report and placed it in the Bill in
quite short order.</div>
<a name="10012160000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clauses
1, 2 and 3 all relate to the responsibilities of Ofwat. It looks as if
we will have enough time to address them but if that is not the case I
would certainly want to return to them on Report. Ofwat was created in
the era of rampant privatisation. As with other regulators that were
established at the time, it was supposed to offer some protection to
the interests of consumers from the jungle of capitalism red in tooth
and claw. As was rather typical of those days, the interests conceived
were imagined to be purely economic, and issues such as fairness,
environmental responsibility and sustainability were not really on the
agenda. Uniquely among regulators, Ofwat seems to have preserved those
rather impoverished values in aspic. Ofcom and Ofgem, among others,
seem to have managed within their regimes to incorporate social tariffs
and other forms of socially responsible tariff. In the case of Ofgem,
there is such a plethora of social tariffs in the energy industry that
we have colleagues in another Committee Room trying to rationalise the
scheme.</div><a name="10012160000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">Ofwat
has argued that because of its remit, it cannot do the same thing. As
became clear in our evidence sessions immediately before we began full
consideration of the Bill in Committee, there is now growing consensus
that the matter needs legislation to sort it out. Further legislation
may be some time coming, and I understand that the Minister&#146;s
ideal is that the whole of the Walker report be properly consulted on
and that legislation be then introduced. However, one water management
Bill has taken some years to introduce and we may have to wait some
time for another, so the time to act is now.</div>
<a name="10012160000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">On social
tariffs in new clause 1, the need is particularly clear. The Consumer
Council for Water points out that water and sewerage bills have risen
faster than inflation for the past four years running. In 2008-09, they
increased by about 6 per cent. Overall, since privatisation water bills
are some 44 per cent. higher in real terms. It is expected that this
year, 12 per cent. of customers will face water and sewerage bills that
are more than 3 per cent. of their disposable income. In the
south-west, where there is an unfortunate combination of relatively low
incomes and very high water bills, some 30 per cent. of customers could
well be in that position. Only some 24,000 customers nationwide are on
the rather limited WaterSure scheme, and the Minister&#146;s
Department estimates that as many as 300,000 households should really
be eligible for it. Clearly, the scheme is not working to full
effect.</div><a name="10012160000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Consumer Council for Water has worked to rebrand the scheme and has
introduced a standard simplified application form, which substantially
boosted uptake of the scheme in 2007-08, but it is still a small
fraction of the people in
need.</div><a name="10012160000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Walker report is equally clear in its analysis of the problem and its
conclusions. Paragraph 11.2.2
states:</div><a name="10012160000125"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Evidence
received showed that there are customers in all company areas who find
it difficult to pay their water charges. The review team also received
evidence showing that affordability 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column412" />Column number: 412</div>issues are particularly acute where overall income levels are low and
where average water bills are
high.&#148;</div><a name="10012160000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
review paid particular attention to the interaction between the issues
of affordability and the introduction of water metering. Paragraph
11.2.4
states:</div><a name="10012160000126"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Research
has shown that where 90 per cent. of households are metered,
affordability is likely to worsen for low income single parents and low
income households with three or more children. Both now and during the
transition to metering, low income households with children are
therefore a further group that might need help with
affordability.&#148;</div><a name="10012160000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
report has identified a number of different groups: customers with low
incomes and high essential water use; customers with low incomes living
in a high-cost area; customers with low income and children;
and&#151;rather broadly&#151;customers with a low income
generally.</div><a name="10012160000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph
11.5.2
concluded:</div><a name="10012160000127"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
review team considers that there are certain adjustments that should be
made to the system
now&#148;&#151;</div><a name="10012160000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
emphasise that
point&#151;</div><a name="10012160000128"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;aimed
at helping customers who are struggling to pay their current water
bills. These changes should continue into the future anticipating much
higher levels of metering.&#148;</div>
<a name="10012160000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">The review
team concluded that the rateable value system of cross-subsidy for
low-income customers is poorly targeted and is unwinding as metering
develops, and that a package of affordability measures is needed for
those on low
incomes.</div><a name="10012160000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
were various proposals in the Walker report and there are different
perspectives on them. Clearly, some consultation is required, but what
is needed urgently in the Bill is something that permits that. The
situation for water companies is quite ridiculous: a number have had to
try to find ways of reinventing social tariff proposals in order to get
them past
Ofwat.</div><a name="10012173000125"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4
pm</div><a name="10012173000005"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some
of the companies are taking a very responsible attitude. I shall quote
the example of Thames Water, which contacted me recently. It stated
that</div><a name="10012173000117"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;by
2015 seven per cent of Thames Water customers, around 360,000
households, would be paying more than three percent of disposable
income, with 140,000 of these paying more than five percent of
disposable
income.</div><a name="10012173000118"></a><div class="hs_brev">The
social tariff proposal that Thames Water made in its business plan
focused on customers with the greatest affordability impact. We
proposed a two tier tariff giving a 50% discount to the one percent of
households paying the biggest proportion of income, and a 25% discount
to the next four percent of households paying the next highest
proportion of income. We tested our proposals through deliberative and
quantitative customer research and found that Thames Water customers
were supportive of the need for a social tariff and were willing to pay
for this, as long as the cost remained relatively low. Our proposals
were costed at less than &#163;1 a year in terms of a cross-subsidy
from all other customers to those receiving the discounted bills and
were supported by customers at this level.</div>
<a name="10012173000119"></a><div class="hs_brev">Our modelling
showed that our proposed tariff was particularly effective in reducing
the number of customers paying more than 5% of disposable
income.&#148;</div>
<a name="10012173000006"></a><div class="hs_Para">That number would drop
from nearly 3 per cent. of their customers to less than 0.5 per cent.
by 2014-15, so it would have a significant impact. The Bill needs to be
amended now to make that clear, as Water UK clearly argued in the
evidence session. I commend the new clause to the Committee.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column413" />Column number: 413</div><a name="10012173000007"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have been
encouraged in the past few weeks by some of the Minister&#146;s
remarks about his being open to the idea of social tariffs being
included in the Bill. I made a few jibes about Thatcherite conservatism
in my opening remarks, but I know that the Conservative party has now
entered a more liberal and progressive phase, and the right hon. Member
for Witney (Mr. Cameron) has now declared that there is such
a thing as society, so I am sure that I can count on Conservative
support for what is certainly a progressive and liberal
amendment.</div>
<a name="10012173000008"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause 2
deals with a slightly different matter. It would explicitly permit
another departure from Ofwat&#146;s purely market-driven framework.
The objective is simple: to de-link water use from profit, shifting us
from a world of complex water efficiency goals, which are difficult to
implement and monitor in practice, to one in which increasing water
usage will simply cost companies money and damage shareholder value,
thereby unleashing the genius of British business to drive water
efficiency forward. It is the same philosophy as that seen in carbon
markets. The market framework will be set in such a way that water
companies will want to do that as a matter of their core business. That
is the best way to proceed, rather than the Government trying to invent
ways to make those environmental
improvements.</div><a name="10012173000009"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
method I propose in the new clause is simple. Every household will be
given time to establish an historical level of usage, which will of
course reflect considerations such as the number of children or any
medical conditions. If usage decreases, the situation is
straightforward, as the household&#146;s bills will decrease and,
indeed, the profit of the water company might decrease a little,
depending on the exact nature of the tariff. The interesting aspect of
the new clause is that it prescribes that where usage increases, the
customers&#146; bills will increase, but the profit taken by the
water companies will remain static, at the historical level of usage.
The surplus generated will then be earmarked for additional
environmental
measures.</div><a name="10012173000010"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
software required to make that sort of amendment to billing would be
relatively easy to set up. It is a simple idea, and equally applicable
to the energy sector. I have discussed it with both water and energy
companies and have yet to meet one that objects to it. It is a simple
and straightforward idea that would release market pressures
to drive water efficiency. I commend it to the
Committee.</div><a name="10012173000011"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clause 3 is the simplest and most obvious of the three. Ofwat is still
driven by the vision of people as customers, with no real regard to
their wider interests as human beings within a wider natural
environment. That has led to some strange concepts in the past.
Although it has now retreated from using the term, which has fallen
into disuse, for a long time they talked about the &#147;economic
level of leakage&#148;, as if there were no reason to reduce the
enormous levels of leakage in some water company areas except reasons
of profit and the sustainability of the business, and as if there were
no reason to work to reduce leakage at an absolute level. Given the
critical challenges of climate change and the need for security of
water supply as climate change progresses and we have to adapt to it,
it is critical that Ofwat&#146;s rather 20th century neocon remit is
now fundamentally changed to take account of the new world in which we
live.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column414" />Column number: 414</div><a name="10012173000012"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause
3(2)(iii) specifically mentions the other important environmental
issues of biodiversity and flood risk, which neatly connects the new
clause to the rest of the Bill. After all our discussions over the past
weeks, the inclusion of that alone would justify the
amendment.</div><a name="10012173000013"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
commend all three new clauses to the
Committee.</div><a name="10012173000014"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012173000133"></a>Mr.
Drew:</b> I support the hon. Gentleman&#146;s principles
from a number of perspectives. First, it would be strange if, having
spent some time considering how we can deal with social tariffs for
communities, we ignored individuals. My starting point is that we have
to identify that as a problem.</div>
<a name="10012173000015"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, I
have always worried about those who face water bills and about how to
disaggregate those who cannot pay and those who will not pay. It is a
fairly open secret that there are people who use the
Government&#146;s policy, which is right, to persuade water companies
to use every means possible to avoid withdrawing water supplies from a
individual household. Sadly, however, there are some individuals who
abuse that and blatantly refuse to pay their water bills. We need to
look at a different way of assessing that. The social tariff for
individuals is a sensible way to go
forward.</div><a name="10012173000016"></a><div class="hs_Para">Thirdly&#151;I
shall be careful how I say this&#151;on the prompting of my hon.
Friend the Member for Carlisle (Mr. Martlew), who has
chaired some of these proceedings, we should look at what happens where
those on water meters are subject to a flooding incident. There has
been correspondence on that matter between my hon. Friend and the
Secretary of State. There is a need to recognise that, as more people
go on to water meters, if there is an incident that could result in
people with water meters having to pay substantially more because of
the way in which those meters are affected by problems of
flooding&#151;like anything else&#151;we must ensure that they are
not penalised in any way. I should be grateful if my hon. Friend
mentioned something about
that.</div><a name="10012173000017"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
a fundamental principle, we must have a social tariff and a way to
charge people who find it difficult to pay their water bills
appropriately, with cross-subsidisation. Let us be honest about this.
We have heard about the figure of less than &#163;1. That is the
killer fact. We are not talking about major redistribution between
customers, but about those of us who can afford to pay helping those
who cannot. Let us crack down on those who will not pay for reasons
that we all know about. When they talk to us, all water companies say
that that has to be dealt
with.</div><a name="10012173000018"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012173000134"></a>Nia
Griffith:</b> The timing is critical, because we were keen for
the Bill to go through as soon as possible and we did not want to delay
it for any reason. Those of us who followed the progress of the Walker
report know that this is a complex subject into which considerable work
has gone. We know about genuine cases where there seems to be a
considerable mismatch between household income and the charges that are
being faced, but we find that there are no ways round that, as there
are with other things, such as by using housing benefit or some of the
existing fuel poverty schemes. We have seen it with our own
eyes.</div><a name="10012173000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
seems fortuitous that we now have the publication of that report and we
are in a position to take the recommendations and make something of
them within the context of the Bill. I would be sorry to see that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column415" />Column number: 415</div>opportunity missed, and I hope that the Minister will, even at this late
stage, find some way to include a social tariff to help those with the
greatest need. As hon. Members have mentioned, the charges to the rest
of us resulting from such a scheme would be minimal, if it was sensibly
prepared and targeted at the households that need help. I therefore
urge my hon. Friend to look carefully at how we can do that, while at
the same time not closing the door to any improved ways of doing it
that we may come to in the future.</div>
<a name="10012173000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a
lot of work to be done on the Walker report in looking carefully at how
measures might work in practice. An area of great concern for people in
the south-west and in Wales is that there is a disproportionate amount
of coastline compared with the number of subscribers. Therefore, as
European directives for cleaner and cleaner waters arrive, we will be
faced with more and more work to do.</div>
<a name="10012173000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a
much wider debate to be had about whether there is any rationale for
not leaving areas to look after themselves, and instead having a
national infrastructure involving cross-payment between areas to cope
with the fact that we have concentrations of population in some areas
and a sparse population with large responsibilities for coastline in
other areas. That is a wider debate and I do not want us to close the
door on future discussions about charging. However, I feel that the
social tariff idea should be included now that we have the
Walker report.</div>
<a name="10012173000022"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012173000135"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> We are straying into challenging areas, on which
there are various views. The Select Committee considered them in a
cursory way, and it is fair to say that they were in the draft Bill in
some shape or form. We took the decision over the summer and autumn
that we needed a Bill this side of a general election that would
implement the Pitt recommendations. Time has marched on since the
summer floods of 2007, and we have had the Cumbrian floods of autumn
2009. We believe that there are issues of concern about bad debt, water
affordability, water poverty, the concept of a social tariff and all
the issues in the Cave and Walker reviews.</div>
<a name="10012173000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">I like to
think that the Conservative record on this matter is positive. The
Conservatives came forward in the late &#146;80s with a White Paper
and proceeded to pass the Water Act 1989 that set the regime for the
water industry over the past 20 years. The time is now right for those
issues to receive further examination, as we stated in the autumn
around the time of the party conferences.</div>
<a name="10012173000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
incumbent on all parties to go away and discuss the contents of the
Cave review, the Walker review and the Environment Agency&#146;s
publications from last year, and take stock. Tempting as it is to have
a full discussion and debate on social tariffs, environmental tariffs,
the role of Ofwat and others, we are minded to support new clause 29.
It seems a nonsense and unacceptable that tenants, or as the Government
call them, &#147;non-owner occupiers&#148;&#151;I do not know why
we cannot call them tenants, perhaps that has a specific legal
meaning&#151;are able to walk away without paying their water rates.
The bad debt runs into millions every year and probably now costs the
water companies more than leakages. We would therefore like the
Committee to consider new clause
29.</div>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column416" />Column number: 416</div><a name="10012173000126"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.15
pm</div><a name="10012173000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have had discussions with Anna Walker, and believe that some detailed
work needs to be done on competition, metering and the other aspects.
Affordability is a particular concern to all customers, as the hon.
Member for Llanelli has said. There is the acute problem of how we
charge for implementing the EU directive, especially in an area such as
the south-west of England. Wales may be in a similar position, but I
think that the situation in the south-west is generally agreed to be
particularly difficult. I think that there is an Adjournment debate on
that issue on the Order Paper, to which I am sure the Minister will
find himself replying when many others have had the opportunity to
contribute.</div><a name="10012173000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have to grapple with some real issues, and we have concerns about
tariffs being fair, and about poverty, water efficiency, water
stress&#151;which we have not begun to discuss&#151;and the concept
of paying for water in an affordable and fair way. Rightly though, the
two main parties seem to agree that the debate has to take place in the
context of a wider Bill. There are controversial debates to be had, and
it would generally be welcome if the Minister took some of the ideas
away and worked on them, and perhaps discussed them further with both
the industry and other
parties.</div><a name="10012173000027"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012173000137"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> The issues are worthy of further debate, but we
are not inclined to support the hon. Gentleman&#146;s new clauses at
this
stage.</div><a name="10012173000029"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012173000138"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> I hope that with this group of new clauses
we can make some progress. I have heard what has been said, and many
Members have spoken about social tariffs, but first let me explain new
clause 29. Curiously, in the light of the broader discussion
that we have just had and of our previous discussion on the need to
protect community groups and associations, new clause 29 is here for a
similar reason, because we anticipate that there will be a broad
consensus, both out there among stakeholders and among us, that we need
to have the provision in the Bill. Rather than cherry-picking, these
are things that are not only essential but that we can do. They will
not delay the primary purpose of the Bill to implement Pitt&#146;s
recommendations. I give that as a backdrop to my comments for the
moment.</div><a name="10012173000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clause 29 seeks to tackle the problem of bad debt in the water
industry. That is a real problem, which has been picked up by many
commentators. The new clause was tabled following concerns raised on
Second Reading, and following the publication of Anna Walker&#146;s
excellent final report on charging for household water and sewerage
services.</div>
<a name="10012173000115"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent">Since
privatisation of the water industry, water and sewerage bills have
increased significantly above the rate of inflation, by about 40 per
cent. in real terms, but on the flip side they have also funded
&#163;85 billion of investment in the sector. That has led, however,
to an increasing number of customers falling into arrears or struggling
to pay their water bills. I can see a bit of an argument developing
about that. At the same time, we have seen a disproportionate increase
in bad debt in the water industry, three times that in the energy
sector, despite average 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column417" />Column number: 417</div>water bills costing only a third of average energy bills, at a cost of
&#163;12 per year to other bill-paying customers. In addition, since
the ban on disconnection in 2000&#151;which was quite
right&#151;companies have started to be required to supply domestic
properties with water, and therefore residents do not need to supply
companies with contact details to secure a water
supply.</div>
<a name="10012173000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under current
legislation, occupiers of properties are liable for water bills, but
companies must rely upon them for the information needed for billing.
Without customers&#146; details, water companies are unable to pursue
residents of a property for payment, or to pursue them for payments
once they have&#151;pardon my French&#151;buggered off. The water
industry estimates that leaver debt accounts for approximately 44 per
cent. of that debt. <i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> I am not sure
that was French, but my Dad told me that it was, Lady
Winterton.</div><a name="10012173000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clause 29 would require owners of residential rental properties to
arrange for the provision to water and sewerage companies of prescribed
details of the occupier of a property. Under the legislation, the
occupier of a property remains the person liable for payment of water
bills unless details of the occupier are not provided to the water and
sewerage company within a set time scale, which will be set out in
legislation. It has been a welcome amendment, which was worked on in
consultation with the water industry, consumer organisations and
others. It helps to fix the problem of bad
debt.</div><a name="10012173000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clauses 1, 2 and 3 were tabled by the hon. Member for Cheltenham and
there has been much debate about them. They relate to the water
industry paying for water and to economic regulation. Those issues have
been considered in Anna Walker&#146;s independent review and we have
already made it clear that we are fully committed&#151;the hon.
Member for Vale of York has said that is the Conservative position as
well&#151;to consult on the recommendations and carefully consider
them before introducing proposals on
them.</div><a name="10012173000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clause 1 would require Ministers to bring forward regulations to
introduce one or more social tariffs to assist customers who were in
water poverty. Its intended effect is to reduce the bills of customers
who spend more than a particular percentage of their income on water
and sewerage. I assure the Committee that we take the issue of water
affordability seriously, which is why we set up the Walker review to
take it out of Government and look at it properly. Section 143A of the
Water Industry Act empowers Ministers to make regulations to assist
water customers with their bills. Assistance can be provided according
to, inter alia, age, ill health or disability, or in relation to
financial
circumstances.</div><a name="10012173000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have made use of that power through the Water Industry (Charges)
(Vulnerable Groups) Regulations 1999, which cap water and
sewerage bills for households that are metered and receiving a
means-tested benefit, and where there is either someone with a
prescribed medical condition that causes a huge increase in the use of
water, or three or more dependent children under the age of 19. Many
members of the Committee will know of schemes such as the WaterSure
tariff, which provides tangible assistance to vulnerable, low-income
metered households and avoids any risk that they might cut back on
their essential use of water. That does not, however, extend to all
low-income households.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column418" />Column number: 418</div><a name="10012173000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">Anna Walker
looked at whether water spend as a percentage of income should be used
as a trigger for assistance. In paragraph 8.1.4 of her interim report,
she concluded
that</div><a name="10012173000120"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;while
water spend expressed as a percentage of income might be a useful
indicator of the relationship between customer bills and incomes over
time, it is not suitable to be used as a trigger for
assistance.&#148;</div>
<a name="10012173000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">The reasons given were
that any percentage figure would be set at an arbitrary level,
unrelated to actual water consumption or need, and would not facilitate
targeted
help.</div><a name="10012173000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">Anna
Walker&#146;s final report contained proposals for a new, more
closely and effectively targeted package of support for some low-income
customers. They included the possibility of offering all metered
customers of certain means-tested benefits a 20 per cent. discount on
their bills, or a concessionary scheme for low-income households with
one or more
children.</div><a name="10012173000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
consistent view, which the hon. Member for Cheltenham and I have
debated on his previous amendments, has been that we need to consult on
Anna Walker&#146;s recommendations as a whole before taking decisions
on whether a social tariff is needed, or whether the vulnerable groups
tariff needs to be revised. That point was made by the CCW and Water UK
during the evidence sittings. Philip Mills of Water UK
said:</div><a name="10012173000121"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It
could be argued that introducing social tariffs at this moment may be
premature, because it could pre-empt the recommendations, or any

am minded to give further consideration to social tariffs, but I need
to clarify something. Amending the Bill along the lines suggested will
not be easy for all the complex reasons in Anna&#146;s report. In the
short time available, we will need to work through some fairly complex
issues pretty rapidly, such as exactly what we think is needed and how
the provisions will work in practice.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012173000139"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> I support the Minister&#146;s line of
thinking. Any of us could have tabled amendments, but we made a policy
decision not to. I fear that this is a &#147;pick and mix&#148;
approach and there is also a danger of that with new clause 29. We
should proceed with the Bill as it is and continue to work and consult
to form a view on other, more far-reaching
aspects.</div>

with risk management, it is critical that we take this

<a name="10012173000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me
outline my proposal for social tariffs. I do not want to derail the

down in endless amendments or lead to our facing accusations here or in
another place of cherry-picking. Other hon. Members or their lordships
could also choose to cherry-pick Anna Walker&#146;s review and we
would lose the Bill. I am willing to go away and look at social
tariffs, but only on condition that we rapidly put our heads together
on the back of the Committee and see if we have the good, effective
cross-party support that would allow us work through the
issues.</div>

responsible for meeting water charges. How is a tenant placed if they

it transpires that the owner of the property who does not live there
has not met the charges? To whom would the debt
attach?</div>

from my hon. Friend the Member for Llanelli and the hon. Member for

sympathetic. If we can establish a consensus on the back of our debate,
there may be something that we can do, but I am determined that we do
not either include something wrong in the<b class="B"> </b>Bill or mess it up by

<a name="10012173000116"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent">I will
also need to discuss the matter with my colleague, Jane Davidson, in
the Welsh Assembly Government&#151;they are key to the proposal. It
is worth pointing out that I have not discussed this at all with her.
That does not apply to new clause 29 on payment liability for water
bills, which was highlighted as a priority in the Walker review. I
suggest that I carefully consider whether a provision to enable water
companies to operate social tariffs should or could be included in the
Bill in the time scale to which we are working. I shall return to that
on Report, because I do not want to derail the Bill, but I do so with
that proviso and on the basis of our understanding as a Committee, and
as Front Benchers in Committee, first, that we want to get the issue
right and, secondly, that it will not lead to additional debate here or
in another
place.</div><a name="10012173000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
regulation, Ofwat&#146;s current duties already require it to

development duty includes climate change, and Ofwat already has a
dedicated team that leads on that. I am therefore clear that

a specific reference to climate change in primary legislation would
have the effect of distorting the weight that Ofwat currently gives to
the environmental, economic and social aspects of sustainable
development. I believe that it is in the interests of Ofwat to follow a
balanced approach to sustainable development as it fulfils its role as
economic regulator. That said, the hon. Member for Cheltenham raised a
valid point about what the role and responsibilities of Ofwat should be
and whether they need to be
revised.</div><a name="10012173000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">When
the water industry was privatised, the role of the economic regulator
was, in essence, to ensure that companies fulfilled their functions and
to extract efficiencies. However, social and environmental issues such
as water affordability and climate change have become much more of an
issue in the 20 years since. Ofwat is going to undertake an evaluation
of its 2009 review of water price limits this year, and is beginning
work on its approach to price setting in future, which will include
having regard to the Government&#146;s social and environmental
guidance in its ongoing regulatory activity.</div>
<a name="10012173000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">A fundamental
review of Ofwat&#146;s role was recommended by the EFRA Committee in
its 2009 inquiry into PR09. My view is that a review of Ofwat in some
form would indeed be justified, because time has gone by. I shall
consider how best to take that forward, but it will need to look not
just at climate change but at social, environmental and economic
situations across the
board.</div><a name="10012173000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have given a commitment to consider a review of Ofwat and to address
the issues raised by the hon. Member for Cheltenham, as well as wider
ones. Furthermore, we have given a commitment, with the provisos that I
mentioned, to consult on Anna Walker&#146;s recommendations and to
see whether we can bring something forward that would be fit for
purpose and would not constrain us. I hope, therefore, that the hon.
Gentleman will consider withdrawing his amendment. I look forward to
moving my own amendment
formally.</div><a name="10012173000057"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012173000143"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> That was one of the most positive responses by a
Minister that I remember hearing in Committee. I share his urgent
desire to see the Bill on the statute book before a general election
and not to derail the timetable. Given the generosity and considerable
work involved in his commitment, it is only reasonable for us to
respond in the spirit in which he has made the proposal. Knowing the
noble Lord Greaves, I cannot entirely bind my noble
Friends&#151;especially that one&#151;but, on behalf of myself and
my colleagues in this place, I certainly commit. I also commit to urge
my noble Friends in another place not to unpick or overly complicate
any proposal that should come forward.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012173000170"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> On a point of order, Lady Winterton. I
will not detain hon. Members too much longer, but I just want to say
that I always enjoy working in Committee. It is where a lot of the
detail is done. I have particularly enjoyed our proceedings because we
have genuinely improved the Bill, and will improve it further when we
bring it back at its subsequent stages. I wish to thank the hon.
Members for Vale of York and for Brecon and Radnorshire for their
constructive and positive engagement. Even though we have disagreed on
some areas, we all want the Bill to succeed and to be in the best
shape.</div><a name="10012173000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
also want to thank the business managers on both sides of the
Committee&#151;the hidden people, including my hon. Friend the Member
for Telford&#151;who make the machinery turn. I want to thank you,
Lady Winterton, and your colleagues, Mr. Chope and
Mr. Martlew, for your great help in achieving such progress.
I really want to thank all members of the Committee who have all
contributed to the Bill over the past few days of our deliberations,
and who will continue to do so to make sure that it is a prime piece of
work. They have shown a lot of passion because of their own
circumstances, insights from their constituencies and their expertise.
The Bill has been a good example of
proceedings&#151;<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> I cannot take
interventions on a point of
order.</div><a name="10012173000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
also thank the people not in the room, but who have been listening to
or watching our debates and who have lobbied for the Bill in all its
parts. We would not be here if it were not for the pressure that we
have had from our constituents throughout the United Kingdom. They will
continue to work with us. I wish also to thank briefly members of my
team, who are hidden away and who provide me with moments of great
inspiration. They do a tremendous amount of hard work. They have also
made themselves fully available to other hon. Members throughout the
course of the Bill to tease out questions and to answer questions
outside our proceedings. I thank the Clerks who have transcribed all my
difficult 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column423" />Column number: 423</div>Welsh pronunciations, as I do the Serjeant at Arms and the police who
have maintained order among us&#151;a disorderly rabble. We very much
look forward to the next stage and to seeing further progress. We wish
this vital Bill speedy progress through this place and, hopefully, into
another
place.</div><a name="10012173000105"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012173000171"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> Further to that point of order, Lady Winterton.
May I thank you, Mr. Chope and Mr. Martlew for
presiding over the proceedings in such a positive way? I should like to
congratulate the Minister on getting the Bill through in this form,
despite our best endeavours and to thank all members of the
Committee&#151;especially my colleagues, who have given me a lot of
support, which is much appreciated&#151;for the good spirit in which
the proceedings have been conducted.</div>
<a name="10012173000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should like
to echo the Minister&#146;s thanks to the business managers. I think
that we were almost short of time, so there is still a lot to debate. I
should like to thank the Clerk and his colleagues for all their
assistance in ensuring that we kept within time and good order. I
should like to thank the Doorkeepers, <i class="I">Hansard</i> and the police.
May we especially recognise the work of DEFRA officials in introducing
these proposals in very difficult circumstances, given the time
pressure that we were
under?</div><a name="10012173000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
think that this is the first Committee on which my hon. Friend the
Member for Norwich, North has served, so I hope that she has enjoyed
the proceedings. Like the Minister, I enjoy the cut and thrust of
Committee work. It rather saddens me that this will probably
be the last Committee on which I serve as the hon.
Member for Vale of York, as my much underwater constituency
will disappear at the
election&#151;<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption</i><i class="I">]</i><i class="I">&#151;</i>not
entirely underwater, despite acts of God and other such
issues. I am very sad to say that Vale of York will disappear at the
next election. The fact that we have had so many episodes
and experiences with water has given me a certain insight that I might
not have had
otherwise.</div><a name="10012173000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
should also like to echo the Minister&#146;s remarks and thank all
the outside organisations for the interest that they have shown in our
work, and we look forward to the next stage of the
proceedings.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column424" />Column number: 424</div><a name="10012173000109"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012173000172"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> Further to that point of order, Lady Winterton. I
should like to join in thanking all members of the Committee for the
positive atmosphere in which proceedings have been conducted. I thank
the Minister and the Bill team in particular for their open and
collaborative approach and, I am sure, for a lot of hard work behind
the scenes. I suppose that we should also thank the Minister for
recently expanding the bounds of acceptable parliamentary language to
include some choice Anglo-Saxon
words.</div><a name="10012173000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
should also like to thank the Officials and Officers of the House for
keeping us on the straight and narrow. I thank you, Lady Winterton, and
certainly Mr. Martlew&#151;I am not quite sure whether we
should thank Mr. Chope, given that his two Divisions on the
Floor of the House interrupted our proceedings somewhat, but it would
be generous to thank him for his work in the Committee,
too.</div><a name="10012173000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
should particularly like to thank my hon. Friend the Member for Brecon
and Radnorshire for his support and expertise on all things Welsh and
rural in particular. I should certainly like to thank my outstanding
office team of Victoria White, Harriet Shone and Tom Jenkins, without
whose hard work hon. Members would not have heard nearly so much from
me. So I suppose that I should finish by thanking all hon. Members for
their
patience.</div><a name="10012173000112"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012173000173"></a>The
Chairman:</b> As the tail-end Charlie of Chairmen and speaking
on behalf of Eric Martlew and my colleague, Christopher Chope, I
congratulate the Minister and other members of the Committee on
proceeding with great good humour, based on a lot of hard work and good
sense, and I am sure that the people of this country would be proud of
the fine democratic tradition that they have followed. It is also
apposite to thank our Clerk and the Clerks Department for keeping us on
the straight and narrow, although we had a bit of a scramble every now
and again, the police obviously for keeping everything safe, the
<i class="I">Hansard </i>writers and all those who are associated with the work
of the Committee. All that remains is for me to say, &#147;Order,
order.&#148;</div><a name="10012173000113"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Bill,
