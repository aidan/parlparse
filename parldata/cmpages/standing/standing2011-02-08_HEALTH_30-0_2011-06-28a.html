                  </strong> I shall begin with a question to all four
witnesses that is similar to the one I asked first thing this morning.
Although there might be pressure to get on with the changes and it
might be regarded as important for the national health service to be
able to move on, do you believe that the timetable that has been set
out for all of us, and particularly for you, has been sufficient to
enable you to go through the 180 amendments, compare the new document
with the original Bill, consider the suggestions from the Future Forum
and the Government’s response, and then look at whether the
clauses reflect the promised changes? Do you think that you are in a
position to represent fully your views and the views of your members in
the time you have been
given?<a class="bkMark" name="11062870000011">&#160;</a>

                     <strong>Dr
Carter:</strong>
                  </em> The straight answer is no. We have had two
full working days, and by anyone’s standards 180 amendments is a
huge quantity. We are working on it. We are prepared to go ahead with
it, but forensically going into these amendments in that time scale is
virtually impossible. As far as talking with our members goes, the
honest answer is no, because we have not had the time. However, we are
where we are and we want to get on with
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11062870000012">&#160;</a>

short. The Irish person would say, “I wouldn’t start from
here,” but we are here. There are bigger problems outside this
room, to do with money and improving care in the health service, and we
must get on with that. A senior politician said to me,
“We’ve lost a year arguing about these
things.”<a class="bkMark" name="11062870000013">&#160;</a>

challenging. I repeat how grateful I am for you allowing me to join via
video link because I am at our annual conference in Cardiff.
Interestingly enough, we had a very full and quite passionate debate on
the Bill this morning. One of the problems that many members pointed
out was that they were finding it very difficult to work out how the
amendments fit into the current Bill. They feel that the degree of
complexity is really quite immense. Any judgment we make at the moment
has to be predicated on the view that we will want more time to study
the amendments to see how they fit in with the overall situation. I
echo what others have said about the uncertainty in the service also
causing
problems.<a class="bkMark" name="11062870000016">&#160;</a>

to Hamish? I, too, received some communication during the lunch hour on
a resolution passed by the BMA, and it would be helpful, Dr Meldrum, if
you were able to amplify a little bit on it. Can I just take the
resolution in reverse order? I understand that the BMA wants the Bill
withdrawn, and three or four reasons are given there. One reason is
that it imposes a duty on commissioners to promote choice as a higher
priority than tackling fair access and health inequalities. An awful
lot of the amendments are about tackling fair access and health
equalities and, indeed, some are about promoting choice. Is your
reading of the Bill that it promotes choice as a higher priority than
tackling fair access and health
inequalities?<a class="bkMark" name="11062870000018">&#160;</a>

                     <strong>Dr
Meldrum:</strong>
                  </em> Our understanding of the amendments as they
are at the moment is that that might well be the case. I have always
said that we are not against patient choice but, in a social solidarity
model of health care, there always has to be a balance on how much
individual choice impacts on the choice of others and the potential
destabilisation of other services. First and foremost, we want to
ensure that there is comprehensive, fair provision of health services
to all. I think the reason that the conference asked for the Bill to be
withdrawn is what I said earlier about the increasing complexity and
the difficulty people were having finding out what it actually all
means. There was another option, which was defeated, that opposed the
Bill in its entirety, so there are still aspects of what the Government
are trying to do that the BMA would continue to
support.<a class="bkMark" name="11062870000019">&#160;</a>

                  </div>the BMA’s present position. The second reason is that you believe
that Monitor, the CQC and the NHS commissioning
board should have a legal duty to act and to avoid the undermining of
existing NHS services. That is something that you would hope that
everybody in the NHS would seek to do—avoid undermining
services. According to the BMA, what would it involve any of those
bodies doing that they do not currently do and are not mandated to do
by
legislation?<a class="bkMark" name="11062870000020">&#160;</a>

of choice and the focus on that rather than, in some cases, there not
being enough focus on the provision of stable, integrated services. It
is about getting that balance right in allowing appropriate choice but

soon. The other reason given is in regard to the function of Monitor to
promote competition in the provision of health services. We had an
interesting debate this morning as to whether preventing
anti-competitive behaviour, which is what the actual amendment states,
is the same as promoting competition. Your members are presumably aware
that that particular phrase does not
occur?<a class="bkMark" name="11062870000022">&#160;</a>

is now being very significantly amended. In many ways, it is being
amended in ways that we approve of and have suggested, but we could end
up with something that I would call almost a legislative morass, which
is quite difficult to find one’s way through and work out what
it will all mean in practice. Of course there are other areas, such as
the relationship with the NHS commissioning board and the role of

There are still things that I worry about, but the amendments, such as
the one about putting a secondary care doctor on each clinical
commissioning group, are a step forward. If there is one good thing in
the reforms, it is forcing integration between primary and secondary
care and getting rid of that barrier—commissioning without
walls, we would call it. One thing that we suggested but no one has
picked up is that there should also be a GP on the foundation trust
board as well, to encourage integration between both sides of the
patch.<a class="bkMark" name="11062870000027">&#160;</a>

chairman of Monitor has changed what he said previously, when he was
interviewed by Mr Timmins. Hopefully, that is a real change and he does
not have the same financial competition in mind that he seemed to have
then. Clearly, if there is going to be choice, there will be some type
of competition. I prefer the word “choice”, as I think
Nick Clegg does, so I will stick to that. I am worried about Monitor
and it must be watched carefully. I am not technically minded, so I do
not know how you can write these things in. You have to leave some

the things that we asked for have been taken on board, but we have
serious reservations about Monitor. Sir Richard has already mentioned
some of the comments that were made by David Bennett when he was first
appointed—likening the NHS to gas and utilities and saying it
was ripe for significant change. Ideologically, we do not believe that
getting component parts of the health service to compete with each
other is a sensible way forward. We would prefer a model where people
are tasked to collaborate with each other and to co-operate, where
there is more integration of services, and where services sort out who
is best placed to do what. We are worried that Monitor will focus on
cost at the expense of quality, which is something we will have to
watch in the coming period.<a class="bkMark" name="11062870000031">&#160;</a>

and Peter have said. I welcome the involvement of a hospital doctor and
a nurse on the clinical commissioning groups, although it is
unfortunate that there is no firm recommendation that a public health
doctor should be there too, because driving down health inequalities is
really a public health role. One of the roles of the commissioning
group is to drive down inequality, so I would like to see that
there.<a class="bkMark" name="11062870000032">&#160;</a>

colleges and thus the commissioning board, for the National Institute
for Health and Clinical Excellence or for any other group, has not been
taken up. The fact that foundation trusts do not wish to release people
for the greater good of the service is a real problem for the colleges
at present, and we would very much like to see that embedded in the

like the underpinning principles, which are greater clinical
involvement in the decisions about how services will be provided, more
patient engagement and a focus on quality. However, many of us, myself
included, felt that a lot of those could have been achieved without
recourse to legislation, or certainly with much simpler legislation
than this Bill. Instead, we have this whole additional layer of
legislation, which led to the worry that it was actually going to
destabilise services and widen the split between primary and secondary
care, and that it was not going to encourage collaboration. We wanted
to see something that would actually change that position. However, the
basic principle is fine. Certain aspects about getting rid of certain
elements of bureaucracy are fine, although one wonders whether, with
these amendments, we are replacing it with another layer of
bureaucracy.<a class="bkMark" name="11062870000040">&#160;</a>

I came back from Nottingham to be with you today, and I hear that there

                     <strong>Dr
Carter:</strong>
                  </em> Because we are still not clear about how
these various structures are going to work, it is difficult to make an
informed comment. I downloaded something just today that is a byzantine
maze of structures, and we are hoping to get very quickly from the
Government further understanding about how it all wires up and links
together, because it is not readily apparent
now.<a class="bkMark" name="11062870000051">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">On
the £20 billion, it has been said many times before that that on
its own would be a huge challenge for the NHS at the best of times.
Doing it now, coupled with this major reorganisation, makes it that
much more difficult. As we go around the country, we see hugely
differing approaches. Some people are applying some intelligent and
imaginative thinking, but sadly there are many examples of people
carrying out short-term cuts that will soon stack up as problems both
financially, because we do not think that they are properly thought
through, and, more importantly, for patient care. We are seeing waiting
lists go up in a way that I believe will soon become unacceptable. Why
are we keen to work with the Government to get this on board? We need
to get some coherence and stability in the system. We need 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 49<a class="bkMark" name="Column49">&#160;</a>
                  </div>to find a way of getting through the financial crisis that is facing the

it.<a class="bkMark" name="11062870000052">&#160;</a>

                     <strong>Dr
Meldrum:</strong>
                  </em> There are two aspects to Liz
Kendall’s question. One is whether the reforms themselves will
help to achieve the savings and achieve the reconfiguration or better
help to do that. We have concerns about the original legislation, for
some of the reasons I have mentioned, such as not encouraging
co-operation, not encouraging that good partnership working between
clinicians of all types and patients, which will be vital if we are to
buy into reconfiguration and provide more cost-effective
services.<a class="bkMark" name="11062870000053">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The other
aspect of the reforms is the disruption that a major reorganisation
creates, with people more interested in looking after their jobs or
finding their next job than in doing their day-to-day work. There is no
doubt that, even at the moment, we are seeing the destabilisation of
primary care trusts and strategic health authorities. That is why there
is a real dilemma: do we try to move on more quickly and get over this
process of reorganisation or reform, or do we take our time to get it
right? Difficult though it may be, we have to do as much of both as we
can.<a class="bkMark" name="11062870000054">&#160;</a>

aspects of the Bill is that it does not read like a logical attack, or
a logical approach to solving the problems, namely the ageing

said that, we are where we are, and as I have already said we need to
proceed as best we can to come up with some clear answers. I have no

                  </span> I have two questions,
one of the entire panel and one of Dr Meldrum. First, you
stated that you have perhaps not had as much time as you might have
liked to look at the amendments. However, I would suggest that you have
had plenty of time to look at the NHS Future Forum report, which this
morning Professor Field said he was extremely pleased about, and that
it was remarkable how the Government had responded to it in such a
positive way. He felt that the vast majority of what had been
recommended is reflected in the amendments.
<em>[</em>
                  <em>Interruption.</em>
                  <em>]</em> You can read it in <em>Hansard
</em>tomorrow. I think you will find that he did. Based on
the NHS Future Forum report, which you have had time to
read, I am curious to know whether you are satisfied that,
if the Government amendments are to reflect
accurately the Future Forum recommendations, it
is the right move and will take us forward in the right
direction.<a class="bkMark" name="11062870000056">&#160;</a>

                     <strong>Dr
Meldrum:</strong>
                  </em> Certainly, the Future Forum took a
significantly better direction than we had been going in previously. We
still have some issues with aspects of the Future Forum report, but
what counts in practice and will count with the service on the ground
is how the recommendations are delivered in legislation. As I said
earlier, it was already a very complex piece of legislation; it is now
potentially more complicated. Besides Professor Field’s comments
that you reported, we still need to study the detail of the
legislation, see how it all fits together, and to see whether, in
trying to deliver the Future Forum recommendations, it does so and does
not have other perverse consequences.<a class="bkMark" name="11062870000057">&#160;</a>

                     <strong>Sir
Richard Thompson:</strong>
                  </em> I agree, it was very carefully
written. We all met them several times; they tried extremely hard. A
lot of the suggestions have been picked up by the Government. We are
probably not discussing the work force section, but we are strongly
against that. We are very worried about that, but it is probably not
being discussed. One thing they did not pick up was the question of
allowing NHS doctors to do national work, such as working in
colleges—to give them definite time off to do that. Now, with
the increased stress as I have found in Derby and Nottingham in the
past two days, there is enormous difficulty in getting time off from an
increased clinical work load to do work for the colleges, or even to go
out and meet GPs, I am told. Yes, I think they have achieved quite a
lot and I welcome a lot of their suggestions, but not on the work
force.<a class="bkMark" name="11062870000058">&#160;</a>

                  <em>
                     <strong>Dr
Carter:</strong>
                  </em> We, too, have said that we feel it was a real
exercise. Steve Field and his colleagues came down to the RCN, and we
had a very good half day. Our members throughout the country
participated at a host of events. Many of the things we asked for have
been achieved.<a class="bkMark" name="11062870000059">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">In relation
to Mr Brine’s question, I hope I will complement what you are
asking. We have consistently said that we sign up to the key
principles. One thing we had always been concerned about in the NHS was
that there were far too many bodies, far too many primary care trusts.
In addition, far too many primary care trusts did not do what they were
set up to do—that is, commission. They had a provider arm, and
that really muddied the
waters.<a class="bkMark" name="11062870000060">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Therefore,
when the reforms were first announced, we were encouraged by the fact
that we were to see a reduction in some of those structures. We were to
get more clinical involvement—and we mean
“clinical” in a generic sense. We also felt it was a very
healthy and sensible thing to do to put GPs right at the heart of
things, because in many respects they had felt alienated and on the
periphery. There was lots of good stuff in the
reforms.<a class="bkMark" name="11062870000061">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">However,
the reforms lacked detail. We put this to the Future Forum. In the
meeting that some of us went to with the Prime Minister and others, we
made the point that even at this stage in what are now known as
clinical commissioning groups, we still do not have the architecture,
we do not have the detail and we do not know who will chair those
groups, who will appoint them and what their term of office will be.
What is the failure regime? It is naive to think that every group will
be a success. When money was being poured into the NHS, trusts still
got into financial difficulties. We are kind of being asked to sign a
blank cheque, and what we say is that it would not be unreasonable at
this stage, nearly a year on, to have had answers to some of those
quite elementary questions about the governance of those
groups.<a class="bkMark" name="11062870000062">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
know that was a bit of a walk-around, but I was keen to come back on Mr
Brine’s question. I hope that has
helped.<a class="bkMark" name="11062870000063">&#160;</a>

                     <strong>Dr
Meldrum:</strong>
                  </em> Thank you for the compliment, Kevin.
Obviously, speeches are a time for trying to use words effectively, but
we are getting reports from people that they feel that the co-operative
working that I talked about earlier, whereby you get all the people
together and decide what you will do about difficult situations, is not
happening, particularly in the current financial situation. That quote
was in relation to the need to make or identify £20 billion of
savings, rather than in the context of the Health and Social Care Bill.
The need to identify those savings is leading to short-term thinking
and immediate, rushed reactions that are having bad effects for staff
and, consequently, for patients.<a class="bkMark" name="11062870000069">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We realise
that time and money are tight and that we will not be able to do
everything that in an ideal world we would like to do. However, there
is a way about the process, which to some extent is a legacy of the way
things worked in the past, that seems to militate against good-quality
planning and decision making. That is unhelpful. Of course, the only
aspect of the immediate impact of the Bill is the destabilisation I
talked about
earlier.<a class="bkMark" name="11062870000070">&#160;</a>

is an added aspect, although again we are grateful for some of the
changes. I do not want to sound like a latter-day Oliver Twist from the
BMA, always coming back asking for more. We are grateful for some of
the changes that have been made, and one of them was the relaxation of
the foundation trust pipeline, but even in relation to that, a lot of
managers and people from hospitals who were at the conference were
reporting that they still feel a pressure to meet very tight financial
deadlines and financial standards, rather than focusing on patient
deadlines and patient
standards.<a class="bkMark" name="11062870000071">&#160;</a>

should take place for good clinical reasons. Certainly, you have to
consider cost-effectiveness but they should not just be done for
financial reasons. I am afraid that I never like to personalise things,
but it is another comment from the head of Monitor that has not been
exactly helpful in reassuring people that the real purpose behind
Monitor has changed and that we are seeing a move much more to
collaboration and appropriate choice, rather than focusing on
competition as an end in itself and not just one of many means
to  an
end.<a class="bkMark" name="11062870000078">&#160;</a>

There has rightly been a focus on integration of services. I know, Dr
Thompson, that when you were here last time that was one of your
concerns, particularly given our ageing population and the fact that
many people now are living with multiple medical co-morbidities. It is
obviously a key challenge. This morning we heard from Sonia Brown and
David Bennett of Monitor that the key focus of Monitor now would be on
promoting integrated care. I want to get your views on that. Monitor
would be looking to achieve value for the NHS, and value for the NHS is
also value for patients; which meant, from further questions, that it
would be better looking after patients in the community to prevent
inappropriate hospital admissions, which is good for patients and good
financially. Would you welcome that sort of thing in our focus from
Monitor?<a class="bkMark" name="11062870000079">&#160;</a>

                  </em> Absolutely. I just hope that the
leopard can change its spots. If it does, that is fantastic. I would
not entirely say that everything  is done out in the community.
Obviously, patients like things done at home but it can be done more
cheaply. The evidence, as you probably know, is very divided in the
studies that have been done. In principle, yes, I support
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11062870000080">&#160;</a>

not want to lurch from one extreme to the other. What is undoubtedly
the case is that far too many people are coming into hospital with
long-term conditions, and if you had adequate community infrastructure
you

delayed discharges because of a lack of
infrastructure out there. That is why we were hoping that these reforms
would free up resources, and you would be able to switch to get those
sorts of things that prevent unnecessary
admissions.<a class="bkMark" name="11062870000081">&#160;</a>

I address this question directly to Dr Meldrum. You said today that the
BMA discussed the Future Forum document and the Government’s
proposed amendments, and you said to the BMA conference that the
Government response on the issue of competition largely addressed the
BMA’s concerns, but members today clearly rejected your view and
advice, and the Bill. Why do you think they did
that?<a class="bkMark" name="11062870000091">&#160;</a>

time to study, with the help of very learned colleagues, some of the
detailed amendments, and I am therefore probably better placed than
others to read other people’s interpretations. You would
obviously have to ask my individual members why they were not as
cognisant as I was that the issues had been addressed, but I think that
one reason is the fact that the Bill very much started out to promote
competition, as was mentioned in some of the comments from Monitor and
others that we referred to earlier. Therefore, there is still a concern
that although there has been some improvement, the issues have not 
<div class="columnNumber">

                  </div>been totally addressed. Some of the comments that have been made by

quite a lot of sympathy with the strength of feeling, and if you had

the different nuances of response to the Future Forum, rather than what
people have heard about the legislation. Given that everybody agrees
that greater integration is the way forward—it is the bottom
line for everyone—what are the obstacles, if any, or

                     <strong>Dr
Gerada:</strong>
                  </em> What a long question. Indeed, there are two
questions.<a class="bkMark" name="11062870000113">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The first is
about the Future Forum and what our members feel about it. I shall not
address the Future Forum itself because it is important that we say
what is the Government’s response to it. We were reassured that
the Prime Minister should have spoken so positively about the NHS, and
so positively at Guy’s hospital about the values and principles
of the NHS. We were particularly reassured by his response to the
Future Forum, when he upheld the 2006 duty of the Secretary of State to
provide a comprehensive health service, and by his reassurance that it
would be in the Bill. We note that it is not in the revisions, but we
are not lawyers and I suspect that lawyers will be picking over the
exact wording. We have had discussions with the Department of Health,
which tells us to be reassured about it, but my simple mind as a GP
says that if it does not matter why not resort to the original wording?
That is the first thing.<a class="bkMark" name="11062870000114">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Secondly, we
all talk about integration as if it is some sort of magic bullet, but
everybody has different views on what it means. I run a shared-care
mental health service that has within it professionals from psychiatry,
psychology and the third sector, and GPs and nurses. To me and to GPs,
integration is about shared care, where the professionals maintain
their professional autonomy, where you work across professional
boundaries, ideally with shared budgets and using the GP electronic
record that everybody writes in.<a class="bkMark" name="11062870000115">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">That is what
integration means to us. We need it absolutely for the big issues that
face us, such as end-of-life care, certain mental health services and
services for the frail and elderly. That is what we mean by
integration, and that is what the Royal College of General
Practitioners will be promoting.<a class="bkMark" name="11062870000116">&#160;</a>

Dixon:</strong>
                  </em> I think the legislation already supports
integration, simply through clinical commissioning groups. As David
says, the issue is about how you get front-line primary care clinicians
to redesign services for the 80% of patients we see who get a totally
unintegrated service at present. Intrinsically, the legislation
supports
integration.<a class="bkMark" name="11062870000125">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
changes to the role of Monitor are very welcome, because it should be
as concerned about integration as it is about competition—you
need both. Therefore, to get this right, we need to ensure that the
clinical commissioning groups are themselves sovereign. Our concerns
with NHS Alliance are now mainly around the autonomy of those groups to
determine the services that their local patients need. Now they are
responsible to quite a lot of organisations, from senates to the health
and well-being boards and the NHS commissioning board, and we must
ensure that these are lean organisations, owned by the local practices,
fuelled by the local population and able to make the innovative changes
needed. Tying them up in knots will not allow for that.<a class="bkMark" name="11062870000126">&#160;</a>

Sobanja:</strong>
                  </em> A thing that the Bill might have addressed
is the mechanism of payment by results. PBR does not necessarily
promote integration between primary and secondary care, often known as
vertical integration, but one thing that we want to promote is
integration across primary and secondary care. If your question is,
“What is in the existing Bill that could be changed to do
that?” I am not sure what the answer is. What might have been in

PBR.<a class="bkMark" name="11062870000127">&#160;</a>

how it was a few years ago when they had to provide a comprehensive
health service; there is a substantial difference between the two in
terms of ideology. The major point is that the Secretary of State is
still obliged to secure a comprehensive health service within the

               <p class="hs_brev">“The

                  </em> It is a concern, for the reasons I gave. You
can have all sorts of laudable things that en masse can have an erosive
effect and straightjacket hopefully innovative clinicians. I am
concerned by the move in the language from assumed responsibility,
which the NHS Alliance has always said that there must be. There must
be trust in front-line clinicians and people to do these things, rather
than earned autonomy, which has a slightly childish feel to it in that
it has to be earned.<a class="bkMark" name="11062870000132">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">On the point
about the board with its PCT clusters signing off those consortia and
being able to commission on their behalf, I suggest that we need to
ensure that there is a proper incentive arrangement for those clusters
to sign off to commissioning groups in 2012 and make them ready for
purpose, and not delay the process and end up with groups that are not
ready for all sorts of
reasons.<a class="bkMark" name="11062870000133">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">With
such things as the senates, we must not return to the Darzi-type
scenario, where we had a lot of secondary care input into how services
were commissioned. There was, therefore, a linear look at different
diseases rather than in the round, which is what clinical commissioning
groups need to do—they need to look horizontally and adjust
priorities. As far as the senates are concerned, I would suggest that
rather than their seeming to hand the tablets to the commissioning
groups, they should be co-owned by the groups and by the national
board, so that clinical input is not something that seems to be another
imposition on clinical groups.<a class="bkMark" name="11062870000134">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">My feeling is
that in the Government’s response, it is clear why, for
political reasons, more responsibility for governance has been put on
commissioning groups, but that could, as a whole, stop the groups from
being as free-moving as they need to
be.<a class="bkMark" name="11062870000135">&#160;</a>

post-pause, means that we have gone—we have calculated
this—from 163 statutory organisations to a proposed 521, not
counting the commissioning support organisations. Clearly, we have
massively increased the bureaucracy, if one calls it that, within the
new, post-pause NHS. With respect to the national commissioning board
and whatever, the current, post-pause Bill seems to be very incoherent.
No matter what one felt about the pre-pause Bill, it was coherent. This
is not. It is neither liberating nor controlling. It neither allows for
GPs to be innovative, nor does it give them tight
restraints.

                  </span> The message we have heard
so far today is that the biggest challenge facing the NHS, as you have
also all said, is an ageing population and the need to meet their care
needs through integrated services. Dr Gerada, we had a very clear
example of your view of integrated services. My question to each of the
panel is whether we need legislation for you to be able to deliver
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11062870000140">&#160;</a>

                     <strong>Dr
Gerada:</strong>
                  </em> No. Let me also say that we have to ensure
that commissioning is done by the right people with the right skills
across the right population. Where we will make phenomenal changes is
in provider reform. Where the Royal College of General Practitioners
comes in is to ask, “How do we tackle those big
challenges?” Where doctors get excited, really excited, is when
we start talking about delivering key services, innovation, joining
together across federations—integrated care with the model that
I mentioned and removing the perverse incentives.<a class="bkMark" name="11062870000141">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I will give
you an example. Hospitals are designed to make money, which means that
they increase their activity because that is how they make money. GPs
are performance managed. They have to reduce money and therefore stop
patients going into hospital. You have two opposing systems working.
Somehow, in the second decade of the 21st century, we have to ensure
that we do not continue to have those perverse incentives. We need to
look at tackling those big issues through provider reforms, and
sensible commissioning should enable us to do
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11062870000142">&#160;</a>

Paynton:</strong>
                  </em> There is one other aspect to this. If we are
serious about wanting to shift the focus of care into the community,
that requires everyone to support that direction of travel. It also
requires us to consider, as Clare has said, provider reform and how we
can enhance the capabilities of primary and community services to
provide the care in the community that our population is looking
for.<a class="bkMark" name="11062870000143">&#160;</a>

                  </em> I think we need legislation because we have
tried to introduce clinical commissioning for the past 15
years and have failed. Each time, we have not changed the environment
sufficiently. We have not given them statutory responsibility and we
have ended up with fundholding primary care groups and, latterly,
practice-based commissioning, which all folded because there has never
been that power and responsibility with the front-line clinicians and
local people. Without that, it will not happen.<a class="bkMark" name="11062870000144">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">You need to
have a means whereby you can say, “These clinical commissioners
are leading the health service and, for the first time, the spending
decisions that I make in surgery for my patients, in terms of
referrals, prescribing and diagnostics, are aligned with my
responsibility to the outer world and population. I am no longer
responsible just for you—the patient in front of me—but
in future for the whole of the population and for the best good of the
greatest number.” Unless you bring general practice and other
clinicians into that role and responsibility—but you have got to
empower them as well—you will not get the integration that you
want.<a class="bkMark" name="11062870000145">&#160;</a>

Practitioners has discussed this issue. Our primary responsibility must
always be the patient in front of us. I have always said that good
commissioning is about the good use and husbandry of resources and that
we must never muddy the water between commissioning across a population
and the patient in front of us. Once we do that, we stop the trust. It
is the trust between the doctor and the patient—the fact I am
doing something in their best interests and not to save
money—that defines the national health

organisation that represents 42,000 GPs, I can answer that. We are well
against making bonus payments to GPs that are predicated on stopping
patients going to hospital. By all means use those payments for
patients or give them to charity, but we must not be rewarded for
preventing people going to hospital. That is a perverse incentive that

Sobanja:</strong>
                  </em> I have a slightly different view. The truth
here is between those two views. It is entirely justifiable to give an
incentive to clinical commissioning groups as long as the caveat is
that that money can be spent only on improved patient care. I
understand where Dr Gerada is coming from, but somebody has got to take
a population view. It is a hard fact of life that doing something for
the patient in front of you every time may disadvantage the patient who
is not in front of you. So there has to be a balance in this. I would
suggest that  
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 61<a class="bkMark" name="Column61">&#160;</a>

clear that decisions by clinical commissioning groups have got to be
made with the support of the population and the public they serve.
Doctor-patient relationships are very good. The vast majority of
patients trust their doctor. I would like to see the same degree of
trust being established by the clinical commissioning groups and the
local population as exists between the GP and the individual patient.
We need to try to ensure that whatever difficult decisions need to be
made by the clinical commissioning groups are supported by the public
they serve. That way, we will retain the
trust.<a class="bkMark" name="11062870000151">&#160;</a>

have devised a better menu of services that you can have—that

                  </strong> Dr Gerada, I have a question about new clause 4. I
will read a bit of it to you, because I heard you say earlier about not
having enough time to do so. It is a clause in which the Government are
trying to alleviate fears that there is a danger that we will see the
NHS privatised. They have highlighted this as ruling out privatisation.
It says, in effect, that the Secretary of State will no longer in
future be able to promote the interests of any one group. He will not
be able to promote the interests of a private provider over another
group.<a class="bkMark" name="11062870000158">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It also says,
equally, that the new clauses would prevent the Secretary of State from
deliberately promoting the growth of state providers over voluntary
sector or private ones. Is it your view that that is another perverse 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 62<a class="bkMark" name="Column62">&#160;</a>
                  </div>consequence in the Bill? In a tax-funded and still overwhelmingly
publicly owned NHS, the Secretary of State would be so hidebound by
competition law as to stop him protecting publicly owned bits of the
NHS.<a class="bkMark" name="11062870000159">&#160;</a>

                     <strong>Dr
Gerada:</strong>
                  </em> We have surveyed our members on that. I will
give you evidence of why I think you are correct: the Future
Forum’s own consultation process on choice and competition. I
urge you to look at it. There were more than 800 responses from members
of the public, patients and some professionals. Of those 800 responses,
and pulling out only the ones that relate to choice, about 597 of them
were against choice. They actually used words such as, “We want
a good local provider”, “We want our NHS service next
door”, “We want to be able to choose the treatment we get
in the consultation, but basically we don’t want a multiplicity
of providers and choice.” Seventeen of those who expressed a
preference were pro-choice, and one of them lived in France, so that
can be reduced to 16.<a class="bkMark" name="11062870000160">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I think, and
our members feel, that it is important that the Government are partial
to and protect the NHS on behalf of our patients. The NHS is there
because it provides a totality of service, universality and services
that do not come and go. Our patients with long-term illnesses do not
have illnesses that last for three to five years. That is how long
contracts are for now, and I run many contracts. We have won, as GPs,
many contracts where we run GP practices, and now we are coming to the
end of the tender process and we have to go out  to tender
again. Patients with long-term diseases have them for more than five
years. If what you say is the case, I and the college would feel that
we are entering a difficult
space.<a class="bkMark" name="11062870000161">&#160;</a>

the health service are not part of the nationalised industry view of
the NHS now. There is community pharmacy, to give you one example. My
own view would be that it is actually much more important for those who
are providing a service to sign up to NHS values—I absolutely
agree with Dr Gerada in that sense—rather than there having to
be some form of state provision of which the Secretary of State is the
non-executive chairman. Also, rather pointedly, I cannot avoid pointing

Korner:</strong>
                  </em> I have not really had a chance to study the
amendments in detail at all, but I have just come from a meeting of 200
stroke survivors at the UK stroke assembly in Birmingham. I was giving
a talk about the potential reforms to the NHS, and there is an enormous
amount of anxiety and confusion. That is compounded because there is
already change and some disintegration going on locally in existing
health structures, but there is not a lot of clarity about what is
going to replace them in the future. There are great concerns, and I
was not able to give them much clarity, because we have not had enough
time. However, we welcome the chance to give evidence and give our
view, such as it is. Our view is maybe more general, rather than about
specific parts of the
amendments.<a class="bkMark" name="11062870000170">&#160;</a>

Young:</strong>
                  </em> A particular anxiety is that it was a very
complicated set of changes in the first place, and they have now been
added to in order to meet the call that the Future Forum gave and also
many of the issues that we had raised as a group and individually. It
feels slightly churlish to complain that more complexity has been
added. On the other hand, however, that means two things. Apart from
the point that was made by the Stroke Association about the
disintegration of services that we are seeing at the moment, there is
an issue of complexity for the future and it being difficult to
understand how all these bits fit together.<a class="bkMark" name="11062870000171">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">For me, the
biggest challenge is not particularly what we get in the legislation
but what comes in secondary legislation—in guidance—and
in the various pieces of implementation, because they will be coming
thick and furious over the next two years. Are we going to have enough
time, as a set of organisations representing patients, really to
scrutinise those carefully? There will be tens, if not hundreds, of
individual changes that  will be subject to consultation; that
will have guidance put out; and that will have secondary legislation.
The devil will be in the detail of those, and my concern is that we
will be on a bit of a treadmill for the next two to three years of
trying to keep up with a very broad programme of changes, and a very
complex set of issues. There are plenty of slogans around but not yet
any clear understanding of how they all fit together.<a class="bkMark" name="11062870000172">&#160;</a>

                  </em> We welcome, for example, lay representation
on the commissioning groups; that is very important. We welcome some of
the strengthening of scrutiny of health and well-being boards. We are
still concerned about the engagement of the patient voice at a
national, collective level. The national commissioning board can set
the example of genuinely putting the patient at the centre of things so
that when we look at the national commissioning board, in the same way
as we look at the medical director of the board and say, “Yes,
we can believe that he represents the medical view,” we can look
at the individuals on the board and say that they genuinely get the
collective national patient view.<a class="bkMark" name="11062870000176">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Similarly, as
the secondary processes and secondary legislation get through, it is
important that it is not just a debate between the professionals of the
health service and the clinical professionals, but that the patient
view is genuinely involved in designing those processes as well. We
absolutely welcome a number of the changes that have been made, and we
commend them, but we have that reservation as well.<a class="bkMark" name="11062870000177">&#160;</a>

Young:</strong>
                  </em> Our concern is much the same. It is always
very churlish of charities that have pressed for changes in legislation
to look, when they ostensibly get them, as though they are being a bit
dog in the manger-ish about it. That is something I would very much
want to guard against. We have to recognise that many changes have been
made to the Bill that are in the interests of patients.<a class="bkMark" name="11062870000178">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">For me, the
biggest issue in terms of the patient voice is the dichotomy that
Ciarán referred to between what individual patients will be
saying about patient choice, and collective views about, for example,
commissioning integrated pathways of care. I find it quite difficult to
understand how those two fit together at the moment. This collective
voice for patients about the commissioning processes nationally and
locally, and about integration of pathways of care, has got to be
predominant. On choice, which is very strongly driven through the
Bill—the whole mandate for choice is quite a strong set of
amendments—I need somebody to explain how it works with
collective views from patients about integrated
care.<a class="bkMark" name="11062870000179">&#160;</a>

<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 65<a class="bkMark" name="Column65">&#160;</a>
                  </div>opposed to the patient in front of you. A lot of the patients whom we
are worried about are not well engaged, if at all, with the health
service. We feel that engaging them effectively and involving them in
the design of services will be important in meeting the challenges that
we face in improving outcomes and productivity. There are a few
outstanding questions in relation to what the networks and the senates
will do and the patient voice in some of those settings, all of which
we would like some clarity on as we move forward. There is definitely a
strengthening in the service, but we would like to see it reaching out
to patients who are quite hard to get to and involving them in the
process.<a class="bkMark" name="11062870000180">&#160;</a>

Jenkins:</strong>
                  </em> This issue, like others, is undoubtedly a
lot more prominent and a lot more recognised in the revised
legislation, which is really important because that harnessing of the
collective patient view will be essential if we are to design services
that are high quality and sustainable for the future. Like others, I
would like more scrutiny of the definition of collective involvement as
the Bill goes through Committee. There may be two angles to that:
either to put patients and carers on the same footing as specialist
clinicians in terms of the requirement to seek advice, so the advice of
expert patients is as important in some aspects of long-term conditions
as that of clinicians; or to change the public involvement stuff, so
that there is much greater emphasis on the proactive engagement of the
public and patients before decisions are made, rather than follow what
has been the typical model of involvement whereby you make a decision
and then you test it and consult people to see whether they object too
much to what you
propose.<a class="bkMark" name="11062870000181">&#160;</a>

and patient. That is a really strong and radical vision. The amendments
that the Government have put forward takes us further in that
direction, and to that extent they are welcome with the greater
emphasis on the duty to involve patients and public, greater
transparency and lay people on consortia. We probably have still
further to go. This is one of the areas in which we need more time to
make sense of the amendments and understand what difference they will
make. It seems to us that more could be done in defining what patient
involvement means, because it is so central not only to improving
quality but to meeting the so-called Nicholson challenge, so there is a
case for being more explicit about what we mean about engaging people
in their care.<a class="bkMark" name="11062870000183">&#160;</a>

public involvement still reads very much along the lines of the old
section 242 template of informing and consulting. That is still the
model of public involvement that is expressed in the Bill as amended.
Many of us here think that that is a rather old-fashioned way of
engaging and involving people, and we would like to see something a bit
stronger.<a class="bkMark" name="11062870000184">&#160;</a>

                  </em> I agree with my colleagues from the
charities. There is a dichotomy in the Bill and that is the involvement
of patients in decision making, which has been strengthened, but there
is also this idea of patient choice, or patients as consumers. The
stroke survivors I have just been talking to are not interested in a
choice of 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 66<a class="bkMark" name="Column66">&#160;</a>
                  </div>providers. They are interested in engaging to make sure that an
integrated complete pathway of care is available for them, that there
are no gaps in the care and that it is integrated. To that extent, the
collective voice, or the voice of representative organisations such as
ourselves, is very useful because we can express a collective view of
people who have experienced stroke services and help to ensure that
those services are commissioned properly across the
country.<a class="bkMark" name="11062870000185">&#160;</a>

                  <strong> </strong>There is obviously an issue here about how
we have and how we put into legislation effective discussion and
engagement with patients. Often, the people with whom we want to engage
do not engage. Patients are incredibly accepting, but unfortunately
there are sometimes things that are unacceptable: for example, being
treated with chemotherapy in a hospital corridor or on mixed sex wards,
which, thankfully, are almost a thing of the past now, but they have
been going on, and still go on in some cases, and are not very good
practice. Nevertheless, the point is that we often see in local LINk
organisations, for example, the agenda is hijacked by one or two
articulate individuals who have their own agenda, which is not
necessarily representative of a wider body of patient opinion and does
not necessarily capture the key challenges for patient care either at
the local hospital or in local community services and community care.
How do you see the Bill improving engagement with patients to make it
more effective, as that is a key
challenge?<a class="bkMark" name="11062870000186">&#160;</a>

that could help; it is very much a question of they are enabled to do
their jobs. Let me start with an example: we are a group of charities
representing a very diverse groups of patients and we could have gone
into the exercise around this Bill just concerned, in my case, with
people with mental illness, or stroke survivors, or people with asthma,
but we have recognised the importance of working together and providing
a generic response to the issues in the Bill. We hope that that style
of working together among patient groups locally will be one of the
things that we can take forward after the Bill is
enacted.<a class="bkMark" name="11062870000187">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">There
are other key things—the role of healthwatch is very important.
We are pleased that the Government recognise the importance of
healthwatch having a duty to engage all parts of the community. It is
very important that healthwatch is properly funded and resourced to
carry out that function. We were disappointed that there was not a
commitment to ring-fence the funding and we hope that that is something
that can be reconsidered. We also welcome the role of the lay
representatives on clinical commissioning groups and one of them having
a specific remit on patient involvement. They need to be real leaders
in their local community, along with health and well-being boards, to
get the right kind of involvement of patients and carers in decision
making.<a class="bkMark" name="11062870000188">&#160;</a>

processes that one puts in place to sample the voice of the patient
should not rely on one individual. It is why when we look at a
commissioning consortium, we need to look at the lay representations
and their quality and the skills they bring. We need to look at the
processes by which they do the public engagement and the transparency
with which what they do is available for scrutiny by ourselves, among
others. It is that collective process that

completed a pilot study in three PCTs of new ways of involving users in
decision making about care, and if you go to our website you can see a
toolkit that we have developed for commissioners and providers to
enable them to learn from the experience of these three pilot
districts. For me it is going to need, first, time; secondly,
investment; and thirdly, skills. We are going to need people involved
with commissioners, providers, the health and well-being boards, the
NHS commissioning board, Monitor and the CQC who are experts in how to
develop that patient and public engagement. Otherwise it will be the

big debate about whether it should sit as a separate body or as part of

HealthWatch England will not be in action until October 2012. Why the
delay? Why not get on with it? Even within the CQC, that body has the
potential to set the tone and leadership for the emerging local
healthwatch bodies. Timing is important, and there is something about
everybody’s duty to deal with and involve HealthWatch England.
The Bill, as amended, gives me greater assurance that people will have

there are still some concerns about whether the healthwatch system will

LINKs have suffered from scarce resources, not many staff and not a
great deal of clout; as a result, they have been patchy. Some have been
very good and have started to get off the ground and do some fantastic
stuff, others have not. It would be a tragedy if healthwatch ended up
being incredibly patchy. We have an opportunity to get something that

sector is good at identifying those needs of our constituents that are
not being met. That is why the type of services that we provide do not
normally carry a tariff, and in many cases, they are probably not worth
enough to go for tender, so we have great concerns about how they are
to be commissioned at all in the future. There is no problem with
people choosing between providers; the real problem is that in many
areas people have no choice at all because those services do not
exist—they are not commissioned.<a class="bkMark" name="11062870000198">&#160;</a>

things. If you start with the collective patient experience of
services, you rapidly identify, as you would in the area of mental
health, a number of issues where it really matters to patients whether
they get a service or what service they get. That ought to be defining
the choice agenda. In mental health, it is about the choice of
medication and the choice of whether you have access to psychological
therapies, and it defines choices patients might want in terms of
realising personal goals, such as getting a job or other things. That
is not unfettered choice; it is a defined agenda of choice. I am not
uncomfortable with what the Bill in its amended form says about choice,
but that is the order of the argument. We use patient and care input to
define where the current system is failing, which then defines a choice
agenda, and where the existing system cannot provide that choice, it is
important to have diversity of
supply.<a class="bkMark" name="11062870000206">&#160;</a>

choice. There is no single voluntary sector view on choice, and I am
not sure there needs to be. Choice is a contentious and politicised
issue and there are different views on it. The Future Forum has said
that it is meaningful choices that matter to patients and
individuals—I paraphrase—rather than the choices that
politicians may think that people want. You have to start with the
patients and understand their needs, which is Paul’s

than in a hospital, which is the example that Stephen Budd used, and it
is a good example of a choice that is meaningful to individuals, but

			Column number: 70<a class="bkMark" name="Column70">&#160;</a>
                  </div>during the scandal at Winterbourne View, one of the things we would
expect it to do would be to investigate the CQC’s failure
properly to watch what was going on. HealthWatch might have decided
that we should be looking not only at Winterbourne
View but at large locked institutions for people with learning
disabilities and that it is important that the CQC does a study of many
organisations. That is a real-life situation happening at the moment.
Let us think about the impact of that. With HealthWatch being a
sub-department or committee of the CQC, would it not be subject to, for
example, pressures from the CQC saying, “We’re 300 people
short; we simply can’t do that.”? Do we not need the two
organisations to be a little more separate, so that the CQC at the very
least can be watched by
HealthWatch?<a class="bkMark" name="11062870000210">&#160;</a>

England is in the CQC, there has to be a satisfactory answer to how you
have sufficient separation and independence that HealthWatch England
can operate without fear or favour in relation to the CQC. However, it
seems to me that the whole regulatory system has to work, and there is
a number of critical ingredients in that. We will probably hear more
about this when the Francis inquiry reports, but you must have a system
whereby people can blow the whistle at local level and are heard and
there is a quick response, so that it does not end up being a national
regulatory issue.<a class="bkMark" name="11062870000211">&#160;</a>

learned about the failings of Winterbourne View. One of the failings is
that nobody picked up on that at an earlier stage, when there were
plenty of opportunities to do so. Having mechanisms for understanding
and measuring people’s response to the services and allowing
them to voice that is critical and may, in fact, be more important than
the machinery you have at national level, because the national
regulators will never be able to cover everything. They need good
intelligence and the willingness to respond quickly when they get
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11062870000212">&#160;</a>

that has been investigated sufficiently, but I want to take this

“I’m going to this hospital instead of that
hospital.” As you explained, it is about sitting down with your
doctor and saying, “My daughter comes to me three days a week. I
have diabetes. I also have this condition and that condition. What are
the different ways in which we can work together to give me the support
that I need to keep me out of hospital?” That is choice in the
modern context, isn’t
it?<a class="bkMark" name="11062870000213">&#160;</a>

do not think that it is choice that patients want. They do not want to
go shopping, particularly when they are ill, or old, or perhaps have a
touch of dementia, or are very depressed about their condition, or have
other really horrible pressures in their lives. They want to sit down
with their professional and understand what the options are for them
and how they can put together a pathway of care that will last for the
duration of their condition, which for some can be 30, 40 or 50 years.
They want to be confident that they  will play a role in
selecting those options and that the options will have some way of
being met—that the services will be
there.<a class="bkMark" name="11062870000214">&#160;</a>

one of the 80% who do not get a service or one of the 20% who do get a
service. The point was made that the first step must be getting
integrated pathways of care commissioned, because that is what people

complete pathway for stroke involves a lot of different levels, so you
might need to reconfigure your acute hospitals, and you might need to
do that across your commissioning boundaries. London is a perfect
example, and the Prime Minister was at University college hospital
praising London’s stroke care two or three weeks ago. What
delivered that was bringing together the 30 PCTs in London and the four
stroke networks under the direction of the strategic health authority,
with patient involvement through the networks and through the Stroke
Association being involved. It was a top-down, strategically planned
reconfiguration of a part of the pathway. That is going to need to
happen in the areas of the country where stroke services have not
reached the standard they should meet and patients still are not
getting access to emergency care and stroke unit care. At that level
you can have involvement, but it is not clear from the legislation how
that strategic input will take
place.<a class="bkMark" name="11062870000219">&#160;</a>

might be other parts of the pathway that can be done locally, but we

different levels and some way of integrating—bundling
up— commissioning groups, with the stroke networks
involved.

                  </strong> My question is specifically for Mr
Korner and Mr Devane. It is about the level at which services might be
commissioned. I am asking you specifically because of the interest
groups that you represent. There has obviously been a concern that,
with the national commissioning board commissioning some things
nationally, specialist services, and with 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 73<a class="bkMark" name="Column73">&#160;</a>
                  </div>consortia commissioning things locally, will consortia at the local
level have the requisite expertise, and will the national commissioning
board have the insight into local conditions to be able adequately to
commission across the country? Do you think those concerns have been
addressed by the changes in the Bill, notably the creation of senates
and
networks?<a class="bkMark" name="11062870000226">&#160;</a>

Korner:</strong>
                  </em> At the moment we have the stroke improvement
programme and stroke and cardiac networks across the country. Those
bodies are extremely good at promoting good practice and collaboration,
but they have no teeth. I do not think we are suggesting that there
should be national commissioning of stroke services, but certainly in
acute care you do need a critical mass of patients if you want to
commission really good acute care. As with Ciarán’s
example in cancer, you need doctors to see enough patients to get good
enough to provide clot-busting treatments safely. The evidence is clear
that the more experienced they are, the better they are at making
decisions about thrombolysis.<a class="bkMark" name="11062870000227">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We feel that
there are reconfiguration issues, which are commissioning issues, that
need to be considered at a regional level, but there is nothing in the
Bill that says that there will be any structures to do that. We have
heard that the national commissioning board may have sub-national
structures, but until they are in existence and we know they are and
what powers they have, and whether they will be able to do more than
encourage and advise commissioning groups to get together, we are going
to be very concerned. There are areas of the country where services
will fall behind the best. If you look at London again as an example,
we probably now have there the best acute stroke services in the world.
I want to see that for everybody throughout the country. I worry that
we have not got the mechanisms in the Bill to guarantee that we can
enforce the type of change that is needed.<a class="bkMark" name="11062870000228">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Many aspects
of stroke services should be done locally, such as the ones we provide
of community rehab. However, there is a danger that in trying to save
money, people are going to start commissioning generic physiotherapy or
generic services, when actually we know that it is the specialist
services—specialist stroke physiotherapists, for
example—who are going to make the difference. It may be that we
do need to get those consortia to work together, so that there is a
critical mass of patients to make it economically viable to do
so.<a class="bkMark" name="11062870000229">&#160;</a>

legislation to ensure that networks exist, and the message that they
will be hosted by the commissioning board. When it gets to their
application, there are a number of things that we have to get right.
Let us say that one GP consortium does not want to play when the
network says it wants to put in a linac in a radiotherapy unit. One
consortium, for whatever reason, might say it is not interested, does
not want to and does not like it. What authority will say that it will
or will not happen? There are some things that we need to work
through.<a class="bkMark" name="11062870000230">&#160;</a>

preservation of the networks was one of the most important things from
our point of view, because, with the best will in the world, a GP
consortium will not see a childhood leukaemia more often than one in x

that up to a collective view, but give them more teeth to ensure that
they are unlike some of the existing networks, where people opt out,

                  </em> Those are two examples off the top of my
head. The current system has delivered across the country a dramatic
improvement in stroke care since the stroke strategy was published in
2007. We have seen, for example, that the proportion of people being
treated for the majority of their stay on a stroke unit, which is the
strongest evidence base for good care and better outcomes, has
increased dramatically since 2007, when the strategy was brought in. It
has been disappointing that some areas of the country, some stroke
networks and some strategic health authorities have not taken the
quality markers that were in the stroke strategy and used them to drive
improvement in services, so the improvement that is going on is
patchy.<a class="bkMark" name="11062870000235">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The national
sentinel audit for stroke, which audits all the hospitals in England
and Wales, shows that there has been a dramatic improvement. The audits
take place every two years, and the two most recent audits have shown
that dramatic improvement. They have also shown where we are failing to
make as much improvement as we should. I am not suggesting that the
current system is delivering everything that we want, but I am
concerned that the legislation as it sits does not provide for the type
of strategic planning to improve services that, as we have seen, has
made a dramatic change in certain areas of the
country.<a class="bkMark" name="11062870000236">&#160;</a>

about choice, to make sure that I understand; it was the point made by
Baroness Young regarding the use of the word and what it encapsulates.
To be absolutely clear whether we are talking about the word and its
application or what it means, I will refer to the Future Forum and the
report on choice and competition. The report mentions some work that
was done at the seminar co-ordinated by the Health Foundation, which
suggested that choice
includes:<a class="bkMark" name="11062870000237">&#160;</a>

Young:</strong>
                  </em> I absolutely support the first and the last of
those two. Patients are very interested in those as options because
they are about the mix of care that they receive as part of the care
pathway. I think that they are not particularly interested in choosing
between providers, because I do not think that they have that luxury in
many cases. Most of them are anxious to get an integrated 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 75<a class="bkMark" name="Column75">&#160;</a>
                  </div>service that gives them, for example, the nine health checks every year
that they need. We are just about to launch the national diabetes audit
tomorrow, which will demonstrate that very many patients do not get
those checks.<a class="bkMark" name="11062870000239">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Most patients
are not interested in selecting their provider; they are interested in
having someone bring together that pathway of care and discussing with
them what that pathway might look like for them. That might include
whether they want to go for healthy walks or would rather have a gym
subscription, or whether they would rather have their foot care done in
the community, in their own home or in some other way. It would not
include the idea that somehow they will select a provider on the basis
of information about quality of services, because in many cases people
who are in that position will find that their condition makes it very
difficult for them to expend that amount of time, effort and energy.
Indeed, they may not be in a place where they can easily tackle the
assimilation of a huge amount of information about the quality of
competing services, for example  if they are older; if their
first language is not English; if they are very sick; if they are in
some sort of emergency situation; if they have dementia; or if they are
struggling with other aspects of their
life.<a class="bkMark" name="11062870000240">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I take your point, Baroness Young, about options in
cases where care is inadequate. I understand your point. Surely,
however, a lot of patients with diabetes would like to have the choice
between going to hospital for various ongoing needs, or having a
facility that perhaps GP practices have negotiated that provides the
necessary care within the community, where they do not have to wait so
long and they do not have to worry about parking their car. Surely,
that is an element of choice; are we not rather playing with words in
talking about options? Having option A or option B is a choice, really,
is it not?<a class="bkMark" name="11062870000243">&#160;</a>

                  </em> Absolutely. But the point at which that needs
to be expressed is collectively when the pathway is designed, with
groups of patients being involved with the clinical networks. To be
honest, I do not think there is enough resource in the health service
to have the luxury of having a service both in the hospital and in the
community, without there being a considerable amount of waste involved.
We are very, very thin on specialist staff with diabetes skills. To
have them duplicated both in a community and a hospital setting for the
same service is very wasteful.<a class="bkMark" name="11062870000244">&#160;</a>

rate of a cancer surgical team is a good thing because of the peer
pressure it puts on one team to say, “Well actually we think
we’re better than Fred and his pals down the road, but maybe not
quite as good as Mary. How come we’re here in the data?”
That mechanism of transparency and of showing performance will drive
some people to make different choices. It will have a salutary effect
that will improve standards, even when some people do not make
choices.<a class="bkMark" name="11062870000245">&#160;</a>

that the national bit of the national health service needs to ensure it

that the mortality in one place is higher than another, I will do what
I can to make sure I do not go there. I completely accept what Barbara
is saying that there are no options and no choices and you have to go
in and do something, but publishing performance data that will drive

of the reason is because often the service that people such as you

be about providing a service, but there are a rich mix of things that

process. We go through tenders and we believe that it is very good that
we are tested on the quality of our services to make sure that they are
cost-effective. We welcome the idea in the outcomes framework of
patient reported outcomes because our services are really about the
well-being of people, rather than about health outcomes. So, patient

               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Where
we have a concern is, first of all, in the transition because, at the
moment, we are finding that, locally, health economies are
disintegrating in some places. Primary care trusts only want to
commission services for a six-month period or a year, which is very
difficult for us. We have staff who we may have to put on notice. In
terms of continuity of care for our service users, that is terribly
destabilising and upsetting. There is a real worry about what is
happening locally. Perhaps less for us, but certainly for smaller
organisations, there is a real concern about whether they have the
resources to do all the work that is involved in tendering all the
other
things.<a class="bkMark" name="11062870000250">&#160;</a>

speaking to someone who runs a smallish stroke charity in the
north-west called Speakeasy, which has just been denied its
£35,000 annual grant from the PCT. It has 20 years of experience
and does brilliant work around user involvement. It is doing work with
the Department of Health and with the stroke improvement programme. All
that expertise will be lost for the want 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 77<a class="bkMark" name="Column77">&#160;</a>
                  </div>of £35,000. It ticked all the boxes and spent a lot of time doing
this, but in a climate of needing to make efficiency gains, one
“efficiency gain” is actually losing Speakeasy and all of
that work. For me, it is not necessarily about what is happening in the
future; it is about what is happening now. What is happening now is
that we have a real blight in many areas of the country in terms of
committing to the types of services that we provide, and that is a real
worry.<a class="bkMark" name="11062870000251">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">On
the commissioning process, again, it is rather unclear how it might
work for us, because, as I said earlier, our services do not carry a
tariff at the moment, and it would perhaps be good if there was a
tariff for them. Many of them are not worth enough to be part of a
tendering process. From the pilot work that we have done, we know that
if it is actually about patients’ own health budgets, people do
not find their way to the types of services we provide. We are very
concerned about where we fit in. That may shake out in the future, but
the uncertainty is terrible for our service users, and it may be that
we will have to issue redundancy notices to our staff, even though we
may be getting contracts in the future, because we just cannot
guarantee that. We are responsible for letting them know as far in
advance as possible. At the moment, we are holding it all together, but
we just do not know what the future
holds.<a class="bkMark" name="11062870000252">&#160;</a>

times, and those of us who provide services know that we have to engage
with the debate about how we meet patients’ needs and deliver
better value. Our experience has been that there are two very marked
ways of doing it. Where commissioners have engaged with us as an
organisation, shared their problem and involved us and the service
users and carers we represent in redesigning services, we have
sometimes come out with services that may be better in some ways than
what we were doing before. In other places, we have just been told,
“We’re taking 10% or 15% off your budget.” That is
not the way to do it. Again, this proactive engagement with our sort of
organisations, to understand how you can address issues of quality and

assessment by service b, assessment by service c, none of which
actually meets their needs or necessarily offers them anything as a
result. Patients prefer sometimes to get a low-level intervention in
the community while they are still well, rather than have the sirens
blaring, taking them to an acute hospital when they are very ill.
Patients actually have insights into how resources can be saved, as
well how resources can be spent.<a class="bkMark" name="11062870000254">&#160;</a>

The chairman of the Future Forum, Professor Steve Field, recently told

not raised any concerns regarding national pay and conditions in
relation to the Bill. He characterised your meeting with him as
constructive and useful. Can you confirm whether you or your members

Adams:</strong>
                  </em> One of our fundamental areas of concern in
relation to staff is with the commissioning boards and the
commissioning groups as they are established. There is a concern that
the transfer of undertakings will be undermined. We fundamentally
believe in national pay bargaining and working collaboratively with
employers to try to find solutions, which is perhaps what Professor
Field was echoing. I was not at the meeting when he met with colleagues
in the Social Partnership Forum.<a class="bkMark" name="11062883000006">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">We have, for
at least the last 10 years, tried to work
co-operatively with Government and employers and we have, during that
time, introduced national pay bargaining, got rid of outdated pay
scales that were 40 years old and brought in a system that delivers
equal pay for work of equal value. We have undertaken an equality
impact assessment in which we looked at the pay records, prior to and
post the implementation of “Agenda for Change”, of
500,000 staff and there was not a detrimental impact in terms of either
gender or race. Therefore, we firmly believe in national pay
bargaining.<a class="bkMark" name="11062883000007">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">As
the consortia boards will be individual employers, there is a concern
that national terms and conditions could be undermined, and that is
something with which we would be deeply uncomfortable. I think concerns
have been raised with the Department of Health.

                  </em> Can I come in on the back of that? I was at
the Future Forum with Professor Steven Field. I am glad that he found
the meeting with the trade unions a fruitful process. We expressed our
concerns about the process of the Future Forum. In particular, we were
concerned about the poor access our members have had in engaging with
the process. There was poor information about when Future Forum
meetings were held and members were refused access to such meetings.
The feedback from discussion groups was very different from the
feedback presented at the Future Forum meeting, so there seems to have
been many misinterpretations as a result.<a class="bkMark" name="11062883000010">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">At the Social
Partnership Forum, we were concerned when we were told by one member
who was chairing one of the groups that he was not listening to us
because he did not agree with the views of the trade unions. We were
certainly very disheartened about that particular comment, especially
as we were highlighting some very pertinent and important points about
the Bill that were raised by our members.<a class="bkMark" name="11062883000011">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">On terms and
conditions, of course the unions expressed our concerns at the Future
Forum, in particular as the NHS employers had told us of concerns about
their skills deficit and being able to negotiate on terms and
conditions locally. We see the fragmentation of the recognisable
“Agenda for Change” package, with its quality proofing
and rigour, as a huge detriment to the NHS and a huge distraction from
delivering front-line services, in particular in taking clinical staff
away from their work to negotiate on local conditions. Therefore, we
believe that “Agenda for Change” should be upheld and
remain the focus of terms and conditions in the
NHS.<a class="bkMark" name="11062883000012">&#160;</a>

Maskell gave evidence to the original Bill Committee, of which I was

subsidy to encourage it to enter the market as a new entrant. Does
anything in the Bill reassure you that those original elements have
been taken
out?<a class="bkMark" name="11062883000013">&#160;</a>

that that would provide a level playing field. We are also very much
concerned about the way that competition could take place under the
amendments proposed. We think that some of the wording on the role of
Monitor—if I can just pull out that wording—as being to
deal with “preventing anti-competitive behaviour” sounds
like another way of saying “supporting competition”, so
we are concerned about the drive for competition remaining in the

consortia once you remove the interests of the provider organisations,
i.e. doctors and nurses—in that procurement process. It seems
that you can take doctors and nurses out of direct involvement in
commissioning, because they might well come from provider
organisations, but some GPs might still have extended interests in
other providers, and that is not safeguarded in the amendments provided

through.<a class="bkMark" name="11062883000015">&#160;</a>

have heard from the BMA and the royal colleges such as the

opportunity we have had to hear from the rest of the staff. I think
that you represent some of the professions allied to medicine. I
suspect that the group of staff that you represent could be in the
first wave of community services that might well be subject to being
opened to competition. The way I am reading clause 9, which is not
changed, is that duties are being passed from the Secretary of State to
the consortia; the areas impacted upon would be health visitors, issues
around prevention of illness and after care for people suffering from
illness—all at the discretion of the consortia. Do you have any
concerns or views on
that?<a class="bkMark" name="11062883000017">&#160;</a>

                  </em> In relation to the changes in clause 9 and
other parts of the Bill on the relationship of responsibility between
the Secretary of State and the commissioning board nationally and
commissioning groups locally, there are concerns. Certainly from my
reading of the amendments, albeit we have had limited time to look at
them, there is a perception that some of the changes are cosmetic. A
lot of the decisions will be made at arm’s length which could
still, in terms of public confidence in the Bill and in the
service—in the confidence of work force—lead to a further
undermining of the process. There is no safety net. For example, if one
of the organisations goes bankrupt or into receivership, or we have
Southern Cross 1,000 times over in the NHS, there is no safety net in
the amendments or clauses I have seen, or in the guidance published
yesterday afternoon, to give me that level of confidence. As a nurse,
that is deeply
worrying.<a class="bkMark" name="11062883000018">&#160;</a>

particularly concerned that a consortia choice could be that NHS
provision for pregnant women or young people is not essential, and that
they will not provide such services—obviously, it will no longer
be mandatory for the Secretary of State to do so. It also means that
the Secretary of State will have limited accountability for such
issues. The commissioning consortia are there  to consider the
extent to which a service is necessary to 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 81<a class="bkMark" name="Column81">&#160;</a>

those services not necessary to meet reasonable requirements, which
would mean that the Secretary of State before
Parliament would not be accountable for the non-provision of particular
services. As the amendments read to date, that is of
concern.<a class="bkMark" name="11062883000019">&#160;</a>

people get very excited about it, some people get much more excited
about prospects for collaboration, and most people are, I suppose,
fairly pragmatic about it. Regarding the Government’s treatment
of competition in the legislation, and the union’s stance, what
is your general view as a union about whether there should be
competition in the NHS? I would not expect the union necessarily to be
up in the air about it, or very excited about it and encouraging to the
Government. Is it the case that there are no circumstances in which
competition is acceptable? Is competition acceptable if someone is
trying to provide a service to the NHS from the voluntary sector but
not from the private sector, or is competition acceptable from both but
under certain circumstances? What is the union line
here?<a class="bkMark" name="11062883000020">&#160;</a>

                     <strong>Gail
Adams:</strong>
                  </em> In relation to the role of competition, I
would first say that competition has existed in the NHS since time
immemorial. You are over the river from Guy’s and
Tommy’s, and Tommy’s used to think that it was the best
thing since sliced bread and that Guy’s was not as good at it;
now they both think that they are better than the Royal Marsden. There
has always been a healthy level of competition, but the Bill introduces
a completely different concept, and to be truthful I am not sure that I
understand the difference between anti-competitive behaviour and
competition.<a class="bkMark" name="11062883000021">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Some
of the proposals about Monitor’s role and the opening of the
door further to private sector provision are deeply alarming. We have
recently seen concerns about social care provision, with Southern Cross
and Winterbourne View, and in our experience when private sector
providers account to their shareholders rather than to the most
vulnerable in their care it can bring different analogies. I have not
seen in the guidance anything that clearly explains to me what the
difference in anti-competitive behaviour is. The challenge with the
whole process—the introduction of different providers and the
further opening up—is that we will face increasing competition
on an EU basis, and the only people who will benefit from that are
lawyers who deal in contracts and the
EU.<a class="bkMark" name="11062883000022">&#160;</a>

                  </em> Sorry. May I just finish this point please,
sir? I do not see a need for an economic regulator. I have worked in
the service for more than 20 years, and I think that it has always been
effective in working collaboratively and responding to change, and
almost, in a way, policing itself. We need time to look at the detail
of the amendments—they were published only

that reassures me that the fundamental architecture has changed, and it
appears, with the greatest respect, to be slightly
superficial. On the EU issues, Mr Burns in answer to a parliamentary

competition law, and once you open Pandora’s box you cannot shut

                  </em> It is not in the same context though, sir. The
competition that we have at this moment, and which we had under the
previous Administration, is with the NHS as the preferred provider.
Patients inherently want to make choices, and as a patient with a
long-term condition, I want to know that if I go to my local hospital,
I will receive high-quality care. I do not necessarily want to go to
BUPA, nor would I ever wish to use a private sector provider. Patients
want to go to local hospitals, and they want to know that they will
receive quality care, whether that is in their home, in an emergency
care setting, in a hospital, or in a residential home. That is
completely different from the principle of opening it
up.<a class="bkMark" name="11062883000028">&#160;</a>

any of them have given us any level of reassurance. Having spent days
in Mid Staffordshire talking to staff and service users, this is about
fundamentally changing the architecture. It may well be that when
Robert Francis publishes his final report, we can learn other valuable
lessons for patient safety relating to quality of care, but we are not
at that stage yet. From my reading, I do not think that the amendments

                  </em> Absolutely. We have gone through the
amendments in as much detail as time has allowed. Our fear is that a
lot of the changes seem to be cosmetic rather than fundamental to the
writing of the Bill, and that is a real concern of our members. If we
look at many of the issues around the any qualified provider role, we
find that there is still an opportunity under the Bill for
cherry-picking services, for instance. The safeguarding in the Bill is
not rigorous enough to prevent certain providers from looking at
delivering low-cost, low-risk, high-volume services, such as cold
orthopaedics or something in that stream. They would not combine that
work with acute renal care or ITU provision, which are obviously
high-cost services. Therefore, from our reading of the amendments,
cherry-picking can certainly still take place as the Bill is set out,
and that is obviously one of the key concerns that has been raised. The
Health Committee and even the Future Forum have raised that particular
issue, and yet we still can see that process. We still do not believe
that the amendments go far enough to reassure the Future Forum and to
address the concerns raised by the Select Committee and, of course, by
clinicians on the ground, who know the health service better than
anyone.<a class="bkMark" name="11062883000042">&#160;</a>

a two-tier system in the health service. It will mean that people who
cannot afford to accelerate their treatment will either wait in pain or
try to find some other source—who knows? Maybe they may even
remortgage their homes—to be able to get crucial surgery, as
private patients can buy their way through the health service. That is
something that the NHS was set up to militate against, but sadly, the

able to march their way through the service.<a class="bkMark" name="11062883000045">&#160;</a>

that we have had to look at the amendments, one of the things that I
found was interesting in relation to the fact that there was no
amendment to that part of the Bill is that the private patients
alliance, a private company, is supportive of our concern about lifting
the cap. The reason for that is that it is worried that the NHS will
pour more money into private patient provision and become a challenge
to it as a
provider.<a class="bkMark" name="11062883000046">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">The
other dimension that we saw in the guidance notes, but which I have not
seen in the amendments—I have not had the chance to
cross-reference them—is that the Secretary of State, in the
Department of Health’s report published last week, talked about
separate accounts being produced so that organisations would be
transparent in the amount of money that they receive and spend on
private patients in the same way as the NHS. I cannot see an amendment
for
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11062883000047">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">It
is difficult. I have no idea how you do it yourselves, looking at all
the amendments and cross-referencing them. They need to be looked at
forensically because I am sure that if the Government say that they
want to do something and make a positive step regarding separate
accounts, they would wish to table an amendment. They would not wish to
have people say to them subsequently, “You said that you would
do it, but you didn’t,” because no one wants to be put in
that embarrassing position. However, I have not yet seen an amendment

                  </em> In terms of the competition rules—I am
not as familiar with that clause as you clearly are—one of the
challenges around it is making sure that services are commissioned
comprehensively, in an integrated way and across services. If your
mother falls over tomorrow and fractures her neck or femur, you want to
know that there is a continuous care pathway from the point when she is
picked up by the ambulance to the point when she is discharged into her
own home.<a class="bkMark" name="11062883000057">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">One problem
with Monitor, as I said earlier in relation to competition, is that of
the 10 clauses that I am aware of, eight relate to business. That does
not seem very integrated or co-operative, from my reading. What I do
know is that now, if I were discharging that 89-year-old woman, I would
pick up the phone, speak to the district nurse and GP and make sure
that there was a care programme in place, but I am not reassured by the
amendments that I have seen today that that will actually
happen.<a class="bkMark" name="11062883000058">&#160;</a>

                     <strong>Rachael
Maskell:</strong>
                  </em> This issue is starting to hit home already,
with the abolition of the strategic health authorities. I was talking
this morning to biomedical scientists who were saying that they were
not getting students through for next year because the strategic health
authority is not there to release the funding for it. So it is already
becoming a problem.<a class="bkMark" name="11062883000060">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">A lot of
training within the NHS is borne out through clinical placements,
student placements or continuing professional development. Without an
obligation on providers to provide that education—we will wait
and see what proposals come out on education and training—it
will seriously impede work force development and training. One thing
that we are particularly concerned about with the fragmentation is some
of the talk around the way that services will be commissioned: that is,
along care pathways.<a class="bkMark" name="11062883000061">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">If that is
the case, how people get supervision from within their own discipline
and their own profession is of huge concern. It just will not happen.
We already have examples of speech and language therapists, for
instance, who have been singly employed to deliver service around a
particular pathway not getting supervision, running into trouble and
ending up before the Health Professions Council in their first year of
practice. That should not be the health service being created for the
future. They need an opportunity to learn on the job with supervision
and advanced practitioners around them.<a class="bkMark" name="11062883000062">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I can draw
another example. It is about engagement with the third sector at the
moment and one particular organisation. Services are transferring from
mental health trusts into this charity. The charity is not taking on
board some of the higher band clinicians in bands 7 and 8 and is
focusing on bands 5 and 6. As a result, the expertise and experience
are not transferring over to the third sector organisation. As a result
of that, people are not having that learning experience and that
supervision at a higher level in order to deliver the best clinical
practice in regard to those patients. So there are already real
concerns coming through the system on that front as well.<a class="bkMark" name="11062883000063">&#160;</a>

out in order to achieve that purpose. The functions of the Secretary of
State, of course, are to ensure that—for example, through the
mandate that is issued to the NHS commissioning board. That is the most
important of these purposes: to ensure through the mandate that the NHS
commissioning board does indeed secure the provision of a comprehensive

recall from our previous discussions that it was always in the
legislation—the continuation of the duty of the Secretary of
State to promote a comprehensive health service for the provision of
health care services and health improvement. What people said to us,
and the reason why we are making the change, is that the legislation
went on in the previous form, under the 2006 Act, to require the

we explained previously, was that because the Secretary of State, under
the structure of this Bill, was not directly providing but securing the
provision, it was inappropriate to say “provide”, because
it would not

			Column number: 88<a class="bkMark" name="Column88">&#160;</a>
                  </div>necessarily be provided by the Secretary of State; it would be provided
through the responsibilities of the NHS
commissioning board and the other commissioning organisations. However,
people said, “We want to know that the Secretary of State, in
addition to having a duty to promote a comprehensive health service,
also has a duty to secure the provision of it.” We have
therefore changed the legislation—or we propose changing it,
with your consent—to make that absolutely clear, although I
think that it was always clear that the Secretary of State’s
duty to promote a comprehensive health service and for it to be
provided was enshrined in the Act.<a class="bkMark" name="11062883000083">&#160;</a>

reinstated, and has been edited as I have said, so that instead of
saying that the Secretary of State must provide and secure services it

the amendments, and on pages 4 and 5 you talk about securing
provision of services, but it confuses me even more. The note on new

but that there will be powers of direction in the event of a national

failure. If I recall correctly—I do not have the list with

they have bought into the process and accepted it as genuine. How much

                     <strong>Mr
Lansley:</strong>
                  </em> We wanted, as we made clear when we took the
decision to pause, listen, reflect and improve the Bill, that we would
do so through the mechanism of the NHS Future Forum but not exclusively
so. You may have found that many of the organisations and stakeholders
you talked to have been engaged both with Future Forum and directly
with us.<a class="bkMark" name="11062883000095">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">As you may
recall, Future Forum was engaged in a process of looking at four
specific areas: choice and competition; patient and public involvement;
education and training; and clinical advice and leadership. Although
the Future Forum was engaged on those issues, we did not say that
others were inappropriate, and the fact that there was no direct
representation on the Future Forum was not in itself a bar to others
bringing forward a range of issues of their own. We talked directly to,
for example, the Richmond Group, the BMA, the royal colleges, the
Academy of Medical Royal Colleges and a range of other organisations
with the objective of ensuring that in so far as people had worries, we
provided reassurance, and in so far as they had concerns, we understood
whether we could deal with them by amending the legislation. That is
the result at which we have arrived. I think that it is providing a lot
of reassurance, and for some people we have been able to deal with
genuine concerns.<a class="bkMark" name="11062883000096">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">Just as in
the previous question, from our point of view there is no change of
intention: the intention was always for the Secretary of State to
continue to have an enduring duty to secure a comprehensive health
service in England. That did not change, but people expressed concerns
and it seemed to us perfectly reasonable that we should change the Bill
if we could, in order to give people that greater
confidence.<a class="bkMark" name="11062883000097">&#160;</a>

some of the clinical commissioning groups would be able to come on

April 2012?<a class="bkMark" name="11062883000098">&#160;</a>

approaching 90% of the country covered—88% is already comprised
within pathfinder commissioning groups that have come forward—we
can be reasonably confident of realising the intention that we set out
to establish clinical commissioning groups covering the whole of
England before 1 April 2013; but establishing them does
not

their commissioning responsibility. It would be premature on my part to
say to what extent across England they will be
authorised with full commissioning responsibilities. That must be a

               <p class="tabbed">The Future

least in special health authority form. I hope we can do that in
October, but it will probably be well into next year—later next
year—with the benefit of legislation, until it will be in a
position formally to start an authorisation process. That will tell us,
at that point, whether the clinical commissioning groups that have been
established should take full responsibility or partial responsibility,
or are not in a position to be authorised and will be, as we express
it, shadow clinical commissioning groups, with the NHS commissioning
board taking the responsibility pro tem.<a class="bkMark" name="11062883000100">&#160;</a>

definition of terms? Language in the Bill is very important, and one of
the much trumpeted changes is the shift in the responsibility on
Monitor to move from the previous situation where it had a duty to
promote competition, to having a new duty to prevent anti-competitive
behaviour. That is described in new clause 5 as<a class="bkMark" name="11062883000102">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“behaviour which

                     <strong>Mr
Lansley:</strong>
                  </em> Yes. From my point of view, this is very
clear. On the one hand, people were very concerned; they felt that if,
for example, NHS commissioners were to set out to integrate services,
Monitor’s responsibility as previously expressed, which was to
secure the best interests of patients<a class="bkMark" name="11062883000104">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“by promoting
competition where appropriate, and…through regulation where
necessary”—<a class="bkMark" name="11062883000211">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>you
are right; language in legislation does matter—and putting
competition as a primary duty in that way might lead Monitor to use
that power to interfere with the structure of integrated service
provision and seek to fragment it. That is essentially the proposition
that was put to us. We wanted to be clear that that was not
Monitor’s job and that its job is to support NHS commissioners
in accessing the services that they should. There are related changes
about that, so that where commissioners are establishing a structure of
commissioned services, that should not be interfered with by Monitor on
that basis.<a class="bkMark" name="11062883000105">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The shift for
Monitor is to continue to exercise the extent of competition law within
the NHS but, as we have made clear, to do it through the Co-operation
and Competition Panel that was previously established using the same
principles and rules. The intention is to secure, where that is
necessary, the best interests of patients by dealing with any
anti-competitive practices that would prejudice the interests of
patients. You are right, language is very important. We are talking
about shifting from an ex ante intervention to one that is, as it were,
an ex post examination of where there might be clear evidence of damage
to patients interests.<a class="bkMark" name="11062883000106">&#160;</a>

competition is entirely a means to an end. I do not know what David
Bennett said earlier, but he may well have been referring to the fact
that, strictly speaking, the legislation does not extend the
application of competition rules and law in the NHS. To that extent,
the legislation does not change because it does not change competition
law. What we need to be clear about is that it is in that
box—that we know what the extent of competition rules are. They
were introduced into the NHS under the Competition Act 1998 under the
previous Labour Government. They were given specific clarity in the
principles and rules in January 2009 that were written to accompany the
establishment of the Co-operation and Competition Panel. To that
extent, we are not changing the boundaries of competition law, and it
is in that
box.<a class="bkMark" name="11062883000110">&#160;</a>

Secretary of State, about procurement roles and at times I have lost
the will to live—it is almost like the sketch in “Life of
Brian” between the People’s Movement for the Liberation
of Judea and the Judean People’s Liberation Movement, because
some very fine distinctions are being played out here. The discussion
could just be about the most elegant description of your role and
function. I suggest that in those circumstances, you would go for the
one that gave you least grief and that most people seemed to like best.
But I suppose that riding behind it is that people really want to know
the difference between one amendment and the other.<a class="bkMark" name="11062883000111">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I notice that
the Government amendment uses “secure” twice, and the
Opposition amendment uses the word in a slightly different context. I
suppose what people really want to know is, if you have one description
rather than another, what do you do differently? For example, if
“promote” is used, do you simply say, “Well, I
have done my best with the health service, it hasn’t worked, I
stop there”? I suspect that it does not mean that.<a class="bkMark" name="11062883000112">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> Just two quick questions, Secretary of State.
First, you have just said that strictly speaking the Bill does not
change competition law. Will you briefly explain why about 80 clauses
in it are introducing competition law on statute that you say has been
around in health care for a long time? I do not think that it
has.<a class="bkMark" name="11062883000120">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Secondly,
in relation to the issue of the change, pointed out by my hon. Friend
the Member for Islington South and Finsbury, between “promote
competition out and prevent anti-competitive behaviour in”,
clause 65 remains unchanged by any of the amendments. It gives Monitor
the power to refer any mergers between NHS trusts, or between an NHS
trust and a business, to the Office of Fair Trading or the Competition
Commission. Why does that remain if, as you said in answer to my hon.
Friend, you do not want competition to interfere with integrated
services?<a class="bkMark" name="11062883000121">&#160;</a>

                  <em>
                     <strong>Mr
Lansley:</strong>
                  </em> On the first point, the intention is that
Monitor should take responsibility as a health sector regulator for the
application of competition law in health and social care services. To
that extent, the NHS Future Forum has helpfully looked at precisely
that question. It agreed that the NHS was given greater reassurance by
that, because otherwise exactly the same competition law would be
applied by a competition authority that did not necessarily understand
and appreciate how the health service worked, which is what Monitor is
charged to do.<a class="bkMark" name="11062883000122">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">In so far as
Monitor will have licensing responsibilities, it will be able to
exercise ex ante licensing provisions, the purpose of which is to
support the NHS. As a consequence, that will make less likely the
intervention of any competition provisions, which tend to fragment and
distort what would otherwise be the NHS’s approach.<a class="bkMark" name="11062883000123">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">On mergers, it
is now the case that the Co-operation and Competition Panel examines
mergers, but it does so in a more intrusive way than the way that will
result from the Bill. We are looking to legislation that—as
would in any case apply if mergers relate to enterprises under
it—will relate simply, as I am sure you know, to where the
boundary of an enterprise or an undertaking cannot be established in
the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11062883000124">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I want to change the subject slightly and talk
about patients a little more and the key health care challenges that
will face the country over the next few years. I have two questions.
The first focuses on the first issue, which we have talked a lot about
today, of looking after an ageing population and people with multiple
medical co-morbidities. It is a key health care challenge in both human
and financial terms, and one that is coupled with the fact that a lot
of resources are diverted at the moment into looking after the worried
well. That is appropriate in areas such as obstetrics, but not
necessarily as appropriate in other areas. Can the Secretary of State
outline how the pause and reflection means that the Bill better
addresses the problems of delivering services, and integrated services,
that will look after people with many medical conditions and the ageing
population?<a class="bkMark" name="11062883000163">&#160;</a>

                  <em>
                     <strong>Mr
Lansley:</strong>
                  </em> It was very clear in many of the
representations made to us and to the Future Forum that commissioning
and the strengthening of it through clinical leadership, which we
proposed through the legislation in any case, is integral to delivering
services that are better integrated around the needs of patients.
Obviously, from the point of view of patients with a range of
co-morbidities and chronic conditions, it is 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 96<a class="bkMark" name="Column96">&#160;</a>
                  </div>particularly important that the building block for that is the
relationship that general practice has with patients. Other than in the
community context, it is very difficult to see the range of chronic
conditions together, but if you are going to do that, it is very clear
that you will also want to be able to bring the range of professionals
into the commissioning context and, particularly, entrench health and
social care together in doing so, in the way that we are doing in the
legislation.<a class="bkMark" name="11062883000164">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">For
many of the patients whom you quite rightly describe, care in this
context is both health care and social care, and to see the two
separated is, from their point of view, very unwelcome. We are creating
all that. The Future Forum report was very clear that through clinical
commissioning groups we wanted to create something that is not only
rooted in the unique population perspective of general practice, but
allied with the views of other professions. I think the legislation
does
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11062883000165">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">From
our point of view, because of the role of health and well-being boards,
the legislation will also enable many of the functions of prevention
through health improvement plans and public health responsibilities,
plus social care and NHS provision, to be seen in the context of
broader strategic needs in an area. Hopefully the further strengthening
in the legislation of the duty on commissioners and the health and
well-being boards to work together on establishing how those respective
commissioning plans meet the joint strategic needs assessment should
give rise to that kind of better, more joined-up
response.<a class="bkMark" name="11062883000166">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> Thank you. For me, one of the key challenges and
key problems is that we have historically had a lot of silo working in
our different organisations. Primary care is rewarded and paid in a
certain way, the hospital sector is paid in a certain way and social
services are paid in a certain way, but what really matters is the
patient and focusing on that. So, effectively, what you are saying is
that by having community-based commissioning or primary care-based
commissioning, albeit integrated with doctors from secondary care and
other health care professionals, it will help to break down some of the
silos and focus the money and the attention much more on the
patient.<a class="bkMark" name="11062883000167">&#160;</a>

                     <strong>Mr
Lansley:</strong>
                  </em> Yes, you are quite right. I would not
disagree with any of that, but I would not want to leave out the extent
to which we are also seeking to involve patients directly both as
participants in the governing bodies of clinical commissioning groups
and as part of, for example, clinical networks and their role through
HealthWatch. That will all strengthen
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11062883000168">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It
was also important to hear from the Future Forum about its feeling that
it would be good on our part to make further progress, not only with
the personal social care budgets—as you know, we intend to
secure personal social care budgets for all those who want them by 1
April 2013—but with personal health budgets. I will not disguise
the fact that there are many practical issues about the scope of that
and how it will work, but if we really are going to break down all
these silos, the most effective way of doing it is from the perspective
of the patients themselves. If they can say, “I want to see
joined-up services and to have direct influence and control over
it,” either through personal budgets or other means by which we
give patients information and control, that is likely to be the most
effective way of taking out the silo
effect.<a class="bkMark" name="11062883000169">&#160;</a>

improvements in the health of the population and to secure improvements
in the health of those who are poorest fastest. That is at the heart of
what we are setting out to do. This has given us an opportunity to
amend the legislation for the first time to put that duty relating to
the reduction of health inequalities directly into the responsibilities

                  </em> I think we have been clear that there are
substantial and significant changes and improvements to the
legislation. That was always our intention, and that is not unusual;
many pieces of legislation have had significant changes between
Committee and Report. What I think is unusual here is that, while we
are making significant changes and improvements, we are exposing those
changes to heightened scrutiny through
recommittal.<a class="bkMark" name="11062883000190">&#160;</a>

correction. Given that we are being live tweeted while we are here,
would it be fair—if only to myself—if I said that I have
not at any time during these proceedings said that amendments will not
be tabled in time for MPs to scrutinise them? I said quite clearly that
they could be scrutinised either on Report or in another place, so that
seems a little
unfair.<a class="bkMark" name="11062883000197">&#160;</a>
