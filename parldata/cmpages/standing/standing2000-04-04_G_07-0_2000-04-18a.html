</P>
<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard </B>(Taunton): I beg to move amendment No. 130, in page 15, line 41, after ``individual'', insert ``or agency''.
<P>
I seek clarification of the word ``individual''. As some hon. Members will know, one bee in my bonnet, which I have raised in the House a number of times, is the need for a national register of nannies. I am sorry to see the hon. Member for Basildon (Angela Smith) sigh again-inaudibly. In spite of all the legislation that the Government are introducing to protect children, some loopholes remain, one of which is that unscrupulous people may try to work as nannies in people's homes. That group of child-care workers is often, though not exclusively and not in the majority of cases, recruited through agencies.
<P>
I accept that individual employers would be guilty of offering work as a nanny to a disqualified person, if they do so knowingly. Does that include an agency that seeks to place someone in a nanny's job, knowing that they are a disqualified person?
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick Hawkins </B>(Surrey Heath): I was slightly puzzled when I first saw this Liberal Democrat amendment, but I understand the importance of the point that the hon. Member for Taunton (Jackie Ballard) has just made, now that she has explained the background to it. I was not aware that she had raised it in other debates on other pieces of legislation.
<P>
There has been a great deal of concern about this in the press, not only because of the terrible tragedies and scandals in this country, but, sadly, because of the Louise Woodward case in the United States. Hon. Members on both sides of the Committee, and of the House, should be aware of the importance of the issue. As we have said in earlier debates, particularly this morning, because there are unscrupulous people who, deviously, seek opportunities to work with children, organisations that place people in employment should bear some responsibility.
<P>
I well understand why the hon. Member for Taunton is probing the Government on this point. I wish to associate the official Opposition with that probing and I shall be as interested as she is in the Minister's reply on what is undoubtedly a serious issue.

<P>
<B>Mr. John Burnett </B>(Torridge and West Devon): I want to make a short point, which I believe is relevant. In other legislation that I have been involved in construing over the years, particularly fiscal legislation, the word ``individual'' is a term of art that means literally what it says. The far wider word ``person'' includes, for example, bodies corporate, trustees and other organisations.

<P>
I join in supporting the point made not only by my hon. Friend the Member for Taunton but also by the hon. Member for Surrey Heath (Mr. Hawkins).

<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department (Jane Kennedy):</B> I recognise the probing nature of the amendment and am grateful for the opportunity to clarify the position and to reassure the hon. Member for Taunton on her specific point.

<P>
As my right hon. Friend the Minister of State said this morning, we are establishing new criminal offences that will bite on individuals who seek to work with children while disqualified. The scheme must focus responsibility on the disqualified individual; that responsibility must not be shifted, in any way, on to the employer. To give an extreme example, we do not want to impose a requirement on all organisations to check an individual's criminal record every time they employ someone or take someone on. That may be the responsible action in any given case, but it is vital that the checks are seen as part of a whole range of proper recruitment measures and a culture of vigilance. A culture that relied on checks and saw them as the be all and end all would be of no use to anyone.

<P>
Originally, the working group that developed the scheme proposed only one offence-for the disqualified individual who worked, applied for work or accepted work with children. In cases where an individual acted deliberately-maliciously, as it were-to circumvent the disqualification, the employer would have been caught by the standard ``aiding and abetting'' formulation. However, responses to the consultation exercise favoured a seperate offence-not to catch a wider range of culpability, but to make a clear statement that active collusion in the employment of a disqualified person must not be tolerated.

<P>
The aim of the clause remains the same. It is designed to deal with the individual who deliberately employs another person whom he or she knows to be banned-for example, a paedophile who tries to employ another member of his ring. It would cover an agency, such as a nanny agency, if the agent making the reference knew that the person was banned. The parent who employed the nanny would also be covered if they knew that the person was banned.

<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> In my ignorance of employment law, I would be grateful if the Parliamentary Secretary would clarify that point. Is she saying that if an individual working for an agency in a recruitment or vetting position knowingly gave work to a disqualified person, they would be guilty? Might that cause problems in terms of employment law, given that the agency, as a body, has responsibility for ensuring that it stays within the law? Would it be difficult to prosecute an individual working for that agency?

<P>
<B>Jane Kennedy:</B> The agency as an organisation would not be covered-no corporate responsibility is involved. Such a broad-brush responsibility would go far beyond the kind of deliberate behaviour that we wish to include under the offence. However, the individual in the agency who took the step of referring the person in the knowledge that they were disqualified would be covered.

<P>
I hope that that satisfies the genuine and proper concerns that were raised by the hon. Members for Taunton and for Surrey Heath.

<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> If the director of a limited company that was running such an organisation knowingly infringed the clause by offering work, would he be liable, in effect, for the acts and omissions of the company for which he spoke?

<P>
<B>Jane Kennedy:</B> If it was demonstrated that the director knowingly promoted the employment of a banned person in circumstances that would be proscribed by the clause, he would be culpable and would be held responsible.

<P>
The offence in the Bill will cover those who are genuinely and truly culpable, not penalise the overall corporate organisation that may suffer as a result of an individual's actions. I therefore hope that Opposition Members will withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> I accept the spirit of what the Parliamentary Secretary has said-in principle, it tallies with what I am asking for-but I still have some worries. For example, if a local authority were found guilty of sex discrimination in employment practices, it is possible that the body corporate of the local authority would be in trouble, rather than the individual personnel officer who carried out the interview, because the officer would have been acting on the local authority's behalf. However, that would not apply in these circumstances: responsibility would lie with an individual officer in the case of a local authority and with an individual employee in the case of an agency.

<P>
Although the spirit of what I want to achieve appears to be covered, my knowledge of the law is not great enough for me to be certain that the legality is also covered. However, I hope that the draftspeople can re-examine the provision to ensure that it is completely watertight and that it will achieve what we all want it to. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> The Minister of State has regularly mentioned the need for the legislation to be proportionate, in his responses to amendments tabled by the Conservative party and by the Liberal Democrats in earlier debates. This is an area in which we want the Minister to deal with the question of extra categories while recognising that issues of proportionality are involved.

<P>
Before I come to the specific terms of the amendment, perhaps I can raise a general concern that several organisations have brought to my attention, because I know, Mr. Maxton, that you and the Committee might not want a separate stand part debate. Similar points may have been raised with other hon. Members on both sides of the Committee. The purpose of this part of the Bill is to ensure that those who prey on children are prevented from doing so. As has been mentioned, that aim shares common ground on both sides of the Committee. However, one does not want to place insuperable obstacles in the way of those trying to organise legitimate activities for children.

<P>
Several organisers of sports clubs in my constituency have expressed their concern that the checks that they will need to go through will put people off, and that people who would never pose a threat to childrren but who simply wish to give their free time for the benefit of training children in sport will be prevented from doing so. That is one side of the argument. The Parliamentary Secretary knows of my personal involvement in sport from previous debates. As deputy chairman of the all-party sports committee, I felt that it was right to place that point on the record. As we are discussing the categories of people covered by the measure, this seems to be the most appropriate section of the Bill in which to make that general point.

<P>
I know that, like me, the Parliamentary Secretary would not want people who have never posed a risk to children to be put off becoming involved in voluntary activities, especially when sports clubs need to get involved in encouraging young people to have healthy activities. As sports bodies such as Sport England have said, such involvement can help us to stop breeding a generation of couch potatoes-with all the adverse health consequences that that entails-and to encourage children to become involved in healthy activities such as sport rather than run the risk of becoming drug addicts.

<P>
Having made that general point, I turn to amendment No. 98. On the other side of the coin, the official Opposition believe that further categories of people to be covered by the checks should be added to those set out by the Government. I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will accept that we are realistic in listing other positions that should be covered by these mechanisms. The amendment proposes that we should add to the provision people who are in
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>a position whose normal duties involve the provision of youth justice services as defined in section 38(4) of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Parliamentary Secretary may not agree to the amendment, but I hope that she will respond to it in the spirit in which it was moved. She may recall that I served on the Committee that considered the Crime and Disorder Act 1998. That Act has changed the way in which local authorities, the police and many other agencies are encouraged to work together. If the Parliamentary Secretary cannot agree to the amendment, it would be helpful if she and her officials would consider introducing a similar amendment on Report or in another place.

<P>
<H5>4.45 pm<w7></H5>
</P>

<P>
Amendment No. 99 would add to the bill a large number of categories of people. There are valid reasons for probing the Government's intention in this regard. Some groups from the list stand out as being of particular importance, including a
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>member of a youth offending team,<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
a
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>member of a local board<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and an
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>officer of a local board.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Parliamentary Secretary may be happier to agree to some of the categories than to others. I make no apology for the fact that the amendment contains a reasonably extensive list, and I do not expect her to agree to all of them. I hope that she will consider including additional appointments and that the Government will introduce appropriate amendments at a later stage.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Jane Kennedy:</B> I shall start by dealing with the general point in the hope that we may avoid a clause stand part debate. As I said earlier, the onus is on the disqualified person. The bill places no requirements on organisations, including the sports clubs to which the hon. Member for Surrey Heath referred, to perform checks. The onus is on the individual who has been banned not to seek or to procure work in a prescribed occupation.

<P>
It might help if I describe the width of the ban. The definition of working with children would go beyond the definitions that are associated with the specific health and social care and education bans, which involve the Secretary of State's powers. It would cover a wide range of work, including education, health and social care, accommodation, leisure and sporting activities, religious activities and the criminal justice system. It is important for the ban to be comprehensive-that will protect children in the relevant circumstances.

<P>
In relation to amendment No. 98, all those who provide youth justice services and who regularly supervise, train, care for or are in sole charge of children are already covered by the Bill's definition, which is wide and generous. We do not want to weaken that definition by identifying groups of staff that need special mention. The hon. Gentleman suggested doing so in relation to, for example, youth justice workers.

<P>
On amendment No. 99, the list of positions that are contained in clause 33(6) is the crucial part of the definition of a regulated position. It involves those positions that afford to the holder trust and respect, and those that give holders the right to go into, for example, schools or voluntary groups without supervision as a privilege of their position. The children and their parents may look up to such people and respect them as safe members of the establishment.

<P>
The list is rightly limited to positions that involve children's services. It does not involve general positions that may happen to relate to children. I hope that the hon. Member for Surrey Heath will withdraw the amendment, or that Committee members will resist it. The positions that are listed in the amendment do not fall into the child-related category that I mentioned, and they do not involve the privileged access to children that school governors, for example, have. I fully accept that all the positions listed are of importance in the community, but they go beyond what is needed to ensure the protection of children. The Committee should also note that, in the context I described, members of youth offending teams are already covered by the general definition of supervision of training, and so on. However, the list of positions in amendment No. 99 is far too widely drawn and, for the reasons I have given, I ask the hon. Member for Surrey Heath to withdraw his amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I am reassured by some aspects of the Parliamentary Secretary's response. I take her point that the Bill's existing definitions are fairly wide, but she may wish to consider one or two of the positions set out in amendment No. 99. She did not say whether she is prepared to consider them, and I hope that she will intervene to confirm as much. As she says, list (a) to (g) in clause 33(6) consists of people who are respected in the community. However, she will agree that a director of leisure services or, in particular, a director of library services is just as likely as a member of a social services committee-a position listed in the clause-to be invited into a school, and I make no apology for our drawing up a relatively wide list.

<P>
Perhaps the amendment, which was intended to probe, has been drawn too widely. As I said, I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will intervene to confirm that she is prepared to reconsider the matter. She will accept that, in terms of drafting, no Government have a monopoly of virtue. Bills can often be improved through debate in Standing Committee, in another place or on Report. If she will consider including some categories of people that we have put forward, some of whom are invited into schools for various reasons, we may be able to debate the matter again at a later stage.

<P>
The Parliamentary Secretary is indicating that she does not intend to intervene, but I shall not press the amendment to a vote doday. She will not go as far as her fellow Minister, the right hon. Member for Brent, South (Mr. Boateng), who said this morning that he
was willing to consider matters relating to other amendments. She should bear in mind that we may have to press a version of these amendments to a vote at a later stage, whether in another place or on Report. Some of the categories that we have put forward may be closer to the definition that she gave in her response that certain existing categories in the Bill.

<P>
The Government may have to think again on the matter. I am to some extent reassured, but the Parliamentary Secretary has not gone far enough to satisfy the Opposition. However, for the moment, and with that proviso, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
Clause 33 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<H4><center>Clause 34</center></H4>
<H4><center>Disqualification in Scotland or Northern Ireland</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> The clause will apply the relevant provisions only in relation to disqualification in Scotland or Northern Ireland. I do not want to detain the Committee, but I wonder whether the Parliamentary Secretary could explain for my benefit the exact position of Scotland and Northern Ireland in this regard, because it may be relevant to subsequent clauses. We now have a separate Scottish Parliament and a devolved Assembly that is suspended, but which may return in the near future if our hopes for Northern Ireland are fulfilled. For the avoidance of doubt, the Parliamentary Secretary should explain the way in which the overlap will apply.

<P>
<B>Jane Kennedy:</B> I hope that I can provide that clarification. Statutory provisions equivalent to those contained in the Bill are not yet in place in Scotland or Northern Ireland, but I understand that both Scotland and Northern Ireland intend to establish equivalent schemes in the near future. The clause therefore provides a power for the Secretary of State to ensure that individuals who, under the law of Scotland or Northern Ireland, are subject to a prohibition or disqualification that corresponds to disqualification in the rest of the United Kingdom, are also disqualified from working with children in England and Wales. The clause is intended to allow the protections provided by the integrated system to be available on a UK basis in due course.

<P>
Although I cannot share specific dates and objectives with the hon. Gentleman today, we keep in close touch with Scotland and Northern Ireland on this issue. It is vital that the protections are UK-wide as soon as possible. In the meantime, the ban imposed in England and Wales will cover work in Northern Ireland.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for that clarification. It is helpful for those who read our proceedings to have that on the record.

<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<P>
Clause 34 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<H4><center>Clause 35</center></H4>
<H4><center>Interpretation of Part II</center></H4>
<P>
Amendment proposed: No. 100, in page 19, line 44, leave out ``a prescribed'' and insert ``an''.-[Jane Kennedy.]

<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> The Parliamentary Secretary is clearly anxious to deal with matters as formally as possible, and I understand that. There have not yet been many Government amendments to the Bill, but perhaps I should not tempt fate. Could she briefly explain the background to this small amendment? Again, it would be helpful to have it on the record.

<P>
<B>Jane Kennedy:</B> I will be brief. At present the officers listed in full in clause 33(6) must be separately prescribed. The amendment merely removes that requirement. There is no need for secondary legislation to precribe them. However, if Parliament wished to add new offices or remove those in the present list, it could do so under clause 33(13) by the affirmative procedure.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I am grateful.

<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<P>
Clause 35, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<H4><center>Clause 36</center></H4>
<H4><center>Probation orders renamed community rehabilitation orders</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> As you, Mr. Maxton, and the Committee will recall I clarified with you and the Clerk this morning that our amendment No. 3 was not selected simply because it sought to delete the whole clause. Indeed, we have tabled similar amendments to subsequent clauses. Therefore, there was no need to select an amendment, because there will be a stand part debate.

<P>
The official Opposition are not alone in feeling strongly that the Government serve no good purpose by seeking to change the names of all these orders. Everybody in the court service at every level-lawyers, magistrates, whoever-has become used over many years to what a probation order, a community service order and all the others mean. There is no good reason for suddenly changing the name from probation order to community rehabilitation order. One does not have to listen to the official Opposition to believe that. We have received many submissions from a wide variety of organisations, not only those representing the legal profession but many others, asking what the point is of these changes.

<P>
In Home Office questions we belatedly persuaded the Minister of State, in answer to a question from my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham (Mr. Bercow), that in view of all the lobbying that the Government had received, the proposed new name of the probation service would bring it into ridicule. Almost every probation committee in the country wrote to the Government saying that the proposal was daft and the Government eventually conceded. However, they have not yet conceded that the same logic applies to changing the name of the order. The National Association of Probation Officers is at the sharp end and sent me a submission stating:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The phrase ``Probation Order'' has international resonance and recognition. Indeed-<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I hope that the Minister hears this important point loud and clear-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>most eastern European countries are currently setting up Probation Services with Probation Orders based on the British model.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
At a time when the new democracies in former Warsaw pact countries want to copy the United Kingdom because the system works, along comes the new Labour Government with its passion for change for change's sake and making everything new for no good reason. They want to change the name of the order, which everyone understands, and replace it with another name, which will confuse everyone. At the moment, a young offender who goes before a court and is sentenced to a probation order knows immediately what that means. His family knows what it means and can encourage the young offender to work with the probation service and to return to the straight and narrow.

<P>
The National Association of Probation Officers believes that the Government may be thinking, mistakenly, that enhanced public knowledge could result from the change of name. It believes that this is the most significant proposal since the Government's abandonment of their original daft proposal to change the name of the probation service and I agree because I have received more representations about it than any other in the Bill. The National Association of Probation Officers states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The term ``Community Rehabilitation Order'' is far less clear than ``Probation Order''. The term ``Probation Order'' is positive, it suggests that the person on the order has a distinct period of time to prove themselves and to make changes to their life-style.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That states the position succinctly and correctly.

<P>
The Parliamentary Secretary is always prepared to be friendly and unconfrontational. She will respond to the debate and I believe that in her heart of hearts, whatever she says today and however much she tries to sweeten the pill, she knows that the proposal is wrong. This is one of those occaisions on which she will read out her ministerial brief, but she will do so with no great confidence.

<P>
I do not want to detain the Committee when the people at the sharpe end have made the argument so strongly. If the Parliamentary Secretary cannot accept our argument today, I hope that the same wisdom that forced the Government to listen to the probation committees and to accept the sense of not charging the name of the service will force them to listen again, in another place, if not here. If they do not, there will be many protests, not just from the official Opposition, but from Labour supporters in the other place. Some of her hon. Friends expressed concern on Second Reading. One Labour Member-he is not a member of the Committee and it would be unfair to identify him-said, ``Do you think you will be able to persuade my Government to drop this daft idea of changing all the names of the order?'' A lot of friendly fire is being aimed at the Parliamentary Secretary and that will continue in the other place. Law Lords will attack it, as they attacked the access to justice proposals which led to the Government's defeat on the Criminal Justice (Mode of Trial) Bill which caused them to introduce a No. 2 Bill. There will probably be attacks from bishops and Cross-Bench Peers. The Government will face real trouble unless they listen to us and the National Association of Probation Officers, as well as other bodies. If the Government pursue the proposal, they will be fiddling while Rome burns. We agreed earlier on a great deal of good material about the protection of children. Given all that good material, why do the Government want to pursue this draft thing, to which the people at the sharp end object and which they strongly oppose? I have no idea. I hope that the Government will decide to drop it.

<P>

<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> I did as the hon. Member for Surrey Heath suggested and listened carefully to the official Opposition. I am afraid that I must disappoint him in his search for support from the second opposition party. I will, however, support him in making similar arguments about the names of the two orders in the next two clauses.

<P>
I have read the brief from the National Association of Probation Officers and I agree with the association that the term ``probation'' is well understood, not just in this country, but in others. The term implies that individuals on probation have a particular period of time in which to prove themselves and change their lifestyle, otherwise something else untoward will happen to them. However, having spoken about the value of rehabilitation in a number of the Committee's previous debates, I think that renaming probation orders as community rehabilitation orders is a positive step and suggests that the proactive purpose of the order is to rehabilitate an offender and encourage a more positive lifestyle, which does not involve offending.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> We all understand the importance of the concept of rehabilitation. Does the hon. Lady not accept that those who have to apply the orders must know best? If we were starting from scratch, and there had never been such a thing as a probation order, I could understand her point. Will she not accept that there is value in the opinion of the people at the sharp end that the name is working and should be kept?

<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> It comes as a surprise to find the Conservative spokesman acting as mouthpiece for a trade union. I do not think that the professionals in a service always know best about its future. Sometimes, we should listen to the people receiving the service or to other groups. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman has not always put forward that argument about trade unions.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I can certainly tell the hon. Lady that, whenever Governments, including those that I might generally support, have put forward-for no good purpose-proposals to change something that is clearly working, I have opposed them.

<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> I am glad that that is on the record.

<P>
My preferred option, which has not been proposed-we might call it the third way-is to call the order a ``probation and community rehabilitation order''. That takes into account both sides of the equation-that someone is on probation and has a specific time to prove himself or herself and that the order aims positively for rehabilitation. That is not, unfortunately, on the table and, that being the case, the clause should stand part.

<P>
<B>Mr. David Amess </B>(Southend, West): I should give my hon. Friend the Member for Surrey Heath some support. I think that he has made his case extremely well, even if the hon. Member for Taunton does not agree.

<P>
Could the Minister give us some detail on where, precisely, all the representations calling for the changes came from? Over what period were they made? We can argue until the cows come home about political correctness-I know that two Government Members made representations about the names-but I would like to hear some guesstimate of the likely administration cost, if we decide to change the orders.

<P>
<B>Jane Kennedy:</B> I should resist the temptation, but the opportunity is too good to miss. The hon. Members for Surrey Heath and for Taunton have displayed the most basic principles of their respective parties. We have the true voice of Conservatism in the shape of the hon. Member for Surrey Heath and the real, naked Liberal Democrat, wanting it both ways.

<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> The third way.

<P>
<B>Jane Kennedy:</B> My hon. Friend the Member for Weaver Vale (Mr. Hall) suggested from a sedentary position that it was not very gallant for the hon. Member for Surrey Heath to suggest that, perhaps, the views that I hold in my heart of hearts were different from those that I would be expressing as a Minister. He was not, however, as ungallant as my hon. Friend the Member for Lewisham, East (Ms Prentice) who accused me of having no heart at all. That would have been true when I worked for the usual channels.

<P>
The hon. Member for Surrey Heath said that other jurisdictions were adopting our system. That is an interesting development, and he makes a valid point. However, appropriate policies for modernisation in other jurisdictions should not prescribe the ways that we modernise our legislation. The hon. Member for Taunton spoke about rehabilitation, which is, of course, one of the overriding purposes and functions of the National Probation Service. That is another reason to make the change.

<P>
The case for change is straightforward. It is important that sentences are understood and our intention, in renaming some of them, is to make their purposes clear. To promote greater confidence in the criminal justice system, we seek to enable the public readily to understand the language of sentencing. Professionals do not always let the public in, and can reinforce that exclusion by the use of their own terminology and jargon. The language that we use is important, as we have learned elsewhere. The change of name reflects more accurately the fact that the order is a community sentence designed to rehabilitate the offender. We should remember that much good rehabilitation work is done, and we should recognise that fact explicitly in the name of the order. I was not persuaded by the case made by the hon. Member for Surrey Heath-eloquent though he was-that we should not follow this route, and I urge my hon. Friends to support the inclusion of the clause.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. As the amendments grouped under clause 42 all concern renaming, I would suggest that, in the light of what has been said, it might be convenient for the Committee to discuss them as part of the stand part debate on clause 38.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I note what you say, Mr. Maxton. At this stage, however, I am responding to what the Minister said in the stand part debate for clause 36.

<P>
I am surprised that the Liberal Democrats do not support us, given that the National Association of Probation Officers feel so strongly about the matter. It was less of a surprise that the Minister responded as she did; clearly, she does not have much room for manoeuvre. I hope that, despite what she said, the Minister and her officials will have heard the strength of feeling and will recognise that we are bound to return to the matter. Pressing this stand part motion to a vote would send out useful signal about the strength of feeling. We will be raising some slightly different points on the next two clauses that are, to some extent, linked, but I will not repeat the arguments that I made in this debate.

<P>
I am not satisfied by the Minister's reponse. The name chosen by the Government will lead to misunderstanding and ridicule. As we have expressed strong views, we would like to vote on the matter.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> Once again, the Opposition are in agreement with the National Association of Probation Officers, which opposes the change of name for community service orders. Its representatives have told me, and perhaps other members of the Committee, that community service has a higher profile than the Home Office appears to believe. From several years' experience of work on criminal cases at the Bar, I know that community service orders have played a substantial and successful part in criminal justice. There is no good purpose in changing the name-it is yet another example of a Labour Government indulging in change for change's sake.

<P>
The community service order has existed for some 25 years. Because of the considerable publicity surrounding community service orders that have been served on a number of high-profile offenders, the public have been made aware that community service is imposed directly as an alternative to a custodial sentence. That is made clear in books on criminal procedure, in training received by judges from the Judicial Studies Board, and in work undertaken by court clerks in advising magistrates. That is one reason why benches of magistrates and judges have to consider community service as a possible alternative. It is intended to be an order requiring work as an act of reparation. The National Association of Probation Officers is right to say that community service should have a positive effect on the self-esteem of those who carry out such orders, as well as providing reparation to the community.

<P>
The National Association of Probation Officers is worred that the Government's proposed change of name will make it
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>harder to engage with offenders on work schemes.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
As you rightly said, Mr. Maxton, all the amendments that are grouped under clause 42 in the selection list are relevant to the changes that we are proposing. We think that the change of name is wrong, and the amendments would, in effect, restore the original name to the Bill. I make no apology for that, because we believe strongly that the change of name serves no good purpose, and the Bill would be greatly improved if the order's original name were retained.

<P>
Given the pressure that the Government are likely to face in the other place, we hope that they will eventually concede that point. Just as the Government were eventually persuaded by the view that the new name originally proposed for the probation service was a bad idea, they will eventually be forced to change their minds in this regard. I hope that the Liberal Democrats will support us and not pursue a third way. The hon. Member for Taunton made an ingenious suggestion during our previous debate, and-who knows?-she may exercise her ingenuity again.

<P>
We need to respond to the genuine concerns of many organisations, including the National Association of Probation Officers, which provided a succinct brief and made some good points with which we agree. Many other organisations, including the Bar Council and the Law Society, made the same point. It is important to stress that this serious concern involves much more than innate conservatism, although I am delighted and proud to represent a party that says, ``If it ain't broke, don't try to fix it.''. We feel that strongly in this context. There is no point in having separate votes on each of these matters.

<P>
If the hon. Lady is not prepared to return to the original name, the Government may be defeated. In the other place, a wide cross-section of opinion may form against them. I should not be surprised if Law Lords, bishops and cross-bench peers joined Conservative and-who knows?-Liberal Democrat peers to inflict a defeat on the Government. There is no good reason to change. Almost all of the organisations have argued against change because it will not achieve anything and it will further confuse the situation. Why not leave things alone?

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. It is worth pointing out that if the hon. Member for Surrey Heath wants to do so, he can move amendment No. 5 formally when we reach clause 42.

<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> I shall give some comfort and succour to the hon. Gentleman. A core part of the behaviour of certain offenders-I make no speculations about the percentage-involves the way in which they view themselves and their self-esteem. A spiral can develop in which they think, ``I am not the sort of person who does anything good in the community, and I will continue not to do good things.'' A community service order can have a positive effect because it increases self-esteem and makes people believe that they can give something back and carry out acts of reparation. They feel that they can do something useful in the community.

<P>
In view of the NAPO briefing, which was convincing, and the speech of the hon. Member for Surrey Heath, which was equally convincing, we shall support the hon. Gentleman in a vote, if there is one.

<P>
<B>Jane Kennedy:</B> I do not know, Mr. Maxton, whether you, like me, follow popular culture. If so, you will know that Les Battersby is currently serving a community service order. I am following his experiences with interest on the sundry opportunities that I get to do so.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I do not wish to sound like one of those judges, but who is he?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hawiins:</B> A fictitious person.

<P>
<B>Jane Kennedy:</B> Indeed. He is a fictitious person-a character on the estimable ``Coronation Street'', whose characters are all but real, especially to those of us who follow it assiduously.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> The Parliamentary Secretary needs to be very careful. She will remember the fuss that resulted when the Home Secretary got involved in a big media campaign about another fictitious character in a different soap opera. I should not want the hon. Lady to run to risk of incurring the cynical remarks of the sort that were made about the Home Secretary. People said that he had indulged in a fictitious person's campaign.

<P>
<B>Jane Kennedy:</B> I have no intention of launching a campaign claiming that Les Battersby is innocent.

<P>
I recognise the spirit in which the debate has been conducted and the concerns that have been expressed. We have received a number of representations from voluntary groups about the fact that the community service that they do is confused in the public mind with work that is done by offenders as a punishment. That is just one of the factors that we must bear in mind in considering the change. It does not represent change for change's sake; there are valid reasons for making it in the form that the clause proposes.

<P>
Our reason for renaming certain community sentences is to make their purpose clearer and to promote greater confidence in our criminal justice system. The public must readily be able to understand the language that we use and victims need to be able to relate to sentences. The change of name more accurately reflects that the main purpose of the community order is to punish the offender. Too often, the public see community sentences as a soft option, yet statutory work in the community places rigorous demands on the offender. The punitive nature of this type of community sentence is frequently overlooked. The change of name would remedy that.

<P>
The amendment, which we are not debating, would have left the name of a community service order unchanged.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We are debating the amendment, but it has not been moved. There is a difference.

<P>
<B>Jane Kennedy:</B> Thank you for that clarification, Mr. Maxton.

<P>
If we did not include the clause in the Bill, we would have missed an opportunity to inform the majority of the public, and victims, as to the primary purpose of the sentence.

<P>
The remaining amendments that we have agreed to debate are consequential amendments arising from amendments to leave out clauses 36, 37 and 38, which change the names of probation orders, community service orders and combination orders. The amendments would delete references to the renamed orders. However, as I said, our intention to rename the orders is clear. The changes will provide much greater clarity on sentencing and a greater public understanding of the sentences. The amendments would result in the keeping of names that are largely meaningless to the public.

<P>
 I note that the amendments do not offer any alternative names, yet it is hard to believe that anyone other than a professional would understand what a combination order is. Such an order combines elements of probation supervision and requirements to do unpaid work that is designed both to punish and rehabilitate the offender. The new name proposed in the clause-the community punishment order-will ensure that there can be no doubt as to its intention.

<P>
The hon. Member for Surrey Heath is right to place on the record the concerns that are being expressed. It is the responsibility of the Government to justify changes that are made. In this case, the proposed change is sensible and proportionate and I hope that members of the Committee will support the inclusion of the clause in the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I am not surprised, of course, that the Parliamentary Secretary has not been prepared to accept my case. I am grateful to her for recognising that it is right to debate the issues and for us to draw attention to the strongly-held views of organisations. However, the Government have failed their own test, because the hon. Lady has not provided satisfactory justification for the changes. She has failed to deal with the extra confusion that will be caused by explaining the new situation. Unfortunately, that is a hard test to satisfy in the case of something that has become as well known as the community service order.

<P>
The hon. Lady mentioned that she has received various submissions from voluntary groups suggesting a change. I have not seen those submissions. Will she write to me and other members of the Committee to clarify which organisations were involved, perhaps including copies of correspondence?

<B>Jane Kennedy:</B> I cannot give detailed examples at the moment. however, it may help the Committee's deliberations if I make them available.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Lady. That is helpful. Despite the fact that those representations, which I have never seen, may exist, I do not believe that they are likely to outweigh the strong concerns that have been raised by the organisations to which I referred in opening the debate. However, I realise that I must move the amendments formally when we reach clause 42.

<P>

<P>
I am grateful to the hon. member for Taunton for saying that if the matter were pressed to a vote on this occasion, the Liberal Democrats would support it. That may become extremely relevant in another place. I said in opening the debate that I saw no point in pressing each amendment to a Division, but it would be helpful if on a future occasion, perhaps in another place, the Liberal Democrats were similarly prepared to support the official Opposition on the matter. We shall bank what the hon. Member for Taunton has said on behalf of her party, as it may become extremely relevant later.

<P>
No purpose would be served today by detaining the Committee and pressing for a vote. It is difficult to avoid mentioning issues relating to clause 38, but I shall deal with that in the next clause stand part debate.

<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<P>
Clause 37 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<H4><center>Clause 38<w7></center></H4>

<H4><center>Combination orders renamed community punishment and rehabilitation orders<w7></center></H4>

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> Once again, we see no need to change the name. On Second Reading, some of the Parliamentary Secretary's colleagues, especially the Home Secretary, suggested that it was misconceived to say that some of the new names would be open to ridicule. I was therefore interested that the National Association of Probation Officers used the word ``ridicule'' in its briefing. It believes that the term ``combination order'' is clumsy and that the name will lead to those employed to supervise the orders being ``held up to ridicule''. That is a clear case of QED-we were right to suggest that the new names that the Government propose will be a matter for ridicule: we have proof positive from NAPO, which volunteered the same word.

<P>
NAPO especially objects to the fact that its members will become punishment officers. It believes that the name is negative and punitive, and, for the reasons that the hon. Member for Taunton and I mentioned, strongly opposes it. Once again, the Government are introducing yet another new name to no good purpose, which will cause ridicule for those at the sharp end. I am worried about those who deal on the street with difficult people.

<P>
Those of us who have worked in criminal courts know that being a probation officer is not easy. I have worked with many good probation officers, as I have said previously, and I know that they need and deserve our support. I do not hold a brief for every probation officer; I have also worked with some for whom I did not have much time, nor, much more importantly, did some of the judges. However, they are a minority. The vast majority of probation officers are dedicated people trying to do a difficult job well, and they do not want their job to be made more difficult by being a subject of ridicule.

<P>
Once again, the Parliamentary Secretary should listen-

<P>
<B>Dr. George Turner </B>(North-West Norfolk): The hon. Gentleman is being rather repetitive. I have tried hard not to extend the Committee's time, but at no time does he mention the public. I realise that by training he is a lawyer-all his instincts seem to be what suits lawyers and probation officers-but does he genuinely believe that the public understand the difference between ideas of community service? They believe that it is what the town mayor and borough councillors provide. I ask him to stop and think. He has not suggested any alternatives. The public do not understand what the names mean, and the public are more important than the professionals who deal with such cases in the courts.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> The hon. Gentleman does me a slight injustice because I talked about that at an earlier stage. We are no longer talking about community service but have moved on to combination orders. In the debates on the earlier two clauses I said that I agreed with those who argued that after 25 years the general public has generally got used to these names. I fundamentally disagree with the hon. Gentleman. The one point on which he clearly does not follow me is that if one introduces new names that are even less well understood, it will make the confusion that he describes much worse.

<P>
Does the hon. Gentleman think that the public will understand when they read in their local paper that someone has been made the subject of a combination order? Will that be better understood than a community service order or a probation order? I suggest that he is hoist by his own petard. Whether we are talking about the interests of the public, the probation service, the professionals at the sharp end, or whoever, no good purpose is served by introducing this. We are therefore against it and once again the Government will have serious trouble in another place, if not now.

<P>
<B>Jane Kennedy:</B> I understand why the hon. Gentleman has tabled this series of amendments, but he is on the weakest ground of all here. I question his assertion that combination orders are well known. Research by Hough and Roberts showed that the public had poor knowledge of sentencing and community punishment. It is important to remember that community sentences are punishments. I refer the hon. Gentleman back to clause 2, which refers to punishment as being an overriding aim of the new service that we are creating in the Bill.

<P>
While it is important to take seriously the concerns expressed by the organisations representing professionals in the field, it is equally important to make sure, as my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Norfolk (Dr. Turner) rightly pointed out, that the public and victims have a better understanding of the sentences that courts are passing. The clause is therefore an essential modernisation of the current sentences.

<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> The hon. Lady just said that it was important to remember that punishment is an overriding aim of the new probation service. However, during our debate on the aims and functions of the service, her right hon. Friend the Minister said that rehabilitation was an overriding function. If punishment is not an overriding function of the probation service, one would expect the names of orders to describe the fucntions that the service is carrying out. Does that not therefore argue the opposite of what the hon. Lady has just said?

<P>
<B>Jane Kennedy:</B> Punishment is one of the three aims of the service. The hon. Lady's intervention does not deflect from the points that I am making which is that sentences need to be understood. As I said earlier, our reasons for renaming certain community sentences is to make their purpose absolutely clear. As I have repeatedly said, the language that we use must be readily understood by the public at large in order to promote greater confidence in our criminal justice system. That is a prime example of how the use of plain English can help the understanding of the work of the courts and community sentences.

<P>
We believe that the changes introduced by the clause clearly and accurately reflect that the audit is a community sentence designed to both punish and rehabilitate the offender. I genuinely fail to understand the case made by the National Association of Probation Officers that its members feel that they would be subject to ``ridicule''-I think that that was the word that the hon. Member for Surrey Heath used-as a result of implementing these orders. Clearly we will continue to receive representations, but the case that the hon. Gentleman has made against the change of name has not been proved. The Government's position bears close scrutiny, and I am confident that we will be supported on the matter in the House and in the other place.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I am grateful that the Minister said that she was prepared to go on engaging in dialogue. That is important. As the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk said, our purpose is to protect the public. It would be helpful to have a continuing dialogue between Government and Opposition that involves consultees, including the National Association of Probation Officers. She does not accept our arguments today but, given that the Bill will have to pass through other stages, we can write to her to expand on some of them. It is better to do that than to detain the Committee further. In the light of her helpful remarks, I do not seek to bring about a Division on the clause.

<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<P>
Clause 38 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<H4><center>Clause 39</center></H4>
<H4><center>Exclusion orders</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 131, in page 22, line 13, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(c) shall only be made if the offence is one of racial hatred, sexual harassment, domestic violence, or an offence against children.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 136, in page 29, line 14, at end insert-

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(c) shall only be made if the offence is one of racial hatred, sexual harassment, domestic violence, or an offence against children'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> I kept quite earlier, because I was aware that I would be speaking an awful lot during the debates on the next couple of clauses.

<P>
The amendments cover the same ground of listing for specific offences. I welcome the use of new technology as a reverse tag to exclude people from the vicinity of their victims. I was assured on Second Reading that the technology would work, although some probation officers have doubts about that. That kind of reverse tag exclusion order could be especially useful in cases of domestive violence, racial hatred, stalking or offences against children. It would be useful to have a system whereby an alarm is triggered if a person enters a specified area in which a previous victim lives.

<P>
I am worried, however, that the Bill does not state any limitations on the potentially wide-ranging use of the tag, and that it might be used in non-predatory situations. The only requirements listed in subsection (5) are that it should not conflict with the legitimate exercise of religious beliefs, with the need to be in a certain place at a certain time as a result of a community order, or with employment or education responsibilities. However, there is nothing to prevent the exclusion order from being used to keep a shoplifter away from a range of shops.

<P>
The amendment list specific areas in which exclusion orders can easily be justified. The Minister may say that our list is not exhaustive, but I would like to hear, in that case, in what context she thinks an order would be inappropriate. Will she say, too, whether the orders are intended to be used for under-16s? They are far less likely than older people to be involved in the crimes listed in the amendment.

<B>Mr. John Cryer </B>(Hornchurch): My hon. Friend the Whip, the hon. Member for Weaver Vale will be glad to hear that I shall not detain the Committee for long. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister can assure us that the new technology will be in place and up to the job. An analogy with the situation that we are discussing may be found in the introduction of the Crown system. Years ago, the previous Administration signed a contract for that computer system, which was supposed to make life a lot easier for probation officers, with their mounting case loads. The idea was that those workers would be able to work more quickly, easily and efficiently. In fact, the Crown system turned out to be an enormous mistake-the previous Administration were pretty good at making them. It was dangerous, because probation officers could not cross-refer cases to find out whether a person had been a serious offender, for example. One or two of the cases, which could have been extremely dangerous, have been brought to my attention as a constituency Member of Parliament. Obviously, we do not want to go down that path again. Can my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary assure us that the technology will be in place and up to the job?

<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I understand the motivation behind the concerns of the hon. Member for Taunton. I will be interested to hear what the Parliamentary Secretary says, particularly about the working of the technology, which the hon. Lady and the hon. Member for Hornchurch (Mr. Cryer) mentioned. I did not hear whether the hon. Lady said that these were probing amendments. Perhaps she has not decided yet.

<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> They are at least probing.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I hear that they are. They provide legitimate grounds at least for inquiry, and the official Opposition are interested in the Parliamentary Secretary's reply.

<B>Jane Kennedy:</B> I understand the spirit in which the amendments were moved, and I am grateful to the hon. Member for Taunton for the opportunity to debate the issue in greater detail.

<P>
It is important to understand that the amendments would make exclusion orders and exclusion requirements of community rehabilitation orders available only for particular offences. The amendments would restrict an order to an offence of
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>racial hatred, sexual harassment, domestic violence, or an offence against children.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The hon. Lady's point is valid.

<P>
The new powers of exclusion give courts another means of protecting those who could be at risk from an offender in the community. A court will be able to consider exclusion when sentencing an offender for any offence for which the penalty is not fixed by law. If it is important to exclude the offender from a place or places, the court may prohibit him or her from entering that place.

<P>
A court may also order that the exclusion requirement be electronically monitored, and I will respond to the points made about that by my hon. Friend the Member for Hornchurch shortly. The electronic monitoring control centre will register any breach of a requirement, and appropriate action will be taken. Electronic monitoring will provide better enforcement and better public protection. We intend the new power to be available for use on all offenders serving sentences in the community, not only those who have committed particular offences. However, that does not mean that we have forgotten the offender's rights.

<P>
We will table amendments to protect those rights. As hon. Members will have learned, any person-usually the victim-whose permission is needed to place equipment to monitor exclusion in his or her house will have a statutory right to see the exclusion order. That is right, because the victim will need to know for how long and at what times the offender is excluded. However, we are worried about the victim seeing the whole community rehabilitation order when the exclusion is only one of the conditions. The offender could be placed at risk of reprisal from a victim who had seen details on where the offender would be while at a probation centre or on community service. Therefore, we are considering how best to preserve the victim's rights to know the terms of the exclusion while curtailing the right to more sensitive information.

<P>
The hon. Member for Taunton raised an issue relating to offenders aged under 16. It is important to remember that the maximum period of exclusion for young offenders will be three months, as opposed to one year for adults.

<P>
Exclusion gives a valuable new power to the courts. It will be up to the courts to use it appropriately, but we see no advantage in restricting its use to particular offences or offenders. It would be in no one's interest to restrict the court's powers in the way proposed by the amendments, although we understand the intention behind them. Courts will have no reason to impose exclusion unnecessarily. To curtail its availability might deprive a court of the power to protect a member of the public who is at risk from an offender, just because the offender's crime falls into the wrong category. That needs to be borne in mind.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> The Parliamentary Secretary may be coming on to the technical aspects of the matter.

<P>
<B>Jane Kennedy:</B> I am.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I thank the Minister for that and for her helpful comment about amendments that the Government may table in future, which will allow us to consider the matter later, but does she recognise that some people would be concerned that reverse tagging, as it is called, will be a kind of Big Brother watching us? I do not use those words lightly. There will be considerable misunderstanding of the technology.

<P>
<B>Jane Kennedy:</B> Exclusion will not be an arduous imposition on the offender. After all, he or she has only to comply with the requirement not to visit the prohibited place or places; that should not be too difficult.

<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Hornchurch raised the issue of the case record and management system, which is the probation computer system. I understand that his concern has been widely expressed elsewhere. It will be replaced, but despite its faults, which we acknowledge, it is better than no system. It is separate from the technology for the enforcement of exclusion orders. We will come shortly to clause 40, which provides for the technology to be piloted to ensure that it works before it is rolled out nationwide.

<P>
Any attempt to restrict a sentence in the way that the amendment proposes runs a risk of making it unintentionally unavailable to deserving cases. The amendments would not allow exclusion to be imposed where an offender had a particular victim, but the crime was not related to race or sexual harassment and involved neither a child nor someone in a domestic relationship with the offender. Examples of other cases that might require exclusion are where someone had victimised his ex-business partner with whom he had fallen out, an episode of road rage or where someone persistently shoplifted-the hon. Member for Taunton raised the issue of shoplifting-from a particular shop. It seems unnecessary and possibly disadvantageous to curb the new powers in the way proposed. I hope that the hon. Lady will accept that her amendments were probing ones, allowing us a useful opportunity to put on record Government thinking on the use of the power, and will not press them to a vote.

<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> The Minister is anxious for exclusion orders to be vailable for all offences, but I am pleased that she recognises the need-as so often in the debate-to balance the rights of offenders against the need to protect victims and that the Government will table amendments on that. The Minister initially concentrated on exclusion from a victim, but later said that exclusion might also be from a named place. In the light of the Minister's response, and of the next two amendments that I shall move which deal with proportionality, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 132, in page 22, line 24, at end insert

<P>

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`; and shall be proportionate to the harm caused'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> In light of our previous discussions, I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will find the amendments favourable, because they would not restrict the list of offences about which she was particularly concerned. They deal with the fact that the exclusion order should be proportionate to the harm caused, or the harm that could be caused. We are trying to ensure that exclusion orders are not issued for relatively minor offences. We all accept that the ludicrous end of the scale would be when someone who was persistently convicted for stealing a Mars bar was excluded from the entire shopping centre. Which point in the scale would the Minister consider to be sensible? I shall cite a difficult example: if someone was convicted of a racial offence, should he be excluded from the row of shops because he harassed one shopkeeper or should he be excluded from the one shop?

<P>
When discussing the protection of children earlier in our proceedings, the Minister of State said that he was concerned about the proportionality of the punishment to the offence. I, too, am worried about that and if this part of the Bill is left unamended, if will offer the courts scope to impose a sentence that is not proportionate to the offence.

<P>
<B>Jane Kennedy:</B> The hon. Lady has made a thoughtful contribution to our debate. I understand the thinking behind the amendments.

<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> Hear, hear.

<P>
<B>Jane Kennedy:</B> The hon. Gentleman is back. We have made provision in schedule 6 for the new exclusion order to be a community order and, clearly, the new exclusion requirements under clause 44 will, by definition, also be part of a community sentence. The provisions will be subject to the general legislative provisions that already govern community sentences. Courts will, for example, not be allowed to impose an exclusion order unless the offence was serious enough to warrant such a sentence. That restriction is part of the sentencing framework established by the Criminal Justice Act 1991.

<P>
In deciding whether the offence was serious enough, the court must take into account all the information about the offence that is available to it. It must choose the order that is the most suitable for the offender, taking account, if it wishes, of any information that it has about the offender. The same statute also requires the restriction on liberty imposed by a community order to be commensurate with the seriousness of the offence. The Government intend all those safeguards to apply to exclusion orders and conditions, and the Bill provides for that.

<P>
I understand the concerns expressed by the hon. Member for Taunton about the potential consequences of breaches of the orders and it might be helpful if I explain what would happen when someone does breach the exclusion requirements. A breach falls under the same proposals as for other community orders. An unacceptable failure to comply would result in a warning being issued to the offender. If there was a second unacceptable failure to comply within 12 months, the offender would be referred back to the court for breach of proceedings. If the exclusion order was monitored electronically, it would be possible to recognise the breach more accurately as a result of which the situation would be picked up and identified by the responsible contractor and would improve clarity when determining whether there had been a breach.

<P>
I hope that I have helped to a degree to clarify circumstances that might apply if a breach occurred. Will the hon. Lady think hard before deciding whether to press the amendment to a Division? It would require the courts to impose exclusion orders and conditions that are proportionate to the harm caused. The overarching legislation that governs the imposition of community sentences already provides for that. It is worth noting that an exclusion order will bite on an offenders' right to respect for private or family life and any interference with that right must be necessary and proportionate. After 2 October 2000, when the Human Rights Act takes effect, the courts will be bound to act in compliance. Proportionality is already incorporated in the clause. I hope that, with that reassurance, the hon. Lady will withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> The Parliamentary Secretary referred to other community orders and said that the courts would have to take proportionality into account. However, we are talking about a new order, which is why debate about it is so important. The Parliamentary Secretary said that it would be imposed only if the sentence were severe enough to trigger the order. I accept that, but it still does not adequately answer the question about the limitations-in terms of places-of using exclusion orders.

<P>
There may not be a problem when it comes to a named victim or several named victims, but a problem arises to the extent that someone may be excluded from a whole vicinity when the offence relates only to a specific place within it. That remains a grey area. I am worried that when the Human Rights Act comes into effect in October, several people on exclusion orders that are widely set may complain about the restriction of their rights to privacy and a normal life.

<P>
I am grateful to the Parliamentary Secretary for clarifying what will happen in the event of a breach. For the moment, I am happy to withdraw the amendment, but I cannot promise the hon. Lady that we shall not return to it at a later date. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> We now move on to clause 40 and the part of the Bill that deals with drug use and testing. Several amendments are proposed here: they mainly apply to clause 40, but amendments Nos. 149 and 150 relate to clause 42.

<P>
Clause 40 provides for drug abstinence orders to be applied to those convicted of an offence. Before the Committee commenced this morning, the hon. Member for Surrey Heath suggested that I was opposed to abstinence. To put it on the record and to set his mind at rest, I am not opposed to abstinence, expecially regarding chemical substances. Personally, I have virtually abstained from taking all such substances. I am a goody two-shoes: I do not smoke or take illegal drugs and I drink alcohol no more than once every couple of months and have often gone without it for six months or more.

<P>
<B>Mr. Mike Hall </B>(Weaver Vale): Salt?

<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> No, I do not use salt either. If we go down this road, people will realise what a crank I am.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I hope that the hon. lady will not go too far down that road.

<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> No, I will not, Mr Maxton, but abstinence is my middle name. My personal decisions are, of course, different from the decisions that we make in Committee for other people.

<P>
The new order achieves no useful purpose. The Government recently introduced drug treatment and testing orders. I understand from the statistics that so far, half of the offenders placed on those orders have completed their course of treatment without regressing. Such drug treatment is obviously proving successful and has a positive outcome. Treatment can also be made a condition of an existing probation order. The big difficulty is delay in access to treatment. That is true for offenders and non-offenders alike.

<P>
The drugs abstinence order in the Bill has no requirement for treatment. That is my main concern, which the amendments seek to address.
 
<P>
It is commonly accepted by people who work in the drugs field that class A drug users will not stop using class A drugs just because the court tells them to. The Home Office guidance relating to drug treatment and testing orders states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Simply stopping taking a dependent drug can be serious and even life-threatening. Offenders who are dependent should be warned against sudden cessation of use in such cases.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Home Office accepts that it may be dangerous or life-threatening for someone who is an habitual user suddenly to stop taking class A drugs, assuming that they would do so just because a court told them to. Treatment is also needed.

<P>
The simple requirement to abstain in clause 40 gives the impression that change would be immediate and a positive test result would be a breach. Amendment No. 148 would therefore replace the words ``abstain from misusing'' with
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``achieve and maintain abstinence from''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
to emphasise that saying to a drug-user, ``Abstain from using that drug that you have been using for some time,'' will not automatically change a person's behaviour. It is more positive to say that he or she must work to achieve abstinence and then maintain it.

<P>
I shall not go through other amendments in the group individually; they are consequential on making the key differentiation between simply demanding abstinence and helping people to achieve it.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I shall be brief. The hon. Member for Taunton used some of the phraseology used by the National Association of Probation Officers but she was moderate enough not to say that NAPO stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>As far as NAPO can see this new order serves no purpose at all<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Those are strong words, which I place on the record. Although the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk said that we should not spend so much time talking about the views of professionals, my view, as I said in response to the hon. Gentleman's intervention, is that professionals at the sharp end know best how to protect the pubic. NAPO's view on this, as on other matters about which it has written to members of the Committee is right; unfortunately, once again, the Government have introduced a measure that they have not fully thought through.

<P>
We are determined to do whatever we can to toughen up the law on the abuse of illegal drugs. Hon. Members such as the hon. Member for Newport, West (Mr. Flynn), who are not members of the Committee, campaign for the relaxation of drugs laws, but no one on the Committee seriously proposes that. I do not agree with the hon. Member for Taunton-

<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> I agree with much of what the hon. Member for Newport, West campaigns for; I say on his behalf, for the record, that he is against the use of drugs. He does not believe that the current drug laws are helpful in preventing the use and misuse of drugs and I share his view.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will be grateful that he has such strong support from the Liberal Democrat Front Bench. I have debated the matter with the hon. Member for Newport, West in the Chamber and on radio and television. I can tell the hon. Lady that I had a pretty good idea, throughout this and the previous Parliament, where the hon. Member for Newport, West was coming from and I do not fully accept that his views are as limited as the hon. Lady's.

<P>
The Committee must be sure that what the Government propose will help in the battle against drugs. I have prosecuted and defended in many drugs cases and, like all Members of Parliament, I share the concerns of those who are working in my constituency to help drugs offenders and to reduce the amount of drug abuse. I pay tribute to all those involved in those legitimate efforts because, as we all know, the abuse of illegal drugs leads to other crime. Much property crime is committed by drug addicts to fund their habit and the funds raised from serious crime are often invested in the supply and importation of drugs. If ever there were any doubts about that, recent publicity about a murder conviction should have put them to rest. Reporting since the case clearly shows that the offender-who is now serving a life sentence-was previously involved in the reinvestment of criminal profits in drugs offences.

<P>
I am concerned, as Ministers should be, when I see an organisation such as NAPO saying, once again, on this clause that the Government's proposals will not work. NAPO suggests in strong terms that offenders are being set up to fail. They will not face automatic custody, but will be dealt with by breach courts in the normal way. A recent study conducted by the Inner London probation service into the outcomes of breach proceedings during 1988 and 1999 showed that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>21 per cent. of those subject to breach proceedings received a custodial sentence.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The National Association of Probation Officers rightly concludes that if that outcome were repeated with the group of people who might receive these orders, the prison population would increase by up to 10,000 prisoners a year. The Home Secretary would not want to see that, nor would the Treasury. I am sure that the Government are not looking for that sort of explosion in the prison population. I want to place on record what those at the sharp end think will result from the order.

<P>
If the Government were making a proposal that would tackle the drugs menace more seriously, we would be supporting it. The Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister know that I have spoken regularly on drugs issues and always on the side of toughening the law. I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will be able to convince the Committee that that will be the case, but perhaps in another place or on Report, the provisions might be improved so as to address some of NAPO's concerns. If so, it may well be that the law will be toughened up and the provisions would be worthy of support. I shall not vote against them at this stage, but it is important to put on record NAPO's gave reservations. It may, of course, be mistaken about the effect, but when it writes in such strong terms that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>this new order serves no new purpose at all<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and could put up the prison population by 10,000 a year it is a matter of concern.

<P>
Having said that I want to see drugs provisions toughened up, not weakened, I await with great interest the Parliamentary Secretary's response to the debate. These are serious issues. I hope that she will say, as she has on a number of earlier occasions, that the Government are prepared to keep an open mind and to listen to representations from NAPO and other bodies. If there are ways in which these provisions can be strengthened at a later stage, perhaps by Government amendments, we will look at those with equal interest.

<P>

<B>Jane Kennedy:</B> We have a valuable opportunity to put on the record exactly what our intention is by the introduction of this new order. The contributions from hon. Members have been thoughtful and I recognise the concerns expressed. It will be useful for me to explain to the Committee that the drug abstinence order will complement the drug testing and treatment orders that we are piloting and expect to roll out nationally later this year. The drug testing and treatment order is designed for drug misusing offenders who show willingness to address their drug problem and are assessed as suitable for treatment.

<P>
The drug abstinence order will be applicable to offenders aged 18 years and over who are dependent on or have a propensity to misuse specified class A drugs and who have committed a trigger offence, which is one or more of the offences that research shows are most commonly committed to buy drugs. The courts may also make a drug abstinence order where they are of the opinion that misuse of class A drugs caused or contributed to the offence.

<P>
The new order can, as with a probation order-soon to be known as community rehabilitation order-be set for any period between six months and three years. The Secretary of State will have the power, by order, to alter the maximum and minimum length of the order, as set out in the clause, subject to the draft affirmative resolution procedure. That provision is common to other community orders.

<P>
<H5>6.15 pm<w7></H5>
</P>

<P>
It is important to remember that the drug abstinence order will enable a probation officer to keep a check on an offender's progress by using random drug testing. As with the drug treatment and testing order, we intend to pilot the drug abstinence order to establish how drug testing can be used most effectively before extending it more widely. Clause 40 provides that a court may make a drug abstinence order only in those areas notified by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State where arrangements are in place for its implementation.

<P>
The hon. Member for Taunton asked what the point was of introducing what is effectively a drug testing order, without treatment being allied to it. The purpose is clear.

<P>
<B>Mr. John Cryer:</B> Is there a case for arguing that it would be wise to wait until we knew the effect of the drug treatment orders and how they had bedded down, before proceeding with drug abstinence orders?

<P>
<B>Jane Kennedy:</B> If we did that, we would remove from the courts an important new power, which evidence shows has an effect. I have examples of cases where the powers have been used by the courts and have been effective. Also, in response to my hon. Friend the Member for Hornchurch, drug treatment and testing orders are for a different group of offenders. We would not necessarily learn from the piloting of the drug treatment and testing orders how the new order will impact on the particular offending groups that we are trying to address.

<P>
The hon. Member for Taunton asked why treatment is not linked to the order. We want to deter drub misusers from further drug use while under supervision and help identify offenders who should be receiving treatment. American research suggest that drug testing can deter drug misuse. In California, a civil addicts programme included a community sentence with testing and no treatment. The Americans found that drug use and crime were reduced while offenders were on the programme. On the basis of that evidence, the Government believe that the order will be a useful weapon against drug abuse.

<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> The Parliamentary Secretary says that the evidence from the United States is that use of drugs was reduced while offenders were subject to an order. Has a follow-up study shown whether that is sustained when the order no longer applies? My key point is that if an abstinence order is not linked to treatment, it will not be effective. The hon. Lady says that evidence shows that the order is effective. Is it effective in the long term?

<P>
<B>Jane Kennedy:</B> I am not aware of any evidence from a follow-up study. However, the evidence from America is of interest and value, and underlines why the drug abstinence order will work, despite the reservations of the hon. Member for Surrey Heath.

<P>
The drug abstinence order and the drug abstinence requirements are tough measures, designed to reduce and prevent drug-related crime. Their meaning is clear. All concerned, particularly the offender, should be under no illusion about the intention behind the order and its requirements. Drug misuse and crime are strongly connected. Approximately 50,000 to 60,000 problem drug users are arrested and prosecuted each year. Each one of that group alone may commit 150 crimes a year-that is almost 7.5 million offences. We are determined to use each stage of the criminal justice system to break the link between drugs and crime. The abstinence order and the requirement are designed to do just that. These are not simply monitoring exercises, as the hon. Lady's amendment implies.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> NAPO suggests that perhaps 40,000 to 50,000 abstinence orders could be made each year. Does the hon. Lady agree?

<P>
<B>Jane Kennedy:</B> I do not have that information to hand but I shall try to provide it for the hon. Gentleman.

<P>
Offenders who are made subject to the order or requirement will be tested for heroin or crack cocaine use. A positive test result will of course require action by the supervising probation officer. This could take the form of encouraging the offender into treatment if he or she is not already on a programme because a positive test could be an early indicator of the onset of problematic drug misuse. So an offender's inability to maintain abstinence will be flagged up through random testing.

<P>
The positive test result will not in itself inevitably lead to action for breach of the order or requirement. As the piloting of the drug treatment and testing order made plain, drug misuse is a relapsing condition that takes time to stabilise. Breach action may not be necessary on positive tests where all other indications of the offender's conduct are positive. A failure to keep appointments for drug testing will render the offender liable to the warning and breach procedures in respect of community orders that are set out in clause 46. Abstaining from specified class A drugs is a requirement, not an option. Although I have absolute respect for people like the hon. Member for Taunton, whose middle name is abstinence, I frequently go on the wagon-to introduce a lighter note into the debate-only to fall off at the next corner. Diluting the description of drug abstinence orders by calling them drug monitoring orders would reduce their impact. I hope that the hon. Lady has been reassured to some extent by my description of the Government's thinking.

<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> The Minister of State looks surprised at the new soubriquet that I have been given. He missed my earlier exposition. Perhaps he is glad that he did.

<P>
I said earlier in the context of our amendments that I believe that abstaining from any type of drug, especially evil drugs, is best. However, remembering the remarks of the hon. Member for Surrey Heath, I do not believe that the current drug laws are effective at preventing drug use or abuse, which is why I think that they should be reconsidered. I agree with NAPO that abstinence orders are unlikely to be of use in preventing drug use and abuse, especially in the long term. I appreciate the order's purpose, but I feel that it is pointless to tell a person to abstain from a practice that is habitual if there is no link with the availability and offer of treatment. I do not understand how it can have any effect if that link is not there.

<P>
The Parliamentary Secretary said that if a person has a positive test, so is not abstaining, a probation officer might offer treatment. The next group of amendments relate to the availability of treatment in various areas but I am not convinced that such an offer will always be made because often it may not be possible to put it into practice. Nor am I convinced by the evidence from the United States. It would have been useful to know whether there was a long-term study that had a follow-up, whether the abstinence was for a brief period in people subject to orders, or whether people were actually cured of their habit of using drugs.

<P>
Tough measures to reduce drug use and abuse have been in place for many years, but both continue to increase. I agree with the aims of reducing drug misuse and breaking the link between drug use and crime. However, I am not convinced that the order is a way of achieving that. We shall return to the matter in a future debate. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

I may have to speak at slightly greater length to explain the amendments that were tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Torridge and West Devon (Mr. Burnett) and me. Amendment No. 142 will, I imagine, be spoken to by the hon. Member for Hornchurch, but we also support it.

<P>
Most of the amendments are consequential, and relate to clause 40 and subsequent clauses. Amendment No. 146 relates to availability of drug treatment, as does the group as a whole, and suggests that the courts should be satisfied that an appropriate programme of drug treatment is available and can be provided to an offender. As I said earlier, the clause introduces drug abstinence orders post conviction, and failure to comply can result in a prison sentence. That raises a number of human rights issues, which we believe must be addressed. The human rights organisation Liberty supports us in that belief. It will be interesting to see whether the hon. Member for Surrey Heath accepts briefings from Liberty as gospel, in the same way as he accepts briefings from NAPO.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hawkins indicated dissent.<w7></B><P>

<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> I thought so. These days, the Minister does not take briefings from Liberty seriously.

<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Home Office (Mr. Paul Boateng):</B> I used to write them.

<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> As the Minister says, he used to write them. It is a pity that he does not still do so. If he did, we might have better legislation.

<P>
It is important that an order is made only if the court has good reason-there has been an appropriate offence, the person being sentenced is dependent on class A drugs and the dependency is related to the offence. We have discussed the number of crimes that are linked to drug use and abuse, but it is not inevitable that someone with a drug habit will commit crimes. The Department of Health and the Home Office have long acknowledged the wealth of evidence, which we discussed earlier, that drug misuse is a chronic relapsing condition. Attempts to tackle drug-driven acquisitive crime are therefore welcome, but they should reflect what we know about drug dependency and how to bring about the cessation of drug-driven offending. Drug treatment can make a positive and significant impact on such problems, but there is no evidence-except that from the United States, to which the Minister referred earlier-that testing alone can do so. I assume that the Minister of State will respond to the debate. If he has other evidence that testing alone can help solve those problems, I hope that he will tell the Committee.

<P>
A drug abstinence order or requirement should not be applied when drug treatment is needed but neither a drug testing and treatment order nor treatment in the community is available. In some areas, people are on waiting lists for months, which is the norm for drug treatment services in many parts of the country. The Government have set hundreds of targets, in all Departments, for all kinds of things, some of which are frivolous and marginal. When I asked a question in the Chamber last week about a target maximum waiting time for drug treatment, I was told that no such target was in place, and no such target was envisaged. That is a great pity. If such a target were attached to the requirement for treatment to be available, it might be more worthwhile to include such orders in legislation. Only a few weeks ago, in my constituency, I received a letter from a grandparent whose grandson, who was aged 18 or 19, had a drug habit and was waiting to go to court for an offence that he had committed. He waited for eight weeks with no available treatment. He wanted to end his drug habit, and committed suicide while waiting to go to court. That tragic and unnecessary death of a young person highlights the fact that, in Somerset, access to treatment is not easy and sometimes takes a long time, given the numbers of people going through the system. That is true for many areas of the country.

<P>
<H5>6.30 pm<w7></H5>
</P>

<P>
I am especially mindful of a recommendation of the Select Committee on Home Affairs in ``Alternatives to Prison Sentences'', which was that the Government make it an objective for all drug-misusing offenders given community sentences to have access to appropriate treatment.

<P>
Amendment No. 159 refers to proposed new section 58B of the Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000, which details the matters that have to be explained by the court to an offender before a drug abstinence order is made. Those include the effect of the order and the consequences if the offender fails to comply with it. Our amendment would ensure that the court also has a duty to explicitly tell the offender
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>where and when the treatment for drug abuse is to be made available.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng indicated dissent.<w7></B><P>

<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> I see the Minister shaking his head. I shall hear in a minute why he thinks that that is not a good idea. I would have thought that it could only be helpful, before putting in place such an order, to make explicit in the Bill the court's requirement to tell offenders the information that they will need to know if they are to abstain and comply with the order.

<P>
I shall not speak to amendment No. 142 in detail, as the hon. Member for Hornchurch will want to do so, but it questions whether the clause is compliant with article 8 of the European convention on human rights.

<P>
Amendment No. 134 states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>A court shall not order a drug test unless it has been notified by the Secretary of State that arrangements for treatment are available in the relevant area.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is to ensure that the Bill enshrines the link between testing and availability of treatment. Amendments Nos. 161 and 162 deal with community sentence drug abstinence orders. We are concerned about the imposition of compulsory abstinence requirements, which I doubt will be effective without appropriate treatment and rehabilitation. I am especially concerned that the court should have discretion to evaluate the use of such a requirement in an individual's circumstances.

<P>
<B>Dr. George Turner:</B> That is a matter of critical concern in many constituencies. A typical offender in my constituency has committed multiple thefts. Is the hon. Lady saying that the court has to prove that the offender's drug dependency caused the series of offences? If so, what standard of evidence does she suggest? How does she think that her amendments would help relieve my community from the problems of multiple thefts? In many people's opinions, they are caused by drug abuse, but that is difficult to prove in courts.

<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> In legal matters, we do not take people's opinions as good enough reason to convict someone. As I said at Second Reading, the fact that there is a correlation between two statistics does not mean that there is a causal link between them. I do not deny that there is often a causal link between acquisitive crime and the need to find money to feed a drug habit, but that link is not inevitable. The amendment suggests that the court should make the link clear.

<P>
<B>Dr. Turner:</B> The hon. Lady's amendment calls for the link to be proven. She says that she accepts it, but one has to be quite theoretical not to do so in many of the cases of which I know. The court convicts of the offence and often finds proof of large numbers of offences. What does she take as the standard of proof that the drug caused the offence?

<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> I suspect the the hon. Gentleman did not mean what he has just said: that the drug caused the offence. That is a completely different issue from a drugs habit causing someone to commit an offence. The Human Rights Act requires that the punishment should be proportionate, and relevant, to the crime. The clause can be justified only in individual circumstances if a clear link can be shown with the commission of the crime.

<P>
Amendment No. 160 would prevent a court from making a drug abstinence order when there is no local treatment available for the offender. Amendment No. 166 would amend clause 48, which gives the police power to test suspected persons for the presence of class A drugs. People who refuse to be tested face a fine or up to three months' imprisonment.

<P>
I want the hon. Member for Surrey Heath to know that I always read NAPO briefings and sometimes quote them in Committee. I understand from NAPO that the number of arrestees exceeds 1 million a year. Home Office research estimates that 20 per cent. of arrestees are drug misusers. If the powers in the clause are interpreted to mean mandatory tests for all suspects who use class A drugs, police cells will be overwhelmed with suspects. Most of the defendants would appear the next day in the magistrates courts and would face being remanded in custody. The Prison Service would experience great difficulty in coping with the numbers involved.

<P>
A test result takes several days to be returned, which would underline the need for a custodial remand. I hope that the Minister will comment on that matter, on the failure rate of such tests and on what appeal mechanism is available to someone whose test proves positive, but who suspects that it may be a false positive. The Minister may say that a second sample should be taken somewhere else to be tested, but he must bear in mind how much that will cost and how many offenders will be able to have a second test. If, despite its problems, the clause is implemented, it is essential that relevant treatment is provided if drug-related crime is to reduced.

<P>
Amendment No. 167 to clause 52 relates to release on licence. The clause allows for the drug testing of persons released from prison on parole or licence. A prisoner is most vulnerable to relapse in the first few weeks after release from prison. The clause allows for testing, but again without the proviso that treatment should be available. Access to advice and treatment in prisons is improving all the time, but I understand from NAPO that the majority of prisoners with drug problems still leave establishments without access to treatment. The improvements will take time to roll out and make a national impact.

<P>
In the mean time, it is essential that those who are released from prison with residual problems are given the help they need to avoid relapsing. Taking mandatory drug tests periodically without the guarantee of treatment will be counter-productive and lead to many people who are released on licence being returned to custody, adding to the prison population.

<P>
<B>Mr. Cryer:</B> I rise to speak to amendment No. 142, which is a probing amendment. All hon. Members can cite cases from our constituencies which show the obvious link between class A drugs and crime. I want to know the thinking behind the clause and what legal advice the Government took in drafting it. I am worried that the clause as drafted may contravene article 8 of the European convention on human rights-the right to respect for private and family life. Subsection 1 of article 8 states that everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence.

<P>
Other parts of the Bill introduce drug-testing orders. They are all related to offences that are linked to drugs. Clause 41 does not seem to be linked to drug-related crime, so people could face mandatory drugs testing when the crime of which they have been convicted has no direct bearing on drugs misuse or drug-related crime. Will my right hon. Friend the Minister say what legal advice the Government took and explain how they justified clause 41 being in isolation, as it were? The clause could bring the Government into conflict with article 8. The amendment sets out several conditions that would link the clause with drug-related crime, as a result of which the Government would not be in conflict with article 8.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I am worried about costs. I invite the Minister to pay tribute to the work that is done by organisations within prisons, such as the Rehabilitation for Addicted Prisoners Trust. The Minister has visited, as I have, Coldingley prison in my constituency and I hope that he was impressed by the work that is carried out there. I am sure that the hon. Members for Hornchurch and for Taunton are right in saying that not everything happens as it should. As the hon. Lady said, the drug treatment programme is not working as well in all custodial institutions as it is in Coldingley prison.

<P>
Although my hon. Friend the Member for Ribble Valley (Mr. Evans) is not a member of the Committee, he has spoken about such matters. There have been press reports about the existing drugs climate in Strangeways prison in Manchester. A person who had recently served a short sentence there talked to the press about his horror at the extent to which drugs were freely in circulation. I went to Strangeways when it had been rebuilt after the riot and those who were running the prison said that they hoped to have a tough regime. I do not know whether the press reports were accurate or simply sensationalised, but no doubt the closer prisons can get to a tougher regime of testing, the better. Those found with drugs in their system in Coldingley prison immediately lose all privileges. Televisions are removed from cells, and so on. Such a risk-reward system clearly works well, although it may not be possible to do the same in every prison because there are different categories of prisons.

<P>
We are discussing serious issues. I am looking forward, as are the hon. Members for Hornchurch and for Taunton, to the Minister's reponse. It has been useful for such issues to be aired. I might not agree with all the arguments, but it is valid to hold such a debate and for opinions to be canvassed. I hope that the Minister will keep under review all the issues that have been raised as the Bill proceeds through the House. We may yet see some pertinent Government amendments.

<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> The debate has been important and well worth taking seriously. All those who have contributed to it from different perspectives want to deal seriously with the problem. Our response will be focused, balanced and likely, on the evidence, to be effective. I disagree fundamentally with the hon. Member for Taunton's approach to the issue. I recognise that she is committed to seeing the problem of drug abuse addressed, but we differ on how best to ensure that people access help and how best to inculcate in them a sense of restraint and abstinence.

<P>
<H5>6.45 pm<w7></H5>
</P>

<P>
Abstinence does not come easily. It needs a context that is frankly coercive. We make no apology for that. The evidence shows that coercion helps people to restore order to chaotic and drug-abusive lives. Many of the arguments that the hon. Lady deployed against DTTOs and DAOs were employed against mandatory drug testing in prisons. She may have deployed them herself, but mandatory drug testing in prison has helped to reduce the number of positive drug tests in prisons by some 24 per cent. in three years. That results from the determination to make drug abuse in our prisons unacceptable and is achieved in a number of ways. It is done by ensuring that treatment is available and accessible.

<P>
I join the hon. Member for Surrey Heath in praising the work that has been done in Coldingley. I am glad to say that it is replicated in quality and impact elsewhere in the prison service. It is a real plus that we have managed to win over the past three years for prisoners and for society as a whole. We have tackled drugs in prison in a robust way; we have ensured that the machinery is in place for testing and we have enhanced security with the use of dogs and other measures. We have encouraged prisoners to impose a self-denying ordinance: they know what the adverse consequences of the positive test are. That has reduced their dependency on drugs and our concern now is to address through care so that when people leave prison, the good that has been achieved is not lost.

<P>
We are determined that the same focus will be provided by the legal framework and that the emphasis will on abstinence and a degree of self discipline by offender for the very reasons that my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Norfolk outlined. He spoke for the public in these matters. Indeed, the public would have some difficulty in accepting the rationale behind a number of the amendments proposed by the hon. Member for Taunton, which would detract from the effectiveness of the drug-testing programme. They would make quite unrealistic requirements for the availability of treatment services before ordering testing on arrest, as part of a community sentence or a licence from prison. They would also require drug dependence or drug-related offending to be ``proved'' before a court can make an abstinence order or other abstinence requirements.

<P>
The court is rightly required to exercise its powers of rational judgment, as my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Norfolk said. Magistrates and the jusiciary more widely are trained and well qualified to do so, and they bring the benefits of common sense as well as training to their decisions. We propose to tackle head-on what the whole Committee would recognise are a serious problem posed by drug-related crime.

<P>
I can give my hon. Friend the Member for Hornchurch the assurance that we have striven to ensure that the drug-testing proposals are ECHR-compatible. That is our advice and the view we take. It is important to regard the ECHR and the Act as enablers rather than inhibitors. In approaching policy making and legislation, we must adopt a frame of mind that always views the ECHR as an obstacle to be overcome. The ECHR is designed to ensure that the imperative to create a safe and secure society is not also an imperative that is driven irrespective of the requirements of justice and of tolerance of diverse lifestyles. Some lifestyles may not be regarded as the norm, yet properly fall within the ambit of private concerns. However, it is not intended to undermine for one moment the need for safety and security, and we believe that these measures are proportionate and reasonable.

<P>
Clause 41 deals with a pre-sentence diagnostic test, which is not a sentence in itself. The court will order the test for the purposes of sentencing-in other words, to determine the applicability of various other order. As I said, we believe that any element of interference with article 8 is proportionate and necessary and is specifically allowed for under article 8.2 as being for the prevention of disorder and crime-any further crime that might be committed by the offender. It falls within a specific ambit of the relevant clause. I understand the motives behind amendment spoken to by my hon. Friend the Member for Hornchurch, but I hope that he will accept our view that the provisions are ECHR-compatible.

<P>
We wish to ensure that our proposals in this part of the Bill are introduced on the basis of piloting-an issue that has been lost in the course of our debate so far. I do not want us to lose sight of it: it is relevant to drug abstinence orders and to issues of cost. We are going to pilot drug abstinence orders so we can assess their impact on sentences and evaluate the responses of offender to those sentences. The issues raised by the hon. Member for Taunton will need to be taken into account-by sentencers, by offenders and by those who monitor the actions of both. I assure the hon. Lady that we will take her concerns into account.

<P>
The hon. Member for Surrey Heath rightly raised the issue of costs. We expect that around 75 community sentences with drug abstinence requirements, including orders, will be made each year in the pilot areas, at a cost of about 300,000.

<P>
It is important to recognise the impact of pilots. We are not at all complacent about issues in relation to capacity and costs, but we shall make available 20 million for arrest referral schemes and 56 million for drug treatment and testing order. We recognise the problem of capacity and important work is being done jointly between the Department of Health and the Home Office on the recruitment of drug workers. Through a new campaign, we expect that by April 2001 up to 685 drug workers will have been recruited and trained.

<P>
The hon. Member for Taunton raised the issue of targets. My answer to her question in the House the other day remains, as she would expect, but the Government's drug strategy sets targets for increasing the participation of problem drug misusers in drug treatment programmes. We are using targets to drive the system and looking for a 100 per cent. increase by 2008 and a 66 per cent. increase by 2005.

<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> I note that the Minister says that the Government are using targets, but will he accept that the absence of a target maximum waiting time for treatment causes more stress and difficulty for the person trying to get off the drug habit? It also increases the period during which the link between acquisitive crime and drug use is likely to continue.

<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> It is enormously important that we do everything we can to keep waiting times to a minimum. When I looked at experience in Liverpool, I was heartened to see that people there get appointments very rapidly. Treatment availability needs to be developed and that and will continue.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> Will the right hon. Gentleman give way?

<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> No, I have to finish. In the meantime, the existence of gaps should not be a reason to deny the opportunity of identifying drug misusing offenders at arrest and monitoring their behaviour on bail or while under probation service supervision. We believe that this will go a long way towards reducing the damage done to communities by drug related crime. For that reason I commend this part of the Bill to the Committee and, although I understand the bona fides and good intentions of those who tabled the amendments, I urge hon. Members to reject them.

<P>

<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> I am pleased that the Minister recognises that this is a serious subject and that the amendments were aimed at generating an important debate about an issue on which there are different views. We all agree that the problem calls for a response, but there is perhaps a different emphasis between us on what it should be. Mine would be the availability of treatment for all drug abusers, not only offenders. Treatment for offenders should not lead to an even longer wait for those who have not offended. I am not convinced that coercion alone will change behaviour. The amendments were not intended to deny the courts the powers to impose certain orders, but to place limitations on their use. That would provide a greater chance of them being effective and of ensuring compliance with human rights legislation in terms of relevance to the crime committed. We must also ensure that the health of offenders is not put at risk because they are told to abstain without being given alternative coping mechanisms. The proposals in our amendments are not at all unrealistic. The proposal that treatment must be made available is more likely than the simple requirement of abstinence to lead to a long-term change in behaviour and a long-term reduction in crime.

<P>
<H5>7 pm<w7></H5>
</P>

<P>
The Minister said that his hon. Friend the Member for North-West Norfolk spoke for the public; we all to some extent speak for the public because we all have drug-related crime in our constituencies. Those of us whose constituencies are in the most remote rural areas have that problem too-it is not only an urban one. Pre-sentence drug testing may interfere to an extent with article 8 of the ECHR, and is likely to be tested in court in the future if it is not amended during the passage of the Bill. There will also be a capacity issue in terms of the availability of treatment, drug workers and prison places, given the increases in prison population that are likely to result from breaches of the law.

<P>
<B>Mr. John Cryer:</B> My hon. Friend mentioned article 8, which says that on the right to privacy
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>There should be no interference by a public authority<P>

<P>
except-among other conditions-in the case of the
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>prevention of disorder or crime.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
A court could reasonably argue that there would not be a link between a drug test, in the circumstances, and the future prevention of disorder or crime. That is what led me to table the amendment in the first place. I will not press the amendment, but will my right hon. Friend provide some information on the legal evidence and advice that was sought in relation to the clause?

<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I shall certainly write to my hon. Friend, although it is not usual to provide copies of legal advice.
