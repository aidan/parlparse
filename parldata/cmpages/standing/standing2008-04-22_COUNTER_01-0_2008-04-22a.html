							<a name="08042272000125"></a>The
Chairman:
						</b> Before we begin, I have a few announcements.
Members may, if they wish, remove their jackets during Committee
meetings. I emphasise at the outset that in today&#146;s proceedings
and those on Thursday&#151;that is to say during the passage of the
resolutions with which we are about to deal and then in the public
evidence sessions&#151;members of the Committee should remain seated.
When we get to clause by clause, line by line consideration, members
will conduct themselves as they usually operate in the Chamber,
standing when speaking. Please ensure that all mobile phones, pagers,
etc. are turned off or are switched to silent mode during Committee
meetings. In addition, I remind the Committee that there are money and
Ways and Means resolutions in connection with this Bill, of which
copies are available in the room. I would also like to remind members
that adequate notice should be given of amendments. As a general rule,
I and my fellow Chairman Mr. O&#146;Hara do not intend to
call starred
amendments.</div>
					<a name="08042272000007"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
process of taking oral evidence in Public Bill Committees is of course
new, and it might therefore help if I briefly explained what is
proposed, so that it can be clear to us all. The Committee will first
be asked to consider the programme motion on the amendment paper, for
which debate is limited to half an hour. We will then proceed to a
motion to report written evidence, and then a motion to permit the
Committee to deliberate in private in advance of the oral evidence
sessions, which I hope we can take formally. Assuming that the second
of those motions has been agreed to, the Committee will move into
private session. Once the Committee has deliberated, the witnesses and
members of the public will be invited back into the room and our oral
evidence session will commence. If the Committee agrees to the
programme motion, it will hear oral evidence today and on Thursday and
then revert to the more familiar proceedings of clause by clause
scrutiny next week. Before I call the Minister to move the programme
motion, I inform the Committee that I have selected amendment (a) to
the motion, which stands on the paper in the name of Mr.
Dominic Grieve. I first call Tony McNulty to move the
motion.</div>
					<a name="08042272000008"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="08042272000126"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
David Heath</b> (Somerton and Frome) (LD): On a point of
order, Mr. Bercow. I welcome you to the  Chair of
the Committee. You will recall that  in the programming
sub-committee
yesterday&#151;<i class="I">[</i>

							<a name="08042272000127"></a>The
Chairman:
						</b> Order. If we are going to conduct the
proceedings of the Committee, it is basic courtesy that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column2" />Column number: 2</div>members should listen to the member who has the floor, and that is
Mr. David
Heath.</div>
					<a name="08042272000010"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08042272000128"></a>Mr.
Heath:
						</b> You will recall, Mr. Bercow, that in the
programming sub-committee, when we were discussing the witnesses who
might potentially give oral evidence, we looked at the possibility of
inviting the Information Commissioner to give evidence. Despite the
fact that both sides of the Committee seemed to feel that it would be a
useful exercise to have evidence from the Information Commissioner, we
were told that he was not available, either today or on Thursday. Is
there  any means&#151;formally or informally&#151;by which
the Committee could invite the Information Commissioner to give written
evidence? That would be extremely
helpful.</div>
					<a name="08042272000011"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08042272000129"></a>The
Chairman:
						</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his
point of order. The short answer is that it can be done informally.
There is no formal mechanism by which to invite the Information
Commissioner&#151;or any other potential witness&#151;to submit
written evidence where that evidence is not already extant. In other
words, formally to request new material in written form is not in the
Committee&#146;s power. However, I have heard the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s point of order and will ensure that it is relayed to
the Information Commissioner. I now call Mr. Tony McNulty to
move the
motion.</div>

Mr. Heath, look forward to the Committee&#146;s
proceedings under your august chairmanship, Mr. Bercow.
Hopefully, our deliberations will be dealt with in good spirit and
temper, although we will be dealing with some very sensitive and
contentious matters. I am happy that Mr. O&#146;Hara will
be your confrère. Although these rooms are wonderful, I am an
old-fashioned sort and I hope that we will be duly dispatched back to a
rickety old Committee Room in the House of Commons where I can do very
strange things such as stand when I move a motion, especially now that
we are in spring rather than winter. I welcome everyone to the
Committee and hope that our deliberations, although at times serious,
are done in a fair and temperate
fashion.</div>
					<a name="08042272000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">The programme
motion before us follows two sets of deliberations by the Programming
Sub-Committee. What is before us represents the practicable outcome of
a range of suggestions from both sides during those deliberations. The
set of witnesses to be called is balanced and for the most part it is
an entirely relevant set of individuals, some of whom represent
organisations, who will bring timely experience to the debate. With all
due humility, I include myself and my officials in that as we will be
witnesses in the last
session.</div>
					<a name="08042272000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">In terms of
what Mr. Heath has just said, I made it very clear at the
Programming Sub-Committee that, if required, I would be happy for all
parties to write to the invitees who, for whatever reason, are unable
to come before us, asking them to submit written evidence. I am
grateful for what you said, Mr. Bercow. As Mr.
Heath quite rightly said, we sought the Information Commissioner and
the intercept commissioner. I think that Lord Stevens is unable to
attend, even though he is erroneously published in today&#146;s
<i class="I">Hansard</i> as attending. If the Chairman&#146;s request does not
elicit such information, I would be quite happy for all parties to
write to the Information Commissioner and others who have been invited,
albeit on an informal basis. We have a measured, balanced and
interesting list of witnesses and I have no doubt that they will
produce four lively sittings. They are all relevant and germane to the
issues. I do not accept the amendment and propose that the Committee
accepts the programming motion so that we can get on with the
fun.</div>

echo the Minister&#146;s welcome conservative remarks
about the need to move back to a rickety old
Committee Room next week, which would be preferable to this room for
the legislative stage of our work. I formally welcome you to your
position, Mr. Bercow. The amendment stands in the name of my
hon. and recently learned Friend the Member for Beaconsfield. I agree
with the Minister about the need to conduct these proceedings in a calm
manner, given the serious nature of the issues that they will
address.</div>

Second Reading. I am slightly surprised that the eight hon. Members who
take the Labour Whip and who spoke on Second Reading in a manner that
might be described as hostile to elements of the Bill have somehow or
other avoided selection for the Committee. The Lord Commissioner of Her
Majesty&#146;s Treasury, the hon. Member for Tynemouth may be able to
throw some light on
that.</div>

fashion. The remarks that the hon. Member for Reigate has just made
have absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with our proceedings. The
selection of hon. Members for Public Bill Committees is not a matter
for him. If he wants to move the amendment, he should continue to do
so.</div>

that it is not proper for him to be making that point. If the hon.
Gentleman wishes to move his amendment, he is absolutely welcome to do
so. This is his opportunity. However, I must repeat to the hon.
Gentleman, and I do not want to have to keep doing this, that I am not
engaged in a debate with him. I am telling him what is orderly and what

							<a name="08042272000136"></a>Mr.
Blunt:
						</b> I am grateful. On a point of order, Mr.
Bercow. At what point would it be appropriate to raise these matter in
the proceedings of a Bill Committee? I would regard it as being at the
beginning. When the proceedings of the Committee of Selection are not
reportable, and a Bill Committee is produced by a Committee of
Selection that would appear not to reflect the views of the House, at
what point is it in order to raise those
matters?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08042272000137"></a>The
Chairman:
						</b> The answer is very simple. The selection of
members for the Committee is not a matter for consideration by members
of this Committee at any stage in its proceedings. I would advise the
hon. Gentleman, if he is concerned about the matter, to take it up
through the usual channels.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column5" />Column number: 5</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08042272000138"></a>Mr.
Blunt:
						</b> Thank you, Mr. Bercow. As a member of
the usual channels, you can be sure that we already have taken it up.
However, I have now put the matter on the record, which is all that I
was seeking to do. I was not seeking to challenge the decision of the
Committee of
Selection.</div>
					<a name="08042272000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment goes to an important principle about the conduct of Public
Bill Committees. I know that the House is at an early historical stage
in dealing with Public Bill Committees. This is the second Committee on
which I have sat that takes evidence at the beginning of its
proceedings.</div>
					<a name="08042272000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is
an important issue, first, about the opportunity to hear witnesses
whose points of view might be uncongenial to those held by the
Committee and particularly to the majority on the Committee. There is
also an important point of principle about Back
Benchers.</div>
					<a name="08042272000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
suggestion that Dame Stella Rimington be a witness came to me from my
hon. Friend the Member for Lancaster and Wyre as soon as he was
notified that he had been selected to serve on the Committee. By that
point, the usual channels had, in the normal way, had more than one
discussion about which witnesses might be appropriate to assist our
proceedings. I thought that the suggestion from my hon. Friend was
excellent. However, I proposed that he make the suggestion, as a
Back-Bench member of the Committee, through the usual
channels&#151;the Clerk of the Committee&#151;so that the witness
could be regarded as not having been produced in collusion by the usual
channels and the Front
Benches.</div>
					<a name="08042272000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
important that Back Benchers should have witnesses whom they wish to
see. However, although the suggestion had my strong support and that of
my hon. and learned Friend, we received a response from the Cabinet
Office to the effect that the matter had to be dealt with through the
usual channels. I thought that that was inappropriate and that the
system ought to allow for the suggestion of witnesses from Back-Bench
members of the Committee, and should not rely on the fact that my hon.
Friend has a particularly good relationship with his usual channels.
That should not be a requirement for the endorsement of that
suggestion. However, that was the first response. It was then taken up
through the usual channels, and, to my surprise, no inquiry has been
made of Dame Stella&#146;s availability to attend. The motion put
forward by the Government yesterday at the Programming Sub-Committee
did not include Dame Stella Rimington.</div>
					<a name="08042272000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="08042272000139"></a>
							<b class="B">Martin
Salter</b> (Reading, West) (Lab): I thank
the hon. Gentleman for giving way. I am intrigued by his argument.
Will he explain how long ago Dame Stella Rimington
was involved in working for the security services and her relationship
with the Conservative
party?</div>
					<a name="08042272000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08042272000140"></a>Mr.
Blunt:
						</b> I am afraid that I am ignorant of any relationship
between Dame Stella Rimington and the Conservative party. Other hon.
Members might be able to assist on that, but I am not aware of any
relationship. Dame Stella finished being the head of MI5 in 1996, which
was 12 years ago, but she could have given&#151;or can give, if the
Committee agrees to the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column6" />Column number: 6</div>amendment&#151;important evidence on the climate in which
anti-terrorist operations are conducted. She had long experience in
that post and to a degree is freed from the immediate considerations.
Obviously, it would be inappropriate to take public evidence from the
serving head of MI5.</div>
					<a name="08042272000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">Dame Stella would be an expert
witness on the wider consequences of some of the legislative framework,
particularly the increase from 28 days to 42 days for detention without
charge. She has particular experience relating to Northern Ireland as
well as in dealing with the emerging threat from Islamic terrorism in
the 1990s. She has an impeccable professional reputation and would make
a fine witness if the Committee were inclined to agree to the
amendment. I am as much concerned about the process as I am about her
qualities as a witness, which are exemplary, so I regret that the
Government and the Cabinet Office have not seen fit to establish her
availability. I think that we should request her to attend by putting
her name on the Order Paper.

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08042272000141"></a>The
Chairman:
						</b> With regard to how I intend to deal with these
matters, I am happy to facilitate a general debate now on the merits or
demerits of the amendment and on the Government&#146;s main motion,
but it is important to stress that we have to dispose of all of the
motions&#151;there are a number of motions to dispose of&#151;no
later than two minutes past 11. That is procedurally required, and I am
sure that members of the Committee will agree that it is important not
to lose time for questioning our various witnesses. Five members are
seeking to catch my eye, which is absolutely fine, but it would be much
appreciated if colleagues could bear that in
mind.</div>
					<a name="08042272000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08042272000142"></a>Martin
Salter:
						</b> Welcome to the Chair, Mr. Bercow. I
will take your strictures for brevity extremely seriously and just want
to make three points. While it would be inappropriate to get into a
debate about the credentials of Dame Stella Rimington and the evidence
that she might give us, the hon. Member for Reigate should be aware
that the Home Affairs Committee has just concluded a lengthy inquiry in
which we took an immense amount of evidence from expert witnesses. At
no point did any Conservative member of that Committee seek to have
Dame Stella Rimington called to give up-to-date evidence. The hon.
Gentleman should bear that in mind, because he is out of line with the
views of his own colleagues on the Home Affairs Committee.</div>
					<a name="08042272000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">My final point&#151;it is
probably worth putting on the record&#151;is that I understand that
Dame Stella Rimington is involved in Conservative party policy groups,
and that does not in any way exclude her from giving useful evidence.
<i class="I">[</i>
						<i class="I">Interruption.</i>
						<i class="I">]</i> It is useful to put that on the
public record since the hon. Gentleman seems to be completely ignorant
of the fact. May I also ask the Minister to make it clear to the
Committee when he sums up how much time the House will get to discuss
the Bill on Report, because that stage is extremely important for the
Bill and it would be useful to clarify that
point?</div>
					<a name="08042272000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08042272000143"></a>Mr.
Heath:
						</b> I shall amplify that point. Although it is not
under discussion at the moment, it will be critical to have sufficient
time to discuss the Bill on Report. My 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column7" />Column number: 7</div>hon. Friend the Member for Carshalton and Wallington
cannot be here this morning due to a long-standing constituency
engagement, but he sends his apologies and will of course join us
later. The Minister of State suggested that the Bill was going to be
fun. I know that he had his tongue firmly in his cheek at the time, but
these are serious matters&#151;even the areas on which members of the
Committee agree, let alone those that are contentious, are extremely
serious. The characterisation of the Bill as fun may not hold true, but
I hope that we can conduct our affairs in an appropriate way and with
respect for each other&#146;s points of
view.</div>
					<a name="08042272000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am grateful to the Minister and to the Treasury Bench for having
listened to some of our suggestions during the early stages of this
process about who should give evidence, particularly the inclusion of
Scottish Law Officers to deal with the important issues that relate to
the Scottish law system and the way in which that is affected by the
legislation. This is an evolving procedure. This is the second Public
Bill Committee on which I have sat that has taken evidence and I am not
sure that we have all the procedures right at this stage.</div>
					<a name="08042272000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are two matters that I
should like to raise today, Mr. Bercow. The first is the
matter that I raised on a point of order and I am most grateful for
both your response and that of the Minister. Where we have agreed to
seek oral evidence and it is not possible simply because the person
involved cannot attend our Committee meetings, we should invite that
person to provide written evidence as a matter of course. That is
common sense and perhaps that could be fed back to the relevant
authorities.</div>
					<a name="08042272000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">My second
point is that the evidence sessions for this Committee finish on
Thursday evening. The deliberative sessions start on Tuesday morning.
Under the rules of the House with the three-day requirement for
amendments, any matter that arises out of the evidence that we receive
on Thursday afternoon cannot be incorporated in an amendment for the
first sitting on Tuesday morning. I do not suggest that anything will
necessarily emerge, but it seems to be a flaw in the procedures and the
Chair would perhaps need to apply some discretion in allowing a starred
amendment were that to
happen.</div>
					<a name="08042272000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is obvious
why we are not receiving evidence from the secret intelligence
community this morning or on Thursday, but having someone from that
community to give evidence would be a sensible move, even if it is
someone whose experience is not as up to date as perhaps we would wish.
Therefore I will support the amendment today. Again this demonstrates
the need for perhaps more clarity in our procedures to ensure that
where a significant part of a Committee wants to receive evidence from
a particular witness they have the opportunity to do
so.</div>
					<a name="08042272000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08042272000144"></a>The
Chairman:
						</b> I will sympathetically consider the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s request for the exercise of discretion. Beyond that
I will report back his remarks to what he called the relevant
authorities, in this case the Chairmen&#146;s
Panel.</div>
					<a name="08042272000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="08042272000145"></a>
							<b class="B">Patrick
Mercer</b> (Newark) (Con): I welcome you to the Chair,
Mr. Bercow. I rise briefly to support the amendment and to
pick up some of the comments of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column8" />Column number: 8</div>my fellow member of the Home Affairs Committee,  the hon. Member
for Reading, West. In view of the evidence that we have taken on that
Committee, our not asking for Dame Stella Rimington to come forward was
probably a mistake. The hon. Gentleman makes a very good point. I think
he is mistaken about her involvement in Conservative party policy, but
I stand to be corrected on that.</div>
					<a name="08042272000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">The great value that Dame
Stella Rimington will add is this. It became clear in our deliberations
in the Home Affairs Committee that, particularly on the issue of
detention without charge and the evolution from a state of internment
during the Northern Ireland troubles through to how that was
manipulated and manoeuvred towards the so-called end of the Northern
Ireland troubles and then into the emerging threat from Islamist
fundamentalism, she has a unique view on these two varied, but similar,
campaigns. I believe that she could give an unparalleled and very
useful insight into these
matters.</div>
					<a name="08042272000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="08042272000146"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Dominic Grieve</b> (Beaconsfield) (Con): I welcome you to the
Chair, Mr. Bercow. I want to add only a couple of points
about procedure because a serious issue is raised here. Clearly there
may be differences of opinion as to whether Dame Stella Rimington is a
sensible person for this Committee to listen to. But the point has been
well made that, for obvious reasons, we do not have access to the heads
of the security services. Therefore, individuals who have served in the
Security Service and the Secret Intelligence Service in the past are
likely to be extremely helpful to the Committee and to be able to give
evidence in a way that those who are currently serving are
not.</div>
					<a name="08042272000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second point,
which I raised last night and which troubles me far more, is that it
appears that the Committee and, indeed, the Commons generally are
toothless in this process. We rely on the usual channels to communicate
a wish, and it is then actioned by the Government to see whether the
person concerned can be brought before the Committee. It appeared that
the request had simply not been processed because the Minister had
taken the view that Dame Stella Rimington was not worth listening to.
Therefore, we were not even in a position to know whether she was
available. I find that situation deplorable. It highlights areas where
the House of Commons is deficient in its processes. I hope that that
will be communicated back. I may have misunderstood the position, but I
was left with the distinct impression that a veto had been applied at
an earlier stage by the Minister, on the basis that it was his
prerogative to do so, so that we did not even know whether she could
come or not.</div>
					<a name="08042272000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do
believe that it may be helpful for us to hear from Dame Stella. She may
have less to say that would be helpful to us than we would hope, but
her name was put forward in good faith as someone whom we think could
probably help the Committee. I commend the motion and amendment to the
Committee.</div>
					<a name="08042272000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08042272000147"></a>The
Chairman:
						</b> Before I call Ben Wallace, in case people are
not watching the clock, I emphasise that we now have a maximum of only
six minutes. We have to dispose of the motions, and I also want to say,
for the benefit of the Committee, a few sentences about how I intend to
conduct the public evidence sessions.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column9" />Column number: 9</div>
					<a name="08042272000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="08042272000148"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Ben Wallace</b> (Lancaster and Wyre) (Con): I welcome you to
the Chair, Mr. Bercow. At the outset, in response to the
point made by the hon. Member for Reading, West, I would like to
clarify the fact that I think that he is confusing two dames. Former
Dame Pauline Neville-Jones has been involved with the Conservative
party. She is now Baroness Neville-Jones of Hutton Roof and is a member
of the shadow Cabinet. I am sure that it is not the first time that he
has mixed up the
dames.</div>
					<a name="08042272000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">The reason that
I made the suggestion to my hon. Friend the Member for Reigate was
because the balance of the witnesses was focused on the protection of
human rights and the judicial body, as opposed to the operational
aspect. I concede that the first witness today relates to the
operational implication of the law. However, it is clear to some of us
on the Opposition Benches who have operational experience in
counter-terrorism that bad law affects not only rights, but the
business of intelligence
gathering.</div>
					<a name="08042272000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">Dame Stella
Rimington has expert knowledge of intelligence gathering and, to my
knowledge, no link to any political party. She was a first rate
director general of the Security Services who, as my hon. Friend the
Member for Newark pointed out, knows the bridge from one type of
terrorism to the other, and could properly contribute to the process of
the Committee. If we get part of the Bill wrong, it may have an impact
on the ability to recruit sources and run informers, which is at the
heart of the operational side of counter-terrorism. I think that she
would have contributed greatly, and I hope that the Committee will take
advantage of experience that is out there, rather than shut down any
debate.</div>

Grieve:
						</b> Good morning, and thank you for coming in. Can I
deal first with pre-charge detention? It has been suggested to us that
the Association of Chief Police Officers has a collective view about
pre-charge detention. One of the problems is that if one looks at the
ACPO website it is impossible to see who serves on the ACPO terrorism
and allied matters committee. No such information is provided. It is
difficult to know how ACPO comes to its collective decisions. Could you
help the Committee by indicating how that has happened, who is on the
ACPO-TAM committee, and whether an expressed viewpoint is a collective
viewpoint, a majority viewpoint, a unanimous viewpoint or the viewpoint
of certain individuals?</div>

								Sir Ian

						</i> In that case, I think that I have exactly the
right witness for you, because Bob Quick, in addition to being
assistant commissioner in the Metropolitan police, is chairman of the
ACPO-TAM committee, although it is bit hard on him to ask him to rattle
through the names, because he has only been in that position for six

						</i> The TAM committee is very large. I think that
it has a membership of over 70 people from various organisations, but
including of course many chief police officers. To answer your
question, those issues are indeed discussed in detail at the TAM
committee, but in terms of forming a collective position among the
chief constables of England and Wales, TAM merely makes recommendations
to what we call ACPO cabinet and then to council&#151;council being
the most authoritative body within ACPO. This 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column11" />Column number: 11</div>argument and debate has been reflected in a number of documents, which
were refined into a position agreed by ACPO council in 2007, which
reflects in detail the terms of a letter that has been sent, I believe,
to the Committee by Ken Jones, the president of ACPO. You will see that
the names of the chief constables of the forces that are foremost in
the fight against terrorism&#151;Greater Manchester, West Yorkshire
and West Midlands&#151;are on that letter, and of course the
Metropolitan police is also a
signatory.</div>

						</b> May I then to turn to the main issue around
extending pre-charge detention from 28 to 42 days? The Home Affairs
Committee has received evidence from the Director of Public
Prosecutions that it has been managing comfortably with an outer limit
of 28 days&#146; detention. How does that affect your perception of
the need for an
extension?</div>

								Sir
Ian Blair:
							</b>
						</i> Our position is unchanged since Peter
Clarke and I gave evidence to the Home Affairs Committee. We have never
put forward a case that there is evidence of a need for an extension of
the length of pre-charge detention. What we have said repeatedly is
that, given the circumstances that the UK has faced over the last few
years, the growth in the number of plots, the number of conspirators in
each plot and the magnitude of their ambition, a pragmatic inference
can be drawn that sooner or later we are going to need more than 28
days. That is particularly affected by the different criminal
investigation and criminal justice processes of the United Kingdom. We
are not the same as the United States. We are not the same as France,
Germany, Spain and Italy. We are in a place in which a great deal of
responsibility is placed on police investigators rather than
prosecutors. Although I respect the views of the DPP and the
Attorney-General, it is appropriate for the professionals, who are
charged with the actual investigation before the lawyers make their
decision, to put forward a viewpoint. That is what ACPO has
done.</div>

							<a name="08042276000363"></a>Mr.

						</b> Is not the position that, as matters stand, the
Crown Prosecution Service is closely involved in any prosecution
decisions as to when charges are brought and, indeed, is involved at
quite an early stage? If, historically, it has not seen that as a
problem in terms of prosecuting the most difficult and serious
terrorist offences, why is there this divergence of views with
yourselves?</div>

						</i> It comes to the same point. We are the
people who have to investigate. We know the difficulties of
investigation. We do not produce the material for the Crown prosecutors
until we have actually got it. Both Bob and I could refer to a number
of circumstances where it takes time to produce that material. Once the
material is there, then of course the prosecutors are in a position to
deal with it.</div>

							<a name="08042276000364"></a>Mr.
Grieve:
						</b> May I turn briefly to time periods? One of the
issues which has been raised during the course of discussion is that
there have been occasions when the 28-day limit has come close to being
reached. I do not know whether you can help us on this&#151;I am
deliberately trying to be a bit careful and am speaking in generalities
because I am conscious that there are matters which may well be sub
judice at the moment. One of the problems that I have had is that on
the two examples that appeared to be given of going to 28 days, I was
able to obtain information quite readily from others involved that,
although it might have gone to 28 days, the evidence on which the
decision to charge was made had in fact been available quite
substantially earlier. Could you make any comment on
that?</div>

						<i class="I">
							<b class="B">
								Bob
Quick:
							</b>
						</i> I am aware of some of the detail of those
cases. The decision to charge is a decision for the CPS, and it must be
satisfied that a point in time has been reached and that the evidence
to justify a prosecution is sufficient. It must be reasonably certain
that a prosecution will succeed. It is largely a decision for the CPS
about when that sufficiency of evidence has been reached. I know that
in the cases to which you refer it was not satisfied until the very
last moment, and the difference between charging and not charging was
quite
marginal.</div>

						</b> I am grateful to the witnesses for what they have
to say. Sir Ian, you said that there was a pragmatic inference. Would
you expand on that a little and explain the circumstances in which you
believe that the present 28-day limit would need to be
breached?</div>
					<a name="08042276000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<i class="I">
							<b class="B">
								Sir
Ian Blair:
							</b>
						</i> Yes. I have to be careful here, because I
do not want to give a road map of what we would find particularly
difficult to those who might want to attack the United Kingdom. If one
looks at the series of factors that affect the difficulty of
investigation, one will see that there could be multiple sites or
multiple plots. You could have a sequence of plots, with things
happening at different times and different attack methodologies. You
could have some of the attacks taking place in the United Kingdom and
some elsewhere. If all those things are combined together, our view is
that that is when we might reach the stage that 28 days was not
enough.</div>
					<a name="08042276000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our concern
over that has been prompted particularly by what is very properly
happening now, which is a discussion in the calm&#151;we have always
sought to avoid that discussion happening after an atrocity. That
remains our concern because, unlike the United States, we do not have
facilities for using intercept as evidence or plea bargaining. We do
not have investigative detention authorised by prosecutors, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column13" />Column number: 13</div>as is the case in the jurisdictions of France, Spain and Italy, so the
police service is the key element in determining whether evidence is
gathered.</div>

							<a name="08042276000367"></a>Mr.
Heath:
						</b> Under the Bill, the trigger for a parliamentary
decision on extension would take place not in the circumstances of
calm, but effectively in the circumstances of emergency. We have spent
a lot of time over the last few years quite properly looking at those
matters and trying to provide appropriate legislative weapons to the
police and prosecuting services, and we have made a number of changes.
What is your assessment of what we have done so far? For instance, how
effective have the lower order offences that were introduced been in
enabling you to prosecute someone at an earlier
stage?</div>
					<a name="08042276000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<i class="I">
							<b class="B">
								Sir
Ian Blair:
							</b>
						</i> The lower order offences have been
extremely useful and have populated the legislative landscape with
things that can be done at an earlier stage. Part of the problem is
that the way in which individuals and groups move from what appears to
be facilitation or terrorist financing into active attack is very fast.
It is not right to say that those people can just be picked off at a
lower level of offence. There are people who suddenly emerge from left
field, about whom we know very little but about whom we become
immensely
concerned.</div>
					<a name="08042276000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<i class="I">
							<b class="B">
								Bob
Quick:
							</b>
						</i> I would reiterate those remarks about the
usefulness of some of the more recent legislation. I feel that the new
provisions have been welcomed universally by the investigative
community. For example, section 5 and the ability to charge with
preparatory attacks, which has overcome some of the limitations of the
old conspiracy legislation, have been used to great effect and have
enabled us to intercept people earlier. The volatility and the
international nature of the threat leave us to conclude that on
stepping back and looking at the events of the last five, seven or 10
years, one can identify trends in terms of complexity, the number of
jurisdictions involved, and the breadth and depth of networks and their
very diffuse nature. Each jurisdiction constrains investigative
activity in different
ways.</div>
					<a name="08042276000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">As has been
said, in some of our investigations the pre-charge detention period has
come under some pressure. After the 14-day limit was set, it came under
pressure in 2004 when we used the full provisions of the 14 days. In
2006, we detained people for 27 days before
charge.</div>

							<a name="08042276000368"></a>Mr.
Heath:
						</b> The point that I am attempting to elucidate is that
we have the acts preparatory, which I hoped would be a useful addition
to your armoury. I think that you have confirmed that it is. We have
the lowering of the threshold for an evidential basis for prosecution,
which again ought to be extremely helpful. Given that those weapons are
available to prosecute somebody who is held on a lower order offence
before the court, under what circumstances would there not be
sufficient evidence to proceed to prosecution of such people&#151;on
acts preparatory, or one of the other offences available&#151;so that
they would have to be held for longer than 28
days?</div>
					<a name="08042276000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">One of the
arguments has always been about encryption, but there is a prosecutable
offence of refusing to provide a key to encryption. I do not 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column14" />Column number: 14</div>understand the argument for the measure, and I ask for your advice on
why those things are not sufficient to enable somebody to be held in
custody, facing a charge which might not be the most serious charge
that they will face after continued investigations, but which is
sufficient to hold them in
custody.</div>
					<a name="08042276000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<i class="I">
							<b class="B">
								Sir
Ian Blair:
							</b>
						</i> Let me start with a general view and I
will ask Bob to fill it in. I cannot be specific, but a number of cases
already have or will eventually come to trial where, because of the
level of the threat that we perceive, we make arrests when almost no
evidential material is available. We have lots of intelligence, but
nothing that can be put into evidence. We start from a position where
we are very concerned about what such people appear to be attempting to
do, but we are not quite sure what that is. Those arrests have led to
some of the most serious charges that we have had. We sometimes face a
position where we do not have the acts preparatory. We just have to go
in and find what is on those computers and in those houses and what the
contacts are.</div>
					<a name="08042276000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">On lower
order offences, while under serious charges of terrorism the courts
would remand people in custody, there is no prospect that defendants
facing a maximum penalty of two years&#151;as with the encryption key
offence&#151;will be remanded in
custody.</div>
					<a name="08042276000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<i class="I">
							<b class="B">
								Bob
Quick:
							</b>
						</i> I can think of examples where preparatory acts
may not come into play. To answer the first point, yes, in some cases,
we will have sufficient intelligence coverage and the run-in to the
inquiry will reveal evidence of preparatory acts or other lower order
offences against which we can act. We will always act where we can to
take out the threat at the earliest
opportunity.</div>
					<a name="08042276000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">In recent
years, we have witnessed a much more volatile picture where suspects
who are of interest or concern to us are not engaging in much activity.
They will then go abroad where the intelligence coverage might not be
as reliable or satisfactory as in the United Kingdom, receive their
taskings, come back to the UK and immediately engage in attack-planning
activity. In some investigations, we have seen that materialise so
quickly that on public safety grounds we have had to act pre-emptively
before we have had the opportunity to exploit pre-arrest evidential
opportunities. That places a huge burden on the senior investigating
officer.</div>
					<a name="08042276000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">To follow up
a question that was put earlier about the CPS and the DPP&#146;s
remarks, some of the stresses and pressures on the senior investigating
officer and the investigative team operating in those circumstances are
not necessarily entirely visible to the CPS and the prosecution team.
There are practicalities whereby officers are having to travel around
the world against extremely tight deadlines, working with high-tech
teams to try to elicit evidence and break encryption codes, and many
other human pressures on people to deliver the evidence within
constraints.</div>

pertinent comparison to make with our struggles against Irish
republican terrorism. Without in any way diminishing the murderous
intent of the IRA and some of the loyalists, there were three
categories of difference. First, they almost invariably gave warnings.
Secondly, they did not want to die. Thirdly, they did not want to cause
mass casualties, with one or two exceptions. I suppose that you could
add a fourth category, which was that they were heavily penetrated by
British intelligence. There are obviously exceptions to all those
events, but that is the general pattern. That is not the case with the

elicit evidence. There are massive amounts of data on devices such as
laptops and flash drives, on very small devices that could be secreted
in a house and which might take an enormous amount of effort to find.
Indeed, through very painstaking methods we have found evidence of a
critical nature on a tiny device, which has in effect broken the whole
case open. So we have legions of people having to service that demand

is the difference? If the 42-day legislation is passed, surely in
principle there would be no reason why you would not support an
extension for other forms of crime, which can have just as awful an
impact on the
victims?</div>

						</i> I will go back, if I can, to the fact that
with these particular individuals, the perceived threat is so awful
that we arrive at their premises right at the beginning of an
investigation. With a lot of organised criminality you will have a
great deal of evidence before you make the arrests&#151;enough to
charge in a number of cases&#151;and the breaking of the encryption
comes later. There is also something about the groups that we have met
so far that makes them interested in IT. That is something quite
remarkable. I had a bit of an interchange of correspondence with the
other David Davis about some evidence that I gave before the Home
Affairs Committee about a case&#151;Tsouli and others, which has just
finished&#151;in which a million separate files had to be opened. The
individuals do things such as breaking up an ordinary commercial film
and inserting something into it. So the whole film has to be watched.
That is the situation that we face.</div>

inference&#151;and it has been hinted at already today&#151;that
the more time the police get, the lazier they get and the more they
mess around and go to full term. It has been said clearly by the other
David Davis&#151;the shadow Home Secretary&#151;and implied again
today, that the evidence in the alleged plot that is before the courts
was secured at 14 to 18 days and that the police faffed around for a
further 10 days to get to 27 or 28, because they had the time. Would
you comment on
that?</div>

analyse the information. I am talking of the Crown prosecutors.
Resourcing is not the issue. Of course, Minister, if you wish to give
me more resources for this purpose I shall be delighted, but that is
not the issue in terms of the length of detention. I should also add,

that, notwithstanding what we have already done with acts preparatory

notwithstanding what we 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column18" />Column number: 18</div>have done, as we will hear later this afternoon, about the threshold
test; and notwithstanding post-charge questioning&#151;if, heaven
forfend, I go to some other part of the Bill&#151;and the Chilcot

you are still of the view that there may be exceptional circumstances

						</i> That has been the position of ACPO and the
Metropolitan police for some time. If I can, without spreading across
to the rest of the Bill, I should mention that we see post-charge
questioning as a useful approach. As Peter Clarke said to the Home
Affairs Committee, 90 per cent. of the main perpetrators in these cases
never reply to questions. The value of post-charge questioning is
therefore only that people can have something put to them so that a
court can know that they have had the chance to refute it. In terms of
the Chilcot review, as you know, we have supported the concept of the
evidential intercept, but there remain significant practical barriers
between now and when that happens. In the meantime, our position
remains that precautionary legislation is the right
approach.</div>

forward. Each member of the Muslim community is as much at risk of
being killed as everyone else in the UK, and we are determined to do
everything that we can to encourage community cohesion. The advantage
that the UK has is that counter-terrorism activity is not separated
from mainstream policing, so chief police officers are responsible for
explaining when things go wrong and for working with the community,
with regard to not only the &#147;pursue&#148; part of the Contest
strategy, but the &#147;prevent&#148; part. While I am conscious of
the fact that many individuals inside the Muslim community and
elsewhere do not want the extension, I think that we can get a mature
debate so that we can at least explain the reasons for
it.</div>

you have both indicated that there have been occasions when you have

						</i> I can only speak in general
terms because I was not part of the recent investigations, but a very
experienced investigator would constantly refine and review the
investigative strategies as the clock ticks, whether that related to a
burglar with a 24-hour detention limit that was extendable to 36 hours,
or a terrorist arrested for a suspected conspiracy to commit mass
murder with a 28-day limit. The important thing to recognise is the
limitation on how far you can change your investigative strategy,
because the processes of investigation are often linear, as has been
alluded to in some of the questions. No matter how many resources are
thrown at an investigation, there is not a direct relationship between
the resources and the time that it takes to secure and retrieve the
evidence in a form in which it could be made available to a court. Of
course, that is a very forensic and linear process, and the way in
which our laws are constructed and the evidence is presented in
prosecution makes it so. Therefore, there are limits to what can be
done to change an investigative strategy. That is why, so soon after
the introduction of the 28-day limit, we are seeing cases that reveal
significant pressures on the
investigation.</div>

to the Minister, you also referred to the potential usefulness of
intercept evidence. I realise the implications for available resources

I have to make it clear, however, that some of the barriers that sit in

of the FBI the other day, it became clear to me that their system
depends on the Classified Information Procedures Act, which effectively
prevents disclosure of how the warrant for interception was granted.
That is very different from our public interest immunity position. To
get to where we want with intercept as evidence, in a framework of the

considerable stake. That is what our whole neighbourhood policing

You will have heard from the director general of the Security Service
that we have seen numbers rise from an estimate of 1,600 at the end of
2006 to about 2,000 at the end of 2007. Disentangling the real growth
in recruits, if we call them that, from the growth in intelligence
capacity is very difficult. It may be that we are just finding what was
already there, or it may be growth. We are still working through to try
to get a better understanding of that. That is the first
point.</div>
					<a name="08042276000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the
reluctance to engage, there is clearly distrust and concern and I have
heard friends in the Muslim community describe their feelings as being
a watched community. It is not difficult to empathise and understand
why they feel that way. What is really important is to keep the
perspective in the debate. The vast majority of terrorism arrests in
the United Kingdom in recent years have been solved very quickly with
minimal detention. Those that have resulted in extended detention
correlate strongly with charge and prosecution. Last year alone, 37
people were convicted of serious terrorist offences, of which 21
pleaded guilty. That is absolutely unprecedented in the history of
fighting terrorism. They were sentenced to more than 500 years&#146;
imprisonment. This year, 28 people have been convicted, of which 11
pleaded guilty. They have been sentenced to well over 100 years. We
have regrettably seen an upward trend, but we have seen success in
pursuing people involved in such
activity.</div>
					<a name="08042276000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are also
seeing more sophistication. Terrorists are learning from their

the Sex Offenders Act 2003. They are generally
effective in helping to monitor and regulate sex offenders, but are by
no means perfect. Many sex offenders slip off the radar and sadly can
reoffend. The correlation of sex offending and the patterns and types
of people involved with terrorist offenders is not good. The risks to
the public, while serious with sex offenders, are of a different
magnitude with terrorist offenders who may be seeking to sacrifice
their own life while committing mass
murder.</div>

and data-sharing powers in the Bill? I wondered what your views are on
that and whether you consider that the powers being envisaged are
proportionate, in view of the fact that they appear to
allow&#151;certainly in the case of the security services and
others&#151;a wide dissemination of information other than only for
the purposes of preventing crime, given that it is specifically

								Dr.

						</i> I agree that it is a much more
nebulous concept. In previous years, we have seen a number of
situations in which powers used for national security tend to bleed
down into the ordinary criminal law. One only has to consider the
recent examples of authorisations under the Regulation of Investigatory
Powers Act 2000, in which surveillance powers are used in relation to
parents being in the right zone for schools, and so forth. In relation
to the collection of DNA, we are extremely concerned about the lack of
regulation in relation to the police database and the very broad
powers, particularly in relation to suspects on control orders. As some
of you may know, the measure is being heard before the European Court
of Human Rights and we expect a judgment very shortly. We are concerned
that it is liable to create further interference with the right to

post-charge questioning. In your evidence, you make it clear that you
feel that the Joint Committee on Human Rights is right to suggest that
there needed to be very clear provisions, either through a code of
conduct or, preferably, in primary legislation, to secure the rights of
the individual under post-charge questioning. I notice that you also
suggest that there should be direct supervision by the court. Can you
elaborate on exactly how you feel that that should take

						</i> It is not necessarily the trial judge,
although if it is possible to arrange that, it would
obviously be desirable. Generally speaking, you certainly want to
emphasise the role of the judge in charge of the pre-trial process.
Bear in mind that case management for terrorism trials can go over a
number of months, so there may be some leeway for different judges to
be involved at different stages. The fundamental distinction, which was
identified by the Joint Committee, is that once charges have been
brought, the police are no 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column25" />Column number: 25</div>longer in charge of the investigation; it is the court that controls the
investigation. That is a fundamental part of our criminal justice
process. It is important that the police remain under the close
supervision of the court, in a way that they are not in relation to
pre-charge
investigation.</div>

&#147;Intercept evidence: lifting the ban&#148;, dated October
2006, you said that there was an overwhelming case for the ban on
intercept evidence to be lifted forthwith. I think that you were in the
room when Sir Ian Blair said, somewhat dismissively, that there are
administrative and legislative barriers that make that quite impossible
and that it is virtually pie in the sky that it could ever come in over
the next two or three years. What is your view on
that?</div>
					<a name="08042276000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<i class="I">
							<b class="B">
								Dr.
Eric Metcalfe:
							</b>
						</i> I was very surprised that Sir Ian took
that view. I think it is taking a cue from the report of the Chilcot
committee, which says that more time is needed to think about it. We
take the opposite view, which is that a great deal of thinking has
already been done on this issue; in particular, we know that the
Government have been working on the public interest immunity plus model
of intercept evidence for some time. Indeed, we were told by the Bill
team in the Home Office, prior to the Chilcot report being handed down,
that in the event that the Chilcot committee gave the green light to
using intercept evidence, it would be prepared to insert clauses into
the Bill. So it seems unusual, given that at one point, just at the
beginning of this year, we were told that clauses could be imminent,
but that now the most senior police officer seems to think that
resolution of the issue is years
away.</div>
					<a name="08042276000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the
experience in the United States, which Sir Ian mentioned, I think, with
respect, that he is completely wrong about the US model of intercept
evidence. There was a report published in 2006 on a detailed
comparative study of the use of intercept evidence in Canada, Australia
and New Zealand, South Africa and the United States. We noted that the
US law to which Sir Ian refers is, in its overall design and framework,
similar to the public interest immunity process that we have here.
Certainly, the Home Office will have been aware of that when working on
public interest immunity plus. We think that it should be possible to
introduce clauses much more quickly than is being done. The Chilcot
report identified points that need to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column26" />Column number: 26</div>be addressed, but we do not think that it is a matter of years; we think
that, at best, it is a matter of months. With the best will in the
world, I am sure that clauses could be introduced into this
Bill.</div>

						<i class="I">
							<b class="B">
								Dr.
Eric Metcalfe:

						</i> We strongly oppose
the provisions. Obviously, coronial proceedings are under reform at the
moment. There was talk of a coroners Bill, and we understand that
certain provisions in relation to intercept evidence and closed
proceedings were transplanted into this Bill. In our view, those are
extremely ill thought
out.</div>
					<a name="08042276000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">At the moment, a
coroner&#146;s inquest sitting under the special appointment
procedure would have the power to hear intercept evidence. If the
coroner reaches a finding of unlawful killing, the case would be passed
to the Crown Prosecution Service, which would, under the current
situation, be unable to use any intercept evidence to prosecute an
individual. You would therefore have an obvious mismatch between a
clear finding of the coroner that there was unlawful conduct and the
inability of the CPS to prosecute. That is just one of the anomalies
that are brought about by the failure to address the issue of intercept
evidence
wholesale.</div>
					<a name="08042276000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second
issue, and our major concern, is the provision to allow coroners to sit
without juries and hold closed proceedings. Article 2 of the European
convention on human rights, which relates to the right to life,
contains clear requirements on duties towards the relatives of those
who are unlawfully killed. It is extremely important for them that
justice not only be done, but be seen to be done. The provisions in
part 6 seem to us to cut off that possibility completely. Therefore, we
think that they are extremely ill thought out and we look forward to
them being
withdrawn.</div>

clearance, as is often the case. Another method is to have a sifting
process involving a disclosure stage using special advocates; the
special advocates and the coroner could then determine what material
could be made public and what would remain

what does not. In

material that the Government claim is so sensitive that it cannot be

Grieve:
						</b> Dr. Metcalfe, I should be grateful if you could
give an overview of Justice&#146;s position on pre-charge detention.
I do not know whether you were here to hear Sir Ian Blair&#146;
evidence. The view he put forward was that it was a necessity because
of the lack of the availability of intercept evidence, for example,
which seems to be a voluntary decision of the Government rather than
anything else. Could you shed any light on the apparent lack of clarity
about how long it is taking in current cases to bring charges against
individuals accused of
terrorism?</div>

								Dr.
Eric Metcalfe:
							</b>
						</i> In general terms I identify five major
arguments against the Government&#146;s proposal to extend the
maximum limit for pre-charge detention to 42 days. The first is that,
in our view, it clearly violates the right to liberty laid down not
only in our own Human Rights Act, but under relevant international
human rights standards, including the international covenant on civil
and political rights to which the United Kingdom is party.</div>
					<a name="08042276000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our second major argument is
that 42 days is unsupported by evidence. The Government have not
identified any case in which a person has been held for 28 days and
then released and has then been shown to be involved in terrorism.
Thirdly, we think that 42 days is unnecessary in practical terms,
primarily because of the ability of the Crown Prosecution Service to
apply the threshold test at a certain point in the investigation, to
allow people to be charged with terrorist offences even where the full
evidential material is not available.</div>
					<a name="08042276000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">Fourthly, we note that 42 days
is far longer than any other western democracy allows, and that
includes the European civil systems. Fifthly, we think that there are
no credible safeguards in relation to 42 days. There are no additional
judicial safeguards offered in the Bill, and the parliamentary
safeguards are inappropriate and, in any event, very much after the
fact.</div>
					<a name="08042276000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is important to note that there is a large gap
between suspicion and proof and what the police are dealing with in
their investigations at the point of arrest is suspicion, and in
particular the idea of reasonable suspicion. In order to charge an
individual and to convict them you need proof. The argument seems to be
that the police need ever longer periods of time in order to gain
sufficient admissible evidence. We argue that the threshold test
essentially allows for reasonable suspicion to be applied at the point
of charge, so really there has been no problem, as the chief prosecutor
indicated, in bringing charges against those who are suspected of
involvement in the most serious of crimes.</div>

						</i> Let me stress first of all that we are
a policy organisation. We do not represent individuals. We are not what
one might describe as a grass-roots organisation. However, in general
terms it does seem that one argument is that effective
counter-terrorism investigation relies on the community to bring
forward intelligence and on the use of informers and such like in order
to detect people who are involved in terrorism in the first place. As a
matter of common sense, it inhibits people&#146;s willingness to come
forward if they see their community as a whole being targeted. There is
no doubt that the nature of the current threat tied to radical
Islamicists means that the Muslim population of the United Kingdom as a
whole&#151;as a general category&#151;is liable to be
targeted.</div>
					<a name="08042276000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">I fully
accept that, as Sir Ian Blair says, the great majority of those people
themselves do not want to be blown up by terrorists and strongly oppose
the terrorists. None the less, I think he underestimates the
possibility that people may strongly dislike terrorism while also
strongly distrusting the police. If you see that members of your
community are liable to be arrested and held without charge for more
than a month, that might well diminish the likelihood that you will be
willing to co-operate with the
police.</div>

						</b> I want to link pre-charge detention with the
measures on post-charge questioning. One of the arguments presented by
the police is that they need time to examine evidence. Given the
provisions in the Bill on post-charge questioning, does it seem to you
that if someone were charged with a fairly serious or middling
terrorist offence, they would be much more likely to be remanded than
released on bail? Would not the police then have all the time in the
world to examine evidence and put it to that individual in a
post-charge situation? Would not that solve some of their concerns
about having time to examine the evidence? Does not the facility for
post-charge questioning do half the job of pre-charge
detention?</div>

							<b class="B">
								Dr.

						</i> It is interesting to compare the
support for post-charge questioning indicated by police with the
comments that they have made to the Select Committee on Home Affairs in
previous inquiries, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column30" />Column number: 30</div>particularly about the 90-day issue. It is apparent that the police do
not readily rely on questioning suspects in terrorism cases. If you
look at the testimony of solicitors representing detainees in terrorism
cases, questioning is not a major part of the investigation. For the
same reasons, I do not see that there would be much need to rely on
post-charge questioning. Our support for post-charge questioning partly
goes to the principle that if there are pressures, they can be
alleviated by post-charge questioning. Given that there is a principled
case for allowing it, why not make it available? We support it on that
basis, but I do not think that there is a strong demand for post-charge
questioning. I think that the experience of suspects in terrorism
investigations is not to answer questions, so, as the police themselves
have said&#151;I invite you to look at their previous testimony to
the Home Affairs Committee when the 90-day limit was being
considered&#151;it is probably only a limited measure. None the less,
we support it to the extent that it could be seen to reduce
pressure.</div>

earlier, Dr. Metcalfe&#151;the threshold test? I agree with you that
it is of some significance, but that was not the position that the
police had taken until recently, was it? I think that Deputy Assistant
Commissioner Peter Clarke said that it had no relevance to terrorism

						</i> I did understand Mr. Quick
as saying that as well. I think that the important point to stress is
that it is not the police who are responsible for charging suspects in
terrorism cases. I also think that Sir Ian somewhat understated the
involvement of the Crown Prosecution Service in the preparation and the
investigation of terrorism cases of this kind. As the CPS paper that
was released by the Government last July makes clear, it is the CPS
that is responsible for going to courts to seek authorisation of
continued pre-charge detention. In order to do that, the CPS itself
must be apprised of the nature of the investigation and how it is
proceeding. How else is the CPS supposed to defend the detention and
argue for an extension in court, unless it is very intimately involved
with the ongoing investigations?</div>

						</b> Taking the threshold test together with what I
shall persist in calling lower order offences even if it offends the
Minister, because that is exactly what they are and it is the correct
term, is that not a mechanism for what used to be called a holding
offence, to enable a charge to be brought quite properly against a
suspect against whom there is prima facie evidence? Furthermore, does
your organisation have any objection in principle to the use of holding
charges in order to ensure that somebody is kept in custody while
further offences can be
investigated?</div>

						<i class="I">
							<b class="B">
								Dr.
Eric Metcalfe:

						</i> I do not think that we need to mix
those two situations together. It is perfectly possible to use the
threshold test in relation to the most serious kinds of charges, for
example conspiracy to cause explosions, which is the standard charge
that is brought against suspected terrorists, or incitement to commit
murder. The threshold test applies equally to the most serious charges
as to what we might call minor holding charges.</div>
					<a name="08042276000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think that everyone has a
problem with the idea of applying a charge against a suspect for which
there is not sufficient evidence; that is problematic. In a less
problematic way, what a holding charge generally refers to is simply
using another charge for which there is evidence to support the
individual being charged against that individual while you prepare more
serious charges, and nothing prevents more serious charges from being
brought. If there is evidence to show that the person is also involved
in encouraging terrorism, or I should say inciting terrorism, but you
are also looking for evidence that they are actively involved in
conspiracy to commit explosions, there is nothing that prohibits that
person from being charged with the so-called lesser
offence.</div>

						</i> Here is the difficulty that I have
with that statement. In 2000, at a time when al-Qaeda had already begun
to be engaged in serious threats to US national security interests and
was no doubt on the radar of MI6, we had established seven days. After
9/11, with an incredibly serious, widespread plot involving multiple
international targets and suspects in a number of different
jurisdictions, the police in this country argued for 14 days. It went
up to 14 days in 2003 and then to 90 days after 7/7. The difficulty is
that the Madrid bombings and the 9/11 attacks were plots of equal
complexity, and the suggestion that, in the past five year, the plots
have somehow escalated in complexity, is something that I find
difficult to apprehend. We are dealing with a relatively constant level
of threat, from internationally based plots, which involve multiple
jurisdictions and suspects with different backgrounds and different
languages, although the level of computer technology has not made a
dramatic difference. I accept that the situation is highly complex, but
it does not seem to be dramatically different from the situation that
we faced in 2003, when Parliament decided that the limit should be 14
days.</div>

end of the day, the complexity is solved by the threshold test, which
provides the ultimate answer to all these issues. We should bear it in
mind that the police have to have reasonable suspicion at the point
when they arrest a subject. That means that they have to have
intelligence of some kind to justify the assertion that these people
are sufficiently dangerous to be arrested. So it is not the case that
the police have no evidence at the point when they arrest someone; in
fact, they have to have a reasonable basis for their suspicions. What
we are really talking about is having sufficient time for them to
gather admissible evidence. As we have pointed out time and again, the

						</i> I have not cited the example at
paragraph 45 to suggest that I do not believe it. I believe that the
facts and figures cited there are accurate. You have not disputed them.
Nor have you disputed the facts and figures that I cite at paragraph 47
in relation to the Forest Gate case. If we are going to use these kinds
of fact and figures to show that the complexity of the police
investigation therefore equals suspicion of a suspect, that is the
wrong question. Bear in mind that the judicial supervision of
pre-charge detention is not about assessing the evidence. It is about
determining whether the investigation is proceeding diligently, and
whether the police have good reason for supposing that a suspect needs
to be detained for the reasons that the police have given, but not in
relation to the evidence, only in relation to the threat that the
suspect may pose in interfering with the evidence-gathering process. So
the complexity issue is something of a side note as well. It comes down
to the assessment by the Crown Prosecution Service. You have not
disputed that Sir Ken Macdonald is mistaken when he says that 28 days
is sufficient for the Crown Prosecution Service to do its
job.</div>

						</i> The point is that the court is not
being asked to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to
justify the suspect&#146;s continued detention. The court is being
asked whether the police have shown cause to detain the person in
relation to the grounds set out in schedule 8 of the Terrorism Act that
allow the police to continue their investigation. The police have to
show only that they are conducting their investigations with proper
diligence. It is a common misconception that judicial authorisation of
extended pre-charge detention involves a determination of the evidence
against the suspect. It does refer to the evidence, but only in
relation to the specific question that the court is being asked to
determine.</div>
					<a name="08042276000290"></a><div class="hs_Para">Bear in
mind also that the individual suspect and his lawyers may be prohibited
from knowing any of the information relating to the investigation that
is put before the court. So the suspect and his lawyers can be excluded
from the proceedings. You can have a situation in which the suspect is
entirely shut out. I know that, in relation to the previous Home
Affairs inquiry, there was correspondence between the Metropolitan
police and the Home Affairs Committee disputing what we have said, but
they did not deny that the Terrorism Act allows suspects to be excluded
altogether from the detention proceedings.</div>

judge-led investigations, as they have in other European countries,
where the judge takes control of the investigation and tells the police
which suspects to bring in, how to question them, and so on. That
system works very well in Europe, where the judges have training in
that kind of investigation, but it would not work under our common law

Eric Metcalfe:

						</i> You have asked me the question and I
should like to have the chance to respond. I am saying that it is my
responsibility&#151;and it is the responsibility of all Members of
Parliament&#151;to deliberate carefully. When the police said that
they needed 28 days to charge a suspect, even though they were not
always responsible for charging a suspect, it is perfectly right to
ask, &#147;Couldn&#146;t that person have been charged
earlier?&#148;</div>

cases, had your position been substantiated the Crown Prosecution
Service, which has, if you like, the responsibility to make that
judgment, would have intervened at the 14-day period rather than
later?</div>

at which the police pass information to the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column44" />Column number: 44</div>Crown Prosecution Service. The police may have delayed passing
information to the CPS, thereby leading to the delay. The truth is that
I do not know and you will have to ask Sir Ian these
questions.</div>
