<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020558000408"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. I remind
the Committee and our witnesses, those immediately with us and those
who are joining us later if they are already in the room, that we are
bound by the internal knives agreed by the Committee on Tuesday
afternoon. That means that the first session has to end at 1.40 pm, the
second at 2.30 pm, the third at 3 pm and the fourth at 4 pm. I have no
desire to interrupt Members, as I am afraid I had to on Tuesday
afternoon, but if someone is speaking and the clock ticks past, I will
have to stop them and move them
on.</div><a name="09020558000009"></a><div class="hs_Para">Without
further ado, let us hear the first evidence from the Director of Public
Prosecutions, Mr. Keir Starmer. Good afternoon and thank you
for joining us. We are deeply grateful to you for
coming.</div><a name="09020558000010"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Keir
Starmer:</b></i> It is a
pleasure.</div><a name="09020558000011"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09020558000409"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Henry Bellingham</b> (North-West Norfolk) (Con): My hon. and
learned Friend Mr. Garnier will ask about clauses 41 and 42.
May I ask you some quick questions about clauses 49 to 52? Those
clauses contain various definitions, such as &#147;reasonably be
assumed,&#148; &#147;impression conveyed&#148; and
&#147;legitimate reason&#148;. Do you think that such terms might
be too subjective and might make it difficult to obtain prosecutions
for the new offence? How will you interpret those terms in
practice?</div><a name="09020558000012"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
second question is about the fear and concern that have been expressed
by people in the arts world that there may be items of genuine historic
interest that could be brought within the scope of the Bill. I do not
think that anyone&#151;certainly no one I have spoken to&#151;has
any truck with or time for the warped, depraved individuals who want to
look at these things. However, if one looks back in history, some works
of art are pretty pornographic. What is your estimate of the likely
number of prosecutions annually for the offence of possession of a
prohibited image of a
child?</div><a name="09020558000013"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Keir
Starmer:</b></i> The interpretation would obviously be a
matter for the courts. In so far as this is bringing pseudo-photographs
and images into alignment, there have been no practical difficulties
with these provisions. I do not anticipate that there will be. In so
far as there are artistic considerations, they are obviously
recognised. These provisions will inevitably fall within the framework
of article 10 of the European convention on human rights and therefore,
in so far as any interpretation is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column104" />Column number: 104</div>needed to comply with article 10, that will be done by the courts in due
course. That, I anticipate, will enable defences to be run that are
consistent with article 10. May I come back to you on the question of
the number of likely cases, as I am not in a position to give you an
answer
now?</div><a name="09020558000014"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020558000410"></a>Mr.
Bellingham:</b> That is very
helpful.</div><a name="09020558000015"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">243
</b><a name="09020558000411"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Tim Boswell</b> (Daventry) (Con): Briefly, I understand that
under clause 49 there will be a requirement for consent by the relevant
Director of Public Prosecutions. One would assume that if the image is
a prohibited image of a child it should be a fairly open and shut
matter of fact. Do you need the safeguard of the DPP and why? What is
the thinking
there?</div><a name="09020558000016"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Keir
Starmer:</b></i> That goes to the heart of the question of
what the consent provisions are for generally. One purpose of the
consent provisions is to enable the Crown Prosecution Service, through
the DPP, to look at these provisions and to ensure that private
prosecutions are not brought in inappropriate circumstances. So there
is that additional
safeguard.</div><a name="09020558000017"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
244</b><a name="09020558000412"></a><b class="B">Alun
Michael</b> (Cardiff, South and Penarth) (Lab/Co-op): I want
to go back to Mr. Bellingham&#146;s question. You may need
to cover this in supplement too. The UK has been particularly
successful in taking down images of child abuse online, but that whole
operation and the co-operation between industry and non-governmental
organisations and the enforcement authorities has thrown up a lot of
evidence and cases to be investigated&#151;the actual abuse, as
distinct from the images online. The likely number of prosecutions and
the extent to which success is being achieved in both the investigation
and the follow-up of those cases arising out of the identification of
images where they are sourced within the UK are important issues. Could
you clarify that for us, both in terms of what is happening at the
present and the
projections?</div><a name="09020558000018"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Keir
Starmer:</b></i> Yes, we will do whatever we can to assist on
both those
issues.</div><a name="09020558000019"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
245</b><a name="09020558000413"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Edward Garnier</b> (Harborough) (Con): May I ask you a
detailed question in relation to clause 49(2)(c)? Does the
word &#147;disgusting&#148; add anything useful to the Bill and
does it make your life as the Director of Public Prosecutions
easier?</div><a name="09020558000020"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Keir
Starmer:</b></i> It is a familiar formula. It certainly does
not make life any more difficult. That is exactly the sort of law that
would be subject to article 10
consideration.</div><a name="09020558000021"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
246</b><b class="B"><a name="09020558000414"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> The last time you and I met on a formal occasion
was when you were giving me a lecture on the European convention under
the Judicial Studies Board, for which I was extremely grateful. I still
am. What is the difference between &#147;disgusting&#148; and
&#147;grossly offensive&#148; in this context, or</div>
<a name="09020558000355"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;otherwise of an
obscene
character&#148;?</div><a name="09020558000022"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Keir
Starmer:</b></i> There is some case law to suggest that the
two are slightly different. I accept that in practical reality there
are unlikely to be many cases that are sufficiently disgusting but not
grossly offensive, but I would not for that reason suggest that it was
an unhelpful formulation.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column105" />Column number: 105</div><a name="09020558000023"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
247</b><a name="09020558000415"></a><b class="B">Jenny
Willott</b> (Cardiff, Central) (LD): An issue that came up the
other day when we were talking to the Internet Watch Foundation is how
the use of the internet relates to possession. Clearly, if you are
downloading images on to your computer, the computer retains a record
of the image being in your possession. However, the equivalent of
YouTube videos are actually streaming, so they are never on your
computer. Is there a legal loophole that means that people would be
able to watch those kinds of images without technically being in breach
of the measures, when if they watched the same image in a format that
involved downloading, they would be in
breach?</div>
<a name="09020558000024"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Keir
Starmer:</b></i> Not that I am aware of. I do not think that
that loophole is in this provision.</div>
<a name="09020558000025"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
248</b><b class="B"><a name="09020558000416"></a>Jenny
Willott:</b> But if someone is watching streaming images
online, there would be no actual copy on their computer, so they would
not technically be in
possession.</div><a name="09020558000026"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Keir
Starmer:</b></i> It would be for the courts to interpret the
meaning of possession. We would proceed on the basis that there should
be no such loophole.</div>
<a name="09020558000027"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
249</b><b class="B"><a name="09020558000417"></a>Jenny
Willott:</b> On the question of the definition of
&#147;image,&#148; I think that the various references to
pseudo-photographs are reasonably clear, and capture the original
intention that the Government laid down&#151;to include cartoons or
computer-generated imagery that are so lifelike as to look like photos
of real children. However, the definition of
image&#151;</div><a name="09020558000356"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a
moving or still image...produced by any
means&#148;&#151;</div><a name="09020558000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">seems
extraordinarily broad to me. If I scrawl a pornographic image on a
piece of paper, would it be covered by that
definition?</div><a name="09020558000029"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Keir
Starmer:</b></i> I anticipate that it would
be.</div>
<a name="09020558000030"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020558000418"></a>Jenny
Willott:</b> Is there anything to ensure that what is picked
up was originally intended, or is the net so broad that a much larger
group than was originally intended could be caught be the
provisions?</div>
<a name="09020558000031"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Keir
Starmer:</b></i> In that regard, the safeguard is in clause
49(2) and the three conditions that have to be satisfied whatever the
form of the image.</div>
<a name="09020558000032"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020558000419"></a>Jenny
Willott:</b> I am not quite satisfied with that answer, but it
is not Mr. Starmer&#146;s problem so much as the
Minister&#146;s. I will come back to the issue
later.</div>
<a name="09020558000033"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
250</b><a name="09020558000420"></a><b class="B">Mrs.
Madeleine Moon</b> (Bridgend) (Lab): May I talk about
encouraging or assisting suicide in the context of the internet? When
we talked to the Internet Watch Foundation, its representatives said
that they felt there would be a problem with many of the sites that are
hosted outside the UK. I do not know whether you have ever seen the
content of any such sites. Often, they are not only explicit in setting
out the methods used, but explicit in almost hounding an individual to
take their life. How difficult do you think it would be to prosecute
when a site is hosted outside the UK?</div>
<a name="09020558000034"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Keir
Starmer:</b></i> The act must be within the jurisdiction, and
it depends what the act of encouragement is. It is anticipated that
such encouragement would be covered by the provision. Certainly, that
is the basis on which we would approach the
matter.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column106" />Column number: 106</div><a name="09020558000035"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020558000421"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Do we have any further questions relating to
images of child sex abuse? I just want to ensure that we have dealt
with that.</div>
<a name="09020558000036"></a>

251</b><a name="09020558000422"></a><b class="B">Dr.
Brian Iddon</b> (Bolton, South-East) (Lab): I want to refer
you, Mr. Starmer, to clause 46, entitled,
&#147;Encouraging or assisting suicide (England and Wales)&#148;.
The language has been rewritten, according to the explanatory
notes,</div><a name="09020558000357"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;with
the aim of improving understanding of this area of the
law&#148;.</div><a name="09020558000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
your opinion, does it change the law in any way, or will the law be
just the same with the new expressions? In other words, is there any
likelihood of increasing prosecutions with the new wording?</div>
<a name="09020558000038"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Keir
Starmer:</b></i> We have approached this on the basis that
the measure does not extend the existing law, and I am therefore not
anticipating that there will be a greater number of prosecutions
resulting from the rewording of the offence. That is how we are
approaching it.</div>
<a name="09020558000039"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020558000423"></a>Dr.
Iddon:</b> Are you happy with the rewording? Does it make life
more or less difficult than the existing wording?</div>
<a name="09020558000040"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Keir
Starmer:</b></i> No, it certainly does not make life any more
or less difficult than it currently is.</div>
<a name="09020558000041"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
252</b><b class="B"><a name="09020558000424"></a>Dr.
Iddon:</b> I have one further question, about young people who
write morbid poetry or song lyrics and might post them up on a social
networking site. That would not be done with the intention of getting
another young person to think morbidly&#151;hence leading to
suicide&#151;but if it happened, could it perhaps be seen as
encouraging another young person to take their own life?</div>
<a name="09020558000042"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Keir
Starmer:</b></i> The answer to that is in clause
46 (2)(b), which states that in those circumstances there
would not be the necessary intent. Therefore, on the face of such an
example, there would not be a prosecution.</div>

hope you do not mind, but I used in aid your reported views about
television cameras in courts on Tuesday, when I urged the Lord
Chancellor to let them in. Coincidentally, I am asking you about a
different kind of cameras in courts now with live links&#151;clause
89. What would be the considerations if we removed the safeguard of the

of prosecutors in future?</div>
<a name="09020558000050"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Keir

make the use of live link much more effective. There are obvious
concerns about the fairness of proceedings, but there are a number of
safeguards in the provisions which are important in that respect.
First, they do not apply to trials. Secondly, they do not affect the
right to be represented by a solicitor. Thirdly, the court has to be
satisfied as to the interests of justice. Finally, and overarchingly,
there is always the safeguard that the scheme must comply with article
6 of the European convention, and be adjusted in any way that makes
that necessary, on a case by case
basis.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
256</b><b class="B"><a name="09020558000430"></a>Mr.
Kidney:</b> Whose responsibility do you understand it would be
under the Bill to determine whether it was in the interests of justice
to proceed by live link? It is not very clear whether the defence are
supposed to raise this or whether the prosecutor should consider
it.</div><a name="09020558000052"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Keir
Starmer:</b></i> It is the court&#146;s responsibility. It
would fall on us as a prosecuting authority to consider that, but it
would also fall on the defence to raise it. Ultimately, it is a matter

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
257</b><b class="B"><a name="09020558000431"></a>Mr.
Kidney:</b> You relied on article 6, but in its representation
Liberty thought that several articles of the convention were
potentially breached by that. It mentioned article 6, the right to a
fair trial; article 5, the right to liberty; and article 3, which
concerns degrading treatment. Are you satisfied that the provision in
the Bill at the present time is compliant with the Human Rights Act
1998?</div><a name="09020558000054"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Keir
Starmer:</b></i> On the face of it, yes. As far as article 5
is concerned, if an individual is in custody they are within article
5&#151;whether they are in a police station or in the courtroom, they
would still be considered under article 5. I am not sure how the
argument is put that article 3 is engaged by this
process.</div><a name="09020558000055"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
258</b><b class="B"><a name="09020558000433"></a>Alun
Michael:</b> On the one hand, how do you ensure that witness
anonymity orders do not become routine? On the other hand, how do you
deal with the question of anonymity, not in the high-profile cases that
seem to be the majority where witness anonymity orders are being
used&#151;protecting undercover officers and that sort of
thing&#151;but in the situation where severe intimidation and
low-level nuisance activity, including activities against property, can
cause real problems within a local community? Could you give us some
idea of how you think that will work?</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column108" />Column number: 108</div><a name="09020558000057"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Keir
Starmer:</b></i> To ensure that the orders do not become
routine, there are a number of safeguards. An application is identified
by the police and passed to the Crown Prosecution Service. We then
consider that. That is done at a high level by the heads of our complex
casework units or the specialist divisions in London&#151;they are
all senior lawyers and they have to personally sign off on that. The
application then goes to the court, which applies the criteria and
either allows the application or not, according to the legislation. In
the cases so far, it appears that that works well and provides the
necessary safeguards. We then have, as it were, an after-the-event
safeguard, which is that we collate the figures monthly. They are all
shown to me month-on-month so that we have a proper view of the working
of the
system.</div><a name="09020558000058"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
259</b><b class="B"><a name="09020558000434"></a>Alun
Michael:</b> In some ways it is easy to see how those
judgments are made when you are dealing with, for instance, undercover
officers, but more difficult to see how the process operates when you
are dealing with local levels of intimidation&#151;which most MPs are
used to dealing with through our casework experience, and which can be
quite
worrying.</div><a name="09020558000059"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Keir
Starmer:</b></i> Where that occurs it is identified by the
police. They take a view on whether it qualifies or not. If it does not
qualify, then these provisions obviously do not apply. If it does, then
it goes through the process that I
described.</div><a name="09020558000060"></a>

260</b><b class="B"><a name="09020558000435"></a>Alun

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
261</b><b class="B"><a name="09020558000436"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> May I ask about both witness anonymity and
anonymity in investigations&#151;which comes slightly before that in
the Bill? In relation to anonymity in investigations, which starts at
clause 59, do you understand the reasons for, and if you do understand,
do you agree with, the Government&#146;s decision to limit the
qualifying offences to murder and manslaughter? Is there not an
argument for extending that to offences of serious violence, such as
section 18 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861? We are dealing
with gangs and trying to proceed more effectively against gang members.
If we limit it to murder and manslaughter, surely we may miss out some
of the nasty things that those gangs
do.</div><a name="09020558000063"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Keir
Starmer:</b></i> Those are exceptional in their nature. I
understand that the provisions have been drafted with a view to
achieving a balance between what would be the usual procedures and the
exceptional procedures. A line has been drawn in in clause 59(2). It is
to achieve that balance and to ensure that it operates at least in
those cases.</div>
<a name="09020558000064"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
262</b><b class="B"><a name="09020558000437"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> Do you have any concerns about the age limits
that have been imposed for these sorts of matters&#151;I think it is
18 to 30?</div>
<a name="09020558000065"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Keir
Starmer:</b></i> It is 11 to 30.</div>
<a name="09020558000066"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
263</b><b class="B"><a name="09020558000438"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> Forget the lower level; let us think about those
above 30.</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column109" />Column number: 109</div><a name="09020558000067"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Keir
Starmer:</b></i> The intention is to deal with gangs that
have certain characteristics. That is why the age limit is there. It
means that we will have to consider carefully the evidence that we have
before making applications on our own behalf or, where relevant,
advising the police on such applications. Again, this is an attempt to
balance what in some ways is quite an exceptional measure with other
cases.</div>
<a name="09020558000068"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
264</b><b class="B"><a name="09020558000439"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> Am I misleading myself? You and the Crown
Prosecution Service are not an investigating authority within the terms
of clause 60(2) on page 35. Presumably, it will be your representatives
who make the application to the court. Is that right?</div>
<a name="09020558000069"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Keir
Starmer:</b></i> No. A number of bodies can make that
application and we are one of them. Applications can be made separately
by the police and probably will be at the pre-charge stage. We are more
likely to make an application at the post-charge stage or in a case
where we have been involved in the pre-charge investigation. I
anticipate that many such applications will come through the
police.</div><a name="09020558000070"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
265</b><b class="B"><a name="09020558000440"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> Let me ask you about the anonymity of witnesses
in clause 69 and following on page 40. As you will recall, Parliament
introduced the emergency legislation at the end of last July when your
predecessor was in post. To what extent has emergency legislation been
used in the intervening period between now and then, and have you found
it of practical use? Would you like to see any differences in the
legislation that we passed then, compared with what is in the
Bill?</div>
<a name="09020558000071"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Keir
Starmer:</b></i> I will try and give an indication. We have
the full figures for the period of July to December 2007 and the
position is as follows.</div>
<a name="09020558000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">During that
period, the police identified 137 cases for application. Within each
case, there may be more than one witness. Therefore, within those 137
cases, 346 witnesses were referred to us. We considered those witnesses
and made applications in 135 individual cases&#151;that is 135 of
346, not 135 of 137. Of those 135, 129 applications were granted: 43
for civilians; 35 for undercover police; 49 for police test purchase
officers; and two for other investigators.</div>
<a name="09020558000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">Six were
rejected and we have analysed those rejections. All the cases were
rejected in the Crown court and all involved civilians. In the main,
they involved the court&#146;s opinion that what are now conditions B
and C in clause 71 were not satisfied. The cases generally
turned on questions that arose during the course of the proceedings,
where a different light was put on the overall situation, and/or it was
considered that the witness did not add sufficiently to the prosecution
case to warrant the making of an order. None of the cases involved
threats to property.</div>
<a name="09020558000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">In that
sense, it appears that the measure is working well. In the cases that
we have considered, there is a high success rate when they are put
before the court. We have analysed the refusals for any patterns or
difficulties and there are none, apart from things that are thrown up
on a case-by-case basis. The only difficulty has been dealt with by the
amendment to condition C, which ensures that it reflects the public
harm or public interest rather than the witness not being likely to
give evidence. From analysing the cases month by month over the six
months, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column110" />Column number: 110</div>it appears that the system works well, that the safeguards are in place
and that there is a good correlation between the applications we make
and their success in
court.</div><a name="09020558000075"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
266</b><b class="B"><a name="09020558000441"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> Are the applications made predominantly in the
magistrates court or the Crown
court?</div><a name="09020558000076"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Keir
Starmer:</b></i> Predominantly in the Crown court. I will try
to give you the figures. Of the 137 cases that have been passed to us
for consideration, 133 were in the Crown court, three were in the
magistrates court and one was in the youth court. That batch is still
in the pipeline so I cannot give an overall figure. Not all of those
applications will necessarily be made because we act as a filter, as do
the courts. I hope that that information gives a sense of the
proportions over the six months. The cases are predominantly in the
Crown court and all the refusals have been from Crown court
cases.</div><a name="09020558000077"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
267</b><b class="B"><a name="09020558000442"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> Are the cases in the magistrates court in front
of district
judges?</div><a name="09020558000078"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Keir
Starmer:</b></i> I am not aware of the individual cases
before the magistrates court because the 137 cases are all in the
pipeline. Which of those cases have got to a magistrates court at the
end of the process has not been analysed. I can certainly try to
ascertain whether any of those have passed up to the court level yet
and received a decision, and if so, what the composition of the bench
was. I will try to make that
available.</div><a name="09020558000079"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
268</b><b class="B"><a name="09020558000443"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> I am not just trying to throw tedious questions
at you. I am interested in how this is applied. We all agreed last
summer that this is a required amendment to criminal law. The Bill
requires the investigation element of the orders to go before a justice
of the peace. From your experience of witness anonymity orders, which
were mostly in front of the Crown court apart from three that were in
front of magistrates, would it be more appropriate as a matter of
practice for investigatory anonymity orders also to go in front of the
Crown
court?</div><a name="09020558000080"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Keir
Starmer:</b></i> The two are different and they apply at
different stages. They are different in their nature and in their
extent. Let me make it clear that three cases have not necessarily gone
before the magistrates court yet. Three have been put up for
consideration that would be in the magistrates court. It is difficult
to say what the experience in the magistrates court is because we do
not have that hard evidence. We might not consider those three cases to
be suitable, in which case they would never be put up. It may be that
they are and at that point we will have information on how the
magistrates approach them. I am sorry that we do not have that evidence
now.</div><a name="09020558000081"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020558000444"></a>The

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020558000447"></a>The

Mark Stobbs, director of legal policy at the Law Society; Linda Lee,
deputy vice-president of the Law Society; and Peter Lodder, QC,
chairman of the Criminal Bar
Association.</div><a name="09020558000089"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
270</b><b class="B"><a name="09020558000448"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> Thank you for coming. Could I ask you about the
changes in the Bill affecting the law of homicide provocation? Starting
with Mr. Lodder, are you satisfied that what we see in the
Bill now adequately answers a real or perceived problem in relation to
the law of
provocation?</div><a name="09020558000090"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Peter
Lodder:</b></i> There is a number of problems in the area of
provocation, not least the state of the law at the moment, under which
provocation is a matter that has to be left to a jury&#151;even if it
has not been raised by any party in the course of the trial&#151;if
there is some basis for it. The basis on which it continues to be left
to the jury can be, if one is completely open about this, somewhat
flimsy. It is rather strange for juries dealing with murder cases to be
told by a judge right at the end of a trial&#151;the issue not having
been raised at any stage beforehand&#151;&#147;By the way, you can
consider the issue of provocation&#148;, and then to hear him
identify what it is that might support such a finding. To that extent,
there is undoubtedly some change required. Whether it is the change as
formulated in this Bill is another matter.</div>
<a name="09020558000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although we
are in broad agreement with what this Bill seeks to achieve under the
heading of &#147;loss of control&#148;, we have a few reservations.
We are not presently very happy with the title &#147;loss of
control&#148;. I appreciate that this is an attempt to break away
from the law as it has been but provocation seems to us a clear English
word. The suggestion made by the Law Commission in its report was that
the word &#147;gross&#148; be added before it so that the jury
could understand the threshold for achieving it as a partial defence.
We are supportive of that. We wonder a little whether &#147;loss of
control&#148; conveys the right message. I appreciate that when one
looks at the individual clauses there is some explanation of what is
meant but, inevitably, because defences tend to have tags that
everybody easily and conveniently refers to, it will be called the
&#147;loss of control defence&#148;. In our view &#147;loss of
control&#148; does not convey the same standing or high threshold as
&#147;gross provocation&#148; would.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column112" />Column number: 112</div><a name="09020558000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">Apart from
that general observation, we do have specific reservations about the
sexual infidelity clause. We have set out in our briefing
document&#151;a copy of which I hope you have&#151;two examples of
situations where sexual infidelity as a root cause might give rise to
provocation or loss of control, but in a factual matrix which is not
dependent solely on sexual infidelity. We understand and we do not
disagree with the Government&#146;s desire to stop spouses thinking
that they are justified in killing each other simply because they have
strayed outside the marital vow of fidelity. However, we are concerned
that the Government seek with this clause to discount it completely in
every circumstance, so we have reservations about
it.</div>
<a name="09020558000093"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
271</b><b class="B"><a name="09020558000449"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> Before the others come in, do you also have a
reservation about the proximity of the provoking event to the
killing?</div>
<a name="09020558000094"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Peter
Lodder:</b></i> This is a difficult area. The word
&#147;sudden&#148; will be removed by the Bill and, as I understand
it, the Government are trying to deal with what are sometimes called
the slow-burn cases, in which, for example, a wife is exposed to a
continual pattern of abuse, be it violence or another type, and
eventually loses control&#151;to use the new phraseology. We have
concerns about that, although we have sympathy with the
Government&#146;s objective and can see that there is a purpose in
having a clause that deals with those
scenarios.</div>
<a name="09020558000095"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
272</b><b class="B"><a name="09020558000450"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> Do you see a problem in trying to
marry&#151;sorry, that is the wrong word to use&#151;the ability to
deal with slow-burn provocation or loss of control and clause 41(4),
which outlaws a considered desire for revenge? It is on page
25:</div><a name="09020558000360"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Subsection
(1) does not apply if, in doing or being a party to the killing, D
acted in a considered desire for
revenge.&#148;</div><a name="09020558000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">Are
courts going to find it difficult to distinguish between a slow-burn
but none the less &#147;justified&#148; loss of control and a
considered desire for revenge? The two may sometimes merge.</div>
<a name="09020558000097"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Peter
Lodder:</b></i> They may, and that is where a jury comes in.
Our understanding of how it is likely to be put in a court is that
there will be an element of the straw that broke the camel&#146;s
back, so a trigger incident will eventually be the cause. If the
factual background is that there has been a sustained period of abuse
and then deliberate plotting and nothing happens, save that a week or
so later there is an event that leads to the death of whichever spouse,
the subsection may create that difficulty,
yes.</div><a name="09020558000098"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mark
Stobbs:</b></i> We broadly agree with everything that the Bar
Council has said on that. We think that it is unfortunate that the
Government have not implemented the full recommendations of the Law
Commission, which provided, we thought, a very elegant way of avoiding
the problems that a mandatory death sentence causes and that the

sum up to a jury and, although I may have political differences with

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
279</b><a name="09020558000460"></a><b class="B">David
Howarth</b> (Cambridge) (LD): I have been trying to get to the
bottom of a statement in the Bill&#146;s impact assessment. It says
that the provisions on homicide will result in 100 to 200 more people
being in prison. The Government have clarified that to mean that 10 to
20 people a year will be convicted of murder rather than of
manslaughter, but we are trying to understand where the Bill provides
for that.</div>
<a name="09020558000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall start
with the sexual infidelity aspects of the Bill. How common is it these
days for a simple sexual infidelity provocation&#151;of the sort that
Mr. Lodder described&#151;to succeed? I notice that he was
prosecuting in a case that is often cited, so perhaps he could start.
Are these cases so common that they, themselves, would account for the
10 to 20 cases a year?</div>
<a name="09020558000117"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Peter
Lodder:</b></i> I am not aware of such a case involving
purely and simply sexual infidelity.</div>
<a name="09020558000118"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
280</b><b class="B"><a name="09020558000461"></a>David
Howarth:</b> Often, I notice in the reports that diminished
responsibility and provocation go together in such cases. Is that quite
common?</div>
<a name="09020558000119"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Peter
Lodder:</b></i> There are some cases in which, frankly, you
will run any defence you think you can possibly run, because there is a
rather overwhelming case against you. But, if you are to run diminished
responsibility, there has to be some medical basis; you cannot conjure
it out of the air. So, if it is available to you and a real basis, of
course it would be run as a defence. Provocation may run in tandem,
but, as I have said, the difficulty with provocation is that the judge
can raise it at the trial&#146;s conclusion even though one of the
parties has not raised it as an issue in the
case.</div>
<a name="09020558000120"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
281</b><b class="B"><a name="09020558000462"></a>David
Howarth:</b> It appears to be the Bill&#146;s major
law-tightening reform. Would that, in itself, account for the 10 to 20
cases a year?</div>
<a name="09020558000121"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Peter
Lodder:</b></i> Not in my experience. In my opinion, where
provocation is raised under the circumstances that I outlined at the
beginning, and which we have just discussed again, it rarely causes any
change in the jury&#146;s
view.</div><a name="09020558000122"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
282</b><b class="B"><a name="09020558000463"></a>David
Howarth:</b> Are there any other parts of the new defence of
loss of control that might account for an increase in the number of
convictions for
murder?</div><a name="09020558000123"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Peter
Lodder:</b></i> I do not think
so.</div><a name="09020558000124"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
283</b><b class="B"><a name="09020558000464"></a>David
Howarth:</b> Could it be in the diminished responsibility area
then? Is there a distinct tightening in diminished responsibility that
could account for an increase in
convictions?</div><a name="09020558000125"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Peter
Lodder:</b></i> I ought to say that obviously you are asking
me questions about somebody else&#146;s analysis, and I cannot
comment on how they arrived at that analysis. I can see how it is
possible that the tightening up of the diminished responsibility rules
might affect conviction rates, because the existing situation is less
clear than it is under these clauses. So, possibly yes, that might
tighten it
up.</div><a name="09020558000126"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
284</b><b class="B"><a name="09020558000465"></a>David
Howarth:</b> May I give you an example that I raised on Second
Reading, though perhaps without detailed analysis? Is it possible that
the tightening of the diminished responsibility defence in clause 39
would 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column115" />Column number: 115</div>mean that more mercy killers were found guilty of murder rather than
manslaughter, for example, because of the requirement for a recognised
medical condition&#151;the present law is much looser&#151;or
because of the tightening of the causation requirements? No strict
causation requirement at the moment links the abnormality of mind to
the fact of the offence. In the Bill we have much stricter
causation-type requirements. What would be the position of a mercy
killing case under those
provisions?</div><a name="09020558000127"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Peter
Lodder:</b></i> I cannot see how, on proper analysis, a mercy
killing could come within diminished responsibility. In the ordinary
course of events, a mercy killing is a reasoned decision, based on
wholly different criteria: the individual concerned is acting in
pursuance of a request, or on their assessment of the quality of life
of the person whom they have decided to kill, albeit mercifully. I do
not quite see how they could then rely on diminished responsibility,
but in any event I do not think that someone acting in those
circumstances could be said, even under present law, to be acting under
an abnormality of mind. One of the virtues of these clauses is that
they move away from a phrase that has no medical basis; abnormality of
mind is not a medical term. I am not sure that I can help you much
further.</div><a name="09020558000128"></a>

286</b><b class="B"><a name="09020558000468"></a>David
Howarth:</b> Mercy killers are often found guilty of
manslaughter rather than murder. One cannot see how provocation can
presently apply, so if one cannot see how diminished responsibility
would strictly apply, and it is difficult to see how a mercy killing
could be involuntary manslaughter, what is going on
there?</div><a name="09020558000131"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Peter

wish to return to the question on provocation, that a defence should be
that D has a justifiable sense of being seriously wronged. As
constituency MPs, we all have many people coming to see us with a sense
of being seriously wronged, even if those wrongs are not homicidal in
intent. Can our witnesses explain what it would be to have a
justifiable sense of being seriously wronged? Could that be defined for

288</b><b class="B"><a name="09020558000470"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> That is genuinely helpful to me, and I am
grateful for your road map in interpreting this. Do I then interpret
what you have just said as meaning that the justifiability or otherwise
of this sense of being seriously wronged is not so much on the facts of
what the wrong, or alleged wrong, was, but rather on the circumstances
relevant to a person of the defendant&#146;s sex and age with a
normal degree of tolerance&#151;in other words, it is rather more a
subjective test in relation to the defendant than an objective test on
the facts of what is or it not wrong, or an act of wronging
them.</div>
<a name="09020558000140"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Peter
Lodder:</b></i> If you start with clause 42(4), the loss of

to a thing or things done or

is an objectivity to that test to begin with, which is a general
objectivity. You then have to link it to (b) and follow the road map,
as you have described it, back up to see what a person of the

289</b><b class="B"><a name="09020558000471"></a>Mr.

290</b><b class="B"><a name="09020558000474"></a>Mr.
Kidney:</b> Mr. Lodder, am I right in thinking that
the Bar Council does not have any particular objections to removing the

Lodder:</b></i> It is not something that we have made a
particular feature of. I think the Law Society has made observations
about it and, indeed, although we did not put it in our note, I became
aware of its concerns subsequent to our note. I think it right to say
that in general terms we support what the Law Society has to say about
this. We think&#151;I put it very simply&#151;that there is virtue
in ensuring that a defendant sees those 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column117" />Column number: 117</div>who represent him as soon as possible. There are dangers, in the sense
that if someone becomes disenchanted with the justice system, and does
not have a chance to see his lawyer and gain the confidence that I am
afraid does not exist with a remote link&#151;it is a dehumanising
process, certainly in that context&#151;the savings that are
otherwise sought generally in the justice system may not be achieved.
But, beyond those general observations, I have nothing else to say at
the moment.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
291</b><b class="B"><a name="09020558000475"></a>Mr.

that the Law Society&#146;s position is to draw a distinction between

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
292</b><b class="B"><a name="09020558000476"></a>Mr.

removing the safeguard of consent for people who are in prison
appearing by live
link?</div><a name="09020558000152"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mark
Stobbs:</b></i> Our understanding is that when you are in
prison you have had access to legal advice; you have usually had some
time to think about things and establish what your position is. The
usual course is that the hearings that happen while you are in prison
are of a relatively technical, case-management nature. They are not as
serious as your first appearance in front of a court, when you have to
decide on your plea, when there are issues of bail to be sorted out,
and when it is extremely important that you have had proper access to
legal advice, given the proximity to your arrest and arrival in the
police station. It is not clear to us that that will be achieved under
the scheme. We think that it should be delayed at least until the pilot
is over so that we can assess that
properly.</div><a name="09020558000153"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
293</b><b class="B"><a name="09020558000477"></a>Mr.
Kidney:</b> I have not seen an example of the pilot, but would
the duty solicitor not be shoulder to shoulder with the accused in the
police station. Would not all the advice and discussion take place
before the cameras are switched
on?</div><a name="09020558000154"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mark
Stobbs:</b></i> There are issues with the availability of the
duty solicitor and with the defendant having access to the lawyer of
their choice. We would like to see how this works in the pilot before
consent is taken
away.</div><a name="09020558000155"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
294</b><b class="B"><a name="09020558000478"></a>Mr.
Kidney:</b> The court has to be satisfied that it is not
against the interests of justice to carry on like this. Is it possible
that the court would not ever proceed if the accused said, &#147;I
haven&#146;t met my lawyer
yet.&#148;?</div><a name="09020558000156"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mark
Stobbs:</b></i> I suspect that it is unlikely. There will be
an issue about the amount of time that the defendant has in which to
see their lawyer and for the lawyer to assess properly the
defendant&#146;s capacity to take
decisions.</div><a name="09020558000157"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Linda
Lee:</b></i> As Mr. Lodder said, one of our
concerns is the dehumanising effect that the measure could have. It is
possible that the court will not be aware of the state of mind of the
defendant by video link. Until we are certain about how that works out,
we would be loath to withdraw
consent.</div><a name="09020558000158"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
295</b><b class="B"><a name="09020558000479"></a>Jeremy
Wright:</b> May I ask something about special measures for
witnesses and then something about special measures for a defendant?
The Bill provides automatic eligibility for witnesses under 18 to have 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column118" />Column number: 118</div>special measures for particular gun or knife crimes. Do Mr.
Lodder and Mr. Stobbs think that there is logic in a
particular section of offences being treated in this way? It severs the
link that exists between the need or wish of the witness to have
special measures and the fact that without them the evidence would be
of a lower quality. The measure says simply that if it is a particular
category of offence, there will be automatic eligibility. We all
understand the political reasons for singling out those offences. Are
there legal reasons for doing
it?</div><a name="09020558000159"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Peter
Lodder:</b></i> I will leave Mr. Stobbs to
start.</div><a name="09020558000160"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mark

separation of gun crime. We think that it is a largely political point.
We understand the imperative, but are not sure why a special case for
one group of offences should be in the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020558000480"></a>Jeremy

296</b><b class="B"><a name="09020558000481"></a>Jeremy

the examination of the accused through an intermediary. We all
understand how interpreters are used in criminal courts, but this is
slightly different. The difference is in proposed new section 33BA(4),
which sets out the function of an intermediary as to
communicate</div>

is a form of interpretation so in principle, that is not a problem.
When a court is receiving evidence through an interpreter, it is always
of the greatest importance for the tribunal to be vigilant to ensure
that there is faithful interpretation of what is being said. There are
often times when a witness gives a long answer and the interpreter
comes out with a translation that seems remarkably shorter. That is
often a trigger for a judge to remind the interpreter of the importance
of the proceedings. There is also on occasions a tendency for a
discourse to build up in the witness box. The advantage here with an
intermediary is that it will not be quite so shrouded in mystery as it
might be when there is a language which no one else in the court
speaks. If you straitjacket an intermediary by requiring them not to
give any explanation at all, you will diminish the advantage of the
intermediary&#146;s
presence.</div><a name="09020558000168"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mark

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
297</b><b class="B"><a name="09020558000484"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> I am looking at clause 100 and the following
clauses beginning on page 60, and particularly clause 107 and how that
is to be construed with clause 109, &#147;Resource
implications of guidelines&#148;. We have heard arguments on both
sides of this dilemma. There are those who point to the fact that the
Bill says:</div>
<a name="09020558000371"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Every
court&#151;(a) must, in sentencing an offender, follow any sentencing
guidelines which are relevant to the offender&#146;s case, and (b)
must, in exercising any other function relating to the sentencing of
offenders, follow any sentencing guidelines which are relevant to the
exercise of the function, unless the court is satisfied that it would
be contrary to the interests of justice to do
so.&#148;</div><a name="09020558000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
does not sit very well, they say, with these resource assessments set
out clause 109. The clear inference must be that these resource
assessments are not being written in the air. They are being written in
order to influence sentences. Do you as representatives of the Bar and
of the Law Society have a view about the constitutional propriety or
the practical good sense of these two
clauses?</div><a name="09020558000173"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Peter
Lodder:</b></i> As to the constitutional propriety, obviously
judges are there to follow and to act according to the law. If this is
the law then a judge is obliged to follow it. But it creates a tension
in the sense that, as a member of the judiciary, the judge is supposed
to have some discretion to assess the sentence that would be imposed as
against the circumstances of the offender and the circumstances more
generally of the offence. We have indicated in our response our unease
with the way in which there has been a reversal of the existing
situation into the position in which a judge is directed to follow the
guidelines. We feel, first, that this is an unnecessary change and,
secondly, that is undesirable because it will create a form of
straitjacket on judicial discretion which we do not think is a good
thing.</div><a name="09020558000174"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mark
Stobbs:</b></i> The Law Society would agree with that. We
believe very strongly that judges should have full
discretion.</div><a name="09020558000175"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
298</b><b class="B"><a name="09020558000485"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> Do you think that it would be better perhaps,
looking at clause 107, for us to invite the Government to say that
every court must, in sentencing an offender, take account of as opposed
to follow any sentencing
guidelines?</div><a name="09020558000176"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Peter
Lodder:</b></i> That is the current situation. The current
phraseology is &#147;have regard to&#148; the
guidelines.</div><a name="09020558000177"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
299</b><b class="B"><a name="09020558000486"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> That is the preferred
outcome?</div><a name="09020558000178"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Peter
Lodder:</b></i> Yes. This is an age-old tension between what
the judiciary do and what the Government think is appropriate. To that
extent, it is a political decision. In my experience, and of course
there will be examples to the contrary, most judges are careful to
attend to the guidelines. Even in these clauses as currently drafted
there is still the facility for judges not to follow the guidelines.
The emphasis is much changed. If there is concern that there will be
maverick decisions, strictly speaking there still can be, but the
trouble is that the balance of decisions is shifted by
this.</div><a name="09020558000179"></a>

emphasis. It puts it on to the court to argue against authority and say
why the court has taken the course that it has. It may in that sense
mean that judges are less likely to exercise discretion based on the
circumstances of the

they go outside them they have to
explain?</div><a name="09020558000182"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Peter
Lodder:</b></i> In general, courts have to explain the
reasoning behind their sentences and there are some statutory
requirements when a particular option is taken&#151;for example, why
they have not imposed a custodial sentence or why they have taken a
particular course with regard to a community penalty. The Judicial
Studies Board already issues screeds which judges have to read out as
they pass a sentence in a court, explaining why they have come to the
decisions that they have. In general, an explanation is proffered in
any event.</div>

you are saying that there is no withdrawal of the various

304</b><b class="B"><a name="09020558000491"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> No doubt. Governments and bureaucracies of all
sorts like to collect information in order to make public policy
decisions about the health service, roads, defence and other forms of
public spending. I assert that the criminal justice system is no
different in that regard. Do you think that the resource implication
assessments referred to in clause 109 ought expressly to be directed
towards the Ministry of Justice and those who are designing the prison
or community punishment estate rather than towards sentences? It has
been put to us by those who disagree with me that these resource
implication guidelines and resource assessments will have no fetter on
judicial discretion&#151;it is simply a way of collecting information
so that we can design a criminal justice system based on available
resources and deploy them in an intelligent way. My suspicion is that
it will build into a form of insidious pressure on the judiciary to
sentence in a particular way. Am I being unduly cynical, or do you
think there is a practical purpose behind clause 109 that will be of
value to the criminal justice
system?</div><a name="09020558000188"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Peter

explanation of the reason behind clause 109 so I do not know. Reading
it, it is capable of a sinister interpretation. Whether one makes that
interpretation is up to the individual.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
305</b><b class="B"><a name="09020558000492"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Justice (Maria
Eagle):</b> Briefly, I wonder whether the witnesses accept
that there is a public good, particularly in respect of public
confidence in the system, in having guidelines that generally ensure
some sort of consistency in sentencing in respect of particular crimes?
That is why we have guidelines. Do the witnesses accept that that is
the case? Otherwise, there would be no point in having guidelines at
all.</div><a name="09020558000190"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Peter
Lodder:</b></i> There is undoubtedly value in having
guidelines. Judges up and down the country are dealing with cases day
by day, which may be generally similar, and if the effect of guidelines
is that they achieve some degree of uniformity or consistency, that is
a good thing. The difficulty with guidelines is that they cannot cater
for every situation&#151;if they tried to, they would become
inflexible. The saving grace of a guideline is that it is available but
you are not bound by it. You may draw upon it and follow it where it
applies, but you have the facility to stand outside it when it does not
apply.</div><a name="09020558000191"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
306</b><b class="B"><a name="09020558000493"></a>Maria
Eagle:</b> Given that the Government&#146;s position is that
it would be unacceptable for any  legislative framework such as
this to fetter the discretion of the individual judicial office holder
doing justice  in an individual case, do the witnesses accept
that  clause 107 (1)
(b)&#151;</div><a name="09020558000373"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;unless
the court is satisfied that it would be contrary to the interests of

that discretion? In fact, it may be in the interests of justice in any
or every particular case for the judge or magistrate taking the
decision, with the facts and the defendant in front of them, to make
that decision. The framework, as set out in the Bill, does not prevent
that.</div><a name="09020558000193"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Peter
Lodder:</b></i> The framework does not necessarily prevent
them from doing it, but courts always act in the interests of
justice&#151;it is their reason for being. Currently, they are
required to have regard to the guidelines in any event. My question
rhetorically&#151;I appreciate that I am not allowed to ask you
questions here&#151;is that these features are already in place and
what you are proposing is not changing them, so what is the purpose
behind
it?</div><a name="09020558000194"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
307</b><b class="B"><a name="09020558000494"></a>Jeremy
Wright:</b> On this point, because of the provision that we
are discussing at the moment, I want to return to something that
Mr. Lodder said earlier about the possibility for maverick
decisions being retained. Currently, we know that judges have the
opportunity to disregard the guidelines, if they so choose. The Bill
will retain the opportunity for them to do so, but only if they can
demonstrate that it is interests of justice. We know from clause
102(11)(d) that the sentencing council has to take into
account</div>
<a name="09020558000374"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the cost of
different
sentences&#148;</div><a name="09020558000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">and,
presumably, construct sentencing guidelines that have cost
considerations, but the Minister has made clear to us on many occasions
that the decision of an individual judge will not be subject to cost
considerations. Are we setting up potential problems between those
things? Is it possible that, on an increased number of occasions, the
sentencing judge will invoke the provision that it is not in the
interests of justice for him or her to follow the sentencing guidelines
because, given that they include an element of cost, that judge does
not think that they are relevant to a particular case? 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column122" />Column number: 122</div></div><a name="09020558000196"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Peter
Lodder:</b></i> A judge would be very reluctant to do that.
You sentence according to the relevant principles for the punishment or
rehabilitation of the offender. If you sentence according to cost
implications you come back into the realms of&#151;I cannot remember,
was it a year or so ago?&#151;judges saying, &#147;I&#146;m not
sending you to prison, because I have been told that they are full and
our political masters say that I must not send any more people to
prison.&#148; It is wholly wrong, in our judgment, for any sentence
to be passed on that basis. I can appreciate that the tension may
exist.</div>
<a name="09020558000197"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
308</b><b class="B"><a name="09020558000495"></a>Jeremy
Wright:</b> But my question was about the Bill becoming law
and that tension increasing, because the sentencing council will have
included cost considerations in its deliberations and drafting of the
guidelines. Up to this point, that has not necessarily been the
case.</div>
<a name="09020558000198"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Peter
Lodder:</b></i> I agree that it will be there. The
difficulties for the individual judge will be that, first, while that
factor may have influenced the sentencing council, it does not become
part of the criteria for assessing a sentence for that particular
offence. Secondly, a judge could not use it as a justifying factor in
the interests of justice, at least in my judgment. I do not see how
cost implications come into the interests of justice in the sentencing
exercise.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
309</b><b class="B"><a name="09020558000496"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020558000498"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> In a previous sitting, another witness gave us
the example of a magistrate who had the option of sentencing somebody
to a community sentence that might cost &#163;30,000, or a community
sentence that might cost rather
less&#151;</div><a name="09020558000202"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Peter
Lodder:</b></i> Do you mean a prison sentence and a community

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020558000499"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> These are his figures; this is just an
illustration. In that case, the magistrate would clearly be better
advised to go for the cheaper option if it was as effective. I find
this a difficult&#151;<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> I am sorry
the Minister is mumbling. She can ask a question in a moment. If it is
not the Minister, it is somebody
else.</div><a name="09020558000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having
to make an economic decision while deciding what is in the interests of
justice is a difficult concept for an independent judge to have to come
to terms with. It may be something that they will have to do, and it
may be possible for them to do it, but I wonder whether it is
desirable.</div>
<a name="09020558000205"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Peter
Lodder:</b></i> I think that I have answered that already. In
my judgment, when courts impose a sentence, they must do so according
to what fits the crime. I would have thought that the public at large
would not be happy about a tribunal making a decision based not only on
what is appropriate for that crime and offender, but on what can be
afforded by the institution that  will provide either the
community sentence or the accommodation for somebody who is in
custody.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020558000500"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I find it slightly surprising that it is
necessary for me to remind the Committee that the object of the
exercise is to ask questions of the witnesses, not to argue with each
other. That comes next week. We have a few minutes left. It is not the
prime purpose of this line of questioning, but Mr. Kidney
would like to ask a couple of questions about the coroner&#146;s
court.</div>
<a name="09020558000207"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
310</b><b class="B"><a name="09020558000501"></a>Mr.
Kidney:</b> In the briefing from the Bar Council for the
Second Reading debate, there were a couple of salutary warnings about
the new powers for coroners. One of those powers is to make somebody
give a written statement, and the other is the power to walk into
someone&#146;s home or office and seize evidence. The warning was
that that might become inadmissible in a subsequent criminal trial. Is
that a real danger that could harm future criminal trials if we do not
do something about it in the Bill?</div>
<a name="09020558000208"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Peter
Lodder:</b></i> The short answer is yes. This is something
that we have been drawn further on by the Ministry of Justice,
supplementary to our written briefing. The understanding is that there
might well be a difficulty here, and I do not want to foreshadow what
Ministers may say in due course. In simple terms, there is a right
against self-incrimination. The difficulty is that that might be
compromised by the requirements of statements not taken under the
proper protections afforded by the Police and Criminal Evidence Act
1984. The material might be gathered by a coroner and give rise, quite
properly, to a prosecution. The danger is that the material on which
the prosecution would be founded might have been obtained contrary to
the normal protections that would be available in an ordinary criminal
investigation. As someone on the Ministry of Justice team detected at
an earlier occasion when we explained this issue, that is inconsistent
with another part of the Bill. It is a danger. We have invited people
from the Ministry of Justice to look at it, and I will leave it to them
to say whether or not they found our observations
helpful.</div><a name="09020558000209"></a>

you very much for taking the trouble to come and give evidence to us

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
311</b><b class="B"><a name="09020558000507"></a>David
Howarth:</b> There are three points in your paper which I want
to take up: one that I agree with, one that I disagree with, and one on
which I should like some more information. Let me start with the first 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column124" />Column number: 124</div>point. Would you outline your worries about retaining the notion of loss
of control in the defence that is going to replace
provocation?</div><a name="09020558000215"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Harriet
Wistri</b></i><i class="I"><b class="B">ch:</b></i> My understanding of the
concern, and why we largely support the general direction of the Bill,
is that we want to move away from affording a defence to somebody who
reacts in a temper&#151;in a hot-blooded rage&#151;in response to
discovering that, for example, his wife has been unfaithful. A temper
response is a bit like a loss of control; that is what it is. And we
are not convinced that the Bill moves the new defence away from that
notion so long as the legislation retains it&#151;particularly in a
title. Furthermore, based on the perspective of our work with many
women who have been subject to cumulative provocation, such as
long-term abuse, I cited four appeal cases of women who had been
convicted of murder, in which the Court of Appeal said, &#147;We
don&#146;t see evidence of a loss of control.&#148;</div>
<a name="09020558000354"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent">Part of the
difficulty is that, when somebody is in a state of paralysed fear and
they take action, it is sometimes not possible for a judge or a jury to
see it as their being out of control. Such people may move slowly; the
response is not like lashing out with a fist. So, sometimes they are
denied the provocation defence, because, if provocation is to be left
to a jury, one has to have evidence not only of provocation but of a
loss of self-control. In some cases, the defence has not been
available, and that is my concern with retaining loss of control. I am
not convinced of the need for it, and the Law Commission, in its
recommendations, did not see the need for it, so long as you have two
safeguards, which are in the Bill already. The first is that the action
cannot be taken out of revenge, and I am trying to remember the other
one. I know, however, that two provisions have been designed to exclude
somebody who is in a gang and retaliates, for example, in a revenge
attack. We do not want any such defence to be
available.</div><a name="09020558000216"></a>

312</b><b class="B"><a name="09020558000508"></a>David
Howarth:</b> May I turn to the point with which I do not agree
at all? In your frequently asked questions, you ask whether the defence
will allow honour killings. You say that honour killings are the
paradigm of revenge killings, and you just referred to the no-revenge
provision, but I do not see honour killings necessarily as revenge.
They are a violation of an honour code, and it is that that matters,
rather than revenge against an
individual.</div><a name="09020558000217"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sandra
McNeill:</b></i> I do not agree at all. I think that honour
killings under their common definition as something done by families
from minority ethnic communities, are very much the same as honour
killings by men who think that they have lost control of their wives.
So, loss of control of property, whether it is your daughter or your
wife, is the key thing. For example, if you have forced the woman to
marry a man she does not want to marry and she has left him, is living
with another man, living her own life and not doing what the family
wanted her to do, that killing is taking revenge because she has gone
out of your control. Part of the reason why we think we need to retain
exclusion of infidelity in the Bill, is that keeping the clause on
revenge and excluding infidelity will cover honour killings; together
those two things will prevent the defence being
run.</div><a name="09020558000218"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
313</b><b class="B"><a name="09020558000509"></a>David
Howarth:</b> I have difficulty with that sense of the word
revenge. Revenge for me is vendetta: if you kill someone in my family,
I will kill someone in yours. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column125" />Column number: 125</div>What you are talking about is not revenge but simply anger&#151;being
furious at someone because they have violated some norm that you find
very important. I cannot see how that is revenge.</div>
<a name="09020558000219"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Harriet
Wistrich:</b></i> The other point on honour killing, and this
relates to a question that I may have been discussing with other
witnesses, is about what a justifiable sense of being wronged is.
Perhaps this is part of the problem with the wording of the law. Is it
ever justifiable to kill somebody who dishonours your family by going
off with somebody from another religion, or for whatever reason? I
guess that there would have to be fairly clear guidelines on what was
justifiable, but I would hope that honour killings were never
considered a justifiable reaction to being wronged. They may be more
normal in certain cultures than others, but this Bill is quite
normative; it is about what we accept as right and wrong and what we
think are acceptable ways of behaving in a modern society. Whereas 50
years ago, or 300 years ago, the appropriate response to somebody being
unfaithful might have been to kill them, it is very helpful that the
Bill says that it will never be justified to kill somebody because they
are unfaithful to you&#151;that that is not
acceptable.</div><a name="09020558000220"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
314</b><b class="B"><a name="09020558000510"></a>David
Howarth:</b> But is not the problem that that clause goes in
because of the problem with the word justifiable in the first place,
which still allows honour killings possibly to get through? Justifiable
to whom? To the defendant? The defendant obviously thinks that it is
justifiable; otherwise, they would not give the reason they do for the
killing. So it comes down to being justifiable objectively in the mind
of the jury. It seems that this point will get to the jury, and that it
will then possibly get through the
jury.</div><a name="09020558000221"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sandra
McNeill:</b></i> If hon. Members want to make absolutely sure
that honour killings are excluded, add a clause to the clause that
excludes infidelity, and exclude honour killings as well. We would be
very happy with
that.</div><a name="09020558000222"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020558000511"></a>David
Howarth:</b> I am glad that you think that. Turning to the
infidelity point for a second&#151;I know that other Members want to
ask about this&#151;how often do pure infidelity provocation defences
work these days? We know that they worked in the past, but time has
moved on. Lord Phillips said famously that infidelity was a good
excuse. That is no longer the case; sentences have got longer. Often
when these defences are run, they are run in conjunction with other
defences. You cite the Dalton case in paragraph 17 of your paper. Do
you have a transcript of the judgment or the instruction to the jury in
that case? There were two entirely different accounts of it in the
media. One said that there was provocation by reason of infidelity and
the other said that it was involuntary manslaughter and that the
specific intent for murder was not established. I shall be grateful if
you will write to the Committee with further information on that
case.</div><a name="09020558000223"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
315</b><b class="B"><a name="09020558000512"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> The exchange between you and Mr. David
Howarth about honour killing has intrigued me. Do you agree that
whatever the merits or demerits of clause 42(6)(c) in relation to
sexual infidelity, it has nothing whatever to do with honour killings?
Do you also agree that someone charged with an honour killing will not
be protected from a finding of guilt of murder, assuming that the
evidence is there, under these clauses?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column126" />Column number: 126</div><a name="09020558000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although the
test in clause 42(4)(b) is subjective, it must be assessed objectively.
It is therefore unlikely that any jury will think that people who kill
women for marrying someone they disapprove of</div>
<a name="09020558000375"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;have a
justifiable sense of being seriously
wronged.&#148;</div><a name="09020558000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
addition, in clause
41(1)(c)</div><a name="09020558000376"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a
person of D&#146;s sex and age, with a normal degree of tolerance and
self-restraint and in the circumstances of
D&#148;</div><a name="09020558000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">surely
would not have reacted in the same or any similar way to D if we are
talking about rational juries. In our society, we do not permit the
killing of people because they have married someone we do not approve
of. That may be approved of in other jurisdictions, but under English
law honour killing will not be protected or turned into manslaughter
even with the provisions in clauses 41 and
42.</div><a name="09020558000227"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sandra
McNeill:</b></i> I would like to cite the case of Tasleem
Begum in Bradford. Her killer was her arranged husband&#146;s brother
and also her cousin. She had left the arranged marriage and had not
brought her husband over from Pakistan. She had started an affair with
another man and was living independently. Her husband&#146;s brother
ran over her repeatedly in a car in public. Ultimately, his defence was
that by starting the affair with the other man she had offended his
code of honour and that it was an honour killing. The case never went
before a jury because the judge and the prosecution accepted his
account. He got five years for provocation. There was an outcry,
although the imams of Bradford said that it was legal under sharia law.
I would have hoped that the outcry surrounding that case meant that it
would never happen again, but it
has.</div><a name="09020558000228"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020558000513"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> That is interesting, but I do not know how
helpful it is because we do not know the reasons that the judge
accepted from the prosecution for withdrawing the case from the jury,
if that is what happened. Perhaps I should leave it there because we
could enter into a rather infertile
argument.</div><a name="09020558000229"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
316</b><b class="B"><a name="09020558000514"></a>Jeremy
Wright:</b> I invite you to look at clause
42(4)(a), which is linked to paragraph (b) that has been referred to. I
do not want to go back over what is justifiable and to whom. Do you
believe that any properly directed jury would come to the conclusion
that a woman marrying the wrong person or engaging in an affair with
someone that the family disapproves of constitutes</div>
<a name="09020558000377"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;circumstances
of an extremely grave
character&#148;?</div><a name="09020558000230"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sandra
McNeill:</b></i> I would not presume to know what a jury
would do. In my experience, juries can do
anything.</div><a name="09020558000231"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
317</b><b class="B"><a name="09020558000515"></a>Jeremy
Wright:</b> My point is that unless the jury were to come to
that conclusion, it would not matter whether the defendant thought that
their actions were justifiable or not.</div>
<a name="09020558000232"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Harriet
Wistrich:</b></i> I think that is right. It will take a lot
of twisting and persuading to convince a jury of 12 people
that marrying the wrong person
constitutes</div><a name="09020558000378"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;circumstances
of an extremely grave
character&#148;.</div><a name="09020558000233"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
318</b><b class="B"><a name="09020558000516"></a>Jeremy
Wright:</b> Perhaps we do not need to be as worried as we seem
to be about the possibility of honour killings being allowed through by
this clause.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column127" />Column number: 127</div><a name="09020558000234"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Harriet
Wistrich:</b></i> I do not think that they will. It would be
very hard to get a classic honour killing through this clause. Perhaps
there would be nothing wrong, as we have an exclusion on infidelity, in
adding an exclusion on honour killing, given the concerns about those
terrible crimes, which still go
on.</div><a name="09020558000235"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
319</b><b class="B"><a name="09020558000517"></a>Maria
Eagle:</b> Given your experience over the years in dealing
with murders that have resulted from fear-based reactions&#151;often
gender specific, as it happens, in respect of your own work&#151;do
you believe that the change being proposed in the Bill to introduce
fear of serious violence as an element that can give rise to protection
from this partial defence is
helpful?</div><a name="09020558000236"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Harriet
Wistrich:</b></i> I think it is extremely helpful. It is very
important because in a number of cases involving women that I have
worked with&#151;I do not think that such cases necessarily
exclusively involve women because there are men who have been
systematic victims of abuse, but mostly we work with women&#151;where
it has almost been self defence, the women have acted after being
threatened with violence. I have cited in the paper two cases
&#151;Joanne Cole and Kirsty Scamp&#151;which I think are perfect
illustrations of why it would be an important advance to introduce fear
of serious violence. These defendants are often stuck in a very
difficult place. They say that they feared for their life, that they
were being attacked at the time, and that they want to run
self-defence.</div><a name="09020558000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
the case of Kirsty Scamp&#151;a 19-year-old who was recently
convicted of murder&#151;the prosecution said that they would accept
a plea of manslaughter on the basis that she acted in excessive
self-defence. She said no, it was self-defence. When the defendant goes
for complete acquittal for murder, juries are not keen to return
self-defence unless they are absolutely convinced that that was the
case. Often where there is an inequality&#151;where one person is
physically a lot weaker, for example&#151;the person may have used a
weapon when they were not being threatened with a weapon. There is an
issue of disproportionality. They may have waited a moment; they may
not have struck in the course of the exact struggle. There may be
reasons why self-defence is not met. They then fall in the hole between
acquittal and a life sentence because they do not necessarily fit
provocation or diminished, which are the only other
options.</div><a name="09020558000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
think that fear of serious violence would be precisely where a jury is
just not sure that it was pure self-defence, but concedes that the
person was terrified and might have overreacted. There are often cases
in which somebody has historically been a victim of abuse&#151;they
may have developed post-traumatic stress disorder or similar traumatic
symptoms, for example. Their startle response to a particular act may
be slightly exaggerated. Something may happen that triggers a bigger
response than perhaps a person who had not been through that experience
would have. If they have so many experiences of being beaten up in a
particular way and then something happens that is the last thing that
triggers their response&#151;it may be an over-response; it may be
what we call excessive self-defence&#151;and yet the response does
not fit the provocation, as we have it now, those women are convicted
of murder. That seems to me, and certainly our campaign, to be a
miscarriage of justice for somebody who has responded in that way. So
yes, we are very much in support of the
measure.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
320</b><b class="B"><a name="09020558000518"></a>Maria
Eagle:</b> You have made clear your views on the exclusion in
the Bill of the use of sexual infidelity in respect of this defence.
One of the other suggestions is that the phrase &#147;gross
provocation&#148; ought to be used to highlight the very high level
of the remaining loss of self-control. I will come on to one further
question about that in a moment. What would your view be on the use of
a phrase such as &#147;gross provocation&#148; in the law, instead
of the replacements we have here?</div>
<a name="09020558000240"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Harriet
Wistrich:</b></i> It is a qualifying word&#151;I do not
know whether it helps very much because what is provocation and what
makes it gross? It is not very precise, which is part of the problem.
From our concerns about the provocation defence being used, let us
forget infidelity&#151;the other kind of classic cases where we have
seen what we would regard as injustices could be, for example, where
somebody has said they were nagged. Is it gross provocation where the
judge says, &#147;This woman would have tried the patience of a
saint&#148;? Is that a justification to kill? Whether you use
&#147;gross provocation&#148; or the wording here, it is to try and
exclude the sort of cases which are not justifications for
killing.</div>
<a name="09020558000241"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
321</b><b class="B"><a name="09020558000519"></a>Maria
Eagle:</b> I have one further question. You have expressed
concern this afternoon, and in your written evidence, about any
retention of the &#147;loss of self-control&#148; element. I wonder
if I might put a scenario to you which is not a real case, just to see
what your reaction might be. It is a reason why &#147;loss of
self-control&#148; ought still to be there in some
form.</div><a name="09020558000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">Somebody
whose family has been murdered in a genocide is walking in the street
and&#151;such things have happened&#151;comes across one of the
perpetrators of that massacre. They remonstrate with them, are taunted
or laughed at, and then lose their self-control in a classic sudden
way. They kill that person. Would you have sympathy&#151;no, not
sympathy&#151;but would you see the point of the retention of loss of
self-control as a concept, on the grounds that the circumstances would
have pushed this person beyond any reasonable level of restraint that
most of us might expect people to exercise in a civilised
society?</div>
<a name="09020558000243"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Harriet
Wistrich:</b></i> It is not precisely this experience which
we work with. The point&#151;in so far as it is analogous with cases
that we have worked around&#151;is what is the kind of underlying
history that affects the psychology of the person who kills? If you
have lost your family in a genocide you may have a deep, traumatised
psychological make-up. It may all be there under the surface, but it is
a bit difficult to
extrapolate&#151;</div><a name="09020558000244"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sandra
McNeill:</b></i> That is not her area of expertise. If
possible within the time, I would welcome the opportunity to quickly
address the suggestion by the previous row of witnesses, that sexual
infidelity, with something else like &#147;taunting&#148; should be
allowed. May I address you briefly on that?</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020558000523"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Given the shortage of time and the fact that you
want to say something else, if there is any further thought that you
want to add, feel free to submit a note to the Committee. We shall be
delighted to receive it. Sandra McNeill; you wish to say
something?</div><a name="09020558000251"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sandra
McNeill:</b></i> Yes. Mostly, when men allege infidelity,
they say, &#147;And she taunted me.&#148; There was the case of
Ward, who alleged, &#147;She said the baby wasn&#146;t mine. I lost
it and strangled her.&#148; He was not put on trial. He got three
years for manslaughter. When he got out he murdered his next
girlfriend, Valerie Middleton, and again alleged taunting, saying,
&#147;She told me she had another lover who was better in bed than
me.&#148; And I sat in the gallery and in the canteen with friends
and family who said to me, &#147;No way would she have taunted him.
She was terrified of him.&#148;</div>
<a name="09020558000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would also
like to cite the case of Cooper, 2002, who strangled his wife and told
the police, &#147;She taunted me. She had another lover who was
better in bed than me.&#148; What Cooper forgot was that there was a
voice-activated recorder in the room&#151;a tape
recorder&#151;which recorded him abusing her for 24 minutes while she
begged for her life and swore she loved him and was true to him, and
then he said, &#147;You are the weakest link. Goodbye,&#148; and
strangled her. That made all the tabloid headlines.</div>
<a name="09020558000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">Unfortunately,
not all murders are recorded on tape recorders. So as for saying that
it is okay to allow the defence of sexual infidelity as long as he
adds, &#147;and she taunted me&#148;&#151;no. That is just
including sexual infidelity, and you have seen our reasons for wanting
to exclude it. As we say, we do not live in the 16th century. There are
countries where people are executed for adultery; remember the fury
over the documentary &#147;Death of a Princess&#148;? What if we
allow men to execute their wives simply for leaving them for another
man? There is another example: it is not just infidelity but,
&#147;She left me for another man&#148;. That is another
allegation, as in Hume&#146;s case. Again there was not a jury; it
was just accepted by judge and prosecution.</div>
<a name="09020558000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">If we allow
those men to execute their wives and do not convict them of murder we
have in fact got the death sentence for adultery in this country, and
in the 21st century we should not have.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
323</b><b class="B"><a name="09020558000526"></a>Mr.
Bellingham:</b> Thank you for coming. I want
to ask a series of questions&#151;perhaps five in total&#151;the
first of which is fairly general. Certainly, on this side of the
Committee, anyway, we are concerned about the Government&#146;s
general record on the handling, transportation and storage of data,
which we think is pretty poor. There is a real fear that the powers of
the state are increasing without the necessary safeguards being put in
place. Certainly in this context, clause 152 is very
far-reaching.</div>
<a name="09020558000259"></a><div class="hs_Para">First of all,
the Serious Crime Act 2007 provided for data sharing between public and
private bodies to defeat serious crime. Do you not think that in many
ways this went far enough in terms of data sharing? Do you share my
concern that the EU data protection directive could be breached by this
clause? The directive makes it clear that the data subject has
unambiguously to give his or her consent. It is possible that this
clause is incompatible with the UK&#146;s obligations under EU law.
Looking at those points, would you give some general
comment?</div><a name="09020558000260"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Richard
Thomas:</b></i> I start by clarifying my position. I am the
Information Commissioner responsible for enforcement of data protection
legislation. I was also asked to carry out the data-sharing review with
Sir Mark Walport of the Wellcome Trust, which I did in a semi-personal
capacity. Some but not all of the provisions of part 8 of the Bill
reflect our recommendations, and I spent seven or eight months on that
review, alongside my official responsibilities.</div>
<a name="09020558000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the course
of that review, we received a mass of evidence. We started in November
2007 and produced our report in July 2008. We received a mass of
written evidence and held a large number of consultation
meetings&#151;hearings of one sort or another. I hope that it is not
arrogant to say that the broad analysis that we brought forward has
been widely accepted. You cannot say that data sharing is good or bad.
There can be wholly inappropriate data sharing. There can be sharing
that should be but is not taking place. We advocated what I call a
public interest approach. Where sharing is beneficial, provided certain
safeguards are in place, it should be permitted. Where it is not
appropriate, it should not be allowed.</div>
<a name="09020558000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">We set out an
analysis of the circumstances in which there should or should not be
sharing and how sharing should take place. We set out three broad
headings under which sharing might be appropriate: for law enforcement;
for the improvement of services, particularly public services; and for
research and statistical purposes. In our report we examine those
situations in detail. The final chapter of our report brought forward a
series of recommendations. A word I particularly want to emphasise to
the Committee is in paragraph 8.1, the first paragraph of that final
chapter. This is a &#147;package&#148; of recommendations. Sir Mark
Walport and I saw this very much as a package&#151;on the one hand,
to improve the arrangements for beneficial data sharing where that is
appropriate, and on the other, to be balanced by a series of safeguards
and protections, not least, stronger powers for my office. I would like
to address that in more detail during the course of the afternoon. I
stand down in June of this year but my successor will, I hope, benefit
from stronger powers because we have been handicapped throughout the
life of the Information Commissioner&#146;s Office&#151;formerly
the Data Protection Commissioner&#146;s Office&#151;by having very
weak powers.</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column131" />Column number: 131</div><a name="09020558000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">Life
has changed dramatically. There has been a fundamental shift in the
past few years in awareness of the risks of data-handling. Where there
is poor data-handling, there are considerable risks for individuals and
society at large, and your question hinted at an awareness of that.
There is also a much wider set of public concerns about data
protection, borne out by our own surveys. Our most recent survey
indicates that the general public now rank the handling of personal
information alongside concerns about the prevention of crime,
expressing stronger concern about it, for example, than about the
health service or the environment.</div>
<a name="09020558000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">We welcome
the fact that part 8 of this Bill provides an opportunity for improving
data protection law and, to a certain extent, there is a cross-party
interest in doing that. I also recognise that at the moment, I and my
office can give only a heavily qualified welcome to part 8. We think
that there are beneficial aspects to it. We have provided the Committee
with a written memorandum setting out our position. But we fear that
the data-sharing powers are somewhat wider and less safeguarded than
was proposed in the Thomas-Walport report and that the powers available
to my office are substantially weaker. We would like to see what
eventually emerges by the time of Royal Assent more closely mirroring
what we spent seven months researching and putting
forward.</div><a name="09020558000265"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
your specific question about compatibility with the European directive,
that sets the framework for data protection law in this country. The
Data Protection Act 1998 transposes that directive. Whatever goes
through in part 8 of the Bill will remain subject both to the European
directive and to that Act. One of the changes that we would like to see
is that if the data-sharing order remains, it should be spelled out in
the Bill that any arrangement that has come forward as a result of a
data-sharing order should explicitly remain subject to the data
protection legislation. That is undoubtedly the case, but it is not
spelt out in the
Bill.</div><a name="09020558000266"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
324</b><b class="B"><a name="09020558000527"></a>Mr.
Bellingham:</b> You mentioned the 1998 Act. Incidentally I am
grateful for the briefing that you sent to the Committee. I certainly
feel that the part of the Bill that gives more powers to your office
makes a lot of sense. The 1998 Act contains various exemptions that are
specifically intended to ensure that data protection does not prevent
the use or sharing of personal information, where a failure to do so
would prejudice the purposes of law enforcement. Public bodies have or
should have the knowledge and confidence to rely on the exemptions to
the Act, when it is necessary to do so. In that context, do we not have
sufficient legislation in place already, without bringing in
far-reaching, sweeping extra powers for data-sharing? Public
authorities can share data already. There was a quantum leap forward
with the Serious Crime Act 2007. Does it make sense and is there a real
demand to go further
still?</div><a name="09020558000267"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Richard
Thomas:</b></i> I failed to address your specific point about
consent. Yes, one of the grounds for data processing is consent, but
there are other grounds which are permitted by the European directive.
In paragraph 5.7 of our report, we explain some of the
limitations, particularly in the law enforcement area but also in areas
like taxation and child protection, where you cannot rely on consent
alone. Sometimes it is wholly inappropriate to rely
on consent and that is understood by both the directive and the 1998
Act.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column132" />Column number: 132</div><a name="09020558000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">On your wider
point about whether there are sufficient powers already, one of the
reasons why Sir Mark Walport and I put forward those proposals is that
we feel very strongly that we need greater scrutiny and less confusion
when it comes to data sharing. We came across a really quite
unsatisfactory state of affairs, where almost every single witness
brought to us the evidence that there is what we called a fog of
confusion about what can and cannot be shared. We talked about a
culture of risk aversion, a culture of uncertainty and people not
knowing where they
stand.</div><a name="09020558000269"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
reason why there could be greater scrutiny with the data-sharing order
is that so often when a Department wants or needs to share information
for a particular purpose, it brings forward a very precise sectoral
provision, which is often tucked away at the back of a Bill. One
example would be schedule 30 to the School Standards and Framework Act
1998, which created the national pupil database. That amended previous
legislation, and it got no parliamentary debate whatsoever.</div>
<a name="09020558000270"></a><div class="hs_Para">There have
been many examples where specific provisions have
been brought forward because there is insufficient power or there are
legal difficulties. Those are not debated sufficiently in Parliament.
Another example would be the Learning and Skills Act 2000. You could
argue that when the national DNA database went through, it was not
sufficiently scrutinised by Parliament. These sorts of things are often
added at quite a late stage in the Bill. They are not picked up and are
not debated in
Parliament.</div><a name="09020558000271"></a><div class="hs_Para">So
we brought forward this far more transparent process with a number of
safeguards. First, there is a requirement for public consultation on
the specific proposal. Secondly, there is a requirement for a privacy
impact assessment. The Committee may know about how those have been
used widely in other countries. Over the past two or three years, we
have been pushing for them to be used to evaluate the risk associated
with any data sharing. Thirdly, there is a requirement for the
Information Commissioner&#146;s office to give an opinion on the
acceptability of a data-sharing
measure.</div><a name="09020558000272"></a><div class="hs_Para">Fourthly,
there is an affirmative resolution procedure so that Parliament has an
opportunity to examine it rather than just nodding it through by way of
negative resolution, which would be completely unacceptable, or it
being tucked away in a Bill and not scrutinised. I accept that a
measure put forward by affirmative resolution cannot easily be amended,
but it would create greater awareness. If done properly, that measure
could end up with greater scrutiny and less confusion. I have some
reservations over the wording of part 8 and that must be improved. If
that is done, the measure will be in the public
interest.</div><a name="09020558000273"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
325</b><b class="B"><a name="09020558000528"></a>Mr.
Bellingham:</b> In October 2006, you sent a position paper to
the Home Office in reference to the Serious Crime Act 2007. Are your
views the same on the impact of information sharing on private
individuals? On page 4, you
stated:</div><a name="09020558000379"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It
is important to keep any information sharing initiative under periodic
review, to assess its impact on personal privacy and to determine how
successful the sharing has been in terms of protecting the public
purse, apprehending offenders and so forth. A successful
information-sharing initiative could still be unacceptable on data
protection grounds, for example because it causes widespread and
unwarranted detriment to
individuals.&#148;</div><a name="09020558000274"></a><div class="hs_Para">Do
you still stand by the general thrust of those remarks? Does this part
of the Bill contain the necessary safeguards?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column133" />Column number: 133</div><a name="09020558000275"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Richard
Thomas:</b></i> I stand by the general sentiment of that. You
have the advantage of a better recall of that measure than me. As I
recall, in the passage of the 2007 Act there were many discussions
about a data-sharing provision for the purposes of serious crime
detection. A package of measures was put forward that met the concerns
that I expressed in that memorandum and elsewhere. That is an example
of a case being put forward for information sharing for law enforcement
purposes. I do not think that there was any serious dissent saying that
it was
unacceptable.</div><a name="09020558000276"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
remains necessary that in every case no more information is shared than
is needed for the particular purpose. There must be safeguards over how
data are shared and constant vigilance is needed to ensure that the
rules of the game are followed, as that note stated. That is one reason
why I attach so much importance to my office having the powers of
inspection and scrutiny that are necessary to ensure that the
arrangements are
working.</div><a name="09020558000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another
example of data sharing being acceptable with certain safeguards is
when the Metropolitan police wanted access to the Transport for London
congestion cameras to prevent acts of terrorism or to find out what had
happened after acts of terrorism. With the Home Office, the
Metropolitan police and Transport for London, my office was involved in
putting together a protocol that confined the sharing to precisely
defined circumstances. That data sharing can be used only in cases of
suspected or actual terrorism&#151;not even in cases of serious
crime&#151;and there must be a proper audit trail of what is going
on. There is a consensual or contractual inspection power for my office
to find out what has happened in any particular
situation.</div><a name="09020558000278"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
needs to be careful with data sharing. I am the first to advocate that.
Some of the safeguards in the Bill are necessary, but some do not go
far
enough.</div><a name="09020558000279"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
326</b><b class="B"><a name="09020558000529"></a>Mr.
Bellingham:</b> How can we keep the measure under periodic
review? We might be passing vital legislation. You mentioned in the
past that it is important to keep it under periodic review. How can we
do
that?</div><a name="09020558000280"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Richard
Thomas:</b></i> Primarily by my office having the power to
inspect without consent. For more than 20 years, my office
has not had the power to carry out any inspection without the consent
of the organisation concerned. In the six and a half years that I have
been commissioner, I have strenuously argued that that is not
acceptable. One would not expect a food inspector to have to get the
restaurant&#146;s consent before carrying out an inspection. The Bill
moves towards giving us stronger powers, and I regard clause 151 on the
assessment notice procedure as very welcome so far as it goes, but I am
very concerned indeed that it extends only to Government Departments.
Our report made it very clear that that sort of power is required right
across the private and voluntary sectors for all data
controllers.</div>
<a name="09020558000281"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
unacceptable that the assessment notice currently has no associated
sanction. If an organisation says, &#147;No, we are not going to
follow the requirements of your assessment notice, Mr.
Commissioner&#148;, there is no sanction. I very strongly urge this
Committee to put that right&#151;please.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020558000530"></a>Mr.
Bellingham:</b> I have additional questions on
clauses 154 and 155, but other colleagues may want to come
in on clause 152.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column134" />Column number: 134</div><a name="09020558000283"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
327</b><b class="B"><a name="09020558000531"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> I thank my hon. Friend for letting me in, because
I have to leave shortly. I shall raise three quick points. The first is
about what I understand is called field protection. Information may
pass from one Government Department to another or elsewhere. I have
heard criticism in the past that you are either in or out of that
process, and that the whole file is sent. The more common practice in
data security in the private sector is to release the amount of
information that is relevant to the particular inquiry. Should we turn
our attention to that?</div>
<a name="09020558000284"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Richard
Thomas:</b></i> Yes, I think that you are raising a very
important point and I entirely agree. Data minimisation is a
fundamental principle of data protection&#151;no more, for no longer
than is needed for a particular purpose. With the broad machinery of a
privacy impact assessment, people can ensure that nothing excessive is
happening, so each action can be justified, by ensuring that no more
data than are needed are used or shared, and there are safeguards about
security and the end use. That is a more transparent way of ensuring
that we are not giving a blank cheque to those who are otherwise
engaged in data
sharing.</div><a name="09020558000285"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
think that the commissioner&#146;s opinion will be important, because
I do not think that it is simply a formality. The commissioner can
insist on a privacy impact assessment under the code of practice to see
the justification for a particular measure. If they still think that it
goes too far and is either wholly unacceptable or does not have
sufficient safeguards or conditions, the commissioner can say so. We
have a robust and responsible approach and I believe that I, and my
successors, would say if a particular measure went too far in the
report to Parliament. Frankly, it would be a brave Department that came
forward and said, &#147;We insist on this particular data-sharing
measure, even though the commissioner has said that it is unacceptable
and does not meet data protection
requirements.&#148;</div><a name="09020558000286"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
328</b><b class="B"><a name="09020558000532"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> Thank you for that firm statement. Following on
from that thought is the question of what you might call &#147;data
gouging&#148;, in which data are passed for a perfectly defensible
purpose and then employed for other purposes or used more widely. I
notice that you refer to that danger in your memorandum. Can we stop or
restrict that more than we appear to be able to with the provisions in
the Bill? For example, once the data have leapt the wall, it is
difficult to prevent the whole lot being used for other purposes,
whatever undertakings were given at the
time.</div><a name="09020558000287"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Richard
Thomas:</b></i> I understand the point. That is one reason
why Mark Walport and I called for precisely defined circumstances in
our recommendations. We also said that the process would not be
suitable for any large-scale data-sharing initiative that constitutes a
significant change to public policy&#151;for example, identity cards
and the DNA database. There needs to be absolute stringency and
control, and limitations on any data-sharing order brought forward to
meet the sort of concerns that you have
expressed.</div><a name="09020558000288"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
would like to turn to a specific concern, which echoes part of
Mr. Bellingham&#146;s question. We are unhappy
with the definition of sharing in proposed new section 50A
to the Data Protection Act 1998. Proposed new section
50A(3)(a) is fine; that is about data sharing from one organisation to
another. However, we have strong reservations about paragraph (b),
which reads,</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column135" />Column number: 135</div><a name="09020558000380"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;consults
or uses the information for a purpose other than the purpose for which
the information was
obtained.&#148;</div><a name="09020558000289"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is not data sharing as Mark Walport and I understood it. We were
concerned with sharing from one organisation to another, but that
raises a completely different set of issues where a single
organisation, having collected and gathered information for one
purpose, wishes to use it for another purpose. That goes to the heart
of some of the principles of data protection. Use limitation is the
shorthand for that part of data protection, and we have anxieties about
the drafting of that provision. It may be more than just a drafting
point, because whereas proposed new section 50A(3)(a) deals with
genuine sharing, proposed new paragraph (b) is concerned with a
different situation altogether.</div>
<a name="09020558000290"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
329</b><b class="B"><a name="09020558000533"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> In the public sector, there are at least in
principle&#151;albeit they may not work well in practice&#151;a
series of safeguards over and above those available through your
office. For example, there is the Official Secrets Act and in certain
cases, such as cases involving the Taxes Act, it is a criminal offence
to disclose people&#146;s Revenue
files.</div><a name="09020558000291"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
a different context, I expressed some concern about this
extension&#151;where you use contractors who may be located outwith
the jurisdiction, for example. That same point is also of concern in
relation to data that are shared with private sector organisations. How
do we get an equality of responsibility with that sort of
situation?</div>
<a name="09020558000292"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Richard
Thomas:</b></i> In our report, we looked at the picture at
large, and we explicitly said that it no longer makes sense to draw
sharp dividing lines between the public, private and voluntary sectors.
We have the use of private sector contractors, the involvement of the
private sector in traditional public functions and the use of the
voluntary sector to carry out public functions&#151;I had a meeting
with the Minister last week, and we discussed the example of a
children&#146;s charity carrying out child protection work for a
local authority. It is right to have a global approach. We cannot draw
those sorts of distinctions between the different sectors any more.
That is one fundamental reason why we think that the powers available
to the commissioner&#146;s office need to extend to all data
controllers. It does not make sense  to limit the assessment
notice only to Government Departments or other public authorities
designated by the Secretary of State, as clause 152 is currently does.
It needs to apply to all data controllers from the outset, to put right
something that has been wrong for more than 20
years.</div>
<a name="09020558000293"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
330</b><a name="09020558000534"></a><b class="B">Ian
Lucas</b> (Wrexham) (Lab): Mr. Thomas, earlier you
gave the example of the Transport for London protocol relating to the
sharing of images from congestion charging. I am interested in what
process was used to activate that. Was it a legislative
process?</div>
<a name="09020558000294"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Richard
Thomas:</b></i> Yes it was. There is a section of the Data
Protection Act&#151;I forget which number; perhaps David will remind
me&#151;which allows the commissioner to agree that for law
enforcement purposes, a particular arrangement can be made along those
lines. That is a good example. Nobody would ever justify use of the
congestion cameras for anything other than congestion charging or for
very serious matters. Mark Walport and I said that it would be
manifestly unreasonable if a wife  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column136" />Column number: 136</div>trying to check up on her husband running off with another woman could
somehow have access to the congestion charge cameras. That would be
wholly unacceptable. A proportionate response is required in all these
situations.</div>
<a name="09020558000295"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
331</b><b class="B"><a name="09020558000535"></a>Ian
Lucas:</b> Just to be clear, there was no parliamentary
scrutiny involved in that process?</div>
<a name="09020558000296"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Richard
Thomas:</b></i> No, and I think that was a defect. It would
clearly be far better if that sort of arrangement could come before
Parliament as part of a democratic process. Parliament would then say,
&#147;Yes, that is okay,&#148; or &#147;No, that is not
okay.&#148; That is a better way forward than having some of this
done behind closed
doors.</div><a name="09020558000297"></a><div class="hs_Para"></div><a name="09020558000298"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
332</b><b class="B"><a name="09020558000536"></a>Ian
Lucas:</b> Do you have any concerns that the affirmative
resolution process is secondary legislation, which will effectively
amend primary
legislation?</div><a name="09020558000299"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Richard
Thomas:</b></i> We understood when we put this forward that
it would be very controversial, and I think that it is for the
Government to defend the precise nature of what is being introduced.
But we also documented the unsatisfactory current state of affairs.
Lawyers are expressing doubt; there is a lot of confusion; and a
specific gateway has been included at the back of a Bill, which just
adds to the general field of confusion. We have said a lot about more
and more layers being put on top of the basic legal framework. That
just creates greater and greater confusion, and there is no scrutiny
whatsoever. So, although I understand that anything that even looks
like a Henry VIII clause will be very controversial&#151;it is for
you to decide whether this is the right way forward&#151;on balance
we thought that that was a better way forward and a better way of
getting more scrutiny, more safeguards and ultimately more certainty
into a very confused area. But, all my support for that is qualified by
the reservations that I am
expressing.</div><a name="09020558000300"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
333</b><b class="B"><a name="09020558000537"></a>Mr.
Kidney:</b> Mr. Thomas, it is evident that
discussion is ongoing between you and the Ministry of Justice about why
you feel that the Bill is inadequate on safeguards. May I push you, on
behalf of us all, on that? Do you envisage that the Bill should set out
the kinds of themes that you gave us&#151;law enforcement, public
services improvement and research&#151;and no others, or do you
envisage a set of examples of what is not acceptable, or indeed a
mixture of the
two?</div><a name="09020558000301"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Richard
Thomas:</b></i> Mark and I are not draftsmen; we put forward
broad themes. I was a little surprised when I saw mention in the Bill
of securing a relevant policy objective. We are very clear that there
need to be rationales under those three broad headings&#151;law
enforcement and public protection, improving public services and
research and statistical analysis. I have not come here this afternoon
with specific drafting ideas. Perhaps one could work around that, or
around some sort of public interest justification, but a rationale
based purely on securing a governmental policy objective seems too
wide.</div><a name="09020558000302"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
334</b><b class="B"><a name="09020558000538"></a>Mr.
Kidney:</b> We have received an angry representation from the
BMA, saying that it would be totally unacceptable, under any
circumstances, for people&#146;s personal health details, on their
sexually transmitted infections or whatever, to be handed over by the
NHS 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column137" />Column number: 137</div>to some other organisation. Should no-go areas&#151;what should
definitely not be acceptable&#151;be specified in the
Bill?</div><a name="09020558000303"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Richard
Thomas:</b></i> I cannot think of absolute no-go areas. I
have not seen the BMA paper, but to say that under no circumstances
should information be shared seems a little extreme. Sometimes
information needs to be shared for research and statistical purposes.
There is a lot in our report about the need to ensure patient
anonymity, but sometimes you need to study what happened to patient A
in year one, and then go back to the same patient in years five and 10.
You do not need to know who the patient is, but you need to know that
it is the same patient. So, I do not think that you can say no sharing
under any circumstances, but the BMA is absolutely right to say that
you need much stronger safeguards for sensitive data, such as health
data. I do not quarrel with that. I just say that you cannot be black
and
white.</div><a name="09020558000304"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">David
Smith:</b></i> The area of health information is very
difficult, and we are often challenged on it. The simple approach,
which has a lot to justify it, is that our health information is
entirely private. We give that data to our doctor, and they must not be
shared more widely. There is a strong public policy argument in that.
If people think that their information will be made widely available,
they will stop going to the doctor and to hospital, and public health
will suffer. However, we already have provisions whereby doctors share
information when there are things such as notifiable diseases, because
the interest in protecting public health is wider than the
confidentiality of the
individual.</div><a name="09020558000305"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is never simple. I hesitate to go into the area of sexually transmitted
diseases in detail, because that is so sensitive, but the idea that
never under any circumstances should information about a sexually
transmitted disease be shared is perhaps wrong. But the grounds would
have to be extremely strong. Any sharing would have to be extremely
limited and the justification in public interest terms would have to be
high. As the commissioner said, perhaps the real test here is not
whether this supports a policy initiative but whether, weighing up the
pros and cons, it is in the public
interest.</div><a name="09020558000306"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
wonder whether it might help if I gave an example. This one goes back a
little way but shows at the other end of the spectrum what can be
prevented by the restrictions on information sharing. Older members of
the Committee may remember the European Union&#146;s butter mountain.
There was a proposal to distribute that butter mountain free to old age
pensioners. The people who were capable of doing the distribution were
in the local authorities. But they do not have any information on who
are the pensioners in their area. That was held by the Department of
Social Security, but it had no power under the legislative provisions
that it operated under to share information on pensioners with local
authorities, so that they could distribute the butter mountain. That
was a real problem. There are ways around some of these things. The DSS
could have written to individuals and told them to go along to their
local authority with proof of their age to collect their butter. These
things are not impossible, but it was a real hurdle. The legal
restrictions were clearly operating against the public interest and
against people getting free butter.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
335</b><b class="B"><a name="09020558000539"></a>Mr.
Kidney:</b> Thank you for that. Can I go back to another
point? You mentioned anonymised information which might be more
acceptable to be released. In fairness to the BMA, it is keen on
releasing information for research but such information is properly
anonymised. Would there be sufficient safeguards in the system that is
proposed in the Bill, however it gets amended and with the impact
assessment, your report to Parliament and so on, for anonymised sharing
of information to be more acceptable than sharing people&#146;s
personal
details?</div><a name="09020558000308"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Richard
Thomas:</b></i> I have always been an optimist in these
matters. When you have statutory requirements to go through certain
procedures, it puts pressure on those concerned to demonstrate that
they are meeting those requirements. As well as being an optimist I am
also a very strong advocate of transparency, which is often the best
regulator of all. So if we have an open process so that we can
scrutinise each scheme as it comes forward, that will serve the public
interest better than a rather bland blanket approval included in
sectoral statute, which then opens the door for anything to happen with
virtually no check or balance at a subsequent stage.</div>
<a name="09020558000309"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that I
am not sticking my neck out. In five years&#146; time, I may be
proved wrong on this. Having sat through seven months of evidence on
this and the sorts of examples that David mentions, and many others
besides, I think we need some sort of fast-track provision in precisely
defined circumstances to allow beneficial sharing. It is as much in the
public interest to allow beneficial sharing as it is to stop
undesirable sharing. You cannot generalise and say, &#147;All sharing
bad, all non-sharing good.&#148; You have to look at each situation
on its own merits and then make sure that it is properly
constrained.</div><a name="09020558000310"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
336</b><b class="B"><a name="09020558000540"></a>Mr.
Kidney:</b> In your report with Sir Mark Walport you
recommended a fast track for secondary legislation to repeal the bits
of primary legislation that get in the way. I heard you tell
Mr. Lucas that that is for the Ministers to defend now. You
would expect there to be limits to that power, would you not? You would
not think that the statutory instrument would remove the bits of the
Data Protection Act or the Human Rights Act that got in the
way.</div><a name="09020558000311"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Richard
Thomas:</b></i> That was certainly not in our contemplation.
We are clear, and we said somewhere in the report, that any
data-sharing arrangement would remain subject to human rights
legislation and to the full data protection legislation. It did not
cross our mind that this would be used to amend the Data
Protection
Act.</div><a name="09020558000312"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are crystal clear that the Act as whole, not least because of European
requirements, would still apply to a data-sharing arrangement. As to
whether that needs to be spelled out, I can see some advantage in
making it absolutely explicit that any data-sharing order should remain
subject to the Data Protection Act. In clause 152, there is
already proposed new section 50A(7), which
says:</div><a name="09020558000381"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Nothing
in this section (or any information-sharing order) is to be taken to
prejudice any power or duty to share information which exists apart
from this
section.&#148;</div><a name="09020558000313"></a><div class="hs_Para">So,
it is safeguarding previous data-sharing powers. That could easily be
complemented by an extra subsection spelling it out clearly that the
full application of the data protection requirements
remains.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
337</b><b class="B"><a name="09020558000541"></a>Jenny
Willott:</b> Going on from the point just raised by
Mr. Kidney&#151;an issue I also wanted to
raise&#151;about the impact on the Data Protection Act, given that
the only Act that is free from potential interference by these orders
is the Human Rights Act 1998, do you feel that there is an argument to
have in the Bill a longer list of legislation that could not be amended
by secondary
legislation?</div><a name="09020558000315"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Richard
Thomas:</b></i> Putting my lawyer&#146;s hat on, I think it
would be difficult to start putting a list together of Acts that could
not be amended because you would start dividing the statute book into
first-class and second-class statutes. I have not given serious thought
to the suggestion you are raising. Inasmuch as Parliament cannot bind
its successors, this would look back at Acts and say that that one
cannot be touched but that one could
be.</div><a name="09020558000316"></a><div class="hs_Para">Part
of the rationale for this approach is that situations will arise that
we cannot currently contemplate. As new schemes come forward,
technology changes, the shape of public services changes&#151;that is
when you need to overcome some of the obstacles and hurdles for
beneficial data sharing. By definition, you cannot here and now
anticipate what all those are going to
be.</div><a name="09020558000317"></a><div class="hs_Para">By
the same token, it is difficult to say that there are no Acts whatever
that should not be amendable by this process. As I said to
Mr. Kidney, I can see advantage in spelling out explicitly
that data protection and, if need be, the human rights legislation do
remain applicable. I think we saw it as so self-evident that it never
crossed our minds that it would not be the
case.</div><a name="09020558000318"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
338</b><b class="B"><a name="09020558000542"></a>Jenny
Willott:</b> It is a fundamental principle to change, to
introduce the concept that secondary legislation can amend primary
legislation.</div><a name="09020558000319"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Richard
Thomas:</b></i> There are plenty of examples in the
better-regulation area. I know it has been controversial, but it is not
without precedent. There have been a number of quite recent precedents.
It is unusual and we recognised that it would be
controversial.</div><a name="09020558000320"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
339</b><b class="B"><a name="09020558000543"></a>Jenny
Willott:</b> If this were on the statute book, you could use
that process to amend this legislation so that all the safeguards in
place to do with codes of practice could then be amended by secondary
legislation. Even the safeguards built into this would then not
necessarily
stand.</div><a name="09020558000321"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Richard
Thomas:</b></i> It may be that the provision that talks of
modifying any enactment&#151;proposed new section
50B(1)(h)&#151;needs to be limited in some way because, again, what
we had in mind were statutes with insufficient clarity, where the power
is not granted in the terms now
needed.</div><a name="09020558000322"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
would not rule out covering an explicit prohibition on sharing, but I
think it would be extremely unlikely that this measure would be
appropriate. For example, in the Taxes and Management Act 1970 there is
an explicit prohibition&#151;I think somebody mentioned it&#151;on
HMRC sharing tax information. I would completely oppose any attempt to
change that. HMRC would not want that change. We need to keep many of
these fundamental prohibitions in place. If it is thought that the
ability to modify any enactment is too wide, I would have no difficulty
in narrowing it down by clarifying the types of situation in which it
was appropriate to modify an 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column140" />Column number: 140</div>enactment. When we put forward the broad approach, we were looking at
the micro-stumbling blocks in legislation rather than at major
provisions.</div><a name="09020558000323"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
340</b><b class="B"><a name="09020558000544"></a>Jenny
Willott:</b> It was raised earlier that some data are held
back because they are very sensitive, such as health records. Given
that this is pretty much a blanket measure, which allows any person
access to any information that is held about anybody, and that no
restrictions are built into it, do you think that there is potential to
put data into tiers with some areas requiring more hurdles to be jumped
than
others?</div><a name="09020558000324"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
should be easy to overcome the hurdles for some data sharing because it
would not be seen as hugely controversial. An example would be sharing
information about who is over 65 so that they could access free butter.
The example that the Secretary of State for Justice has used is that
you do not want to have to tell the council tax office and the
electoral register when you move house. Sharing other information is
significantly more complex and without a huge amount of public
consultation it could cause a lot of upset. Do you think that there is
the potential to have a series of different tiers depending on the
sensitivity of the data and who it will be shared with, with different
methods for obtaining each
one?</div><a name="09020558000325"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Richard
Thomas:</b></i> There is already a distinction in European
and UK law between what might be called ordinary personal data and
sensitive personal data. Sensitive data include health information and
information about criminal activities, trade union membership and so
on. My hesitation is that data protection law is already complicated.
That complexity is a major problem in itself. Adding further layers of
complexity would run against the spirit of what we were trying to do,
which was to introduce greater
simplicity.</div><a name="09020558000326"></a><div class="hs_Para">Your
general points are valid. I do not favour more tiers or different
tiers, but I expect the privacy impact assessment to flush out any data
of particular sensitivity. I have no doubt that the Information
Commissioner&#146;s office will look closely at personal data of
particular
sensitivity.</div><a name="09020558000327"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
341</b><b class="B"><a name="09020558000545"></a>Jenny
Willott:</b> I would like to link that to the issue of policy
objectives. You have already talked about proposed new section
50A(4)(a) on sharing information to achieve a relevant policy
objective. The procedures laid down for the role of the Information
Commissioner&#146;s office state that you can comment only on whether
the data sharing is proportionate to the policy objective and on the
balance between the public interest and the interests of those
affected. The Bill does not seem to give you the ability to take
account of the right to privacy, public interest or the best interests
of the people involved. You will deal with the proportionate nature of
how the sharing achieves the policy objective rather than with the
policy objective itself. Do you feel that that is appropriate or will
it cramp what you are able to report on to the
Department?</div><a name="09020558000328"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Richard
Thomas:</b></i> This may be another example of the drafting
not mirroring our report closely enough. We said that the opinion from
the commissioner should state the compatibility of the proposed sharing
arrangement with data protection requirements. That is a wide approach
to all aspects of data protection requirements, which 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column141" />Column number: 141</div>would include reference to the right to privacy, the use limitation and
all the other aspects that we are familiar with. The wording of the
Bill is not exactly the same. Perhaps the parliamentary draftsman took
a slightly different
approach.</div><a name="09020558000329"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am not sure that an awful lot turns on this because I have no doubt
that in practice, in giving his opinion, the commissioner will examine
all aspects of the proposed data-sharing arrangement. It is our job to
look at schemes all the time and to say whether they are compatible
with data protection. In reality, these matters will be commented
on.</div><a name="09020558000330"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
342</b><b class="B"><a name="09020558000546"></a>Jenny
Willott:</b> I have a final question. You commented earlier on
the procedures and were saying that the measures that have gone through
so far have not been debated in Parliament and so on. Given that you
will not be able to amend the proposals and then Parliament will not be
able to amend the proposals either&#151;it is either all or nothing,
which is often quite a clever way to get something through that is 85
per cent. okay, 15 per cent. hideous&#151;do you feel that you have
enough power to tackle any shortcomings, or do you have concerns that
too many unpleasantnesses could sneak
through?</div><a name="09020558000331"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Richard
Thomas:</b></i> An awful lot will turn on the privacy impact
assessment. The statute will say that there is only 21 days for the
office to comment, which is not very long at all, but in practical
terms I would certainly expect any Department wishing to bring forward
a scheme to contact my office many months in advance, to keep us up to
speed as to what is envisaged, to consult us on how it will conduct the
privacy impact assessment, and to share it with us before bringing the
order at the formal stage for our comment. Unless that kind of contact
happens in practice, with many exchanges before the 21 days start to
run, I think that some of your concerns are
justified.</div><a name="09020558000332"></a><div class="hs_Para">You
said that it was all or nothing: well, I would expect many of the
nuances, the changes, the safeguards and the conditions to be built in
during that process of informal exchange. The formal opinion must state
whether it is fully compatible, not at all compatible or in-between.
The Department then has to consider whether it wishes to continue and
bring the matter to Parliament. You are right that at the moment
Parliament can only say yes or no, but there will have been a great
deal of transparency before we get to that stage. What I do not
know&#151;I am not an expert on parliamentary procedure&#151;is
whether this could be amended to allow an affirmative order to be
varied. I think that maybe that cannot happen&#151;I see many shaking
heads around the table, so I assume that it is not possible&#151;but
I think that in reality the Department would have to decide whether it
still wishes to go ahead if there was an adverse report from the
commissioner. It would then have to subject the matter to parliamentary
scrutiny on that
basis.</div><a name="09020558000333"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020558000547"></a>The
Chairman:</b> We have relatively little time left and a
certain amount to get through. So we need to concentrate some
minds.</div><a name="09020558000334"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
343</b><b class="B"><a name="09020558000548"></a>Mr.
Bellingham:</b> I have three quick questions relating to this
part&#151;two are actually more general. In the data protection
legislation it has always been the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column142" />Column number: 142</div>case that Government Departments are immune from prosecution. Is that
something we should be having a look at, particularly in light of the
view of many organisations? The current situation gives the Government
carte blanche to pile up more and more data on a need-to-know basis, or
on a just-in-case basis. I would have thought that that needs
changing.</div>
<a name="09020558000335"></a><div class="hs_Para">The other
point that to some extent relates to this is that new sections 55A to
55E of the Data Protection Act 1998, which were brought in with the
Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008, are still not in force. They
relate to your power to issue monetary penalties for deliberate and
reckless loss of data and, outside of an order, are a pretty vital tool
as far as you are concerned. What is you opinion on the first point,
and, secondly, what is actually happening on the second
point?</div><a name="09020558000336"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Richard
Thomas:</b></i> Could I ask David to respond on the second
point? On the first point, I would just say that, with a couple of
exceptions, the Data Protection Act is not criminal by nature. Such
powers as we have, and such powers as we will have, are of a civil or
administrative nature&#151;enforcement notices and the
like&#151;and they apply to a Government Departments as to anybody
else. For example, I have recently served enforcement notices on HMRC
and the Ministry of Defence in relation to the major security losses
that took place last year. We have secured an undertaking from the Home
Office in relation to a more recent incident that is one step short of
a full enforcement notice. There is no question of immunity for a
Government Department or anybody else. That really does reinforce what
I said earlier, and if I can just labour that point&#151;we need to
have these powers of inspection so that we can use our enforcement
powers against any data controller: public, private or voluntary. On
civil sanctions, perhaps David could update you as to where we
stand.</div>
<a name="09020558000337"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">David
Smith:</b></i> Both parts of the question run together in
some ways because, as the commissioner said, our primary sanction is
through those monetary penalties when they come into effect. At one
time, we argued strongly that we should have a criminal sanction for
serious breaches of the data protection principles. We were actually
persuaded that monetary penalties were more effective, and one of the
areas we were conscious of was Government Departments. That was because
the responsibility for complying with data protection law lies with the
organisation concerned, and not with individuals within the
organisation.</div>
<a name="09020558000338"></a><div class="hs_Para">The idea of
prosecuting the Ministry of Justice, and the Ministry of Justice ending
up with a criminal conviction&#151;what does that mean in practice?
There is also a difficulty with imposing a monetary penalty  on
a Ministry, because of the circularity of how the money flows. We
collect it as a monetary penalty, surrender it to the Treasury, and
maybe it ends up back there. However, someone has to explain all this
publicly, which is probably the biggest deterrent of all. We see
monetary penalties, particularly with public authorities, as being a
more effective deterrent than the criminal sanction.</div>
<a name="09020558000339"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are in
discussions with the Ministry of Justice about bringing these monetary
penalties into effect and would like that to happen as quickly as
possible. They  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column143" />Column number: 143</div>can only come into effect once guidance, produced by
our office, has been approved by the Secretary of State and is then
laid before Parliament in an order. The order also has to set the
maximum penalty that can be imposed.</div>
<a name="09020558000340"></a><div class="hs_Para">All I can
really say, Chairman, is that we are a long way forward on the drafting
of that guidance. We are on to, I think, version five. We would be
prepared for the legislation to be laid in a month or two, but I think
the Ministry&#146;s timetable is a little longer than that. I think
there is an element, in terms of the provisions we are talking about
here and funding for the office, of it all coming together in one
package. It is really up to the Ministry to answer this. However, I
think we are all talking about this year&#151;it is just a question
of when this year.</div>

344</b><b class="B"><a name="09020558000549"></a>Mr.
Bellingham:</b> Of course, it would have been far better if
this had been a free-standing Bill on data. I have one final question.
On notification fees, clause 154, is there an argument for exempting
MPs, for the simple reason that I am a data controller&#151;we are
all data controllers. It is fairly ridiculous when we do not want to be
data controllers, but we are made to be, and  we are made to
register and pay a fee. What is your view on that?</div>
<a name="09020558000342"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Richard
Thomas:</b></i> We have persuaded the Department that a flat
fee for all data controllers is wrong in principle. At the moment an
individual, whether a Member of Parliament or a sole trader, pays
&#163;35, as do Barclays bank, the Home Office, and large
conglomerates. That does not need primary legislation, although the
MOJ, I am pleased to say, is bringing forward proposals. The approach
will be tiered, so that a fairly small number of much larger
organisations will pay substantially more. Every other data controller
will remain at &#163;35.</div>
<a name="09020558000343"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think you
are trying to draw me into whether Members of Parliament should be
excluded from the Act altogether and I do not wish to go too far down
that road this afternoon. However, if you are  processing
personal data, you are generating the same sort of risks as any other
data controller. I would need some persuasion that there was a special
category for Members of Parliament. I may make myself unpopular by
saying that, but I look at it from the point of view of the risks to
the individual. Sometimes, very sensitive information is held by
Members of Parliament and people recognise there need to be stringent
safeguards to make sure that they are looked after in the same way as
all other reputable organisations.</div>

345</b><b class="B"><a name="09020558000550"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> I want to follow up on Mr
Bellingham&#146;s point about a discrete Bill. This  Bill is
219 pages long, and it deals with all sorts of things, very few of
which are to do with your responsibilities and data protection. Four
clauses, and schedule 18, touch upon you. Would we not better deal with
this subject if we did not construct Bills in this way, and if data
protection matters were dealt with in a data protection amendment Bill
or a separate data
Bill?</div><a name="09020558000345"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Richard
Thomas:</b></i> We are now used to being part of the Criminal
Justice and Immigration Act 2008 and the Coroners and Justice Bill
2009. We consider ourselves fortunate to get what we can get. We would
love to see a separate self-contained data protection Bill, but we live
in the real world. We have fought long and hard to get our powers
increased, and we are going in that direction. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column144" />Column number: 144</div>I think that there has been a sea change in public attitudes and in
political attitudes, and it is very welcome that Parliament is now
being invited to take our position far more seriously. We have been
marginalised for far too long. I do not mind too much whether data
protection is part of a larger Bill or is in a self-contained one. What
is really important is that we get stronger
powers.</div><a name="09020558000346"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
346</b><b class="B"><a name="09020558000551"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> I can see that, but the point is that the Bill
will be subject to timetabling. In Committee in the coming weeks there
will be knives and on Report there will a guillotine, and therefore
some of the issues that you want discussed might get timetabled out. I
want to ask you, if I may, to use your influence in your few remaining
months in office to persuade Departments not to do this to us because
it wrecks public confidence in the
legislation.</div><a name="09020558000347"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Richard
Thomas:</b></i> I understand your points. I have also worked
in public policy for many years, and I understand the constraints of
the parliamentary timetable. I understand also that part 8 has now been
accelerated before the Committee, so it might get fuller consideration
than otherwise might have been the case. I very much welcome
that.</div><a name="09020558000348"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
347</b><b class="B"><a name="09020558000552"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Justice (Bridget
Prentice):</b> Perhaps the Information Commissioner will
ponder my question and write to us with his response. On proposed new
section 50A(3)(b) to the Data Protection Act 1998, he said that he had
concerns about gathering information and then using it for a different
purpose. Mr. Smith used the good example of the butter
mountain. I think that it was probably the Department of Health and
Social Security at the time&#151;I do remember it, I am sad to
say&#151;that was not able directly to share the information with
local authorities. But if, for example, a local authority had
information on its electoral register that it could share with its
council tax register and vice versa, that would be, would it not, using
the data for a different purpose? Would that not be beneficial sharing?
We are running out of time, but perhaps you will come back to us with
where examples of beneficial sharing could be incorporated into that
part of the
Bill.</div><a name="09020558000349"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">David
Smith:</b></i> We will come back to you in detail, but I wish
to make two quick points. This is a slight technicality, but the
electoral registration officer is separate from the local authority and
that would therefore be the moving of data from one body to
another&#151;true information sharing. We can see that there might be
a case for use of information for another purpose in some
circumstances, but our concern is about how the Bill has been
constructed&#151;that information sharing, as defined, means not just
passing information from me to you, but that something you have given
me is used for a different purpose. If you have given me something to
provide you with a service and I then use it for marketing&#151;a
different purpose&#151;I have not shared it in the common parlance;
no one on the street would understand that as sharing. Sharing involves
movement from one organisation to
another.</div><a name="09020558000350"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our
concern is that we have to translate the legislation into common-sense
