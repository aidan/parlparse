<B>The Chairman:</B> Hon. Members may remove their jackets if they so wish.
<H4><center>Schedule 1</center></H4>
<H4><center>SUBSTITUTED PART I OF SCHEDULE 1 TO THE CHILD SUPPORT ACT 1991</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Eric Pickles </B>(Brentwood and Ongar): I beg to move amendment No. 119, in page 69, line 22 leave out from beginning to end of line 25 and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`Where the non-resident parent also has one or more relevant other children—
<P>
(a) the total number of children cared for shall be calculated in accordance with paragraph  (b)
<P>
(b) the number referred to in paragraph (a) shall be calculated by adding together the number of qualifying children and the number of relevant other children
<P>
(c) there shall be calculated in accordance with paragraph (d) a sum for deemed child care liabilities
<P>
(d) the amount referred to in paragraph (c) shall be calculated by application of the rates in paragraph 2(1) to the total number of children cared for
<P>
(e) the basic rate shall be deemed child care liability divided by the number of qualifying children.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following: amendment No. 103, in page 69, line 29, after `income', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`adjusted, where the non-resident parent also has one or more relevant other children, in accordance with paragraph 2(2) above'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Amendment No. 68, in page 69, line 35, leave out `£5' and insert `£3'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I apologise for removing my jacket without your permission, Mr. O'Brien. I note that the Minister of State is wearing a particularly snazzy waistcoat, which may distract you.
<P>
I suspect that, like me, hon. Members have spent part of the weekend reading the report of our deliberations in Hansard, and re-examining the White Paper and the Green Paper. On reading Hansard, I was struck by a point that is apposite to this amendment. Although any changes to the Child Support Agency should put the needs of children first, we seem to spend a lot of time considering the wealth, or non-wealth, of the parent with care and the non-resident parent. I want to draw the Committee's attention to a suggestion in the Green Paper, and there is no better way in which to do so than to quote the Prime Minister. In its foreword, the Prime Minister states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the system must support families and children'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and be
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Fair to children who will get the maintenance they have a right to expect, providing not just financial benefit for them but tangible proof that they are cared for.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Those last few words are key to the amendment, which would give full flight to the Prime Minister's pledge to establish a system that must support families and children.
<P>
The amendment would treat all children fairly, without discriminating against one category according to the families to which they happen to belong. That is not what the Government currently propose. In the Green Paper and the White Paper, two alternatives are offered. Page 10 of the White Paper states that those alternatives are
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``to deduct a proportion of the non-resident parent's net income for each of their children in a second family, and apply the standard rates to the balance'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
or
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``to calculate child support for all the non-resident parent's children (in both their families) and then share out the resulting amount according to the . . . children in each family.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is the second alternative that the amendment would implement.
<P>
The consultation process was straightforward and a number of responses were received. To their credit, the Government made it clear that opinion was divided. In paragraph 13 on page 11 of the White Paper, they state that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``On balance, we think that the new scheme should show a slight preference to the children in the first family''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is significant that they use the words ``on balance''. We shall expect the Minister to explain that in his response.
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Department of Social Security (Mr. Jeff Rooker):</B> The hon. Gentleman skated over paragraph 12 on page 11, which states that it was clear from the consultation that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Non-resident parents generally wanted a rule that would result in the minimum maintenance liability.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Amendment No. 119 is basically a men's groups amendment. I would be interested to hear what the hon. Members for Beckenham (Mrs. Lait) and for Bromsgrove (Miss Kirkbride) have to say about that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I am sorry that the right hon. Gentleman is taking such an aggressive line. The amendment reflects the Social Security Committee's preferred way of going about the calculation, and it is entirely wrong to characterise our view in such sexist terms. It is a children's amendment—it is about putting children first. We are not saying that there are two classes of children. If the right hon. Gentleman is so fond of paragraph 12, let us look at paragraph 15, in which the Government state:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``There will be no `first class' and `second class' children in the second family—those who count for child maintenance and those who do not.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is laudable. However, why refer to first-class and second-class children in the second class—in the second family? That was a Freudian slip. The effect of the calculations is neatly illustrated by the Select Committee report, which, on page xiii, gives two examples. It begins:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Example A:
<P>
Weekly take-home pay £200
(one child in first family, one child in second family)
Rate for two children 20 per cent
So £40 per week to be divided equally between children Liability for child in `first' family would be £20 a week.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is straightforward.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Leigh </B>(Gainsborough): To which page is my hon. Friend referring?
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> Page xvi. The report goes on to cite a second example, ``Example B''. The initial circumstances are identical:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Weekly take-home pay £200
ƒ‚(one child in first family, one child in second family)''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It continues:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Rate for child in `second' family 15 per cent of £200, so £30 a
ƒ‚week
ƒ‚Remaining pay £170
ƒ‚Rate for child in `first' family 15 per cent of £170
ƒ‚Liability for child in first' family would be £22.50 a week.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is not surprising that the Committee goes on to state:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``We welcome the White Paper proposal to treat step-children in a `second' family on the same basis as the non-resident parent's own children in the `second' family. We prefer the alternative approach set out in the Green Paper that maintenance liability should be split equally between all children''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is exactly what the amendment seeks to do.
<P>
The Committee received evidence from a variety of organisations, which it highlights. It is noticeable that that does not involve favouring fathers, as the Minister of State suggested. For example, Karen Randall stated that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``all children of all families should be treated equally as a moral principle.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Parliament should not take the view that there are two kinds of children, with one kind having a greater need than the other.
<P>
Karen Randall gives another reason. Most of the Government's arguments last week seemed to be based on administrative convenience, and I do not believe that administrative convenience is a good reason for making changes, if that puts into the balance justice between the various families. She says on page 131:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``We also think that the original proposal the Government made was more transparent. If you have two children in one family, the first family, you will pay 20 per cent. of your net income and if you have one in the first and one in the second then it seems logical to us that you split that 20 per cent. and have ten in each. What the Government has gone for in that situation is you would pay 12.75. It is not quite as transparent for people to work out for themselves.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There is some logic in that.
<P>
I do not want to overstate the case. We are talking about a marginal advantage. This provision will not create enormous unfairness, but it will create unfairness. We must recognise that children are often the casualties of a marriage or relationship break-up and should not be treated differently from their siblings. We live in different times and relationships break up. A child of a first family in one relationship could be the child of a second relationship in another. I could not put the case better than Natalie Cronin of The Children's Society, who is quoted with approval by the Select Committee in paragraph 29 on page xvii. She said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the prevailing policy should be equality between the children.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment should not be controversial or a matter of great debate in the Committee. We might be open to persuasion if the Minister of State could tell us why the Government feel that children of the first marriage should be on a more equal footing than children of the second. We accept that it is a marginal point in terms of resources, but it creates inequality.
<P>
We recognise that various parties have made submissions, but the run of the evidence, which seemed to persuade the Select Committee, suggests a move to the second system. I cannot believe that the Government thought that this proposal was wholly unreasonable. If they did, they would not have put it in the Green Paper. No Government in the process of producing a Green Paper would say, ``Let's find something ridiculous and wholly unrealistic. Let's find something to show that fathers will be better off. Let's put in a system so bad that everyone will plump for the other one.'' That is a highly cynical view, and I do not believe that the Minister would admit to such plans. What they have is a perfectly fair and workable system.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Government should give us an explanation. The Minister's earlier intervention was so astounding because he said that it was not a question of one option being absolutely right and a second absolutely wrong—it was a question of balance. He seemed to suggest that the Government had to make a decision some time, and that this was their decision. They need to tell us more to obtain our support. They need to explain why they have chosen this path.
<P>
When we embark on a reform in which we hope the public will have confidence, it must be clearly understood why we are proposing the changes. The Government must make that clear now. If they cannot persuade us, we shall force the amendment to a vote, and the consensus that has pertained thus far in Committee will be shattered. We want a reasoned argument from the Government.

<P>

<B>Mr. Desmond Swayne </B>(New Forest, West): I disagree with my hon. Friend's view that this may be a marginal matter. It is an important matter, worthy of great debate.
<P>
I hope that those members of the Select Committee who made the recommendations to which my hon. Friend referred—that there should be equal treatment between the families—will be able to enlighten us as to why they took that view, and why they might now take a different one. I draw the Committee's attention to my own intellectual journey regarding this matter. I was on the opposite side of that argument. I differed from the majority of the Select Committee who believed that there should be equal treatment. I refer hon. Members to page xlii of the proceedings of the Committee of 20 October. The Committee had made the following statement:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``We prefer the alternative approach set out in the Green Paper that maintenance liability should be split equally between all children.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I tabled an amendment to strike out that statement, which received the support of a number of hon. Members.<P>

<P>
I took a normative position on the matter. A number of my constituents had visited my advice sessions, and their attitude had irritated me greatly. They had made such comments as, ``Mr. Swayne, I realise that I have to pay something, but this is ridiculous. Don't they realise that I have another family now?'' I felt that it was appropriate that the White Paper, and now the Bill, should contain the powerful message to such people that it is proper to consider additional financial responsibilities, as any family must. Indeed, those are the sentiments expressed by Baroness Hollis in answer to a question that I put to her.
<P>
Every family must consider the consequences of its actions. Why should a father who leaves one family and decides to take on another be free of that consideration? It is entirely proper that he should be made to consider the cost of an additional family, which must, of course, be tempered with the consequences for the second family. My initial impression was that the White Paper and the Bill had got that balance right, because, as the White Paper states, there is a mild preference for the first family.
<P>
We took evidence from the Family Policy Studies Centre, which said that the White Paper had not gone far enough and that the preference shown for the first family was insufficient. The centre suggested that the arrangements for the second family were already too generous, and that the family in danger of poverty was always the first, rather than the second family with which the father was resident and where the economic conditions tended to be better. The evidence that we received was that the preference in the White Paper was not sufficiently strong.
<P>
How have I moved from supporting the preference in the White Paper to putting my name to an amendment stating that there should be no such preference? It was a consequence of re-reading the evidence that others gave. We received evidence from a number of witnesses who pooh-poohed the notion that any sort of normative message in the legislation would have any impact whatever. We were told that it was unrealistic to consider a conventional model in which a father leaves one family and sets up a stable relationship with another. It was suggested to us that the norm was much more casual in that fathers acquired and released responsibility for any number of children in any number of relationships over a period. Replies to my questions suggested that any requirement we might impose and any powerful message we might put in the Bill would have no effect because they would not be of any concern to fathers when they made decisions governing their lives and determined which family they stayed with and which they abandoned. One is thrown back to consideration of the consequences for the families involved.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> Does my hon. Friend recall that, according to the evidence given, the Government's method of going about this could, in some circumstances, work in the opposite way to that intended and could favour the second family? Our amendment would introduce transparency and consistency.
<P>
<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> That is, indeed, the merit of the amendment. It would also introduce greater simplicity, which is one of the fundamental objectives of the Bill. My hon. Friend is right in suggesting that some witnesses believed that the first family had the disadvantage, and some believed that it was the second family. The evidence was mixed, but the most powerful view was that any strong message we wanted to put in the Bill would be of little effect, and that we would be better to concentrate on what we could achieve—fairness for the children involved. That is why I put my name to the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Desmond Browne </B>(Kilmarnock and Loudoun): I listened with interest to the explanation of the hon. Member for New Forest, West (Mr. Swayne) for changing his mind so significantly since his strong contribution to the deliberations of the Select Committee. I also listened with interest to the contribution of his hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. Pickles). This important matter is a legitimate issue for debate in the Committee. I believe that the first family should have preference, but I am more interested in the working of the amendment. Under paragraph (e), if there were one qualifying child, 100 per cent. of the basic rate would go to that family with nothing for the second family. I may be wrong, but my understanding of arithmetic, which was taught to me in Scottish schools, is that if one is divided by one, the result is 100 per cent.
<P>
I have every sympathy with the Opposition and others who want to discuss the matter in the Committee, but the amendment contains a fundamental flaw and would not achieve the objectives set out by Families Need Fathers or in the Select Committee report. It would not work, and perhaps the hon. Gentleman can explain it to me by giving a specific example of someone earning £200 a week with one child in the qualifying family.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I must insist that interventions are brief.
<P>
<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> I shall disappoint the hon. Gentleman—
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I take responsibility for the drafting of the amendment, and I do not believe that it would do as the hon. Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun (Mr. Browne) suggests. We have been straightforward and stated that we have tabled probing amendments. If the Minister believes that the amendment is defective but accepts the principle, we would withdraw the amendment. We want to be reasonable. I do not believe that the hon. Gentleman is right, but if he is, I shall be the first to put my hand up.
<P>
<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> The point that I would make to the hon. Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun is that I share his preference for the first family, but my estimate is that putting that preference in the Bill would not achieve the objective that I seek. Rather, it would lead to another species of complaint about unfairness. The Bill will not achieve what I believed would have been a desirable objective—that is, to give a powerful message to people carefully to consider their actions before taking on the responsibilities of a second family. My sad estimate is that it would not have the effect that I desire, so it is better to aim for simplicity and fairness for the children so as to reduce complaints and representations against the Bill.
<P>
My intellectual journey has been rather sad, and it would have been preferable if the Bill had sent a powerful, normative message, but I doubt that it could do that and it is better to aim for fairness.
<P>
<B>Mr. Browne:</B> I want to make a short contribution to build on my intervention. I have considerable sympathy with the Opposition on the detail of the Bill. They keep saying that they support the principle of the Bill and the aim of simplicity, but they are constantly trying to make it more complex as they try to exercise their interest and that of others who have contributed to the considerable debate on the Bill during the consultation process and the deliberations of the Select Committee. The Opposition must separate the principle from the difficulties of complexity. They must decide either that they want complex legislation and regulations, such as we have now, that can be used to reflect almost every set of circumstances, or that they accept that, if there is to be a simple and transparent system of calculating maintenance, there must be an element of rough justice. There will be winners and losers, and the Bill must provide a broad balance.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
This is an interesting issue, which should exercise the Committee. We must look at the whole Bill and at all the Government's proposals to ensure that there is a balance across the board. However, the basis from which at least Labour Members start is that, on balance, there should be a preference in favour of the first family. That is reflected in the fact that we want to strip out of the system reductions from income for housing, travel-to-work and other costs. That principle of preference towards the first family must, in this difficult area, cause the balance to be reflected in favour of the first family.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> The hon. Gentleman says that he has a preference for the children of the first family. I should be grateful if he could explain why.
<P>
<B>Mr. Browne:</B> I am obliged to the hon. Gentleman for that question. Perhaps I should have dwelt more on that point.
<P>
The primary responsibilities accepted by the natural parents are for their first children and first family, although I do not argue that the responsibilities that they assume for stepchildren and later natural children in other families are not important. If the system that we create is to reflect the proper sense of responsibility that parents should have towards their children, the Bill should give that message, in a marginal rather than a dramatic way. The Schedule does that.
<P>
Perhaps I may dwell for a moment on a matter on which I spent too long when I intervened in the speech of the hon. Member for New Forest, West to try to get an explanation of whether amendment No. 119 achieves its objective. With your indulgence, Mr. O'Brien, and the Committee's, I shall work through what I think the effect of the amendment would be.
<P>
The amendment seeks to calculate the total number of children cared for by a simple aggregation of the number of qualifying children—the children of the first family—and the number of relevant other children—the children of the second or subsequent families. If my arithmetic is correct, if there is one qualifying child—one child for whom the non-resident parent has responsibility—and two relevant other children resident with that parent, there are three children altogether. The amendment fixes the deemed child care liabilities by reference to the Government's own proposals of 15, 20 and 30 per cent. Therefore paragraph (c) would make the total deemed child care liability 30 per cent. of the net income. [Interruption.] I am sorry. It should be 25 per cent. It was my memory that was wrong, not my maths. Therefore, if there are three children, that is 25 per cent. Paragraph (d) says that the amount in paragraph (c) is to be calculated by reference to those rates. Paragraph (e) says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the basic rate shall be deemed child care liability''—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
that is 25 per cent.—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``divided by the number of qualifying children.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>as there is one qualifying child, it will be 25 per cent. Therefore, the total amount of the deemed child care liability will be the basic rate.

<P>

<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> None of us is following what the hon. Gentleman is saying.
<P>
<B>Mr. Browne:</B> With respect, it is the Opposition's amendment. If it can be explained in simple arithmetic, I will be able to understand it, but that does not seem to be the Opposition's objective.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Jacqui Lait </B>(Beckenham): This will be slightly embarrassing, because the first thing I want to do is to apologise to the Under-Secretary for our discussion last week about the 15, 20 and 25 per cent. and the upper earnings limit. She assured me that a person's minimum income would have to be £200,000, and I took issue with her. I apologise. Her figures were of course correct. I feel a bit like the hon. Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun: it was a failure of memory rather than of maths. I had used 25 per cent. instead of 15 per cent. However, the figure still goes up to £300,000 at the top rate.
<P>
However, I am now even more confused than I was before. I am sure that again it is a failure of my understanding rather than the hon. Gentleman's maths. One of our main motivations which I hope Labour Members have accepted from the beginning, is to ensure that the children come first. The amendment would ensure that all the children being looked after by the person paying for care have equal treatment.
<P>
My understanding of the Bill—I am now so confused that I am prepared to accept that my understanding is wrong—is that the children of the first family being paid for by the parent without care will get less than the children of the second family, because the net income for the maintenance of the first family will be calculated after the costs of children of the second family have been taken out.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Social Security (Angela Eagle) indicated assent.</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I am glad that I understand it correctly. [Interruption.] Now the Under-Secretary is having a second thought. I am happy to be corrected on this, but that is my understanding. I think that that is correct if there is one child in each family. If there is more than one child in a family, a larger gross sum will be paid to the family. If there is one child in each of the two families, under the Bill, as I understand it, the child of the first family will get less than the child of the second family.
<P>
<B>Kali Mountford (Colne Valley):</B> The one thing that seems to be missing from that calculation is the fact that subsequent children who are living with the absent parent are sharing in the living conditions of that parent, and the other children are not. In this arithmetical way of looking at things, there is no way of recognising that the parent with shared care—in this instance the subsequent family—is sharing in the living conditions of that parent. How can the calculation achieve that?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> The hon. Lady and I are not a million miles apart. If we decide to press the amendment to a vote, even though my hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar has said that it is a probing amendment, I hope that she will support us. The principle behind our amendment is that the child of the first family would receive the same notional sum as the child of the second family. If the Government were to accept the amendment, we should be happy for them to redraft it so that it achieves what we wish it to achieve. Under the Bill the child of the first family would get less so would be punished if the parent without care left the family. I am sure that many people who care for children would argue that children of the first family deserve at least the same in terms of income, because they have lost the presence of the parent who has left the family. The least that we could do for those children is to give them access to the same sum of money, given that they cannot have access to the care and attention that the parent would be giving had he not left.
<P>
<B>Mr. Browne:</B> I am genuinely interested in the debate, and should like to ask a question before Opposition Members conclude their remarks. How does this logic take into account the Family Policy Studies Centre's legitimate criticism that the children of the second family may be enjoying maintenance from another source? How does one balance that rough justice, which is clearly articulated in the Select Committee's report, if not in the way that the Government seek to do so?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> The hon. Gentleman should, like the hon. Member for Colne Valley (Kali Mountford), consider voting with us. His argument is the same as ours—that is, that the child who has lost the parent should at least have equal income to the notional income that the family with the parent has, or is deemed to have.
<P>
The Government have said that they are trying, through the Bill, to make the whole matter simple. However, the minute anything is made simple, one gets winners and losers. That is what the amendments that we have tabled are trying to tease out. Who are the winners? Who are the losers? Who will suffer rough justice? Who are we going to have tramping through our surgery doors complaining? As a result of the Bill, children and the parent with care of the first family will complain that they are not receiving equal money and that they have lost the attention of the parent without care.
<P>
I am happy to accept that circumstances will arise in which, because of the number of children in the families, the amount of money that goes to one family will be greater than the amount that goes to the second family—or to any other family that may be involved. The examples are all constructed on the basis of two families. However, as we know, life is considerably more complex than that. My early constituency work involved people with three or four families. Trying to work out such cases would be a nightmare for anybody.
<P>
We are trying to establish the principle that every child should have an equal amount of money available as part of the parent without care's responsibility. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for New Forest, West that, although the evidence points to the fact that people do not take such considerations into account, I sincerely wish that they would do so before starting to produce yet more children. The income of any person, however rich or poor, is affected by the number of children for whom they are responsible.
<P>
The underlying moral message is that children are the responsibility of both parents. Under the Bill, the children of first families, or of second families that have parents who have left, will be badly penalised. That is why we tabled an amendment that would ensure that all children have equal sums of money available to them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> The debate has involved a lot of maths. However, it is a question not of maths, but of a simple moral argument. I would start from the point of view that if one has children, as part of a family, and the relationship ends, one must—even if the end of the relationship is not one's fault—think carefully about starting a second family. If one looks at the matter in those simple moral terms, one may conclude that the Government would be right in thinking that children of first families should be advantaged in comparison with children of second families.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
However, the Government do not take that view. On this issue, as on every other issue, they say that in a modern society we must recognise that people want to live their lives in many different ways, and we should respect their wishes. The Government are not prepared to take an old-fashioned moral view; they believe that all lifestyles should be respected. To be fair to fathers, relationships often end through no wish of their own. Are they henceforth to be prevented from having children in a happy, stable second relationship, merely because their first relationship went wrong? If that is the Government's attitude, I cannot understand why. They are not prepared to take a moral point of view, yet earlier in the debate the Minister told my hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar—somewhat aggressively—that he was presenting the father's agenda. My hon. Friend was merely explaining that amendment No. 119 is a probing amendment.
<P>
This is a difficult issue to resolve. The Select Committee narrowly came down on one side of the argument. The Children's Society firmly believes that all children should be treated equally. Given that the Government are not prepared to set any moral norms for society, that is presumably their view as well. Yet if they believe that, why have they come down on the other side of the fence in resisting the amendment? It would be helpful if the Minister were to explain exactly what his views are, as I can see no logical reason why the Children's Society's view that all children should be treated equally should be resisted.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I do not intend to nit-pick in relation to amendment No. 119, because it is a vehicle to facilitate debate. There is one aspect of the amendment that I do not understand. [Interruption.] I do not. However, that is not the issue.
<P>
It is interesting that no Opposition Member has referred to amendments Nos. 103 and 68, which are grouped with amendment No. 119. I shall address the bulk of my remarks to amendment No. 119, and refer to the others in passing, subject to the wishes of members of the Committee.
<P>
I shall inevitably have to give some arithmetical examples, for which I apologise, Mr. O'Brien. I am contemplating making a request at a later stage of the Committee's proceedings. Although I know that it will be turned down, I want to put it on the record. When we debate the pensions aspect of the Bill, it will be convenient for members of the Committee to have charts before them for explanatory purposes. However, it would be better still if we could have an overhead projector in the Room. I intend formally to make that request so that it can be formally turned down, thereby demonstrating that the archaic procedures of the House do not allow the use of modern technology for the purposes of explanation. Because I know that I will be turned down, I intend to provide members of the Committee with the graphs and charts to which I referred. I have no idea, however, how they will be incorporated into Hansard.

<P>

<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> In a modern court room, where complicated issues are dealt with, each member of the court has a computer screen in front of him on which figures, charts and arguments can be immediately flashed up. I do not know why the House always rejects such modern ideas.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I hope that hon. Members are not about to embark on a discussion about changes to the procedures of the House. They should stick to the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> To explain the amendment and why the Government will ask the Committee to reject it, it is necessary to give some examples. It is not always possible verbally to make the argument clear, but I shall do my best.
<P>
I make no apology for referring to amendment No. 119 as the men's groups amendment. I did not do so in an aggressive fashion. I said that I would be interested in the views of the hon. Ladies on the Opposition Benches, but the hon. Member for Bromsgrove was out of the Room at the time. The net effect of the amendment would be that the non-resident parent would pay less maintenance. One has to compare the measure in the Bill with attempts to change that.
<P>
While the deliberations of the Select Committee are interesting, the Government do not accept them all. The Green Paper put forward options, but I do not know the nature of the background discussions to its formulation. However, I must say to the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar that it would not be the first time that the Government have proposed a couple of options in a consultation paper, one of which they did not really want, only to discover overwhelming support for that option, and to have to go down that road. That is not to say that the proposal is not put there for proper debate. It was wholly legitimate to put forward those two forms of calculation and to ask for opinions, because each would have a different effect.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> If the Government's intention was to put forward a no-hope proposal that they had no intention of adopting, in order to bolster their position on their preferred alternative, were they shocked to find opinion equally divided?
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> No. I was not referring to this measure. I do not know the background to this case, but I know that in the past several options have been proposed, because it was thought wrong to put forward only one option for debate. There are differences of opinion, sometimes even between Departments, although that is not so in this case. It is legitimate to have set out two forms of the calculation. Paragraph 13 of the White Paper makes it clear that we believe that, on balance, the new scheme should give a slight preference to children in the first family.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> Why?
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> Because the responsibility of the absent parent to the first family should come first. It is as simple as that. This is no fancy intellectual or moral argument. The responsibility to that family comes first.
<P>
I shall give the Committee some examples. The point made by the hon. Member for Beckenham about notional figures was quite right, and I shall give an example to highlight that point. People who misread future calculations might think that they have grounds for complaint, but that would not be justified. The money goes to the children according to the net income of the absent parent. That is the final arbiter. Nevertheless, the point that she raised deserves an answer, and I shall try to give one. I shall stick to my notes so that I do not get tongue-tied when giving the examples, because it is important to put some of them on record.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> Before we get into the details of the examples, I want to be clear on the thinking behind this provision. Why should preference be shown to the children of the first family? Why should those children be advantaged? Is it because the Government take the moralistic view that people should not start second families?
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> One can look at the issue the other way round. Stepchildren will be taken into account in the calculations for this purpose, whereas they would not be normally. We are proposing a different set of rules. We are reforming the way in which the Child Support Agency makes its calculations, but we should not necessarily be driven by the status quo. We understand that we shall have to live with two systems for a while.
<P>
We are proposing a different culture of calculation. Housing costs will be wiped out completely, for example. There will be complete earnings disregard in respect of one of the parents. It is, therefore, unhelpful to consider the proposed system at the same time as the one that we shall eventually remove. I make it clear to the hon. Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh) that there is a slight preference towards children in the first family, because that responsibility comes first. That is the way in which the calculation has been made.
<P>
I shall illustrate the point made by the hon. Member for Beckenham about notional payments. They could be construed the other way by parents who want to misunderstand the calculation in order to feel aggrieved. There would be no justification for that, but there is no clear-cut answer to this question. The decision was taken, on balance, between two forms of calculation, both of which are legitimate ways of calculating the responsibilities of the non-resident parent.
<P>
<B>Kali Mountford:</B> When arriving at this decision, on balance, what view did my right hon. Friend take of the position of second, or subsequent, families who have the advantage of sharing in their father's—or parent's—wealth and having the general well-being of that parent living in the home?
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> A variety of issues would be taken into account in arriving at this decision, some of which cannot be quantified. One cannot quantify family relationships or the way in which children are treated. The money is not necessarily the be-all and end-all, but it is the only aspect that we, as lawmakers, can influence. Money cannot create love, nor does it necessarily follow care, willingness or access, but it is the only factor over which legislators can exercise control. All other aspects of the issue are important but unquantifiable. I do not think that we should debate that, because I am not in a position to answer such questions.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I want to pursue the point a little further. I have great sympathy with what the Minister is saying. He said that the decision was made ``on balance''. If he does not accept the amendment, and if, after some practical experience of the new measure, it is found that, on balance, the system is not working, will he undertake to look again at the issue and revisit the whole debate?
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> It would be bull-headed and ridiculous to say that the Government would never assess the performance of their legislation. One of the great failings of our present lawmaking system is that we have no regular review of the legislation passed by the House, to see whether it performs as we intended. We are, in some ways, in that situation now, because of the background to the setting up of the Child Support Agency. We do not have a systematic review of legislation in this country, unlike some other European Union member states. However, that does not mean that the effects of legislation are not reviewed. They are reviewed constantly in surgeries held by Members of Parliament, in parliamentary questions and in debates in the House.
<P>
Our proposals in the Bill—which, one assumes, will become an Act—are not the be-all and end-all. They will introduce a system that we shall try to make work in the interests of 1 million children. Many months' work and a great deal of planning remain to be done; new computer systems need to be installed, and there are thousands of people involved, as the hon. Lady accepts, in trying to get this right. We have to try to get it right, and if we do not succeed, we shall have to look at the matter again. I cannot say more than that, but it would be churlish to say that we will never look at the results of our legislation.
<P>
The purpose of the amendment is to provide for the non-resident parent's liability to children in his first family to be a proportionate share of his liability for all the children in his first and second families. For example, if there were a liability for one child, with another child in a second family, maintenance would be assessed as 20 per cent. of net income, with half of that—that is, 10 per cent.—being paid to the parent with care. I shall cite as an example a non-resident parent with a net income of £250 with one child in the first family and one child in the new second family. Under the method proposed, there would be a 15 per cent. deduction from net income— £250—for the child in the second family. That is a notional deduction of £37.50, leaving £212.50.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The maintenance liability for the first family—the family of the child whom we want to receive the money—would be 15 per cent. of £212.50, which is £32. Under the Bill, the family of that child would receive £32. Under the amendment, the total liability for both children would be 20 per cent. Twenty per cent. of £250 is £50, so the maintenance liability would be half that sum, which is £25. The amendment would thereby reduce by £7 the amount that we are trying to give to the first child.
<P>
I am not saying that either calculation is not legitimate. Clearly, the notional sum of 15 per cent. of £250 is more than 15 per cent. of £212.50. The amount of £37.50 is notional not in the sense that it is a payment to the child in the second family, but because it is the income retained as part of family expenditure. The point that the hon. Member for Beckenham made is legitimate—[Interruption.] It is a deduction so that a calculation can be made for the other child.
<P>
The net effect of the Bill will be to give £32 to the child with whom we are concerned at the moment. The amendment would give that child £25. That is the bottom line. As I have said, a slight preference is given to the child of the first family because, although there are responsibilities to the second family, those to the first family should come first. That central difference between the amendment and the Bill highlights the two options under point 11 in the White Paper.

<P>

<B>Miss Julie Kirkbride </B>(Bromsgrove): It has been helpful to hear the Minister. I am pleased that my hon. Friends on the Front Bench regard the amendment as a probing one, because, in my view, the children of the first family should be given priority. According to the Minister's calculations, however, more money will be set aside for the children of the second family. That comes as something of a surprise, although it may be that I am not very good at adding up.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> It may come as a surprise, but because one is removing, by retention, the effects of the children in order to make the calculation, one starts off with a large sum, which is the total net income. In removing a percentage from that sum to arrive at a smaller sum that will provide the child in question with a percentage of the relevant amount, the first sum will, by definition, be greater than the second. However, that sum does not constitute a payment. The two figures of which we must take account are £32, which is in the Bill, and £25, which is in the amendment.
<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> Why cannot the first family get £37.50, leaving the second family to share in the income?
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> Would the hon. Lady ask that question again?
<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> I thought that the Minister said that the second family will get the first 15 per cent., which is £37.50, whereas the first family will get 15 per cent. of £212.50, which is a smaller amount than the notional amount that is being retained by the first family. It seems rather unfair that the first family should have more.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> The hon. Lady is right: it can look unfair if one compares notional sums with real money that is transferred from the parent without care to the parent with care. The residual amount maintained in the family is purely notional; it is the income of the parent in the second family who has responsibility to a child in the first family. That is the inevitability of the calculation. That is not playing the two children off against one another. As I have said, the bottom line is that the money will go to the child—
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> No.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> Yes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> It is not going to the child.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> The money in respect of the child will go to the parent with care. We should be looking at the fact that that amount will be £32 under the Bill, but £25 under the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> What the right hon. Gentleman has said is very interesting. I apologise to you, Mr. O'Brien, for the sedentary interventions.
<P>
Is the right hon. Gentleman saying that, when we cut through all the flannel, it is the bottom line that matters, and that the Government prefer this method of calculation to the other because it gives a larger figure? It is a legitimate view; I just wanted to clarify it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> We made it clear in the White Paper that, on balance, the method of calculation should show a slight preference to children in the first family. Indeed, it is clear from what the hon. Member for Bromsgrove just said that there is some cross-party support for this slight preference, which depends heavily on the number of children in the first and second families. Some perverse results could arise if there were more children in the second family than in the first. The figures of £32 and £25 would vary greatly according to the number of children in the families.
<P>
I could give other examples, but concentrating on the instance of one child in each family makes it fairly clear and easy to understand, because it is the method of calculation that we are debating.
<P>
We floated the alternative method in the Green Paper. Reaction to it was split very much on the basis of gender, with lone parent groups—generally speaking, mothers—favouring the approach in the Bill. It is true that men's groups favoured the more equal treatment proposed in the amendment, mainly because it required less maintenance. Indeed, the refrain that I have heard time and again over the past three years has been, as the hon. Member for New Forest, West said, ``I know I've got to pay some maintenance, but how can I pay less?'' That is the general thrust. We do not want people to be treated unfairly, but we think that it is right and proper to tip the balance in such a way, which has majority support from the parents with care for the children about whom we are concerned.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> The Minister has already referred to our difficulty as a non-high-tech Parliament. Could he provide us with calculations for more complex families—for instance, for more than two families? I do not want them immediately, but it would be helpful if he let the Committee have them in due course.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> We are bending over backwards, as we shall continue to do, to provide hon. Members with maximum information. I shall be careful not to flood them with too much before we come to other parts of the Bill. At the back of the White Paper, there are copious tables and calculations of various family compositions, running to several pages. If we can provide more examples to explain the calculations, like the one that I have just given, I shall be happy to do that.
<P>
There is a quid pro quo to be considered—we must think about it in making child support changes. Going through the Bill line by line and clause by clause sounds good, but it is not a very efficient way of conducting our proceedings in this instance because it makes us treat each bit in isolation. However, we propose a package of reforms, in which some parts are dependent on, or a quid pro quo for, other parts. Given the slight preference to the first family in the calculation chosen, which provides for the parent who must pay the money, and those who will receive it, a simple, easy-to-understand calculation, the quid pro quo is that allowance will be made in the new system for all children living with the non-resident parent, including stepchildren, and that any maintenance that the non-resident parent or his partner may receive for their children will be ignored.
<P>
The amendment would reduce the amount of maintenance going to children in the first family, in some cases significantly. It is only right that non-resident parents should be expected to make a meaningful contribution towards the care of the first family. They cannot walk away and say, ``That was my first family. They don't count any more.'' Some men have said to my face, just as they have to other hon. Members, ``My clean break means that I don't want to know about any of them—her, the kids, the lot.'' We are trying to change attitudes, to bring about a cultural change.
<P>
I do not want anybody to feel deprived, so I shall make a few remarks about amendments Nos. 103 and 68, which I hope will be acceptable to Conservative Members. Amendment No. 103 has an impact on the treatment of second families. It seeks to change the way in which child support liability is calculated in cases where a non-resident parent's net weekly income falls below £200. That is a significant sum. Whenever we quote 15, 20 and 25 per cent., we are referring only to those with a net income of over £200 a week. For the majority, whose net income is between £100 and £200, those simple percentages will not apply. That is why it is necessary to look at the tables at the back of the White Paper.
<P>
I admit that I have had some difficulty in following the figures in the tables and trying to reproduce in graph form the examples in my notes. I think that amendment No. 103 attempts to address the difference between £100 and £200. Where the calculation for the net income is reduced below £200 as a result of the adjustments made for the children in the second family, the amendment would provide for the non-resident parent's liability to be calculated at the reduced rate. That would reduce the non-resident parent's liability, which is another way of paying less. That contrasts with our method, which provides for liability to be calculated at the basic rate in all cases where the non-resident parent's net weekly income is more than £200. That would produce consistency.
<P>
We recognise the concern that non-resident parents who have children with them in a second family should not suffer. Our proposals ensure support for all children, while leaving most of the non-resident parent's income with the second family—a point not mentioned in the debate.
<P>
Amendment No. 68 would reduce the flat rate liability for non-resident parents with an income below £100 from £5 to £3. Simple percentage calculations are not relevant to parents with very small incomes of £100 a week or less, or those in receipt of social security benefits. Under the current scheme, non-resident parents in receipt of social security benefits are asked to pay £5.20—that will rise to £5.35 in April—so they will be marginally better off under the new scheme. All fathers, whether on benefits or with earnings, have a responsibility for their children's upkeep, and that is why current exemptions will be removed.
<P>
The issue is important and the Opposition were right to table an amendment to allow us to discuss the choice between the two forms of calculation. We do not apologise for the direction that we have taken, but I accept that it does not meet all the wishes of the Select Committee. Select Committees perform a valuable function in advising the House, but the Government are under no obligation to accept amendments. However, if we deviate from the recommendations of a Select Committee, we are under an obligation to explain why. I hope that I have done so this morning, albeit inadequately, and I hope that the Committee will reject the amendment.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I do not think that the Minister has been inadequate. He has been forthright and straightforward, for which we thank him. The good news is that his argument on amendment No. 103 has wholly convinced me. We tabled amendment No. 68 to obtain the Government's opinion on the size of the amount and amendment No. 119 was tabled to obtain the Government's opinion on the calculations. My mind goes back to my youth when I understood mathematics at a basic level, and it would have assisted me if I had learnt the phrase, ``It was a failure of memory rather than my maths.'' I shall use it a lot in future.
<P>
The amendment is important, and the Government have not entirely convinced hon. Members. It is a probing amendment to obtain greater understanding of the Government's views. My hon. Friend the Member for New Forest, West takes a moral view, which is legitimate. Initially, the Minister took a moral view, but it turns out that he has made a bottom line calculation and that this is the best system available because, by and large, it provides a greater sum of money by way of maintenance.
<P>
I do not accept the moral argument that people who move on to a second relationship should think long and hard about whether to have children in that relationship for the obvious reason that many enter other relationships in which children already exist. That is why the White Paper is so clear about stepchildren and states so unequivocally:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``There will be no `first class' and `second class' children in the second family''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is why the Government said that the provision should not be examined in isolation and that, although it may seem harsh, they are making other commitments on the definition of a child within the calculations, and stepchildren are to be included. That is legitimate.
<P>
I was shocked by the argument of the hon. Member for Colne Valley who said twice—once when intervening in my speech and again when intervening in the Minister's speech—that we must bear in mind the fact that the second family has a father but the other relationship has a non-resident parent, so the second family will enjoy the benefits of growth. Apparently, that has been set at 2.5 per cent. That is a strange figure to put on the value of the non-resident parent being in residence and looking after children, and I hope that the hon. Lady will think long and hard about that.
<P>
The hon. Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun referred to the primary responsibility If there is a primary responsibility, surely there must be a secondary responsibility. The measure to introduce fairness to the Child Support Agency and to ensure that resources rightly and properly go to children starts from the basis of not treating children equally. That is a very bad basis from which to achieve fairness.
<P>
I thank the Minister for being so honest in his response. He said, rightly, that there is cross-party support for his objective, as there is for mine. The Minister referred to the amounts going to children, which goes back to our previous debate. The mechanism in the Bill is to move money between the non-resident parent and the parent with care. There is no mechanism to ensure that the money goes to children, and that undermines much of what the Government are saying.
<P>
We are discussing a probing amendment and we have had a serious debate on it. In view of what has been said about its adequacy, we should like to reflect on it. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>

<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. George:</B> Perhaps I should beg the Committee's forbearance as I try to explain the purpose of the amendments while struggling to fathom the complexities of even the simplified proposals. I do not share the eloquence of some other hon. Members. Following our discussion on earlier complex proposals, we are still in the depth of complexity with the amendments, for which I apologise to hon. Members.
<P>
We have accepted that average assessments will fall under the new scheme, so most non-resident parents will not be worse off. That has been established in previous debates, and there is adequate evidence to accept that. However, of the 150,000 non-resident parents whose assessments will be increased or who will lose their exemption from paying child support, around 70 per cent. are on benefits or have net incomes of less than £200 a week. Only 22 per cent. of non-resident parents have new partners but with such a significant proportion on low incomes, it is right to consider the position of children in such families in the context of the overall aim of tackling child poverty.
<P>
I accept that the Bill contains measures to protect families who earn less than £200. For some, perhaps for many, those measures will prove adequate. None the less, I remain concerned about the prospects of those who are already in financial difficulty, or whose circumstances leave them with less disposable income than most other second families. For example, second families on income support or income-based jobseeker's allowance will have £5 deducted from their benefit for payment of maintenance. Some low-income second families who are in work may experience hardship, particularly those with very high housing costs.
<P>
Amendment No. 70 would increase income support or income-based jobseeker's allowance to take account of that difficulty, so that those on very low incomes would not be pushed below the poverty line. Currently, non-resident parents are exempt from paying maintenance if they are assessed as liable for the minimum payment of maintenance, which is currently £5.20, and fall within categories set out in the explanatory memorandum and elsewhere.
<P>
Under the Bill, only those groups that are described—full-time students, prisoners, and so on will be liable for a nil rate of maintenance. Therefore, all other non-resident parents on income support or income-related jobseeker's allowance will be liable to pay the £5 a week premium. That includes those who are responsible for children in a second family, who are currently exempt. As a result, the income-based JSA of an estimated 44,440 second families will reduce by £5 a week.
<P>
I understand that the Government wish to encourage compliance to ensure that as many children as possible receive maintenance. However, income support and income-based JSA fall significantly short of the income levels that are required to meet families' needs. Deducting a further £5 will cause significant hardship. Those second families will be required, as a matter of public policy, to live below income support levels. That is why we have tabled our amendment. Under it, a deduction could be made for payment of maintenance without pushing such families further into poverty. That would reinforce the Government's commitment to ending child poverty. Best estimates suggest that the amendment would cost about £11.5 million a year. I should be interested to hear whether the Government have made their own assessment.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> Yes, we have made an assessment. It would cost £20 million a year.
<P>
<B>Mr. George:</B> I will check my figures, but it is clear that, although there is an associated cost, a principle is at stake. I should point out that each of the amendments under my name and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Sutton and Cheam are probing amendments. We want to ensure that Committee members and Ministers appreciate what we are getting ourselves into. Some families—admittedly, a minority—will be 100 per cent. affected by the Bill, and pushed below what we would all agree is a low poverty line.
<P>
We recommend that the Government consider increasing housing benefit disregards as part of the housing benefit review. One option is to calculate entitlement to housing benefit on the basis of income once maintenance has been paid. According to Hansard, the Government estimated on 13 December 1999 that such a measure would cost £30 million a year. Of course, increasing housing benefit disregards would not help home owners, for whom a different solution should be sought. Concerns about high travel-to-work costs could be met by widening the appeals system or by varying the scheme.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
According to their reply to the 10th report of the Social Security Committee, the Government have set up a systematic research programme to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``evaluate the impact of the reforms on CSA clients and their families will collect information about children's welfare, payment levels and compliance. This data will enable us''—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
that is, the Government—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``to observe the effect of the reforms on the well-being of second families.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is welcome. I hope that the programme will provide useful information that will help to evaluate the impact of the new system on families. However, we believe that sufficient information is available in the meantime—for example, by comparing the income levels of people who are in work and on income support—to allow the Government to consider possible solutions for second families with high housing costs as part of the housing benefit review.
<P>
I accept that new clause 5 slightly contradicts other amendments, but its purpose is to probe. The Government announced their intention to introduce a maintenance disregard of £10—the child maintenance payment—for parents with care who are in receipt of income support or income-based JSA. We were told that that provision is not in the Bill because it can be introduced by amending existing regulations, and we accept that. The purpose of new clause 5 is to question the level of disregard. We welcome the £10 disregard, but a £15 disregard would clearly go further in the tackling of child poverty.
<P>
I turn to new clause 9. As I understand it, the scheme should be launched in late 2001, when the first new cases will be taken on. Existing Child Support Agency cases will be taken on at a later, unspecified date. The child maintenance premium will apply to parents who are assessed under the new scheme. Initially, therefore, in respect of existing cases, income support or income-based JSA will continue to be reduced for every £1 of maintenance received. Some 400,000 parents with care will not benefit from the child maintenance premium until their cases are transferred to the new system. When will existing cases be transferred to the new scheme?
<P>
The Social Security Committee was concerned that dealing with apparently similar cases over a long time may give rise to a sense of unfairness, which could substantially undermine the credibility of the reformed child support scheme. It recommended that all parents with care who are in receipt of income support or income-based JSA should benefit from the child maintenance premium from the commencement of the proposed reforms in 2001.
<P>
In responding to the Social Security Committee, the Government said that it was not possible to introduce the premium at the same time for all parents with care because, first, it will not be possible to deliver effectively and reliably without a new computer system and, secondly, many non-resident parents are exempt under current rules, and one third who are liable for payments do not make them. The Government have said that, in such circumstances, the child maintenance premium would offer no advantage to the children concerned.
<P>
We urge the Government to try to overcome any technological difficulties. We want as many children as possible to gain as quickly and as early as possible. It will be difficult to explain to parents with care why their benefit is reduced for every £1 of maintenance received, while other parents in apparently the same position keep £10.
<P>
The nature of the technological difficulty with the computer system is unclear. I know that there has been some debate about the cost, the tendering process and the system that will be put in place, but no doubt we will hear more in the Minister's reply. About three quarters of parents with care receive maintenance direct from the non-resident parent. Such parents already report the amount of maintenance that they receive to the Benefits Agency. Why cannot the Benefits Agency then apply the appropriate disregard to maintenance received, as it does for other forms of income such as earnings?
<P>
Where a parent with care is using the Child Support Agency collection service, income support and maintenance can be paid together. It may therefore be unclear to the parent how much of the payment is maintenance. In those cases the CSA could be required to notify the Benefits Agency of the amount of the maintenance payment, and the Benefits Agency could then increase the income support payment by the appropriate amount. The CSA could confirm the level of payment being made on, say, a quarterly basis. If necessary, an adjustment could be made to the income support for the next quarter.
<P>
The introduction of the £10 child maintenance premium is an important step in tackling child poverty. Raising the premium to £15 would have an even greater impact on child poverty. Some academics believe that support falls £20 short of the ``low cost but acceptable'' budget for a family with two children under 11. Increasing the premium to £15 would take them close to being able to reach that budget. Based on Government figures, a premium of £15 would cost £140 million a year, compared with £100 million for the £10 premium.
<P>
As a minimum, the premium should be regularly uprated so that it does not lose its value over time. In response to the Select Committee's recommendation that the premium be uprated in line with inflation, the Government said that that would introduce complexity. For example, this year it would go up by 11p or 16p depending on the method used. The Government consider it more sensible to have disregards in whole pounds. Their commitment to review the value of the premium from time to time is welcome. I noted that in his earlier reply the Minister accepted that the impact of all the CSA changes should be reviewed regularly, and that is welcome. To review it through oral or written parliamentary questions might give rise to a rather piecemeal review and would not give the whole picture, which I think many hon. Members would prefer. Therefore, it would be helpful if the Under-Secretary could say whether a scheduled review is proposed and how wide ranging it might be. We welcome clarification of when and at what intervals the review will take place.
<P>
As regards new clauses 10 and 11, I understand that the maintenance payments of parents with care on tax credits will be disregarded entirely, compared with a £15 disregard for those on family credit. However, the disregard on housing benefit and council tax benefit remains at £15. That means that up to 85 per cent. of any maintenance over £15 is lost in the extra rent and council tax that the parent has to pay. For example, a parent getting £30 a week keeps only £17.25. The value of the more generous tax credit disregard is therefore eroded. Maintenance received should be ignored in full for housing benefit and council tax benefit purposes. That would bring the policy into line with the more generous tax credits policy.
<P>
We welcome the indications that the Government are considering increasing the maintenance disregard on housing benefit and council tax benefit. I appreciate that the increase would not need to be included in the Bill, as the change could be made by secondary legislation. The estimated cost of disregarding maintenance in full for housing benefit and council tax benefit purposes in these circumstances is—again based on Government figures—£30 million a year. However, it would be helpful to have amplification of both the cost and the Government's plans to deal with what still appears to those who are concerned about families on low income to be an anomaly.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I want to speak briefly to amendment No. 70 and to our amendment No. 107, which is a technical, probing amendment. It seeks to delete the provision in paragraph 4(2) which states that if two non-resident parents are together as a couple and one or both are on benefit, one gets a special flat-rate contribution. We seek an explanation for this special concession.
<P>
In the previous debate the Minister talked, not unreasonably, about the package of measures and said that it was sometimes difficult to reach a conclusion in Committee because we have to scrutinise the Bill line by line and examine every provision in isolation. As the hon. Member for St. Ives (Mr. George) said, the Government intend to introduce measures to deal by regulation with the treatment of benefit. On the surface, the excellent briefing supplied by the Child Poverty Action Group shows that, as a matter of public policy, second families will be required to live below income support level. That is clearly not desirable, so we seek an explanation from the Government of the package of measures that gave rise to that bare statement from the CPAG. The Government's reaction will determine how we vote on this group of amendments.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> Under this group of amendments, there are complex arguments on the interaction of the benefits system with tapers and rising income, which anyone familiar with the subject will recognise. The Child Poverty Action Group has been supporting these amendment, and is probably more familiar than most with the effects of tapers and high marginal deduction rates. I hope that I can allay some of the fears about those effects, but, even with a high marginal deduction rate, if housing benefit tapers, people will still retain more money than they would have before. We must, therefore, bear in mind the big picture when considering high marginal deduction rates.
<P>
Amendment No. 70 seeks to change the way in which a non-resident parent on income support or income-based jobseeker's allowance who has children living with him in a second family would meet his maintenance liability. The amendment would provide for the weekly amount of income support or income-based jobseeker's allowance to be increased by an amount equivalent to the flat-rate liability of £5, in cases in which the non-resident parent had children living with him in a second family. The effect of the amendment would be that the taxpayer, rather than the non-resident parent, would meet the costs of child support.
<P>
That would be inconsistent with the stated aim—with which I think most Committee members agree—that the primary responsibility for children should rest with the parents, whether they live together or apart, rather than with the taxpayer. We will struggle to achieve the appropriate balance between determining what the taxpayer can do to provide support and sending a signal to parents that they have the first responsibility for their children.
<P>
We recognise the concern to ensure that children in second families do not suffer. However, our proposals for a new child support scheme recognise that all children have a fundamental right to the support of both parents, and that fathers on benefit have as much responsibility for their children's upkeep as those with earnings. The requirement of a flat-rate payment recognises that responsibility, and maintains an important link between the parent and child during periods of unemployment or illness. It will also establish a habit of regular payment, which is very important, as our experience of running the Child Support Agency teaches us. If people are moving between work and benefit, it is important for them to have some continuity, and to get into the habit of paying a regular sum of money for the child.
<P>
Moreover, there is little logic in the present rules, which require non-resident parents who are single—and who have the lowest benefit entitlement—to make a contribution, while those with children are exempt. Non-resident parents who receive social security benefits but who meet their responsibilities by sharing the care of a child will not be liable for the flat-rate payment. This is part of the balance that we are seeking to establish, and I am trying to explain to the hon. Member for St. Ives the basis on which we are doing that. We recognise that there are difficulties relating to all these decisions.
<P>
We have said that if those who pay the basic rate because they are on benefit share the care of their child for one night a week, they will be exempt from paying the £5. It is important to remember that non-resident parents who receive social security benefits but who meet their responsibilities in this manner will be allowed to have a nil payment in recognition of the support that they are giving to the child of the first family.
<P>
In summary, we believe that our proposals for a flat-rate payment strike an appropriate balance between protecting children in low-income families and ensuring that non-resident parents continue to honour their responsibilities to support their children while they are out of work. Non-resident parents with children already receive higher benefits in recognition of their circumstances. Increasing benefit levels further in line with the flat-rate payment would simply transfer the non-resident parent's responsibilities for child support to the taxpayer. That would not be fair and it would be against the principle underlying the Bill.
<P>
I shall deal with amendment No. 104 before we go on to the more complex areas of child maintenance payments and how they interact with housing benefit and council tax benefit. At that point, we should also have a discussion about the administrative complexities, because they are a key issue that one cannot simply dismiss as a bit of a bother. I hope that I shall be able to explain those complexities to the hon. Member for St. Ives later.
<P>
I hope that amendment No. 104 is a probing amendment, because it would have the opposite effect to that described by the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar. It relates to cases in which both members of a couple in receipt of income support or income-based jobseeker's allowance are liable to pay child support. For that to become a relevant part of the calculation, there would have to be two non-resident parents, both of whom had moved away from their first families, and both of whom were receiving benefit. I suggest that that happens quite rarely. Only about 5 per cent. of non-resident parents are women, which enables us to make a quick calculation as to how few people would be likely to be involved.
<P>
The purpose of the amendment is to revoke the provision under which a couple who are both non-resident parents in receipt of income support or income-based jobseeker's allowance will be liable to pay a flat-rate payment of a prescribed amount. In these circumstances, we intend the flat-rate payment to be the equivalent of half the standard flat-rate amount. We do not want the basic rate of £5 to go any higher because we recognise that those on benefit have limited resources. The effect of the proposal in the Bill will be that both members of the couple will be liable for a flat-rate payment of £2.50 each, and that the total amount to be deducted from the benefit payment will therefore remain at the standard flat rate of £5.
<P>
The amendment would mean that, if both members of a couple were non-resident parents, a deduction of twice the flat rate amount—or £10—would be taken from their benefit. The benefit rate paid to a couple in receipt of income support is not equivalent to twice the rate paid to a single person, as many of us will know from our surgeries. It would, therefore, be even more unfair to require two flat-rate payments—the equivalent of £10—as a deduction in such cases, because the benefit is not doubled up when there are two people rather than one. I hope that the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar will accept our reasoning on those cases in which both members of a couple are non-resident parents on benefit.
<P>
New clause 5 would introduce a £15 a week disregard of maintenance into a reformed child support scheme instead of our planned £10 a week maintenance premium. We have always made it clear that we wanted to let families on income support keep some of the maintenance paid for their children when resources allow. We see the introduction of the child maintenance premium as a way of legitimising the payment.
<P>
Many people who have come to my surgery to discuss these issues have said that, if the non-resident parent is on benefit, the liabilities that they pay get deducted pound for pound from their benefit. When the 1991 Act was going through Parliament, there was a question about whether there should be a child maintenance premium. We have decided that there should be, so that for the first time all children, in all circumstances, will receive a benefit from the non-resident parent paying maintenance liabilities. The issue here is the level at which it should be set. The Government have said that it should be set at £10. The amendment would make it £15. We could discuss that, but the principle is not at issue.
<P>
We announced in the White Paper that we expect at least to double the proportion of lone parents on benefit who receive maintenance. The introduction of the £10 maintenance premium will ensure that those families gain directly. That means that 600,000 children in some of the poorest families will experience the benefit of maintenance for the first time. That is on top of extra help directed to poorer families through the working families tax credit, by which any maintenance received is completely ignored in working out the entitlement. Thus what used to be known as the Treasury support agency becomes once more a child support agency.
<P>
We have always made it clear that our plans for a reformed child support scheme should be seen as a package, as my hon. Friend the Minister of State emphasised during an earlier debate. A balance always has to be struck in respect of such delicate matters. If one takes them apart, picks out bits and isolates them, one often does not get the full picture of what the Government are trying to do.
<P>
A £10 a week maintenance premium in income support will cost £65 million a year. Increasing it to £15 would cost an extra £35 million a year. Our radical reform of the CSA is a broadly cost neutral package over five years. By my calculations, the hon. Member for St. Ives spent an extra £180 million a year in the course of his short contribution. I shall give him the costings for which he asked. Amendment No. 70, which would transfer the cost of the £5 maintenance premium for those on benefits, would cost an extra £20 million a year. New clause 5, which would increase the child maintenance premium from £10 to £15, would cost an extra £35 million a year. New clause 9, which would introduce the child maintenance premium before moving existing cases on to the new scheme, would cost an extra £65 million. New clause 10, which deals with the housing benefit maintenance disregards, would cost an extra £30 million. The hon. Gentleman was right about that, but he forgot about the extra £30 million which would be accounted for if we were to change the council tax benefit disregards as well, as he suggested. I am not Scottish, nor am I stunningly good at mathematics, but I believe that that totals £180 million. I would be interested to hear how the Liberal Democrats would pay for that. I suspect that it would mean yet another 1p on income tax.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> Does the Under-Secretary agree that that would be on top of the £800 million that it would cost to take the whole system back to the courts?
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> The hon. Lady is right. However, I am sure that you do not wish me to go down that road at this juncture, Mr. O'Brien.
<P>
I assure the Committee that we intend to introduce our planned £10 a week child maintenance premium in income support and income-based jobseeker's allowance by means of secondary legislation. We intend to pay the child maintenance premium as soon as maintenance is paid under the new scheme. We are not going to subsidise the payment of maintenance in advance by introducing the child maintenance premium before the non-resident parent is paying maintenance. All the evidence from European and other systems demonstrates that if child maintenance payments are advanced in that way, they are never recovered from the non-resident parent. This measure is intended to say to the non-resident parent, ``Your money is actually going to your children; please pay it'', rather than, ``The taxpayer is going to subsidise you until you decide to come up with it.''
<P>
I know that the hon. Member for St. Ives tabled the amendment and the new clauses partly for the purposes of debate, but I am surprised that he would like to put the child maintenance premium—which is, of course, part of income support—into the Bill. Technically speaking, it would be extremely undesirable to do so. Furthermore, the hon. Gentleman argued completely the opposite case in the Committee's previous sitting, during which he tabled amendments suggesting that certain matters should be removed from the Bill and put into regulations. It would be nice if he were to show a little consistency.
<P>
New clause 9 would go even further. It would provide in the Bill a £10 weekly disregard of maintenance in income support and income-based jobseeker's allowance, and would introduce the disregard for all child support cases at the same time as the new scheme is introduced. I hope that I have explained why the Government want to introduce the measure as a package, and not do so in advance.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
As I said earlier, our plans for a reformed child support scheme have to be seen as a package. That means that once the reforms are introduced, new cases will get the maintenance premium straight away. Parents with an existing maintenance assessment will have to wait until they are transferred to the new scheme. We want to make that change as soon as possible, but trying to transfer existing cases too soon would be a recipe for administrative chaos. We are determined to avoid that.
<P>
I am sure that we will return to the issue of transition in more detail as we progress through the Bill. Hon. Members have mentioned—both on Second Reading and during the Committee's proceedings—the difficulties that are involved in the transition, and we have not denied that. However, having examined the matter closely, we have been unable to come up with any alternatives. We anticipate that by the time of the change there will be a caseload of about 1.2 million cases, and we have been advised that a big bang solution is not administratively possible. We do not want to put the entire child benefit structure at risk in order to ensure that there is always going to be complete consistency between people in the same situation.
<P>
Obviously, we want the transition period to be as short as possible. That is consistent with getting the 1.2 million cases transferred to the new system. The Child Support Agency will do a lot of work in advance of the new computer system becoming available so as to minimise the prospect that there may be difficulties in that area.
<P>
The child maintenance premium involves difficult administrative issues that must be addressed. It will have to be paid using the income support computer. The Department has a legacy of very old computer systems, many of which were designed in the 1970s on old computer architecture. In layman's language, that means that we cannot change the way in which the computers operate as easily as we could if we had modern computers. The income support computer works by changing its programming through old language. We are able to carry out two so-called releases a year. They change the way in which the programme works. The first free space for the purposes of the child maintenance premium occurs at the end of October 2002, because existing legislative commitments have filled up the others.
<P>
It has been estimated that the child maintenance premium is so complex to introduce that it will take an entire release to do so. Therefore, from a practical, operational point of view we are significantly constrained by our existing legacy systems. That means that we could not introduce the child maintenance premium overnight, even if we had the money and agreed that we wanted to do so immediately. We must ensure that it is done in a coherent, controllable way that does not damage the other deliveries of income support. In other words, we must—in due course—do it in the way that I have described.
<P>
New clause 10 would mean that parents with care would have any maintenance received—that word is important—disregarded when entitlement to housing benefit and council tax benefit is calculated. Currently, £15 of any maintenance received is ignored for housing benefit and council tax benefit purposes.
<P>
New clause 11 would mean that non-resident parents would have entitlement to housing benefit and council tax benefit calculated on income, less any maintenance that they were paying.
<P>
The first thing to say about housing benefit is that 409 different local authorities administer it, using 409 different computer systems.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I have been listening to the Under-Secretary with great interest, particularly on the problems of the computer architecture. Can she confirm that it will be October 2002 before any changes can be made, or is it—
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> No.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I am sorry. I thought that the Under-Secretary said 2002.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> No, I said October 2001. We have two computer releases a year in which to rewrite in old-fashioned computer language, which I shall not bore the hon. Lady with, the way in which income support can be administered. All those computer releases are taken up until 2001. Our calculations for the complexities of applying the new child maintenance premium will take an entire release. Clearly, civil servants and computer experts are working on it.
<P>
People think that computers can do anything, but when a load of legacy systems from the 1970s are involved, they cannot. There are great constraints on the way in which the language and the programmes can be rewritten. We then have to test them to make sure that the systems do not collapse. It is about time the House began to take account of the series of practical, operational matters involved in policy decisions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> The Under-Secretary has been helpful. I am not familiar with this concept of a release.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> The hon. Gentleman does not want to be.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I am sure that the Under-Secretary is right, but we want to be clear in our minds. The release is a period during which the computer operators have time to fill in this particular problem. Is she entirely satisfied that that release period is sufficient? What would be the consequence if it turned out to be more complicated than the operators thought? Would we then have to wait for a further period of release? If so, what is that release date?
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> The hon. Gentleman, not surprisingly, has slightly misunderstood the concept of computer releases. On the old, large, mainframe computers there is no software of the sort that we find on the personal computer in our office. A series of codes has to be written into the computer to make it do things We do not produce a letter on those old computers by typing it out in WordPerfect or Word and then printing it. It must be translated into computer gobbledygook and put into the computer, so that the computer can function.
<P>
It was a fantastic advance when the computer arrived in the 1970s, but they can be incredibly frustrating. Computer architecture has moved on, computers are much faster and software and modern PC designs have enabled us to do things on a screen in a sensible way rather than in Cobol or other old computer languages.
<P>
The two releases a year for the income support computer do not relate to an amount of time. They are two windows of opportunity when can rewrite some of the programming in the computer and test it to make sure that it does not interact adversely with any of the existing programmes. There are two windows of opportunity a year when that can be done in our legacy systems on the income support computer. It is one of the oldest, most changed and most patched, because of the nature of income support and the fact that it is a safety net benefit on which millions of people rely. That also makes it one of the largest and most complex things to change.
<P>
The two windows of opportunity this year are taken up with existing legislative changes and other things that have to be done such as upratings, which there is only a limited opportunity to change. Our first major opportunity to change the system in order to introduce a complex maintenance premium is October 2001. Even if we wanted to do it tomorrow, we could not. As I repeated earlier, we shall do it as a package when the existing caseload transfers over to the new caseload, so as to ensure that, once the new system is up and running, the parent with care gets the £10 premium and the non-resident parent can be certain that the money that he is paying for the upkeep of his child is going into that family.
<P>
Before we got into these interesting and relevant discussions about computers, I was saying that new clause 10 would mean that parents with care would have any maintenance disregarded with respect to housing benefit, which is administered by 409 local authorities on 409 different computers. I suspect that the best place to deal with problems of disregards, housing benefit and tapers is in our review of housing benefit rather than in the context of child maintenance.
<P>
It is not clear to me why maintenance should be disregarded for housing benefit purposes and not, for example, money that one spends on looking after an elderly relative or many other things. We must always be careful when considering benefits and establishing principles that then lead to other demands for the same principle to be applied. We should consider how housing benefit and council tax benefit interact at this level in our housing benefit review and not in the Bill.
<P>
If we were to accept the new clauses, we would have to check that every maintenance payment due had been paid. The maintenance in both new clauses is not notional; ``maintenance paid'' is the phrase used. Therefore, some people for whom maintenance was being paid would get the disregards in housing benefit, while there would be others for whom maintenance had not been collected or was not being paid or where there was some dispute. Housing benefit or council tax benefit due would change on a weekly basis.
<P>
If we accepted the new clauses, regardless of their cost—which would be £60 million a year—the complexity that would be introduced into already complex benefits, which local authorities are attempting to put into effect with varying degrees of success, would be hard to contemplate. However, I am sure that, like me, the Committee will welcome the extra money that we are directing through the tax credit scheme and working families tax credit to working lone parents. The idea is to make work pay but to allow parents with care who can get into work to keep all the maintenance being paid for them. However, the withdrawal of income-related benefits as income rises is a fact of life for many people on benefit. That is how the means test operates. As I said earlier, it does not mean that no benefit is gained, but simply that it is less than the hon. Member for St. Ives would have hoped.
<P>
Income tapers in housing benefit and council tax benefits mean that all parents with care who gain from the 100 per cent. disregard of maintenance in working families tax credit will be better off as a result of the change. That is the big picture that I ask the hon. Gentleman to keep in mind.
<P>
I hope that I have gone through some of the reasons why the Government do not support any of the amendments.

<P>

<B>Mr. Andrew George:</B> I appreciate the Minister's reply. As I said in my opening remarks, these are probing amendments, but we cannot let this opportunity pass without dwelling on and debating these matters. It is difficult enough in these circumstances to attempt to probe or even to second-guess methods by which we can relieve the impact of the Bill on the poorest in the land, and clearly, during its deliberations, the Committee must make some attempt to pay due regard to that. That is why we tabled these probing amendments. I appreciate that the Under-Secretary has clarified the costs of the amendments in my name and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Northfield (Mr. Burden), but I think she will accept, given Labour Government principles, that reducing poverty has a cost. We must recognise that a price tag will <P>
necessarily attach to provisions that deal with social exclusion and inclusion. The purpose of the amendments is to probe, and it is helpful to have the price tag attached to them. Perhaps there will be an opportunity at a later stage, having reflected on the Bill's likely impact, to revisit some of those proposals.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Like the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar, I am grateful to the Child Poverty Action Group for their briefings, for keeping us on our mettle and reminding us of the proposals' likely impact on the poorest families.
<P>
With regard to computer systems, I am probably more IT challenged than most Committee members. I am not normally a Luddite or a dinosaur when it comes to such matters, and I appreciate that the implementation of the proposals will give rise to technological problems. I have reflected on the Under-Secretary's response—which, if not tortured, was certainly detailed—to the question of using the existing computer system and the significant modifications that would have to be made. As legislators, we are increasingly becoming slaves to technology. We may wish to bring about legislative change, but the major barrier to such change is usually technology itself
<P>
I agree with the Under-Secretary's comments about the computer systems. Penwith, a district in my constituency, wanted to be one of the first to implement the verification project, but the result was horrendous delays in the payment of housing benefit and a range of associated problems. We appreciate that there were technical reasons for that, and it is clear that there are IT difficulties associated with <P>
implementing any change to the system. The changes proposed in the Bill are significant, and I recognise the overwhelming problems that the Department will face.
<P>
Leaving aside those difficulties, the Under-Secretary seemed to accept in her reply that some parents will feel a sense of unfairness, in that existing cases will be treated differently until the system is able to catch up. That is a matter of regret for all parties.
<P>
I shall not respond to every point that the Under-Secretary made. The primary purpose of our amendments was to probe issues that are fundamental to the Government's purpose in addressing poverty and social exclusion.
<P>
In response to the unnecessary comments about whether clauses should be in the Bill, I can tell the Under-Secretary that that depends on the circumstances—[Interruption.] I beg the Committee's pardon for giving a straight answer We are discussing serious matters that will affect poor people. If we want to probe and debate those matters, we must table amendments that reflect the likely impact on some of the poorest people in the land. <P>
If Ministers want to make cheap comments about that, that is up to them. If we want a debate on the rate of disregard, we must table amendments. We want to amend the Bill, not background or anticipated supporting regulations, and it is inevitable that those amendments will include figures, but those figures need not ultimately be in the Bill.
<P>
Leaving aside the unnecessary preamble, I appreciate the Minister's response. I believe that the Government have a genuine shared interest in wanting to ameliorate the worst effects of such legislation on the poorest families in the land. I hope that our debate has provided the Government with the opportunity to reflect on the matter. If they felt able to table suitable amendments, we would welcome them.
<P>
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 105, in page 70, leave out line 10 and insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(a) is a student in full-time education at an educational establishment in the United Kingdom or is serving a term of imprisonment at a prison in the United Kingdom'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 106, in page 70, leave out line 10 and insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(a) is serving a term of imprisonment at a prison in the United Kingdom'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I know that Labour Members enjoy the prospect of voting for their Government's proposals, and Opposition Members become equally excited at the prospect of voting against them. We have had no votes this morning and it is unlikely that we shall have a Division on this group of amendments, unless the Minister is particularly provocative.
<P>
These are probing amendments on two levels. The first argument concerns ministerial discretion. The House must always be vigilant about not giving Ministers too much discretion.—
<P>
<B>Mr. Kevin Hughes </B>(Doncaster, North): The hon. Gentleman can say that again.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> The Government Whip is a man of considerable experience in such matters. He has been hardened by the experience of being in office for 999 days, and he now knows that we should not put too much discretion in the Government's hands.
<P>
I draw the Committee's attention to the explanatory notes, which are, as always, most helpful. It was rude of me not to thank the Ministers for providing what used to be called a composite of the Bill. It has made our deliberations much easier. I am grateful to the Under-Secretary, as I am sure other hon. Members are, for supplying that information this morning.
<P>
On page 11 of the explanatory notes, which refers to the receipt of prescribed benefits, it states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The flat rate is not payable in a case where a non-resident parent has a nil liability''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The notes go on to explain the nil rate, and paragraph 28, referring to paragraph 5 of the schedule, states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``It is intended to prescribe full time students in advanced education and prisoners for this purpose.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If anybody else is to be prescribed, we should be told. If no other categories of people are to be prescribed, why do the Government need this discretion? It might well be a belt-and-braces exercise, as we often have in legislation, in case we forget, or in case our window of opportunity—I forget the exact phrase that was used with regard to computers—
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> Computer architecture?
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> Computer architecture—just in case the architecture of the Bills or the statutory instruments is not up to it. There is that argument.
<P>
There is also an argument that says ``Hold on a minute''. When I woke up this morning, I listened to an interesting discussion on the ``Today'' programme about Scottish education—this time not about mathematics but about student fees. We are saying that it is all right for students to pay fees, to take out loans and to take summer jobs, but it is not acceptable for students to make a contribution towards a child that they have brought into this world. I cannot see any logic in that. There is no consistency. This is the age of joined-up government, so what happened to that element of joined-up government? It may or may not be a good thing to ensure that students pay their whack.
<P>
<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> Although we must always encourage young people to pursue full-time courses in education, would it not be most regrettable if an added incentive to do so were to avoid a child maintenance liability?
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> My hon. Friend anticipates what I was about to say. I want to make two points on that. First, if somebody decides to bring a child into this world, they must say to themselves, ``Maybe I did want to go Oxford or Cambridge, or to spend an extra year in Edinburgh learning about the classics and the like''—[Interruption.] I come from a polytechnic background.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> There is nothing wrong with polytechnics.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> The Minister is exactly right. I am very proud.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman stick to the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I most certainly will, Mr. O'Brien.
<P>
<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> Given the nature of student life, of which I am sure my hon. Friend and those who attended polytechnics are aware, it is precisely those young people who should be particularly vigilant. It would be wrong to remove a disincentive.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> My hon. Friend should bear in mind the fact that I blush easily. This is a little bit too X-„certificate for me. However, there is a moral point. If somebody decides to bring a child into the world, maybe they should say, ``I won't go on to full-time education. Maybe I should get a job and contribute towards the child's upbringing.''
<P>
My second point relates to what my hon. Friend said in his earlier intervention about avoidance. The easiest way to avoid the CSA is to enrol on a full-time course. That applies not only to young people but to those who are more mature in age and outlook. As part of joined-up government, the Government rightly want to see more people going into full-time education. People should not use the opening of that door to escape their responsibilities, and we want an explanation of that.
<P>
It being One o'clock, THE CHAIRMAN adjourned the Committee without Question put, pursuant to the Standing Order.
<P>
Adjourned till this day at half-past Four o'clock.
