</P>
<P>
<B>The Minister for Sport (Mr. Tony Banks):</B> It may be for the convenience of the Committee if I explain why the Government are opposing the motion. The clause would establish a panel to advise the Director General of the National Lottery, when selecting the national lottery operator, to ensure that such a procedure is independent and objective.
<P>
However, as members of the Committee are aware, we have decided to broaden and strengthen the regulatory structure by replacing both the office of the director general and the proposed advisory panel with a National Lottery Commission. It will be a permanent collective body, responsible for the selection of the operator and on-going regulations. That will reduce the risk, actual or perceived, of conflicts of interest and regulatory capture by introducing a wider range of expertise and experience. I shall explain the matter in greater detail when we discuss amendments Nos. 32, 28, 29 and 30, new clause 2 and new schedule 1. I propose that the clause does not stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Richard Spring </B>(West Suffolk): As the Minister said, there will be an opportunity to discuss such issues later in our proceedings. We shall then examine the proposals in more detail.

<P>
<B>Mr. Banks:</B> We oppose schedule 1 for the same reasons as we opposed clause 1.
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> I appreciate that this is a nerve-racking day for the Minister for Sport. His great personal evolution, which Opposition Members watch with fascination, may be determined by the decision of the people of London today. If the hon. Gentleman is nervous and cannot quite grasp which end of the Bill should go where, we understand and are sympathetic.

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(15) The Director General shall not impose a financial penalty if he is satisfied that the operator has agreed to take, and is taking, all such steps as it appears for the time being to be appropriate for the operator to take for the purpose of securing or facilitating rectification of the contravention in question.".<P>

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>", or
<P>

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Fraser:</B> I would like to speak briefly and coherently about amendments Nos. 20 and 22. My Hon. Friend the Member for North Norfolk (Mr. Prior) will speak to amendment No. 21.
<P>
Amendment No. 20 seeks to establish a scale or tariff of the fines to be imposed on the lottery operator for breaching the terms of the operating licence. The Opposition are in favour of a firm regulatory regime, which will establish a framework within which the operator can work and provide a transparent system that will gain the public's confidence.
<P>
Under the Government's planned regime, the director general and the lottery commission have the ultimate sanction of either revoking the operator's licence for failure to comply with its terms, or giving a new licence to another operator when the existing licence expires. However, we understand that the Government are determined to provide the regulator with the power to fine the operator for failure to comply with the terms of its licence.
<P>
The amendment is intended to make that process transparent by establishing a tariff or formula to[Mr. Fraser]
indicate the level of fine to be imposed. The White Paper, "The People's Lottery", outlined the Government's proposal to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"include a power for the Director General to impose financial penalties on the operator, where serious licence breaches occur."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We are concerned that clause 2, like so many other clauses, confers wide powers on the director general, which can be used at the discretion of individual office holders.
<P>
The Bill gives the operator no indication of what it might be fined for breaching the terms of the licence or even what might constitute such a breach. On Second Reading in another place, Lord McIntosh said that the operator would be fined only if there had been a serious breach of the licence. He said of the director general:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Now he will be able if there are serious breaches to impose a fine both as penalty and to recompense the good causes if the breach has reduced the amount of money flowing to them." [Official Report, House of Lords, 18 December 1997; Vol. 584, c. 731.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There is no mention in the Bill of the severity or the gravity of offence that might prompt the regulator to fine the operator.
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that in general, when litigation results in excessive awards, it often diminishes the authority and credibility of the law? Litigation would not only damage a private company's ability to do business and to make business judgments; it would also affect public perception of the law if it was so open-ended.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fraser:</B> It is precisely because the make-up of the organisation and its standing in the country would be affected that we tabled our amendments. Several peers drew attention to that omission in another place and asked whether the Government would consider limiting the liability of the operator. Publishing a tariff of fines for breaches of licence would not only make the system more transparent but have a deterrent effect on the operator.
<P>
As my right hon. Friend the Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Brooke) pointed out on Second Reading, the Minister's reply in the House of Lords was meaningless. Lord McIntosh said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"We believe that the sensible and reasonable application of the power to impose financial penalties is the most appropriate way of ensuring that any penalties imposed are fair." [Official Report, House of Lords, 19 January 1998; Vol. 584, c. 9.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I should be grateful if the Minister would clarify exactly what that means. Does it mean that any penalty that the regulator decides to impose is fair?
<P>
I should also be grateful for some guidance from the Minister as to what is likely to constitute a serious breach of the licence. For example, failure to display the relevant point-of-sale material is a technical breach of the operator's licence, as is the interruption of the sale of tickets in an area of the country for several days. The Bill provides no indication of when the regulator would choose to levy a fine. On Second Reading in the House of Lords, the Minister said that the regulator had long asked for the power to fine licence holders. There must therefore be instances in which the director general would have fined the operator, had he been able to do so. In his response to the debate, will the Minister give us examples of when that has occurred?
<P>
Will the Government consider the impact of the capacity of the director general to impose unlimited fines on the operator? What effect will that have on the operation of the lottery? It may be detrimental to good causes because it may encourage the operator to be overly cautious of introducing new games or developing the lottery in other ways.
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> My hon. Friend makes a key point. The reason why Camelot has been uniquely successful among all lottery operators around the world and is recognised as such is the profit motive. That is why Camelot has been able, by innovation and by handling the lottery so well, not only to be a role model for other countries but to give a substantially greater amount to good causes than does virtually any other lottery.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fraser:</B> I agree entirely with my hon. Friend that the lottery is seen as a fine example around the world; we must ensure that the Bill retains it as such.
<P>
If the problems to which I have referred are not addressed, that may have a negative impact on the amount of money allocated to good causes. It may also discourage companies from coming forward to bid to be the lottery operator when the current contract expires. The Government have a duty to ensure that lottery legislation is framed in such a way that the lottery generates the maximum possible sum for the good causes. The more open regulatory framework that the amendment is intended to promote would help to achieve that.
<P>
Amendment No. 22 would prevent the current or any subsequent operator from being held to account for any failure in the operation of the lottery resulting from circumstances that could reasonably said to be beyond its control. The grounds for appeal against financial penalties imposed by the regulator are not drawn widely in the Bill. They are: first, that the director general made an error concerning the facts; secondly, that there was a material procedural error; and thirdly, that the director general made some other error of law. The amendment would increase the scope for appeal by the operator by adding the grounds that the circumstances leading to the breach of the conditions of the licence were beyond the operator's control. If we compare the Bill's provisions with the grounds for appeal open to other bodies subject to a regulator, it is clear that the grounds for appeal are narrower in the Bill.
<P>
Section 57(1)(a) of the Railways Act 1993, section 30(1) of the Gas Act 1986 and section 18(1) of the Telecommunications Act 1984 all state that an operator can question the validity of an order if it is believed that the regulator has questioned his power in doing so. Such grounds clearly go beyond what the amendments or the Bill propose, but the Opposition think that there should be at least grounds for appeal in the case of force majeure.
<P>
In March 1998, 190 national lottery terminals were out of action for two hours in the Birmingham area because British Telecom inadvertently cut a telephone line.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Damian Green </B>(Ashford): Does my hon. Friend realise that the importance of the points that he is making is enhanced by the fact that one of the great difficulties that Camelot has overcome completely smoothly is the tremendous technical feat of ensuring that many tens of thousands of terminals work all the time, especially during peak demand on Saturday evenings? So far as I know, no one with a winning ticket has been turned away in the history of the lottery. That in itself is a great tribute to Camelot. Much of the process is outside its control and in the hands of BT and especially electricity companies and other public service providers. It would be monstrously unfair to hold Camelot peculiarly and individually responsible, given that the process that it undertakes day after day, week after week depends on reliable services being provided by many utilities.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fraser:</B> Of course, as the Government would expect, I agree with my hon. Friend. Camelot has done a tremendous job in ensuring a consistent service to lottery players, and that has been maintained at great cost. Neither Camelot nor any operator that might come after it can be held responsible for circumstances beyond its control. That would be a very open-ended responsibility.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Prior </B>(North Norfolk): Does my hon. Friend also agree that the more arbitrary and penal the regulatory regime, the greater the return that any new operator will require to take over the running of the lottery and that the greater the return required to compensate for the regime, the less money will go to good causes? Is not that a classic case of Karl Popper's law of unintended circumstances? In proposing such a regulatory regime, the Government will do down the very thing that they want to support.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fraser:</B> I entirely agree. The inevitable effect of putting measures in the way of the people trying to run such an operation is that they will be discouraged from coming forward to do so. That will work against the system within which the Government are trying to work, and they are totally wrong in doing that.
<P>
British Telecom is an important example; it is an organisation that strives to do its best, but in certain circumstances, it comes unstuck for example, in Birmingham, as I said. The Bill does not address exceptional circumstances, and the amendment would redress that. An interruption in the operator's service could happen on a much larger scale, without its being the operator's fault, and it could take some time to discover whose fault it is. That goes against the principle of the lottery and the service that the operator is trying to provide. It is unreasonable that the operator should be accountable for such circumstances and, therefore, the amendment should be accepted.
<P>
<B>Mr. Prior:</B> I shall speak to amendment No. 21. It is the least controversial amendment that we have tabled, so I shall read it out. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The Director General shall not impose a financial penalty if he is satisfied that the operator has agreed to take, and is taking, all such steps as it appears for the time being to be appropriate for the operator to take for the purpose of securing or facilitating rectification of the contravention in question."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment does not seek to remove anything from clause 2. We wish to insert it at the end of the clause as subsection 15. In the event of a breach of the licence, the amendment would provide the operator with an opportunity to rectify the situation before financial penalties are imposed by the regulator.
<P>
The amendment is consistent with clause 2, the notes on which state:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The purpose of this clause is to increase the range of options open to the Director General for dealing with licence breaches so that he is better equipped with the full range of powers to ensure that the Lottery runs successfully."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Amendment No. 21 is consistent with that. It does not detract one iota from the powers of the regulator.
<P>
The amendment seeks to remove the possibility hopefully, a remote one of an unnecessarily adversarial relationship developing between the operator and the regulator. It is senseless for the operator to pay a fine when it rectifies a breach or satisfies the director general that it is about to do so.
<P>
Hon. Members on both sides of the Committee will surely agree that compliance with the licence is more important than penalising the operator for breaching the licence. We all want strong, independent regulation with teeth. That regulation should be transparent and clear for people who play the lottery. We do not want unfair and unprincipled regulation.
<P>
The wording of amendment No. 21 is similar to that governing contravention of the licence by operators in other regulatory regimes. The Minister will be familiar with section 55 of the Railways Act 1993, which refers to the powers of the regulator. It states that:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The appropriate officer shall not make a final order, or make or confirm a provisional order, in relation to the relevant operator if he is satisfied... that the relevant operator has agreed to take, and is taking, all such steps as it appears to the appropriate officer for the time being to be appropriate for the relevant operator to take for the purpose of securing or facilitating compliance with the condition or requirement in question".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The language that we have used for amendment No. 21 is almost identical to that and to wording found in Acts governing the regulation of utilities.
<P>
I would like to take the Minister back to February and March last year, when South West Trains was involved in a much-publicised case. The shortage of drivers meant that the organisation was cancelling trains on a regular basis, and, as a result, was breaching its agreement. The franchising director made a draft enforcement order, which required South West Trains to operate 98.5 per cent. of the scheduled service in April 1997 and to satisfy the director that the level of cancellations would not be repeated. Failure to do so would have subjected the operator to a fine of £1 million. In those circumstances, performance was improved and the threatened fine removed. That is the ideal outcome in such a situation. The imposition of a fine should be the last resort, because it may result in less investment in trains and rolling stock, fewer employees and a poorer service in the long term. The levying of a fine implies that the regulatory system has failed.
<P>
It is incumbent on the Government to ensure that the regulatory system works, rather than imposing a fine or a public penalty at an unnecessarily early stage. That is particularly important in the case of the lottery, for two reasons. First, public confidence in the lottery would be eroded by the wide publicity that a fine would receive.[Mr. Prior]
Secondly, when the current licence expires, companies tendering for the new licence will take account of the fact that fines have been levied in the past and their bids will change accordingly. The more penal the regime, the higher the price that future operators will need to exact to take over the running of the lottery. That cannot fail to have an indirect effect on the good causes.
<P>
During the debate in the other place, a Minister indicated that the Government were broadly sympathetic to the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Banks:</B> Did he?
<P>
<B>Mr. Prior:</B> Yes, he did. I shall quote his exact words:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"this power is already enjoyed by other regulators and I do not believe... there is any objection in principle to its introduction for the lottery."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is hard to believe that there could be any objection in principle [Interruption.] If the Minister for Sport has such an objection, he will no doubt state it in due course. Sadly, it appears that the Minister in the other place discussed the matter with the Minister for Sport, because he subsequently declined to accept the amendment. He went on to say:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The noble Viscount asked about analogies with other operators. To take the case that he drew, particularly in Committee, in relation to the Railways Act 1993, the difference is that the franchising director has a much wider range of powers than the director general of the lottery. The franchising director can make a train operator pay compensation to passengers; he can make the operator pay financial penalties automatically for each train cancelled or delayed. Conversely, the operator can earn bonuses for improving performance."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The two Ministers should take particular note of his following point:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Train operators therefore have commercial incentives to meet passenger expectations. No such situation applies to the National Lottery operator." [Official Report, House of Lords, 9 March 1998; Vol. 587, c. 13, 14.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Minister makes some extraordinary points in that statement. First, the director general of the lottery has extensive powers. He is not a poodle and I do not believe that anyone has ever thought of him as such. I have not noticed that huge criticism of the regulatory regime has taken place. Camelot is not believed to have behaved improperly or wrongly throughout the period in which it has held the licence. The director general's powers are already extensive and will be made more so by clause 2.
<P>
Secondly, the lottery operator, like the train operators, has a strong commercial incentive to meet customer expectations. In fact it is stronger, because there is a philanthropic incentive as well as a profit incentive. Labour Members may see the directors of Camelot as capitalist hyenas trying to extract every last penny from the mouths of orphans and widows, but their activities have a strong philanthropic element as well as the commercial element. I am sure that the Minister, who has spoken extensively to Camelot over the past year, would confirm that.
<P>
I welcome the statement by the Minister in the other place that commercial incentives are a vital part of meeting passenger expectations. There is nothing wrong with the profit motive. It is wholly consistent with, and indeed vital to, the delivery of customer satisfaction. The profit motive has an unquestionably important part to play in the maximisation of revenue and resources available to good causes.
<P>
An instinctive dislike of business and the profit motive is at the heart of the Government's likely rejection of the amendment, which is uncontroversial, unless one has an undisclosed agenda. The Government would welcome the opportunity to splash across the newspapers a headline about the fining of Camelot. Nothing would amuse and satisfy some Labour Members more than the chance to say, "We have fined Camelot £1 million".
<P>
Future lottery operators will need to exact a higher rate of return to compensate for a penal regime that is arbitrary and unfair and which encourages an adversarial relationship with the regulator and with the Government. That is an irony to which I have already drawn the Committee's attention. If the amendment is rejected everyone will lose lottery players, the operator, the regulatory regime and, worst of all, the good causes.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Green:</B> My hon. Friends have set out the purposes of the amendments in great detail. Their erudition is such that they have enlightened the Committee and added to the Minister for Sport's knowledge of what Ministers said behind his back in another place. Such comments always help to improve the quality of debate in Committee.
<P>
The amendments' purposes must be set in the wider context of the Bill's deficiencies. As drafted, it illustrates the Labour party's attempt to travel from oppositionism to responsible behaviour in Government. However, the thinking that underpins the Bill can be found in the savage attacks that former Opposition spokesmen mounted on Camelot's running of the lottery. In a November 1995 press release, the right hon. Member for Copeland (Dr. Cunningham), then shadow Secretary of State, referred to Camelot pocketing profits of £1 million a week. The right hon. Gentleman did not use the phrase "capitalist hyenas", to which my hon. Friend the Member for North Norfolk earlier referred. However, such derogatory language is cut out by the Millbank spellchecker the thinking behind such language is as valid to Labour Members now as it ever was.
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> Can my hon. Friend confirm that hyenas eat meat on the bone?
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I defer to my hon. Friend's knowledge of the natural world. Hyenas are lucky to be able to do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tom Levitt </B>(High Peak): Does that explain why hyenas have a reputation for constant inane laughter? [Laughter.]
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> It could be dangerous for the hon. Gentleman to make such remarks among his hon. Friends. In that respect, hyenas can live the free life that should be available to animals and human beings. The Government have tried to prevent that, but I shall not go down that route now.
<P>
The amendments would improve the Bill. The clause suffers from a hangover from the Labour party's attitude in opposition. It decided that Camelot was one of the institutions that it could attack as savagely as possible and thus gain political advantage. Such tactics come home to roost if one wins the subsequent election and must deal with the real world in government.
<P>
The amendments would stop the Government damaging their own interests. I assume that they are sincere when they say that they want the lottery to continue to be run well and to provide large sums of money for good causes. I have no difficulty accepting the Government's sincerity because they wish to use the pot created in large part by Camelot's effective work for their own central public spending ends and to provide Ministers with a slush fund into which they can dip in future. It is clear that the Government want the lottery to continue to run well.
<P>
In the spirit of bipartisan helpfulness, we tabled the amendments to ensure that arbitrary and unfair over-regulation does not cause future damage to the lottery. A point that has been lost on Ministers it was certainly lost on them when they were in opposition is that just as under-regulation has its dangers so does over-regulation. Those dangers are more subtle, but they are equally great.
<P>
We know of the problems of under-regulation in certain industries. Scandals may emerge and public confidence may be eroded. Over-regulation of an industry or an operator, however, may present a subtle and long-term problem. It was touched on by my hon. Friend the Member for North Norfolk when he said that the second-order effect of over-regulation is that those applying for the licence will demand greater fees. The more uncertainty that the lottery operator faces, the higher the margins will have to be to cope with that uncertainty.
<P>
The Government will store up trouble for themselves if they leave the clause unamended. Problems will arise not just in the next few years, but after the next licence comes into being in 2001. It is extremely important that the lottery operator be that Camelot or some other organisation is convinced that the regime to which it signs up is not only fair, but will not be changed adversely at a later date. Anyone bidding for the licence will pad out the danger margin whether that is for profit or not for profit and that means that more money will have to be spent on systems or extra internal bureaucracy. Profit margins will have to be fattened so that the operator can cope with unexpected adverse consequences caused by the regulatory regime.
<P>
The amendments would not weaken the regulatory regime or lead to under-regulation, but would provide greater transparency, openness and consistency so that an operator is certain of how it will be treated throughout the length of the licence.
<P>
I hope that Ministers will consider the amendments favourably. Ministers in the Lords almost brought themselves to doing that and got half way to jumping the hurdle. I hope that these sensible amendments will be accepted now.
<P>
<B>Mr. Banks:</B> We are made of sterner stuff. The hon. Member for West Suffolk thought that he detected nervousness on my part on this auspicious day. It was not nervousness; it was euphoria. I draw his attention to the good speech that I made in the House on 2 May 1990 when introducing a ten-minute Bill, which proposed
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"That leave be given to bring ... to provide for the people of London the legal right and duty to elect a London Council and mayor" [Official report, 2 May 1990; Vol. 171, c. 1037.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
As I said at the time.
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"My Bill proposes the introduction of a directly elected mayor of London." [Official report, 2 May 1990; Vol. 171, c. 1038.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Bill was derided many people, including those from my own party. This morning, I had the great privilege of voting in the referendum for a directly elected mayor for London. It is nice to know that, eight years later, the rest of the world has caught up with my ideas. That is the reason for my euphoria.
<P>
I was quite nostalgic this morning when I heard the language that was being used. It took me back to the days of old Labour. On hearing the words "capitalist hyenas", I almost sprung to my feet and gave a clenched-fist salute, but then I remembered who and where I was. It reminded me of old phrases, such as the "running dogs of Yankee imperialism". I used to love that saying and threw it regularly at Foreign Office Ministers and those "capitalist lickspittles" whom we used to protest against. Each month, there would be a vote in "London Labour Briefing" on who was the class traitor of the month. However, those days have long gone; we are now new Labour.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> In the interests of the record of our proceedings, did the Prime Minister ever win that coveted accolade?
<P>
<B>Mr. Banks:</B> The former Prime Minister did on several occasions as a result of the vote of Conservative Members of a right-wing tendency. However, I do not believe that the then young well, he still is young dashing and handsome right hon. Member for Sedgefield was ever put into that category. If he were, I had nothing to do with it.
<P>
We reject the idea that there is discrimination on our part or any attempt to attack Camelot. I was almost persuaded by the speeches of Opposition Members this morning; they were of an unusually high quality, but I detect that there was a hidden hand somewhere, which probably said, "It's you!" and that the briefings came not a million miles from Camelot.
<P>
We disagree with the amendments. The hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole (Mr. Fraser) said that a tariff should be made available. We want the director general and eventually the commission to have a discretionary element when approaching the problems of fines against a lottery operator. Such a situation is not unusual. The Office of Passenger Rail Franchising and the Office of Gas Supply have the power to fine, but they do not publish tariffs. The Independent Television Commission has the power to fine television broadcasters a percentage of their qualifying revenue, which is their turnover from television-related activities. That maximum percentage is higher for subsequent offences.
<P>
Similarly, the Radio Authority has the power to fine radio companies for breaches of licence conditions[Mr. Banks]
according to pre-set percentages of qualifying revenue. Discretion is built into those areas and there is no question of publishing tariffs. We are not breaching any conventions; we are following one that was set up by the previous Government when they created regulatory bodies.
<P>
We were asked to elucidate for what sort of offences fines would be imposed. Reasonableness will always be the test. Anyone who feels that a fine imposed by the commission or the director general is unreasonable has the right to test it in court. I have in front of me a draft statement on the use of financial penalties issued by the director general, which is now the subject of consultation between him and the lottery operator. If hon. Members want examples of where fines could be imposed, I can do no better than quote from the director general's draft statement.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The director general says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"My predecessor stated in his Annual Report to you for the year up to 31 March 1997 that if he had been empowered to impose financial penalties on Camelot it was likely that he would have used them in connection with the failure to meet the licence requirement for the number of retail operational outlets to be operational at the first two quarter ends during 1996. I regard the factors above as likely to have led me to the same conclusion. By way of another example, I would regard failure by Camelot to comply with its licence requirement to use its best endeavours to comply with the Player Code of Practice with regard to the prohibition of sales to persons under 16 years of age and the taking of appropriate action also to point to the use of a financial penalty. I would, of course, need to consider any case that arose on its merits."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We are not saying that the director general will reveal none of his hand. He is consulting Camelot and potential future franchise bidders; they will know the ground rules. We want discretion to be left with the director general. That is why we oppose the amendments. The director general will always have to act reasonably, as I am sure he will.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Prior:</B> Amendment No. 21 would leave discretion with the director general. It would be at the discretion of the director general to determine whether the operator had rectified the breach of the licence or was on the way to do so. The amendment would not remove any discretion from the director general.
<P>
<B>Mr. Banks:</B> Let me deal specifically with that point in a moment. The reason why we do not believe that it is possible to devise a comprehensive tariff of fines for the lottery operator is because there are an enormous number of ways in which the operator may breach its licence. Most breaches have varying degrees of seriousness, and the director general may want to consider other factors such as whether there has been a repetition of a previous breach. That is why we resist the idea of a tariff; it is not a sensible proposal. As I said, there are so many different ways in which the franchise may be breached that it would be ridiculous for us to publish such a list.
<P>
Let us take the example of "Erskine May" concerning words that are inappropriate for use in the House of Commons. First, "Erskine May" is not quoted any more. We all know one or two words that we must not use [Hon. Members: "Socialism."] That is on our side, as a matter of fact. It would be nonsense to publish a list because language is always evolving. Because things move on, a published tariff against certain offences would be inappropriate. Breaches will vary from one case to another. To lock the director general and the commission into an inflexible tariff of offences would be inappropriate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> I rather wish that the Minister had continued with his earlier general observations on the state of the nation. This matter is important for the public perception of fairness. Let us consider the criminal justice system. If someone is before a magistrates court, there is guidance and a tariff. That is a well accepted principle, and it is only reasonable that it extends much more widely, so that people at least have a sense of bands of discretion it is not an absolute. That should give comfort to Camelot, or any other operator, as it would prevent the absurd situation in other parts of the criminal justice system where fines or court settlements have been absolutely inordinate and, therefore, undermining the criminal justice system.
<P>
<B>Mr. Banks:</B> I shall briefly explore that interesting point. We in the House have often had to complain about the lack of judges' and magistrates' discretion in imposing fines. A classic example is the Dangerous Dogs Act 1989. The public demanded action and many Members became involved. I opposed the legislation because I thought that it tied judges' hands far too tightly; they had no discretion. An element of discretion must be built into legislation, otherwise everything comes back to us.
<P>
I do not accept that the proposal is unfair, or that it would deter future operators from coming forward. The operator, and potential operators, will know of the fines and penalties. I assume that a precedent list would be built up and that any operator would know, given that it was previously fined for X offence, roughly what would happen if it were to commit the offence again. However, the director general or the commission would consider whether to bump up the fine if the offence were a repetition of an earlier one.
<P>
It is pretty obvious that the ground rules will emerge speedily, if such powers have to be used. There will also be the statement on the use of financial penalties, about which the director general and Camelot are consulting. In due course, a copy of that statement will be laid in the Library.
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> That is a fair point. There is a consultation process and it will be interesting to see what emerges from it. However, we are not talking about a regular pattern of fining; we are talking about exceptional circumstances. We hope that any lottery operator will maintain high standards, so it will not be necessary to impose fines regularly.
<P>
The Minister implies that there will be some sort of checklist, but we are not talking about that. We are talking about exceptional circumstances and bands of discretion to give comfort and public confidence. The Minister is not being realistic about what might emerge in the circumstances.
<P>
<B>Mr. Banks:</B> In answer to that point, I repeat the reasonable argument that it would be wrong and ludicrous to suggest that the director general would impose a fine if something were obviously, patently, manifestly beyond the control of the lottery operator. That point is so obvious that, frankly, it is hardly worth making. Clearly, if the director general were to act unreasonably, the operator could look to the courts to provide redress. Safeguards against acting unreasonably already exist. I simply cannot accept either what the hon. Gentleman suggests or the amendments.
<P>
The hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole seemed to suggest that the Government might try to impose enormous fines on Camelot. We would not impose enormous fines if, indeed, they were enormous; it would be for the director general to impose any fine. Those fines would not, as the hon. Gentleman seemed to suggest, mean a loss to the good causes because any revenue derived from a fining regime would go to the good causes. There is no question of that sum being lost to good causes.
<P>
On amendment No. 21, when a licence holder contravenes the terms of the licence, I hope that it will take corrective action itself and not require prompting from the director general. I know that the acting director general is mindful of the need to clarify, as far as possible, how he will approach the operation of financial penalties. I understand that when he decides whether to impose a penalty or decides on the level of any penalty, he intends to take into account the effectiveness and timeliness of any corrective action that the licensee has taken. I am sure that he will also take into account the extent to which the circumstances that gave rise to the breach were within or genuinely beyond the licensee's control. The director general will not be forced by the Bill to penalise; that option will be open to him when he considers it appropriate.
<P>
Amendment No. 21 would prevent the director general from imposing a fine if corrective action is being taken. That cannot be right. There may be occasions particularly if there has been an impact on income to the national lottery distribution fund when a fine is appropriate even though the operator is taking action to prevent a recurrence of the breach. Equally, there may be occasions when no penalty is appropriate. I do not think that it would be right to fetter the discretion of the director general. The amendment would reduce significantly the director general's powers to regulate effectively and, in appropriate cases, to use a financial penalty as a deterrent against future breaches of the licence.
<P>
As I wish to enshrine reasonably exercised discretion in the Bill, I ask Government Members to oppose the amendments if they are pressed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> I do not wish to detain the Committee, because I realise that this is an important day for the Minister and that he will wish to press the flesh or kiss whatever man, beast or fowl is available and subliminally, what bubbled up was a reference to the Dangerous Dogs Act. That was particularly interesting in view of the recent photograph of the Minister in a canine embrace. I wish him well as he proceeds through the streets of London during the course of the day.
<P>
I have an abiding image of the Minister walking through the streets of London in a three-cornered hat 
<P>
<B>Mr. Banks:</B> Walking?
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> A yard or two behind him will be walking a cat called either Ken or Glenda. Only history will tell. Anyway, I do not wish to detain him from carrying out his duties later today.
<P>
The amendments would improve the Bill. The Minister's essential fairness kept bubbling through; in a sense, he kept making the argument for us. He recognised that it is important for the Bill to operate fairly when it deals with matters such as fines and how successful the lottery operator is.
<P>
On amendment No. 22, we would be happy if regulation of the lottery were more comparable with the regulation of other bodies. It is only fair for the Bill to state specifically that the lottery operator will be offered protection in the event of something occurring outside its control. The Minister seemed to imply that such events would of course be taken into account, but it is not reasonable for the lottery to operate in an environment in which that fact is not specified. My hon. Friend the member for North Norfolk told us what happened when British Telecom's system failed. There could be an earthquake or a power failure, and it is only reasonable to protect the lottery operator by making reference to such circumstances in the Bill.
<P>
It is right to have a firm regulatory regime, but it is well known that our criminal justice system has a range of tariffs and that some discretion is available. We do not suggest that the sums involved should be absolute, but inordinate fines upset the public and it would give comfort to the lottery operator to know that such fines would not be imposed.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I am sorry that the Minister does not acknowledge that. Camelot has been more successful than any other lottery operator in the world because of the profit motive and the Minister has missed the point about that. A regulatory environment that eats into Camelot's profit potential may have the effect of making the operator more risk-averse.
<P>
<B>Mr. Banks:</B> To compare a regulatory regime with the criminal justice system is extreme. In its response to the White Paper, Camelot stated that it was confident that it
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"would continue to operate the lottery without serious breaches of"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
the licence and that it was
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"therefore comfortable with a fair regime of fines."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That takes us back to the question of how reasonably the director general would act. The hon. Member for West Suffolk seems to suggest that the director general would be wholly unreasonable in his application of the provision. I do not accept that.

<P>

<B>Mr. Spring:</B> I am sorry that the Minister is taking that harsh view. He has a sense of natural justice and knows that we are talking about the broad spectrum of regulation, and that the criminal justice system involves the same principles.
<P>
<B>The Minister for Arts (Mr. Mark Fisher):</B> Criminal justice?
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> The principles are the same a sense of fairness and an environment in which people or corporations can operate. Of course we want a fair regime; that is why we want to specify the parameters more clearly. I regret that the Minister does not accept the point.
<P>
Amendment No. 21 states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The Director General shall not impose a financial penalty if he is satisfied that the operator has agreed to take, and is taking, all such steps as it appears for the time being to be appropriate for the operator to take for the purpose of securing or facilitating rectification of the contravention in question."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It would allow a breathing space that could be used to rectify a breach of a licence before the financial penalties were imposed. As my noble Friend Lord Skidelsky said in another place he was backed up by Viscount Falkland there is the potential for an adversarial relationship between the regulator and the operator.
<P>
The amendments are perfectly reasonable and do not undermine the Government's view of how the national lottery should operate. I regret that the Minister has not said that he will consider them and come back on Report. Time and again he simply says no. Mature reflection on the amendments would have brought the Minister's natural sense of justice into play, and I am once again disappointed with his response today.

<P>

<B>Mr. Banks:</B> The aim of the amendments is to improve regulation of the national lottery to ensure that the public have full confidence in its operation. Regulation of the lottery is currently undertaken by a single individual, the director general, who is supported by staff from the Office of the National Lottery.
<P>
Clause 1 and schedule 1 reflected White Paper policy and would have established a panel to advise the director general on the selection of the national lottery operator. That would have brought collective expertise to the selection process, but the final decision would still have been taken by an individual the director general.
<P>
The amendments, however, go further to broaden and strengthen the regulatory structure. They abolish the office of the director general and remove the proposed advisory panel, and replace them with a National Lottery Commission, which will be a permanent collective body with responsibility for the selection of the operator and for on-going regulation. That will introduce a wider range of expertise and experience and so reduce the risk, actual or perceived, of conflicts of interest and regulatory capture.
<P>
The commission will have the same statutory functions and duties as the director general. Those include the new power to impose financial penalties on the operator for licence contraventions that is already contained in the Bill. The commission will have five members, who will be appointed by the Secretary of State.
<P>
We are determined to ensure that the lottery is given the most effective regulation possible to provide the objectivity, independence and transparency that the public rightly demand. When the Bill was introduced in another place it recognised the importance of widening the experience and expertise brought to bear on the selection of the lottery operator. It therefore made provision for an advisory panel to help the director general with that task.
<P>
However, we have re-examined that provision, and in the light of recent events we have concluded that we can do more to ensure that the public have confidence in the independence and objectivity of the regulator. In particular, a move away from a specific individual will help to remove possible criticisms that conflicts of interest, actual or perceived, threaten effective regulation.
<P>
The amendments therefore replace the post of director general and the advisory panel provided for in clause 1 and schedule 1 of the original Bill with a new National Lottery Commission. The commission will consist of five members to be appointed by the Secretary of State. It will be a permanent body that will take on the same statutory functions and duties as the director general. The role of its members will be to ensure that the lottery is run and promoted with all due propriety and that the interests of all players are protected. Subject to those duties, members will do their best to ensure the best possible return for the good causes.
<P>
The commission will be able to choose one of its members as a chair to run meetings and to act as a spokesperson for no more than a year at a time and no member will be reappointed immediately so that responsibility is rotated between its members. That will[Mr. Banks]
avoid focusing attention and influence undesirably on any one individual.
<P>
The new commission will have in its armoury the power to fine licence holders that is already contained within the Bill. That fills a gap that was highlighted by the Select Committee on Public Affairs. Any fines levied will go to the good causes rather than to the Treasury, and the power to fine will apply in respect of existing licences as well as future awards. The commission will be supported in its work by existing Oflot staff. The amendments will provide for their employment by the commission on the same terms and conditions as they currently hold, except that the commission will not be a Crown body and its employees will not therefore be civil servants. Nothing contained in my proposals should be taken to be a criticism of the acting director general or his staff, whose professionalism and commitment are not in question.
<P>
The key provisions are new clause 2, which creates a national lottery commission to replace the director general, and new schedule 1, which is in three parts. Part 1 deals with transfers from the director general to the commission, part 2 deals with the constitution of the commission and part 3 deals with consequential amendments to the 1993 Act and other miscellaneous legislation. Amendment No. 32 lists the repeals resulting from the creation of the commission. Amendments Nos. 28 to 30 would allow the Secretary of State to make an order to bring the commission into being. I believe that those provisions, taken together, will ensure that the lottery inspires full public confidence.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robert Maclennan </B>(Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross): I begin by welcoming this group of Government amendments. I speak as a member of the Public Accounts Committee, which produced a number of reports during the previous Parliament highlighting some of the regulatory shortcomings. The amendments, coupled with the Secretary of State's announcement within the past 24 hours about the opening up of regulatory activity to pursuance by the National Audit Office, deal with PAC members' concerns about regulation.
<P>
The proposal that there should be a commission in place of the director general is wholly welcome. I specifically made that suggestion to the Secretary of State on the Floor of the House, and I am delighted that he has shown flexibility and a readiness to take it up.
<P>
I shall speak briefly about amendments (q) and (r) to the new schedule. They are probing amendments rather than amendments that I should wish to put to the vote, and I view them as second best. That is because, as the Minister will know, I had hoped to put an alternative arrangement to the Committee. That would have provided for two commissions one with responsibility for the selection of the operator and another with responsibility for regulation. That would avoid the risk of regulatory capture to which the Minister referred. However, my preferred option is not possible within the ambit of the Bill, because the money resolution has been drafted so as to make funds available for one commission only.
<P>
My amendments are designed to focus the debate on the question of ensuring that once the commission has discharged its duty of selection, it will not be predisposed to give the operator the benefit of any doubt when exercising its quasi-judicial function of evaluating how the operator has carried out its tasks. The Public Accounts Committee noted that, on a number of occasions where there had been evidence of rather doubtful practices, Camelot had not suffered financially as a result of the Committee's attention being drawn to those practices. It is especially satisfactory that the Government propose that fines should go to the good causes, not to the Treasury. However, I hope that there will be no occasion for fines no one wants that. Fines should be a disincentive from straying from the narrow path of righteousness.
<P>
The proposal to set up sub-committees in amendments (r) and (q) to proposed new schedule 1 is admittedly a device. I am bound to say that in the light of the provision for a panel to give such advice, the amendments are perhaps not the best way to crack the problem of regulatory capture. I have a lingering concern that the functions of selection and regulation should be separate, but the Secretary of State undertook to give that issue further consideration during the Bill's passage. I am grateful for that undertaking and I have no doubt that he will continue to think about the matter.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Broadly, I welcome the proposed change, which will remove the risk of one individual being too heavily burdened by the need to have links with the operator objectively to appraise what the operator is doing. I must say that I do not think that the first director general was very skilful in his conduct. Considerable errors were made, but that is water over the mill. Thre is no point rehearsing the episodes that gave rise to public criticism. The Bill will avoid such events in future and for that reason, and because I want the lottery to be above such suspicion, I welcome the Government's proposals.
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> We certainly have no objection in principle to the Government's proposals. We have always made it clear that regulation of the lottery must be sensitively handled and that we would be happy to reconsider it from time to time as the lottery evolved. I was comforted by the fact that the Minister reminded us that the former director general had done nothing improper, despite the way in which he lost his job. The acting director general found Camelot to be a fit and proper organisation to run the lottery. Having said that, we have no objections to the clause in principle, other than that it is designed to solve a problem that may or may not exist.
<P>
The idea of replacing the director general with a five-person lottery commission is probably a good move in the circumstances, but perhaps for an entirely different reason from that which the Government have advanced. The Secretary of State has engaged in some extraordinary publicity seeking. He publicised the bonuses of Camelot's directors in a manner that was deeply embarrassing to the Government and other members of the Cabinet and brought him into disrepute. Together with his handling of the issue of the director general, that shows his capacity to seek headlines in an unhelpful and inappropriate way.
<P>
I think that the right hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross (Mr. Maclennan) was trying to point out that regulation of the lottery is an enormous burden for one individual. In the complicated circumstances of the lottery and given the lottery's national importance, it is appropriate for regulation to be carried out by a commission.
<P>
I agree with the Minister on the matter of confidence. The real determinant of confidence is the public's willingness to buy tickets. No matter that controversy arises from time to time, the sale of tickets has continued admirably. Even in moments of extreme controversy the public do not seem to mind. However, although the market place is the ultimate determinant of confidence in the lottery, it is appropriate that the Government should consider public confidence in a broader context. That, of course, includes the matter of regulation.
<P>
Amendment (r), tabled by the right hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross (Mr. Maclennan), would separate the selection of the operator and the role of the regulator. The point made by the right hon. Gentleman is valid: it is a logicial extension of how such matters should be handled. In principle, we are happy to accept that.
<P>
It is important from every point of view that public confidence should be maintained. If, as will undoubtedly happen, controversy should surround some aspect of the operation of the lottery, the fact that the commission will be composed of people suitably chosen for the task will undoubtedly give comfort to the public. It will reassure those especially interested in such matters most notably Members of Parliament and the Cabinet that as much as possible is being done to protect the lottery, because the lottery is a national institution. The fact that it contributes so much to our national life, particularly those areas that are under-resourced, is to be cherished. We must ensure that it continues to operate successfully.

<P>

<B>Mr. Green:</B> I shall divide my remarks into three parts. First, I shall speak specifically to amendment (s). Next, I shall speak to amendments (q) and (r), tabled by the right hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross. Finally, I shall ask the Minister to explain some of the points made in the Government's proposals.
<P>
I hope that the Government will look more favourably on amendment (s) than they did on previous Opposition amendments, and treat it as a drafting amendment. Its purpose is slightly opaque, but it seeks to add the powers given under proposed section 10A, should it be necessary for the commission to give any person affected by a commission decision
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"a written statement of their reasons for any decisions which they may make in the exercise of their functions".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Government propose that anything under "sections 5 to 10" of the 1993 Act should be included. We seek not to delete that provision but to add to the list "section 10A", which provides that if the director general is satisfied that a person has contravened a condition in the licence under sections 5 or 6, he may impose a financial penalty on that person in respect of the contravention. The amendment seeks to extend the requirement for the commission to give to the person affected a written statement of the commission's reasons for any decisions that it makes including the imposition of financial penalties for the breach of the licence conditions.
<P>
In practice, it would mean that in addition to providing a written statement of reasons under sections 5 to 10, as proposed by the Government, which include the licensing of an operator, the licensing of bodies to promote the lottery, variations of licence conditions, the enforcement of those conditions, or, in the end, the revocation of the licence obviously, the most dramatic and extreme power that the commission has the commission will also have to give the reasons for the powers that it has under proposed section 10A. That provision allows the commission to fine the operator for breaching the licence conditions, which is another extreme and dramatic power.
<P>
The Minister will recognise that the amendment would increase the openness and transparency with which the new commission will operate. It will extend its duty to give written reasons for anything that it intends to do within the field of regulatory control. To that extent, the proposal is a drafting amendment and I hope that the Minister will recognise that it would improve not only the Bill, but long-term confidence in the new commission.
<P>
As my hon. Friend the Member for West Suffolk (Mr. Spring) said, Opposition Members do not object to the principle of moving from one director general to a commission. However, if we are to change the entire structure of the regulatory body that will control the national lottery and the operator, it is important that the new body should be seen to have been visibly improved. It is not necessarily obvious that a commission will be more competent or more decisive than an individual or less prone to gaffs. Clearly, one of the more controversial and probably mistaken decisions of the previous director general was to accept flights in a GTech plane.
<P>
It is not necessary, a priori, that any one of the five commissioners may not make a similar error of judgment. It could be argued that, the more people there are, the more possibility there is for one of them to make a mistake. The Government are changing from one director general to a wider commission, so it is important that it is instructed to behave openly transparently. One suspicion that will clearly affect any lottery operator who is operating under a new regulatory regime is that there will be some inconsistency, especially when the new system beds down. It is conceivable that, in 2001, we shall have a new operator and a relatively new regulatory regime. If we are in the business of ensuring that confidence in the lottery is maintained and that the money keeps rolling in, the operator must know that the new regulator the new commission will be operating under fairly tight guidelines and will not be able to spring unpleasant surprises on the operator. The amendment would reduce the potential for that to happen.
<P>
The amendment would have wider implications for transparency and openness in government to which the Government have committed themselves. There are[Mr. Green] already provisions under paragraph 9 of new schedule 1 about openness. The amendment would widen those powers. I accept that there is a duty under the proposed section 10A(10) to serve a notice on the operator giving the reasons for the decision to impose a financial penalty. We do not want to restrict that duty merely to the service of that notice on the operator, but to extend that power so that all the parties involved are notified of any important regulatory decisions that the commission takes. That would indicate that the Government are genuinely interested in the degree of openness with which the commission will operate.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
Having set up a new regulatory regime and having had the chance to learn from the four years of Oflot's operation, it would be bad news for everyone if the commission ran into trouble during its early years. That would be seriously damaging to the lottery's future. Such problems can be guarded against if all involved with the lottery, not merely the operator, are made aware that the commission is required to give in writing reasons for any decision that it takes. Such a requirement would also affect the way in which the commission conducts itself, because it would be slightly more vulnerable to judicial review and to other forms of legal challenge. I hope that the Government can therefore accept the amendment.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross expressed uncertainty that the new method of appointing the commission would prove ideal, or that it would lead to any improvement in regulation. I share those doubts; however, the amendments tabled in his name do not address them. Amendment (q) proposes that the commission should have not five but
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"ten members, at least five of whom shall be women".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is not obvious that the setting of gender quotas would in principle improve the commission's powers to regulate. The question of quotas is less important than that of the honesty, competence and good character of the commission's members.
<P>
Why has the hon. Gentleman stopped at gender quotas? Geographic, racial or political quotas are equally relevant to a body that regulates a national institution. People of all types, classes, colours and creeds play the national lottery, so a balance needs to be struck. A gender quota is a purely arbitrary selection. The applying of quotas of any kind to a regulatory commission is bizarre and unhelpful. If the Government go down that route, they should consider quotas rather more scientifically.
<P>
Much of the debate during this Committee and on Second Reading has concerned problems associated with the geographic distribution of the lottery. Geographic quotas are therefore of greater relevance to the commission than gender quotas and would increase confidence in its work. What decision on the regulation of a national lottery would a woman reach that a man would not? It will not be a public body and it will not be required to perform in the public domain. Therefore, it will not be able to demonstrate that women can perform the task of regulation as well as men. Of course, they can.
<P>
Amendment (q) is at best pointless and at worst damaging. Will the Minister tell us whether any quotas will apply and what he thinks about the one suggested by the amendment? Can he compare it to any other type of quota that may be applied?
<P>
I also wish to consider the Government's reasons for the change of approach. The Minister said that the existing system has had problems we all acknowledge that and that he thinks that a commission will do better. Why have the Government not tackled the one valid complaint made against Oflot's operations, which is that the same person makes appointments and then acts as regulator? The prima facie argument is based on the fact that someone invests a certain amount of personal prestige in the operator that he has appointed. Tough regulation and exposing the operator's faults will, therefore, become more difficult.
<P>
A regulator will be less inclined to impose a big fine or remove the licence if that regulator made the original appointment. That is one of the few valid criticisms made of Oflot and it is not clear how such problems will be avoided in future. What will be done about them?
<P>
The right hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross asked about the problems of regulatory capture. He asked whether a commission would be any better at dealing with them than the director general of Oflot. Setting up a regulatory structure is difficult for any Government and easy solutions will not be forthcoming from a Committee such as this. The Government are investing a huge amount of their own prestige in setting up the commission. Therefore, it will be interesting to hear why they think that the commission will be less subject to regulatory capture and less likely to build up too close a relationship with the lottery operator than a single director general.
<P>
Whatever the Government's criticisms of the former director general, I am sure that they will acknowledge that a different director general might have behaved differently. If that had been so, the problems that emerged would not have done so. Different regulators across the range of the utilities perform in different ways. To put it candidly, some are better than others. The same will be so of commissions. The Government apparently intend to apply the commission structure to regulate the range of utilities, but there will still be variations in competence between the various regulatory bodies.
<P>
Amendment (s) is a drafting amendment with a serious purpose. It would increase the degree of openness and transparency with which the commission will be seen to operate. That is important if the commission is to get off to a good and self-confident start. The amendment would draw a line and regulation would take place differently. It will be good for the lottery if regulation ceases to be a controversial matter. People will concentrate on what the lottery is for and public confidence will be maintained at the high level of the past four years. I am sure that that prospect unites rather than divides the Committee.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. David Prior </B>(North Norfolk): I wish to speak to amendment (t). Paragraph (9) of proposed schedule 2A to the 1993 Act is headed, "Duty to give reasons for decisions", and paragraph 9(1) requires the commission
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"to give to any person affected a written statement of their reasons for any decisions which they make in the exercise of their functions",<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
concerning the appointment of a lottery operator and the regulation of the lottery. Conservative Members approve of that and of paragraph 9(2), which requires the commission to publish the reasons for its decisions. Those requirements are consistent with the Minister's aim, stated when he moved the amendment, of achieving objectivity, independence and transparency. He talked about removing the appearance of conflicts of interest and I agree that justice must be seen to be done if the public are to have confidence in the lottery.
<P>
Newspaper reports today tell us that the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport has said that he is determined to make
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the financial arrangements governing the lottery as transparent as possible".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
All hon. Members agree that transparency is essential, so paragraph 9(3) is rather a shock. It appears to undermine paragraphs 9(1) and 9(2) by obviating the need to give reasons for a decision in two circumstances first, in paragraph 9(3)(a), when there is
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"a restriction imposed by or under any other enactment",<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and, secondly, in paragraph 9(3)(b), when there is "an obligation of confidence".
<P>
I hope that the Minister will give the Committee some examples of what is meant in paragraph 9(3)(a) by
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"a restriction imposed by or under any other enactment".
<P>
What "other enactments" does he have in mind? Is it the legislation covering official secrets? What specific enactments does he think might make it difficult for the commission to reveal the reasons for its decisions? There must be a proper justification for that provision, as the commission must not be allowed to get away with not publishing the necessary information.
<P>
At least paragraph 9(3)(a) is fairly specific. More worrying is paragraph 9(3)(b), which involves merely "an obligation of confidence". What does that mean? If an applicant for the new licence headed its application "In confidence" or "Personal and confidential", would that be covered by paragraph 9(3)(b)? A broad reading of the provision would allow the commission to shelter behind it in almost any circumstance.
<P>
I hope that the Minister will offer some assurance that that will not happen, or that he will explain what limitations circumscribe the phrase "obligation of confidence". For example, Richard Branson recently made some allegations against GTech. Would such allegations be made public by the commission, or would they be regarded as having been given in confidence?
<P>
A second example might involve an unsuccessful bidder for the lottery. If that bidder made allegations in private to the regulator that led to a decision to revoke the operating licence, it would seem to be against the principles of natural justice not to test those allegations in public. The accused should be given the opportunity to respond to them. I hope that the Minister will accept the amendment in the proper spirit. We want transparency and more openness because we want the public to have confidence in the lottery. We do not want secret decisions made in smoke-filled rooms by people who think that they know best. It is much better for everyone that decisions should be fair, out in the open and properly discussed.
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Banks:</B> First, I can tell the hon. Member for West Suffolk that the smiling, convivial mask that he wears slips sometimes and the true, snarling face emerges of a class warrior who loathes the people's party that occupies the Government Benches. That happened a moment ago when he made a quite unprincipled attack on my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State. As to the resignation of the previous director general he was not sacked, he resigned.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> Look me in the eye and say that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Banks:</B> It is not a pleasant prospect, but I shall do so for the sake of sincerity. A set of circumstances existed that was undermining public confidence in the lottery. The previous director general knew that. He also knew that to restore and preserve public confidence it was necessary for him to go, and go he did. He was an honourable man.
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> I am very hurt that, after all the convivial weeks that we have spent, I should be accused of having a mask that has slipped to reveal some sort of class warrior. I assure the Minister that that is far from the truth.
<P>
The Secretary of State said that he had no personal criticism of the director general. The impression was given that some magical invisible hand had led to the resignation or was it spontaneous combustion? Yet, if that resignation happened as a result of criticisms of the director general, it does not accord with what the Secretary of State said, both at the time and subsequently. I do not wish to make a meal of the matter, but to clarify that there was no personal criticism of the director general by the Secretary of State.
<P>
<B>Mr. Banks:</B> That is absolutely so. There was no personal criticism of Peter Davis. That may seem strange to Conservative Members. Ministers in the previous Conservative Government were constantly caught out the previous Home Secretary was in and out of the courts like a recidivist. They always said, "It's someone else's fault, the buck doesn't stop here, it wasn't me, guv, honest." They knew nothing of honour as it applies to principle and resignation. That is why I commend Peter Davis for his action. Honourable men met together in a room and concluded that it was in the interests of public confidence in the lottery that only one of them should emerge with his job. That man was the Secretary of State, not the director general. No personal criticism of the director general was made.
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> I shall make this little forecast for the Minister: the longevity of the Secretary of State will not be very great.
<P>
<B>Mr. Banks:</B> That is nonsense. The Secretary of State is doing a wonderful job. He has shown great discernment in leaving the duff matters to us two me and my hon. Friend the Minister for Arts. He goes to the[Mr. Banks]
Silk Cut challenge cup rugby league final and watches Arsenal play Everton, while I go to a duff match at Southampton, but that is the way it goes. As my hon. Friend says, we are ministerial scum.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I am delighted that the Minister has raised that matter. When I watched the Secretary of State award the cup at the rugby league final I thought that I detected the whiff of hypocrisy, given the Government's attitude towards tobacco sponsorship.
<P>
<B>Mr. Banks rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Hon. Members should not labour that point, but instead get back to the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Banks:</B> Thank you, Mr. Benton. It seems that the Secretary of State knows a good match, but the Minister for Sport does not.
<P>
I am grateful for the welcome given to the Government amendments by the right hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross. Members of the Government are listeners, and I would describe ourselves as the listening banks. We always say yes when the amendments are reasonable and necessary. However, we think that the amendment (r), which was tabled by the right hon. Gentleman, is not necessary.
<P>
We carefully considered separating the functions of selecting and regulating the operator, but concluded that there are several important reasons why it is not sensible to separate the two functions. First, and most important, knowledge and expertise gained during the selection and licensing process are important to the regulatory function. Similarly, the experience of regulation makes a valuable contribution to the next selection process. A number of other regulatory bodies are responsible for both functions. In my Department, there is the Independent Television Commission and the Radio Authority, and in the wider gaming sector there is the Gaming Board. They are all collective bodies that are responsible for granting licences and for on-going regulation.
<P>
Secondly, one of our key concerns in reforming the lottery has been to ensure that decisions are taken transparently with clear lines of accountability, so that the public understand and have faith in the way it is regulated. With the system suggested by the amendment, it would not be clear which body had taken any one decision. Would the commission as a whole be accountable, or only the particular committee involved? Thirdly, the establishment of two separate committees within one extremely large commission would be confusing and expensive. It would create unnecessary bureaucracy.
<P>
I believe that the potential for conflict of interest can be tackled more effectively and efficiently by creating a permanent collective body, such as the lottery commission, that will take decisions openly and transparently and will remain permanently accountable for them.
<P>
Amendment (q) is unnecessary because the Equal Opportunities Commission advised that recruitment should be made on merit and based on equal opportunities for all candidates and not on positive discrimination. The Government are firmly committed to attracting high quality candidates of both sexes, and therefore advertise jobs as widely as possible in order to achieve that aim. Appointments to the commission will be made purely on the basis of merit and equality of opportunity.
<P>
Amendment (s), which was tabled by the hon. Members for West Suffolk and for Ashford (Mr. Green), is well intentioned but misguided. It would require the commission to give reasons for its decision to impose a financial penalty on the person affected as well as for its decisions to grant or revoke a licence and for its other functions. We could not agree more with that intention. That is why the Bill already contains that requirement in proposed new section 10A(3)(e) and (10)(c) of the 1993 Act under clause 2, which deal with fining. That is why there is no explicit reference to the provision in paragraph 9(1) of proposed new schedule 2A to the 1993 Act.
<P>
The point about notifying the wider public about the reasons why a penalty has been imposed is covered by paragraph 9(2)(c) of that proposed now schedule. I have said that the amendment is reasonable, but explained why it is highly unnecessary. I hope that the Opposition will withdraw it.
<P>
The hon. Member for North Norfolk referred to amendment (t). It is important to qualify the duty of the commission to give reasons in the fairly limited way set out in paragraph 9 of proposed new schedule 2A. That does not mean that the commission will be able to use commercial confidentiality as an excuse for not giving reasons. The general expectation is that it will give reasons for all decisions except where that will mean breaching another law or an obligation of confidence. That does not mean that information can be completely withheld; instead, it will be disclosed in a partial form with any necessary deletions.
<P>
The hon. Member for North Norfolk described an extreme case in which allegations were made by one operator against another and criticisms were voiced from outside. The example was so extreme that it is unlikely to carry weight and an issue of substance will emerge into the public arena anyway. It would be nonsense for the commission to listen to only one side of an argument and act on an allegation or a rumour without explaining its reasons or first examining the basis of such an allegation. The hon. Gentleman specifically mentioned Mr. Branson. I have a great deal of time for Mr. Branson, and I cannot believe that anything that Mr. Branson said about an operator or anyone connected with the lottery would remain private, so the hon. Gentleman chose a very bad example.
<P>
There is no intention to cover up or to hide information. This Government are the open Government; we are introducing a freedom of information Bill [Hon. Members: "When?"] Shortly, I trust. It is therefore nonsense to suggest that we are trying to cover things up. We have tried to make the process as transparent as possible. The commission will provide the safeguards and transparency that all members of the Committee want.
<P>
Our approach to the release of information is in line with general Government policy, and with the planned freedom of information Act, which I understand that the Opposition have already welcomed. The White Paper includes both "commercial confidentiality" and "information supplied in confidence" as specified interests where the scope for disclosure will need to be carefully examined and put to the "substantial harm" test. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Relations between public authorities and the private sector need to rest on two-way openness and trust. There will of course be information like trade secrets, sensitive intellectual property or data which could affect share prices where disclosure would substantially harm the commercial interests of suppliers and contractors."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Those are the sorts of safeguards that we are considering.
<P>
If we accepted amendment (t), the commission would be required to disclose all information that it was given by bidders. We do not consider that sensible, and under the circumstances I ask the right hon. Gentleman not to press the amendment. If he does not, we will have to oppose it.

<B>Mr. Maclennan:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for his remarks, and I shall not press my amendment to a Division.
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> I listened carefully to what the Minister had to say, and I must say that I am disappointed by his response. It is becoming characteristic of both Ministers that they reject any sensible, moderate amendment that we propose. I have never sat in a Standing Committee where amendments have been so summarily rejected with not even the courtesy of a suggestion that they may be further considered and returned to on Report. That having been said, we accept the Government amendments in principle. The Minister for Sport has not convinced us that the principles underlying our amendments have been covered elsewhere.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
Brought up, and read the First time.
<P>
Motion made, and Question proposed, That the clause be read a Second time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclennan:</B> I am grateful that the Government are moving in this direction. The new clause is extremely important not only in itself, but in respect of the wider principle, which has long been espoused by the Public Accounts Committee, that it should be possible for the National Audit Office to follow public money wherever it goes. We could argue about whether money that goes to Camelot can properly be described as public money, but I do not doubt that the money derived from the public as a result of the creation of a national monopoly rather than a lottery should be so described.
<P>
The new clause has a practical consequence with regard to the effectiveness of the scrutiny by Parliament of the operation of the lottery. In 1996, when the Public Accounts Committee considered the report about the National Audit Office's payments to the national lottery distribution fund, we found that the NAO's work had been severely limited by its lack of access to Camelot's records. It was unable to express an opinion about whether the amounts paid to the good causes fund were correct.
<P>
The chairman of the Public Accounts Committee said yesterday that that weakness in accountability was compounded by the fact that the National Audit Office found that Oflot the regulator had failed to carry out 11 of the 21 compliance programmes designed to check that the licence conditions were complied with. That is unacceptable. That was the unanimous view of the Public Accounts Committee. This is an important step forward for the national lottery and for Parliament's general oversight of its workings.
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> I do not wish to detain the Committee, because the right hon. Gentleman has covered all the points. I understand the object of the exercise. The National Audit Office has been unable to verify that all the conditions have been met perhaps the Minister will confirm that. The right hon. Gentleman alluded to the fact that, in 1996, it was shown that 11 of the 21 conditions had not been carried out. The reason for seeking to have the inquiry was to establish that all the conditions had been carried out.
<P>
We do not object to the proposal in principle, because the lottery's conduct, and the public's perception of it, should be of the highest order in accordance with the lottery's popularity and the esteem in which the public hold it. However, I would like to understand the mechanism. The press seemed to be somewhat confused about it this morning. What is the National Audit Office's procedure? Does it approach the Secretary of State, seeking his clearance to undertake the investigation? It is important to understand the Government's role.
<P>
The fact that Camelot has done a good job in difficult circumstances is acknowledged all over the world. That is why so many lotteries in other countries are consulting Camelot. I hope that no difficulties will arise on investigation. Of course, if they did, we would be the first to support the fact that they have come to light. If the Minister assures us about that, we would have no objection in principle.

<P>

<B>Mr. Banks:</B> I thank the right hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross and the hon. Member for West Suffolk for their contributions to the debate.
<P>
New clause 3 will add to section 33(3) of the National Lottery etc. Act 1993. It will allow the Comptroller and Audit General access to the lottery operator's records for the narrow purposes of auditing the national lottery distribution fund. The hon. Gentleman asked how that would be activated. The comptroller will approach Camelot after taking account of Oflot's work. There is no role for the Secretary of State whatsoever, as one would expect, in the independent actions of the CAG.
<P>
The new clause will meet the concerns raised by the Public Accounts Committee in its 20th report in 1996-97. The Government accepted that necessary access, sufficient to complete the audit of the national lottery distribution fund, was appropriate in their response to the PAC in July 1997. The new clause will, therefore, give effect to the PAC recommendation, while not setting any general precedent on the CAG's access to private bodies within regulated sectors.
<P>
The change is being introduced now, after careful consideration between other Departments and the NAO. Because of the need for wide consultation, it was not possible to introduce the new clause earlier. I apologise to members of the Committee for that, although I trust that they have had time to study the explanatory note that I issued on Wednesday 6 May and will understand the reasons. The new clause has the director general's support and the NAO is pleased with it, as is the PAC.
<P>
The new clause will allow the CAG to examine documents held by the section 5 licence holder and require written and oral explanations of it in carrying out his functions of examining, certifying and reporting on the accounts of the national lottery distribution fund.
<P>
The CAG's work will be complementary to the regulatory work currently conducted by the Director General of the National Lottery. In drafting the new clause, we were mindful that the extra compliance costs it creates should be modest. Therefore, it ensures that the CAG has a duty to take into account the work undertaken by the director general and the documents available to him through Oflot.
<P>
The access right to the operator will apply only to a financial audit. The change will not allow the CAG to conduct value-for-money scrutinies of the operator or set a wider precedent. That level of CAG access is consistent with that provided in various situations where it is necessary to audit accounts for which a public body is responsible.
<P>
I am confident that the change will reinforce transparency in the audit of the national lottery distribution fund, add to public confidence in the lotteryand ensure greater parliamentary accountability for the sums due to the good causes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for making that apology. I am sure that he would be the first to recognise that it is not satisfactory that this important proposal was announced in a written answer. I am comforted by the fact that he indicated that no precedent would be set. That is absolutely crucial. I hope that, on Report, that point will be fleshed out because this cannot become a precedent for the future.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
