<B>Mr. Ian Bruce </B>(South Dorset): I beg to move amendment No. 65, in page 1, line 9, leave out `Gas and Electricity' and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`Energy'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss the following amendments:

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`Energy Intervention'.<P>

<P>
No. 68, in page 1, line 10, leave out `Markets' and insert

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I remind the Committee that I have made several statements about my interests in electricity, telecommunications and so on. I wish to make it clear that this group of amendments and others are mine alone: I thought them up on my own, and did not table them on anyone's behalf. Indeed, I have no registrable interest in the strict sense that pertains to the Register of Members' Interests.
<P>
Committee Members may find it strange that my amendments attempt to widen the scope of the Bill. However, they are probing amendments, designed to get to grips with what the Government intend to do with so much regulation. I shall remind members of the Committee of the reason for regulation in such fields.
<P>
I have a long-standing interest in energy matters. Indeed, when the Conservative Government set about privatising the energy industry, I was especially interested in how that was going to happen. Colleagues who have been in Parliament a while will remember Sir Walter Marshall, a former chairman of the Central Electricity Generating Board, telling the then Government and, indeed, every Member of Parliament whom he could get hold of, that it was impossible to privatise the electricity industry and break it up at the same time. He said that the CEGB was a natural monopoly and would need to be privatised as a single entity because having lots of different bits competing against one another would be unachievable. The Conservative Government disagreed with that, as we wanted a market mechanism allowing prices to be driven down. We therefore decided to privatise the industry by breaking it into constituent parts—the original intention was to split it in two—to create competitive businesses and encourage others to come in.
<P>
Sir Walter disagreed and resigned as chairman of the CEGB. Privatisation was not easy, as people could not envisage how the industry would be broken up. Special problems arose in relation to the nuclear part of the industry, which no one wanted to buy and which was regarded by the City as a total liability with no benefits. The City wanted the Government to give away the whole electricity industry, along with a few extra millions or billions to get it off their hands. That was extraordinary, especially as we now know how valuable the electricity industry was.
<P>
When John Wakeham decided not: proceed with the privatisation of the nuclear industry on becoming Secretary of State for Energy, I wanted to find out why. I remember standing in the Lobby behind Baroness Thatcher, who had just arrived back from an overseas visit and was rather worried that, in rushing to fix everything, the new Secretary of State was taking the nuclear industry out of the privatisation. However, that was necessary to launch the other part of the strategy.
<P>
Mr. Hood, you have been patient with me. However, I was putting into context what I want to say about the energy industry. That industry needed little regulation when it was nationalised. The then Government knew best. If consumers thought electricity was too expensive, a Minister would get up in Parliament and say that electricity prices would be put up by only half the rate of inflation or whatever. It was almost in the gift of Ministers to decide. Of course, markets are not run in that way.
<P>
Members on both sides of the House now accept that allowing private enterprise to operate in the energy market creates benefits for everyone. Not least of the benefits is the fact that the Exchequer no longer has to subsidise the energy industry; the taxes paid by shareholders in privatised industries alone represent a massive amount of money for the Treasury. Hon. Members can see that our aim is to make those markets work better. The White Paper ``Modem markets: confident consumers'', published in July, states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The Government will look first for opportunities to make markets work, including through better information and self-regulation . . . Open and competitive markets are the best guarantee of a good deal for consumers.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I tabled the amendments to tease out from the Government the reason why we have such a massive Bill, in which the Government appear to be saying, ``We have launched the electricity and gas industries on to the marketplace. We have had great difficulty, and need to regulate quite tightly to make sure that those markets work.'' Now that the markets are starting to work and people can decide who will supply electricity down the one available wire to their house, or gas through the one available pipeline, the Government are saying, ``Privatisation was a terrible thing. The safeguards for the consumer were insufficient. Let's set up an authority to regulate the electricity and gas industries''.
<P>
The Government are also saying that there should be a statutory level of consumer support in the system, despite the fact that we have experienced the awkward transition from a nationalised industry that was virtually unregulated—Ministers were left to decide what was in the public interest—to regulation that was supposed to work for the public good in what is almost a free market. One might argue that the aim should now be to get rid of regulation, yet the Government are saying that on those particular items—electricity and gas—there must be more regulation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick Gibb </B>(Bognor Regis and Littlehampton): I am enjoying my hon. Friend's well informed introduction to the amendment. However, he has omitted the fact that, during the privatisation period, the experts, the Labour Opposition and the City of London all underestimated how much more efficient those industries would be in the private sector; that is one of the reasons why the industries were then criticised for rewarding their shareholders excessively or for making excessive bonus payments. Everyone involved in structuring those industries after privatisation underestimated the effects of privatisation and competition.
<P>
The Bill will roll the process back, if not towards full nationalisation, then certainly several steps in that direction, and will create several layers of Government intervention that could add costs and burdens to those businesses. That in turn would put the consumer at a disadvantage. That is against the whole premise of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> My hon. Friend has not shot my fox; I was trying to hide it. My fox is, of course, the fact that the Bill was introduced because the Labour party, many of whose members still believe it to be a socialist party, still goes back to the belief—[Interruption.] The Minister for Competition and Consumer Affairs is going to leap to his feet and say, ``It is a socialist party!''
<P>
<B>The Minister for Competition and Consumer Affairs (Dr. Kim Howells):</B> I remember being severely castigated for saying that it was time to bury socialism—but never mind about that.
<P>
In all the time that I have known him, the hon. Gentleman has shown tremendous interest in energy matters, but does he agree that when the industry was privatised, the bulk of electricity generation in this country came from two sources: a huge tranche of coal-fired power stations and a large tranche of atomic power stations? The world has changed dramatically, as he knows. A big tranche of new generating capacity comes from the gas sector. I hope that the Conservative party does not become proprietorial about the form of privatisation that took place, because things change dramatically and we must change regulation to keep up with them; otherwise it becomes redundant. If that is his point, I agree with him. However, we must be sensible about adapting regulation to meet current market demands.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I hope that interventions will be shorter than that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> The whole thrust of my remarks is not that the Government should avoid reconsidering how we privatised and regulated the original market—far from it. Now that the market is working so much better, the Government should be considering what to do about regulation. The Government are over-regulating, and going in the wrong direction.
<P>
I deliberately tabled amendment No. 65, which suggests that the name of the authority should not limit its remit to electricity and gas, to make the point that if it is right to have all that regulation of only two forms of energy, it must be right to extend it across all forms of energy. When a Minister eventually responds to my argument and says that we must not extend regulation, he or she will really be making the case that we should not be over-regulating electricity and gas.
<P>
I heat my home by oil. Ministers are not suggesting that the delivery of oil to people's homes should be regulated. However, I contend that now that we have the great benefit—or disbenefit—of the Human Rights Act 1998, consumers who must heat their homes by oil and who find that they are not receiving the so-called benefits that will come from electricity and gas regulation, may read section 6 of that Act, which says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``It is unlawful for a public authority to act in a way which is incompatible with a Convention right.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Many of the further regulations deal with disadvantaged customers, and people will be able to take the authorities to court if they feel that they have been treated unfairly.
<P>
The Bill will grant disabled or elderly people, and those on a limited income, rights for a public authority to intervene, supposedly to improve their situation. If those people use heating oil, they may say, ``Ah, I'm being unfairly disadvantaged'', because the Government have set up that mechanism only for certain types of delivery. Ministers and colleagues may ask why home delivery should be regulated, and why it should be treated the same as gas and electricity under the regulations in the Bill.
<P>
We have a tank at the back of our house, with access via a narrow driveway, so which company I can buy oil from depends on the size of the tanker available. The size of my tank and the size of my wallet enable me to purchase a large amount of oil at any one time; I can also purchase it in the middle of summer in the cheapest place and ensure that I get the best deal possible. An elderly or disabled person, or someone on a limited income, could not do that. Much depends on the distance from the depot and the refinery. There is no universality in the price that one pays for fuel; it is negotiable.
<P>
My wife tells me to ring the oil company because I always get our oil a couple of pence per litre cheaper by ringing around and negotiating. I should not say this, because the supplier in question will read it in Hansard, but there is only one company with a tanker that is small enough to get up our driveway, so I ring it first to ask the price, then I ring around all the companies, which all quote me cheaper prices. Finally, I go back to the first company and negotiate a reduction. 
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Whether there is value-added tax on fuel depends on the volume that one takes and whether any industrial or commercial activity is involved. The length of the hose on the tanker is another important factor. As to quality, I must rely on the quality that is achieved by the free market with all the other relevant regulations, whereas the quality of what is being delivered by the other companies will be regulated by this legislation. As I understand it, the Bill will not prescribe that equipment should be maintained at special prices for elderly people if they use oil. It may also exclude people who have to rely on bottled gas or those who have to buy timber from the Forestry Commission to heat their homes. As the Minister for Competition and Consumer Affairs reminds me, even coal is available in some areas. If all those sources of energy are to be treated differently from electricity and gas in the marketplace, I believe that the Government will be vulnerable to a challenge by consumers claiming unfair treatment by a public body because they are not getting the benefits of the provisions in the Bill.
<P>
If one is going to regulate, one should do so very lightly across the whole energy market; we should not single out certain forms of energy. That is the substance of my amendment, and I will be interested to hear the Government explain the logic behind the decision to regulate some energy forms and not others. The important point is that the only items to be regulated are those goods and services that were previously provided by a nationalised industry. It seems extraordinary that we should have two sets of consumer regulation, one for the privatised industries and another for the others. The Minister for Energy and Competitiveness in Europe has talked about coal, but that has always been sold and delivered to individual householders by private companies.

<P>

<B>Mr. Brian White </B>(Milton Conies, North-East): I am interested in the hon. Gentleman's argument, because he makes a powerful case for regulation; I am almost tempted to agree with him. However, although he has often argued in the context of telecommunications that there should be no regulation of the mobile phone industry, apparently we needed to regulate BT to reduce its share of the market—regulation was required only because it was an ex-state monopoly. That seems to contradict the argument that he is using now.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> The hon. Gentleman is right to point out that the reason a Conservative Government prescribed stronger regulation in those areas was that they were monopolies that had to be transferred into the sphere of market economics. If a market is already working and one can purchase from different suppliers, one has already created a normal marketplace, which does not need such close regulation. I am not arguing that because regulation already exists, there should not be a Bill. I am arguing that any regulation should apply to all the energy sources, and that there should be equity among them. There should not be a special set of rules for companies and shareholders that own former nationalised assets and another for shareholders and companies running assets in the energy sector that had not previously been nationalised.
<P>
<B>The Minister for Energy and Competitiveness in Europe (Mrs. Helen Liddell):</B> I was interested in the comments of the hon. Member for South Dorset (Mr. Bruce) in justification of the amendment. However, when I first saw it, I believed that it was frivolous, though frivolity is not something with which I usually associate the hon. Gentleman. He presented it as a probing amendment, but it is contradictory even in terms of his own supportive comments. He began by stating that he was opposed to over-regulation, but as debate on the amendment proceeds, it is becoming glaringly obvious that he intends to regulate even further in other sectors. That stands fact on its head.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I listened carefully to the debate and the right hon. Lady is being disingenuous. My hon. Friend's argument was that if the Government are not regulating oil and coal deliveries to homes, why should they regulate sectors in which full competition already exists. He is not advocating the extension of regulation to coal and oil, but asking why, if they are not regulated, the Government are so insistent on regulating sectors in which competition is at the same level.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> If the hon. Gentleman curbed his jack-in-a-box tendencies, I could go on to explain those points. The hon. Member for South Dorset argued that the scope of regulation should be widened into sectors in which the market is substantially different from that in coal and gas.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> If the Government decide to regulate only electricity and gas, they are liable to challenge under the Human Rights Act. If regulation is to apply to the entire energy sector, it must be light-touch regulation. The question whether a separate regulator is necessary would take us outside the scope of the amendment. If the Government are to secure the support of their Back Benchers, not to mention the Opposition's support, they must demonstrate to the Committee that the regulations are commensurate with what is necessary. If it is unnecessary to regulate the delivery of coal and oil to the home, it is also unnecessary for electricity and gas to be regulated.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> The hon. Gentleman seeks light-touch regulation, but the Bill will deliver much clearer and more transparent regulation, which is in the interests of the industry as well as consumers. Regulatory certainty is important to companies, particularly with regard to complex utilities. The Government introduced the Bill in response to demands from industry and consumers for regulatory certainty through depersonalising the nature of regulation. We shall explore that in greater detail as our debate proceeds.
<P>
The hon. Member for South Dorset failed to take into account the key difference between gas and electricity and coal and oil, which is that the former are delivered in a monopolistic manner because of the ownership of the means of transmission. The hon. Gentleman left us in awe of his negotiating skills, but the nature of the market and competition in oil is such that consumers can seek a much better deal by changing the delivery system as well as the oil company.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> The Minister makes a strong point with which I agree. Before people could buy gas and electricity from different companies—in other words, down the monopoly route—that was the position. I agree that it is necessary to regulate the way in which people have access to the electricity line or to the gas pipe. We shall support that when we get to those parts of the regulations.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> When operating a market, it is essential to give people clear information. The operation of free markets depends on the nature of the information available to consumers and on their ability to disseminate it and make choices based on it. One critical area where there is no clear information or freedom of choice in gas and electricity markets is that of pre-payment meters. People who use them find it difficult to take advantage of offers to switch suppliers. Such an option has operated for some years, and it allows a market between gas and electricity, People on pre-payment meters, the fuel poor or people carrying significant energy debt do not have the opportunity to make choices. Members of the Committee have a reasonable income so can pay by direct debit and avail themselves of the negotiating skills of the hon. Member for South Dorset to obtain a much better deal.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Linda Gilroy </B>(Plymouth, Sutton): Does my right hon. Friend consider it appropriate to bring to the attention of Opposition Members the fact that, at the lowest estimate, more than 4 million people are still in fuel poverty? Another monopoly consideration is that gas dominates the space heating market—fuelling 80 per cent. of it.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> My hon. Friend, who has considerable knowledge of these matters, made two important points. She spoke of the pressure on the disadvantaged people whom we call the fuel poor. We shall discuss those people later. She mentioned the distortions that come from market dominance by one or two significant players, as a result of which the market is not truly competitive. The Bill harnesses regulation and competition. The regulator's primary duty to consumers is to foster competition. The Government do not see the regulatory structure remaining for all time cast in stone. As markets change, so will the nature of regulation. It is therefore important to establish a regulatory authority to look widely at the issues that the industry must address, to ensure that consumers are looked after properly.
<P>
The hon. Member for South Dorset spoke of the history of the energy industries. He seemed to think that the Bill's only purpose was to deal with previously nationalised companies. My hon. Friend the Minister for Competition and Consumer Affairs indicated that the coal industry was once nationalised. The nature of coal distribution is such that different purchasing deals can be done—provided one has purchasing power, which not everyone has. It is much more difficult to do that with gas and electricity.
<P>
The hon. Member for South Dorset seemed to make a case for privatisation. I wondered whether he was going off the received text. Under the previous regulatory framework, the interests of consumers ended up being subordinated to those of shareholders. I accept that the two are often the same, but consumers were disadvantaged under the previous system of regulation. We therefore thought it extremely important to give the regulator primary responsibility for taking into account the needs of consumers. That is most important for a market that is still not fully competitive in all its operations.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The hon. Member for South Dorset made several points about the need to change the name of the Gas and Electricity Markets Authority so that it relates to energy. On the one hand he wants to reduce regulation, yet on the other he talks about extending it to cover other parts of the energy industry. I do not think that that would enhance the Bill in any way. Indeed, it would lead to the suggestion that we are not prepared to listen to the advice of consumers and the industry on the future shape of regulations.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman referred to the consultation that has taken place; it has been extensive. His amendment is the first suggestion that I have seen that the Gas and Electricity Markets Authority should be extended to include other aspects of energy. The best way to protect consumers is through competition. It creates a spur for companies to innovate, to improve efficiency and to drive down prices. That is why the authority's principal objective is to promote the interests of consumers but at the same time to promote competition, which is not as perfect in gas and electricity as it is in other sectors. I therefore ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment as it goes against the spirit of the Bill and the remarks that he and his hon. Friends made on Second Reading.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I am sorry that we did not tease out more from the Minister about her intentions and why the electricity and gas industries are significantly different from those concerning other forms of energy, but we have been able to put down a marker about future difficulties in the market place. This is a strange place to bring up the Human Rights Act, but we have always benefited in this country from not having a written constitution. The law that we have made in Committees like this is the law, and will not be challenged. The Human Rights Act provides new routes of challenge, just as we saw with speeding offences in Scotland. Ministers should go back to their civil servants and ask whether the point that I have made is valid.

<P>

<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> The hon. Gentleman's argument is pretty far fetched. Presumably he is talking about the anti-discrimination sections in the Human Rights Act. He suggests that national Governments could not implement regulations for different industries, regardless of the shape or operation of those industries. It is an ingenious attempt to extend the discussion, but it is pretty far fetched.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I hope that I will not be proved right and that the Committee is not reassembled in a year or so in order to rewrite the provision. We have had a good discussion. I had every intention at the outset of withdrawing the amendment. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 72, in page 1, line 18, at end add—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(5) The Authority will be wound up 5 years from the date of commencement of its duties.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Amendment No. 87, in clause 84, page 91, line 23, at end add—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(4) The Authority will be wound up 5 years from the date of commencement of its duties.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I rise now with my free-market hat firmly on my head. This debate directly follows my earlier speech about the route that we envisage markets taking. I do not intend to repeat that, but basically I am saying that, with the best will in the world, Governments set up all sorts of rules, regulations and authorities to try to make the market work better. If we want to concentrate the authority's mind in making the market work better, it should be told that it has a maximum of five years in which to act, after which it will be wound up and any of its regulatory functions that still needed to be undertaken will pass to a light-touch regulator. That certainly would not require an organisation and edifice—in effect, a State Department of gas and electricity—to fiddle around with the market.
<P>
<B>Mr. White:</B> The Conservative party is fixated on dates. It has set a date with the euro but says that it would not join irrespective of the economic conditions. Under the amendment, a five-year limit would be set irrespective of whether the conditions to which the hon. Gentleman referred had been met.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I tabled several amendments that referred to different time limits in which such matters should be decided. The Chairmen have rightly selected only one of those amendments for debate and, being generous in their selection, they have chosen the amendment that would allow the authority five years to sort out the market and then disband itself. I am happy with a five-year period because it is a maximum not a minimum.
<P>
Such a large, bureaucratic organisation will cost electricity and gas consumers a great deal of money, all of which will be taken in a levy on the gas and electricity companies' licence fees. Therefore, people must be certain that the authority will withdraw when it has done its job of making the market work properly. Unless a time limit is set for the authority, it will be seen as normal that Governments interfere for ever in the marketplace for such services and goods.
<P>
The amendment would ensure that no Government left the legislation on the statute book for ever. I think that my timing is right and that the next Conservative Administration will be involved—not the next but one; I tend to think in terms of Parliaments. After all, people will be given all sorts of wonderful contracts to work for the authority and they should know that they are time-limited. Perhaps those contracts should state that, if they finish their work in two years, they could receive large bonuses. Perhaps we should explore such matters further under different clauses; we should certainly do so if the Minister is happy to agree to the five-year maximum proposed in the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Does not the amendment enable the Government to explain their vision of future regulation in those areas that will shortly be subject to full competition? The Minister has an opportunity to say that, during the next five years, she expects that regulation will be withdrawn from certain markets, however narrow those markets are defined. I hope that she will do precisely that in responding to the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I am most grateful to my hon. Friend for finishing my speech for me. I think that, given that helpful intervention, I have said sufficient about the constraints that we are asking the Minister to set for the authority. The authority will have its own budget and, under later provisions in the Bill, will be able to do whatever it wants in furtherance of its aims. Clearly, instead of building a £500 million office in London, Sheffield, south Wales or wherever, the authority should know that a tent would be okay—it would certainly last five years. That would be preferable to it worrying about which marble to use in a building that should last 100 years.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Gilroy:</B> I should like to speak against the amendment. The hon. Member for South Dorset was engaging in wishful thinking—the idea that there could be a Conservative Government within his time frame for the life of the authority! He will be aware of the shocking fact that last winter saw the highest rate of excess winter deaths for 10 years. Around 4,800 occurred in the region that covers our constituencies, and 77 were in his constituency alone. That number coincides with the size of his majority at the general election.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> As soon as I saw those spurious figures, I contacted the chief executive of the health authority, who told me that they were complete rubbish. My amendment would ensure that my constituents would not have to pay for the authority for more than five years—reducing costs to consumers.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Gilroy:</B> I am pleased that the hon. Gentleman is aware of the shocking statistics to which I referred. Those figures are given credence by many Government Members, who want to do something about them. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman has also ignored the fact that there are more than four million fuel-poor households in this country, of which 800,000 have to pay more than 20 per cent. of their income to keep their homes warm, which is so important for their health. I am pleased that at least one Conservative Member—the hon. Member for Southend, West (Mr. Amess)—recognises the importance of such matters, and has promoted the Warm Homes and Energy Conservation Bill, which I recently sponsored.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Is the hon. Lady aware that in 1981—two years after her party left office—only 60.5 per cent. of households in this country had central heating, in comparison with 89 per cent. by 1997–98? It ill behoves her to speak about those matters without crediting the previous Conservative Government. One of the main reasons for that enormous increase was a 30 per cent. fall in the price of gas and electricity, which is attributable to privatisation—a policy that her party opposed.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Gilroy:</B> I am certainly pleased that many more homes have central heating, but having spent 17 years—before I entered Parliament—working for gas consumers in the west country on the gas consumers council, I can tell the hon. Gentleman that it has much more to do with the extension of the pipeline to rural areas that did not have a gas supply than with his explanation. He should also take note of the comments of the Director General of Gas and Electricity Markets who said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The scale and nature of the problem call for a response from many organisations'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and described the problems as ``awesome''.
<P>
I would be pleased if the dreams of the hon. Member for South Dorset came to fruition and we could afford to allow the authority to lapse in five years—and solve all the environmental and fuel poverty problems addressed by the Bill. However, on conservative estimates, it would take 10 to 15 years to resolve such deep-seated problems. The hon. Gentleman's time scale is unrealistic and should not be supported. I hope that he will listen to his hon. Friend the Member for Southend, West, whose Bill will push forward the boundaries of resolving the problems, and will recognise that, far from abolishing the authority that he seeks to do out of a job, we will probably still be debating the subject in five—possibly ten years' time.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> The hon. Lady was sufficiently interested in the Bill to come to the briefing that my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb) and I attended at the DTI. Officials kindly told us that, effectively, a stealth tax was attached to the authority and that they would be able to put prices up to pay for the authority and everything that it was doing. Has she yet found out, as the DTI could not tell us, just what that increase would mean to her poor constituents who have problems with their fuel bills and will have extra to pay once the authority has been created? Does she not want it to get rid of that levy in five years?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Gilroy:</B> As I understand it from the Library briefing, the scale of the problem is such that greater investment is required but, according to the regulator, it largely relates to funding and policing the new electricity trading arrangements. The amount of investment is minuscule in comparison with the major savings that are likely to result from it. I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman has received the briefing from the Utilities Buyers Forum, which predicts that, this year alone, there will be £500 million for business and commerce, with a similar figure flowing to domestic customers. The extra investment in regulation that will bring about that major saving will be of great significance. I am sure that my right hon. Friend the Minister will make some further points to rebut the hon. Gentleman's idea.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The debate is covering a fundamental question about the role of regulators. How does the Minister see the role of the regulator once there is full competition in a sector. The Conservative view is that a regulator acts as a proxy for a fully competitive market. Once that market exists, the proxy can be removed. From the details of the Bill, one sees a different Government vision. They see the role as regulating for regulation's sake the various social and environmental causes that they have in mind. They want the regulator to continue to regulate regardless of full competition. This is an important point; it would be helpful to have the Government's vision spelt out precisely.
<P>
On Second Reading, the Secretary of State was asked whether he believed that there would still be a role for a regulator when the utilities sector involved was open to a fully competitive environment, however narrow that element of the sector. His response was:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``There may be a limited role, but it would depend on the specific circumstances. As a general rule, my personal view is that regulators are not appropriate in those circumstances, and I should much rather have the discipline of an effective market.''—[Official Report, 31 January 2000; Vol. 343, c. 793.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Does the Minister agree with the Secretary of State? If so, when in the next five years does she anticipate that certain elements of the markets in telecommunications or electricity supply will be fully open to competition? If the price cap is to be removed from domestic electricity supply and domestic telephone usage over the next couple of years, why not remove the regulator from those areas? Let us hear the Government's response. Indeed, when the Minister for Competition and Consumer Affairs called for socialism to be buried, he said that he tended to agree with my hon. Friend the Member for South Dorset that the regulations might become entirely redundant.
<P>
I did not quote the figures for central heating increases—60 per cent. in 1981 to 89 per cent. by 1997—to make a petty party political point; I wanted to know which direction the Government want us to follow. Do they want us to continue in the same direction in which we have been going for the past 20 years, with electricity and gas prices falling significantly in real terms and an increasing number of households having central heating? The number of households with telephones is also increasing, from 75 per cent. in 1981 to 94 per cent. by 1997—the figures are from the Government statistical service. Do they want to continue in that direction, or do they want us to change direction and have a new vision, which means higher regulation, more intervention, more cost and therefore a real risk of costs to the consumer rising rather than falling or, if not rising, then not falling as much as they would had we continued on the same path as the previous Government.
<P>
That is also the view of the regulators. For example, a recent Oftel press release says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``At the heart of the strategy is a rolling back of formal regulation where competition is effective and already protects consumers.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It goes on to quote David Edmonds, who states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``As telecoms markets become more competitive OFTEL needs to review its approach to regulation.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He continues:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Over-regulation distorts markets and disadvantages consumers. Regulation should be appropriate to the level of competition.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is the point. When there is full competition in a market, there should be no regulation. However, that is not what the Bill prescribes. The role and duties that it gives the regulators are far-reaching and wide and they concern several new social issues. The Government give the impression that they intend such regulation to continue even when the market is fully open and competitive.

<P>

<B>Mr. Phil Sawford </B>(Kettering): I am listening carefully to the hon. Gentleman. Is not five years an arbitrary figure? As the hon. Member for South Dorset said, it was plucked out of the air. Would not it be irresponsible to expect a fully competitive market automatically to protect consumer interests? We read about car price comparisons in Europe, and in relation to CDs and other goods, there has been talk recently of rip-off Britain. Is not it naive to assume that a fully competitive market would protect consumer interests? Surely there is a need for the Government to retain some method in regulation to protect consumers in what for them is often a monopoly market.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes my point for me. Yes, five years is an arbitrary figure. It is a probing amendment to draw out from the Government a policy statement on their vision of role of the regulator.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman also referred to rip-off Britain, although the Competition Commission's report seems to indicate six of one and half a dozen of the other. If he is saying that there is a rip-off culture among businesses selling CDs and cars, does he want the Government to regulate in those areas? Would he like a CDs regulator and a cars regulator? Is that the excessively regulated vision that Labour—old and new—has of this country?
<P>
<B>Mr. Norman Baker </B>(Lewes): I am following the hon. Gentleman's comments closely because he is making an interesting philosophical contribution to the debate. While he clearly believes that a fully competitive market would deliver a fair deal for consumers, I am not clear whether he believes that there is a role for security social and environmental objectives. How would a fully competitive market without a regulator achieve that?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> There is a role for Government in pursuing social and environmental objectives—that is what we are here for when we discuss legislation—but the Opposition do not believe that it is the role of the regulator to be the delivery mechanism for those objectives.
<P>
In a mature democracy, it is important that people know what social programmes are being delivered, that they understand fully the cost of those programmes and that they can then decide as a nation to pay for them through the fairest method of collection: the tax system, which has been carefully devised to be progressive and fair. Those costs should not be imposed on the electricity bill.
<P>
The £1 levy for fuel efficiency to which my hon. Friend the Member for South Dorset referred goes on all electricity bills. There is no objection to £1, but were £5 or £10 to be added to the average electricity bill, it would be a burden: a form of stealth tax. It would not have arisen from the Finance Bills that we discuss each year, nor, because of the way in which it would be collected, would it be progressive. That is wrong, which is why we have tried to draw the matter out in the debate. The Government have a tendency to use business to deliver their social objectives. They did it with the working families tax credit, which merely takes the old family credit introduced by the Conservatives, extends it slightly and insists that it be paid through the payroll, putting a £100 million regulatory burden on businesses.
<P>
The Government are doing the same again by using the regulator to impose obligations on utilities licence holders. As all the documents make clear, the cost will in turn be passed on to the consumer. That is the basis for my concern. There is to be a change in the successful policy pursued in the 15 years since privatisation, through which electricity and gas prices fell by 30 per cent. in real terms and the number of households with central heating increased from 60 per cent. to 90 per cent. I am concerned that the Government's change of direction will lead to a harsher deal for consumers. In such circumstances, the poorest consumers are always the ones who suffer. That is a real worry.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I return to the hon. Gentleman's earlier point. We have many other forms of regulation. My hon. Friend the Member for Kettering (Mr. Sawford) mentioned some of the allegations about high prices. The previous Government were never averse to referring examples of where they saw a real distortion in the market to the Director General of Fair Trading and on to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. It is disingenuous to state that there has never been regulation. Of course there is regulation. The hon. Gentleman knows that as markets change it is important to allow distortions in them to benefit consumers. We will give regulators real teeth to whack the fixers and shysters who drag up prices rather than bringing them down.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> That is the purpose of the legislation covering monopolies. The Monopolies and Mergers Commission—now the Competition Commission—exists for that end. The legislation has all the safeguards built in to deal with abuses of the market. That should remain. The new paraphernalia are being created either to repeat processes undertaken by the Competition Commission or to bring in new draconian measures to implement other social programmes not within the regulator's role, rather than to respond to concerns about market share and market abuse. The regulator's role is meant to be that of proxy for the absence of competition.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Gilroy:</B> The hon. Gentleman kept quoting the 30 per cent. decrease in prices. I raised this point with him on Second Reading. Does not he accept that the 30 per cent. decrease in gas prices followed year-on-year real-terms increases in the price of gas in the early 1980s at 10 per cent. above inflation? Does he agree that it was therefore not difficult to achieve the decrease and that it cannot, in its entirety or for the most part, be put down to the impact of competition?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The reality is that when these utilities were in the state sector they were used by the Government as cash cows to raise funds, and that if they had remained in the state sector they would have gone on being used for that purpose. When the companies were moved from the state sector to the private sector they achieved astonishing falls in their delivery costs. All the experts underestimated exactly how much more efficient they became in the private sector. That must have eventually carried through to falls in prices to consumers. That is what has happened. I do not believe that those 30 per cent. falls would otherwise have happened, even after the increases of the earlier years. Prices increased continually while the utilities were in the state sector.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Gilroy:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman aware that—again during a similar period—owing to a negative external financial limit the gas industry made substantial inputs to the Treasury? Has he taken that into account? I draw his attention to the major investment in the infrastructure made by the nationalised industry when it developed the national grid, which brought natural gas to the majority of homes.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I have not even spoken about the tens of billions of pounds of corporation tax that the utilities are paying. If the hon. Lady wishes to begin a debate about the advantages of nationalisation, perhaps the Fabian society or her party conference is the place to do that. Most people accept—and I thought that most of new Labour had accepted—that the private sector does things better, more cheaply and more efficiently. That is why privatisation has been put into practice worldwide, and why Britain leads in advising other countries how to privatise utilities and achieve the resounding successes that this country has achieved.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I would not want the Committee to be inadvertently misled by the hon. Lady because I am sure that she did not mean something that she said. She probably does not know that when the gas industry was privatised, deals were done—effectively with Government seals on them—on the price at which gas would go into the nationalised industry. When it was privatised, it realised that it could buy gas on the world market at massively reduced prices, and it was the very mechanism of privatisation that allowed it to get gas from other sources that brought down the price of gas. The hon. Lady was a member of the gas consumer council. I am surprised that she did not realise that it was the Conservatives' privatising policy that broke that link of fixed-price gas contracts that the Government had negotiated.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Gilroy:</B> If the hon. Gentleman looks at the record he will discover that most of the gas contracts were for long periods of 15 and 20 years, so what he has described did not have that impact. For his benefit, let me put it on record that I was an advocate of the benefits of competition perhaps long before my own party came round to it. I have never denied the benefits of competition. The hon. Gentleman should describe accurately what happened rather than over-egg the pudding in a factually incorrect way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I do not believe that I have done that. The case for privatisation speaks for itself in all the utilities that were privatised.
<P>
Our amendment No. 72 would set a time limit for the regulator. We want the Minister to tell the Committee when the Government envisage regulation being withdrawn. I have spoken of the keenness of the Director General of Telecommunications to withdraw regulation as competition comes into the marketplace. We have heard how critical of the Bill the Director General of Water Services, Ian Byatt, was. He said in a speech to the Royal Aeronautical Society that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``as a result of the Bill, the Regulator will be festooned with detailed requirements'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
all of which are likely to raise the costs of regulation. In a lecture at the London School of Economics in September 1999, he said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``There are those . . . with a more centralised view of society who do not like the independence of the regulator from Ministers. They appear to want to counter the privatisation of utilities with the nationalisation of regulation.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is coming through from Labour Members' interventions.
<P>
The focus and purpose of regulation seems confused, and the Government's philosophy is unclear. This is much like their competition policy, to which the Minister for Competition and Consumer Affairs referred: it is part and parcel of the same issue. The Government's competition policy is in a complete mess. This week's edition of The Economist states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Stephen Byers is making a mess of competition policy.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He says that he wants to withdraw from intervening in the competition authorities' decisions, yet in the past few months he has intervened in decisions more often than any previous Secretary of State. Three times in the past year he has rejected their recommendations. The Government's philosophy generally—in competition policy and in their proposals for the regulator to deal with the former nationalised industries, is a complete mess and we must clarify it for the regulator.
<P>
The amendments would introduce clarity, and would focus the collective governmental mind on the regulator's purpose. Does the regulator take the place of the free market when competition is insufficient or does it deliver the Government's social agenda through a new delivery mechanism? Setting a time limit would enable the Government to make that clear.
<P>
Paragraph 2.4 of the Green Paper, which appears on page 9, states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``it is vital that the regulators should be given the independence and discretion necessary to make economic decisions, for example, on price reviews. Without this, the risk of ad hoc political involvement in economic regulation will increase regulatory risk and costs of capital, and reduce the abilities of utilities to invest and operate in a settled climate.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is precisely our view. However, the opinion expressed by the Government in the Green Paper is not reflected in the Bill. The ability of the Secretary State, the consumer council and the regulator to institute new rules will create an ad hoc political climate and add to the cost of regulation. Revealingly, page 10 of the Green Paper states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``In emerging competitive markets, price regulation can be withdrawn from all . . . competitive parts of the market''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It continues:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Where competition has developed fully . . . the operation of the market should make economic regulation unnecessary. General competition law . . . should provide sufficient economic safeguards for consumers.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Why does the junior Minister say that that is the role of the regulator, not the Competition Commission? Everything that Government Members have said in our debate suggests that the regulator should continue that role, even in the circumstances mentioned by the Green Paper in which competition has developed. I want to hear the Minister's reply to my fundamental questions.

<P>

<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I shall resist the amendments.
<P>
In discussing the previous group of amendments, the hon. Member for South Dorset mesmerised the Committee with his negotiating skills. He now seems to be a fortune teller as well. Perhaps he will allow us to look over his shoulder when he chooses his lottery numbers this week, as he can obviously put definite dates on time matters. He probably takes after his leader, who says that he will campaign against the single currency for 10 years. After 10 years and a day, everything will change. The Opposition have an interesting obsession with dates.
<P>
More significantly, the Conservatives have changed their position. When we began discussing the Bill, they welcomed the merger of the gas and electricity regulators and the separate consumer councils, but now they are going back on that. The amendments are ill founded because one cannot say with absolute certainty when perfect competition will apply in any market. The nature of free market economics makes it impossible to put definite dates on such matters. Indeed, seeking to do so could be extremely dangerous. Regulated concerns that are not committed to the consumer in the same way as the Government may seek the opportunity to lift regulation at a future date. As a result, they may bring about changes to their operation that militate against consumers and damage the operation of the market. Indeed, the Opposition's position in these amendments is at odds with the industry's.
<P>
Benefits will accrue to gas and electricity companies, which will have to deal with only one regulatory authority for energy. Having to deal with two separate regulatory systems is costly and reduces companies' efficiency. Closer alignment of gas and electricity legislation will reduce the regulatory burden on companies operating in both markets, as most companies now do as a result of Government action.
<P>
Splitting electricity supply and distribution will facilitate further restructuring in the electricity sector. Indeed, we are giving the regulator much greater scope to respond to the rapidly changing operation of the market. We have heard much about the costs of regulatory changes proposed by the Government. The Bill, together with reform of electricity trading arrangements, will lead to a 10 per cent. reduction in wholesale energy prices, which is extremely important for consumers in domestic and corporate markets.
<P>
The bulk of the Bill's proposals will affect regulators rather than companies. We have always said that we anticipate a small increase in the cost of regulation arising principally from greater interest in the consumer, which the Opposition welcomed on Second Reading. Consumer councils involve set-up costs of £7.5 million and recurring costs of £3 million to £4 million. Measures to improve transparency, consistency, predictability and accountability of regulation involve one-off costs of £250,000 and recurring costs of up to £1.2 million. Of course, implementing a much clearer regulatory system allows companies to reduce their costs.
<P>
The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton did not take proper account of the points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth, Sutton, who has considerable knowledge and direct experience of market operations, especially in relation to gas consumers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I was listening carefully, especially to what the Minister said about a specific number of years. Will she reassure us that such an authority will not exist for a long time? In future, change will be necessary to lighten the regulation so that the regulator deals with a national body rather than an industry body. Reassurance about that would make it easy for me to withdraw the amendment, which obviously would get great support if it were put to the vote.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> The Government have always made it clear that the regulator's role is to protect the consumer throughout the development of competition. No one can predict the future shape of the market or how market distortions will be ironed out. The way in which the powers of the regulatory authority are put together gives more flexibility than has been available through existing gas and electricity legislation and takes account of future changes in the market.
<P>
I cannot say whether the day will come when there will be no regulator as there will always be consumers who cannot avail themselves of true competition opportunities. Gas, electricity and telecoms infrastructures, which involve lines and pipelines, make it difficult to envisage the development of true competition and a true market, but the Bill provides scope to allow for change in the regulatory framework.
<P>
I urge the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment. We have had a wide-ranging debate and I regret the fact that the Opposition are backing off from the commitment to reform of the regulatory regime that they gave on Second Reading.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I am afraid that the right hon. Lady is reading from the wrong part of her file. The debate was about the Government's vision of the regulator's future. That was touched upon towards the end, but most of her speech was about the advantages of merging Offer and Ofgas into Ofgem. On Second Reading and during today's debate, my hon. Friends and I have said that we support that, so I have no idea why she raised that issue. It would have been helpful to know when the Minister envisages that the regulators will withdraw, not necessarily from the whole sector, but from a particular aspect, such as the supply of electricity.
<P>
I hope that I have made our position crystal clear.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> The Minister has given some explanation of her view, but I note that, on page 4 of the White Paper on competition and markets, the Government have committed themselves to ensuring that 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``consumer protection by public authorities is effective, without imposing unnecessary burdens on business, large or small.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We should let businesses know that if they get the market working properly and behave themselves, there will be no need for a regulator in the form set out in the Bill. The Minister said that there were mechanisms in existence that would allow the Government to refer abuses in the marketplace, even if such regulations were not in the Bill, so I am disappointed that we have not made more progress.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I am tempted to call a vote, Mr. Hood, because so many committee members have turned up and listened avidly—some even with their eyes open—to the debate. They have not yet had the opportunity to speak or, indeed, to get their names on the voting list. I shall not ask for a vote, however, so their constituents will not know whether they have been here at all. That may encourage them to involve themselves in the debate.
<P>
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I seem to be very popular with the Chair, judging by the selection list. I am most grateful for that, but I must be less efficient in future, so that I might have an opportunity to open some of the documents that I have brought with me.
<P>
The record of today's proceedings will serve as evidence of how well informed our debates are. I wrote the amendments as soon as I could get to my computer, whereupon they were picked up by bodies such as the National Consumer Council, which immediately e-mailed me—this being the electronic age—to say, ``We've done a paper on this.'' Clearly, I am moving in the right direction, as far as the National Consumer Council is concerned, although it will be somewhat shocked to learn that some of my later amendments would require it to take over many of the duties that the Bill will create for the new bodies.
<P>
The amendments would at least give the Government the opportunity to save on stationery costs. There is a serious purpose in discussing what we should call the authority. I have given the Government the choice to call it the Communications Authority, rather than the Telecommunications Authority. That would allow the Government to save on stationery costs, because it is already Government policy to have a communications authority, in the fullness of time. My idea would work, provided that the authority has a building big enough for everything, as I suspect it does. Oftel has already built a new office, as is the wont of authorities—and it is always nice when Members of Parliament are invited to lunch. If one wanted a great-sounding authority that would make the shares go up, one could call it an ``e-communications authority''. That would go with the style and, as we all know, the Government concentrate very much on style. The Minister may expect me to add ``and no substance'', but there is no need to do so, as everyone knows it.
<P>
The context of regulation is changing rapidly. I have the honour of being vice chairman of EURIM—the European informatics market all-party group—and I see that our treasurer is also here today. We asked our industrial contributors to examine the wider context of communications regulation. I have a sneaking suspicion that our treasurer was involved in that debate. The strong conclusion was that a single communications agency would be the best way forward and should embrace what is now known as the broadcasting and entertainment industry. Information and communications, our group recommended, should be dealt with under a similar set of regulations.
<P>
If I were a film maker in the real world, someone would want to regulate my material, perhaps in respect of sex, violence and the audiences that should be permitted to watch it. Special provisions could be considered under a single regulator. Let us count up the different forms of regulation that would apply to a particular film. Under the Bill, a different set of regulations would apply according to whether the film was transmitted through a telephone line, broadcast terrestrially or sent down from satellite. If the film were shown on an aeroplane or in the cinema, different sets of regulations would apply. Films are cut especially for different marketplaces.

<P>

<B>Mr. White:</B> Would not that argument have greater validity if the previous Government's Broadcasting Act 1996 had taken account of the hon. Gentleman's suggestions? The Conservative Government chose a different direction and opted for a multitude of regulations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> My hon. Friend—if I can refer to the hon. Member for Milton Keynes, North-East (Mr. White) in those terms—makes a valid point. I called him our treasurer earlier because I could not remember the name of his constituency. He well knows that Ministers often become enthusiastic about reducing the number of regulators, take a wish list to their civil servants but are then provided with all sorts of reasons why it cannot be done. Their advice is, of course, from the regulation industry—a great set of regulators—who constantly ask why it is necessary to have another set of regulations but affirm how impossible it would be to bring all the regulations together.
<P>
Conservative party policy now is to reduce the number of regulators. It should not be too contentious a party point to suggest that broadening the title of the authority, without broadening its remit, would be a sensible way forward. Let me read an excerpt from a letter from the National Consumer Council. It is a briefing, which will probably be sent to all of us eventually, about telecommunications regulation. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Whilst we support many of the changes to telecommunications regulation in this Bill, our ideal vision for telecommunications, along with broadcasting and IT services, is a communications regulator with a communications consumer council. This is because of the convergence and blurring of distinctions across communications technologies and markets. The current regulatory structure is too fragmented, confusing and inappropriate for these converging sectors. We are aware that broadcasting regulation is being reviewed in government, and await a white paper on how it will be updated to take account of the changes.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We are all waiting for that.
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``In the meantime, given the rapidity of developments in these sectors, it is vital that consumers interests are effectively protected. we therefore believe the remit of the telecommunications consumer council should be expanded. This is a theme we will be following as the review develops.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That shows why I make up my speeches as I go along rather than reading them: I did not get as far in my education as reading out loud. I read out the view of the National Consumer Council because I had not read it beforehand and wanted an opportunity to do so. It kindly sent me a copy. We must keep informed of the views of such an important body, which is in touch with decisions and does not have a political axe to grind, although it may have an axe to grind on whether it should itself remain as a regulatory body. It also produced ``Ofcom: a coherent approach to regulating communication'', which I shall not read out for the record.
<P>
The Government must tell the Committee on the record where they are going. I repeat that including the word ``communications'' in the title is not a flippant point, and it would demonstrate the Government's intentions effectively. The term ``telecommunications'' suggests a rather narrower meaning, and makes people think of the telephone. Computers do their work over telephone lines. In the internet age, we must bring that aspect of telecommunications up to date. I hope that the Minister will take that seriously and move forward.
<P>
I had the honour of promoting the Telecommunications (Fraud) Bill—a private Member's. Bill—which sought to describe what regulation might be needed in respect of fraudulent devices. The technology was moving ahead so quickly that it was difficult to describe a device as a telephone, a telecommunications apparatus or whatever. When it came to describing it, we simply called it a ``thing'', which was sufficiently wide to be future technology-proof. We knew that next week's invention would still be covered. Many changes have occurred in technology since and the issues covered by that Bill are still relevant.
<P>
I ask the Minister to examine the issues carefully: otherwise, the next Government—I suspect that it will be a Conservative Government—will have to change the name of the Communications Agency again, probably along the lines of the Federal Communications Agency of the United States.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I was amused when, in his closing remarks, the hon. Gentleman talked about ``things''. Whenever I ask my daughter what she is doing, she says, ``Things''. The work of the Committee would be easier if we just did things but, sadly, the procedures of the House do not allow us to do that.
<P>
As I said, I thought that the first set of amendments were frivolous, but I can see where the hon. Gentleman is coming from in these amendments, because they pick up a theme that he raised in our first sitting. Incidentally, he criticised my hon. Friends for being in attentive, but if more Conservative Members were present, he might manage to get through his correspondence.
<P>
In the Committee's first sitting, the hon. Gentleman asked whether there would be a reform of Oftel with a view to reducing the number of regulatory bodies that are involved in communications and broadcasting. He has considerable experience in such matters, and advocated looking more widely at digital broadcasting. That is a valid point. It has been recognised for some time that the telecommunications and broadcasting industries are converging. Services that were once exclusive to broadcasting can now be delivered on a personal computer; moreover, digital television can now provide interactive services that would once have required a personal computer.
<P>
In the light of that convergence, the Government published a Green Paper in July 1998 and there was a subsequent consultation exercise. The outcome of that consultation is in the report, ``Regulating Communications: The Way Ahead'', which the Department of Trade and Industry, together with colleagues in the Department of Culture, Media and Sport, published in June 1999. That work must be taken further. The subject is complex and covers a range of issues. We must look to the future shape of technology. The Government intend to publish a communications White Paper later this year setting out our proposals for the reform of the framework of communications legislation.
<P>
<B>Mr. White:</B> Is my right hon. Friend aware that countries such as Canada, which have a much wider communications regulator, have had to separate the regulation of telecommunications because of complexities of the type that the Government are considering at the moment? There is therefore a need to reflect what is currently Oftel in a separate part or body.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> My hon. Friend makes an important point. We must look to international examples to guide us as we consider the future of communications businesses in this country. That is what the forthcoming White Paper will do. It must also take into account the current review of the European Union regulatory framework for communications.
<P>
Our aim is to ensure a consistent and coherent approach to the regulation of the converging communications industries. That is why it is difficult for me to accept the amendments. For a start, there would be no opportunity for the kind of consultation that the rapidly changing technology requires. The communications review will address the legislative framework that is required to ensure that we create the best environment in the world for e-business, as my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister wants. In the meantime, it would be premature to make changes of the kind proposed in the amendments, which seek to anticipate the outcome of that review.
<P>
The changes to the telecommunications framework proposed in the Bill are only those that follow from the conclusion of the utilities review. Our conclusions are informed by the desires of the industry and consumers. It is sensible to deal with that limited agenda now and to consider the broader issue of convergence and its implications for the regulation of the whole communications sector in the forthcoming communications review. If the hon. Gentleman is not prepared to withdraw his amendment, I regret to say that I shall ask the Committee to reject it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> Again, I would be only too pleased to test the Committee, but we are trying to make good and sensible progress. I am grateful to the Minister for giving a bit of a nod towards what will happen. Does her briefing give her a month when the Whit Paper will be published? It would help us to know where we are going. One of the problems is quite simply that we are implementing a Bill whose proposals will roll out over a period during which the Government might say that they want to introduce another Bill to deal with communications.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I cannot give the hon. Gentleman a specific month. That road is paved with good intentions. The minute that a month is mentioned, it automatically slips. The best that I can say is this autumn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I am grateful for that at least. Setting a target, however unachievable, often ensures that we start to make some progress. Autumn finishes around October, to be generous. I look forward to coming back to the matter after the recess. On that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Bruce:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 86, in page 91, leave out lines 15 to 17.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 36, in schedule 1, page 153, line 22, leave outparagraph 11.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> The clause seems—Ministers may tell us that we are misreading it and that there is something else further on—to give enormously wide powers to the authority to get on and do whatever it believes would be appropriate to fulfil its remit under the Bill. Subsection (3) is unacceptable. It reads:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The Authority shall have power to do anything which is calculated to facilitate, or is conducive or incidental to, the performance of its functions.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is probably not too difficult if a Minister offers it £10 million to run its functions, as that will be limited. However, the authority can set down licences and levy stealth taxes on the telecommunications industry. It cannot simply collect money to be handed over to the Treasury—that is not part of its powers—but it can spend that money in any way that it wishes.
<P>
Subsection (3) seems to give the authority power to make an offer to the Romanian Government for the people's palace, which is the second biggest building in the world and has wonderful marble halls. Because it is an organisation that will want to encourage UK industry, it may want to build such a palace in the UK. Constituency MPs will no doubt want to put in their bids for the headquarters of the organisation. In other words, the committee of people who will replace the director general of Telecommunications may say to themselves, ``The United Kingdom must be the best place for electronic communications and commerce, and the Prime Minister has set us that task, so we must have the biggest, best, most wonderful centre. We can have demonstration rooms, where''—

<P>

<B>Dr. Howells:</B> Why does the hon. Gentleman assume that, to have the best environment for e-commerce, we must have marble halls? Is he obsessed with marble halls?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I should be redirected, and I am grateful to the Minister for doing so. I meant to say Portland stone halls; that would be far better, and great for my local stone industry. I am grateful for the intervention, but I was simply trying to suggest great luxury and great expense.
<P>
This country was fortunate to be chosen as the site of the European Bank of Reconstruction or whatever it is called.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I am grateful to the right hon. Lady, who knows that organisation well, as she used to be at the Treasury. Initially, the bank had a French director general, who decided that reconstruction would be carried out in London at great expense and in marble. I understand that once the marble was put up, people did not like the shade, so it was all knocked down and rebuilt.
<P>
The clause allows the authority to do anything that it wants that is ``calculated to facilitate'' its job; it allows the authority to empire-build. The authority can decide what it believes would be good for the telecommunications industry. I think that we all agree that the United Kingdom wants to be the—or certainly a—leader in the e-commerce industry. We want the staff of the authority to do a good job, but we do not want them, through stealth taxes and licence fees, to have unfettered access to the money that they can collect from all the mobile, satellite, and fixed-link companies, in order to set up a great empire.
<P>
I suspect that the clause is in the Bill because lawyers have said that the authority must have everything that it needs to do its job, but it is the reference to ``anything'' that causes concern:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The Authority shall have power to do anything which is calculated''—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and it is the authority's calculation—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``to facilitate, or is conducive or incidental to, the performance of its functions''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Perhaps the authority can set up its own e-commerce company. That is much too wide a power for the Committee to give to a non-governmental organisation that can collect taxes and take money in licence fees from the industry. I hope that the Minister will either accept the amendment, or make certain that the power is not unfettered by rewording the clause later through Government amendments, in accordance with normal practice in Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Amendment No. 36 would take out the identical wording from paragraph 11 of schedule 1, which says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The Authority has power to do anything which is calculated to facilitate, or is conducive or incidental to, the performance of its functions.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That paragraph applies only to Ofgem. As my hon. Friend so ably explained, clause 84 (3) applies to the telecommunications industry, because only the first 10 paragraphs of schedule 1 are incorporated in to the Telecommunications Act 1984.
<P>
The power is far too wide. It is especially wide because of the use of ``or'' between the three words ``facilitate'', ``conducive'', and ``incidental''. If those words had ``and'' between them the power would be limited, but as the clause stands there are three powers.
<P>
First, there is the power to do anything that is calculated to facilitate the performance of its functions, which is extremely wide; secondly, there is a separate power to do anything that is conducive to the performance of its functions; and thirdly, there is the power to do anything that is incidental to the performance of its functions. I believe that they are dangerously wide powers. I looked through the Electricity Act 1989, the Telecommunications Act 1984 and the Gas Act 1986, but I was unable to find any similar powers relating to the directors general of the relevant regulatory bodies.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I cannot understand why the Government feel that such a wide enabling power is necessary for the new authority. There may be some administrative law or case provisions that limit the meaning of the ordinary language of those phrases; they appear to grant a terribly dangerous power to the authority, but perhaps they are limited in some way by a set of case law. Even if that is the case, however, it is wrong to legislate so widely in the hope and expectation that judges and other Acts will somehow limit the provisions. That is the wrong way to legislate. Legislation should be clear in its own right. I share the fear of my hon. Friend the Member for South Dorset that this is an enabling clause for future regulatory expansion. That is a cause for concern in its own right.
<P>
Will the Minister explain why she considers the provision necessary? Why was it not in previous Acts? If she cannot give us a satisfactory explanation, I shall urge Committee members to vote against the clause.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> If the amendment were accepted, the two authorities could not even order office equipment, which would be a rather restrictive way of doing things.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Why was the Director-General of Telecommunications able to order office equipment under the Telecommunications Act 1984, despite the fact that I cannot find a similar provision in that Act?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> The hon. Gentleman should give people a chance to get started. He talked for long enough; he should now give Ministers a chance to respond to his comments.
<P>
On the construction of the clause, incidental powers do not extend to the functions of the regulatory authorities. Those functions are set out clearly in the Bill or in the Gas and Electricity Acts. This power simply gives the authorities the means of carrying out their functions. It is about day-to-day administrative tasks. For instance, it permits them to lease office accommodation and enter into contracts for the purchase of equipment.
<P>
The hon. Member for South Dorset was very worried about marble—perhaps he is worried about losing some of his. He suggested that the regulator could spend a fortune on offices, but he must bear it in mind that the regulatory authority is a non-ministerial Government Department; as such, its annual budget will be subject to negotiation and agreement with the Treasury and is to be recovered from licence fees. That does not mean that the authority will have an unfettered ability to put up licence fees for the purposes of empire building. The Treasury has never been known to be generous—my right hon. Friend the Chancellor will not even order new carpets for No. 11 Downing street—so the likelihood of it allowing the authority to set up the marble halls with which the hon. Member for South Dorset is so obsessed is extremely small. None of the authority's functions could be said to justify vast expense and office building of the type that he suggested; the expenditure is that which is incidental or conducive to the authority's express functions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I understand what the right hon. Lady is saying, but why is there no similar clause in the other Acts, including the Telecommunications Act, which allows Oftel to operate now?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> As a matter of law, it is harder to prescribe powers for incidental or conducive expenditure to a corporate body such as the new regulatory authorities than it is to individuals such as the existing regulators. I would point out to the hon. Member for South Dorset that, generally speaking, an individual can do anything that he or she is not prohibited from doing, whereas statutory bodies, of which this authority is one, can do only what they are empowered to do. There is a specific empowerment on the authority in this instance. For example, the ability to enter into a contract with, say, an internet service provider to run an internet site giving the public information that the authority is empowered under the Bill to publish would have to be covered by this incidental or conducive power. Therefore, although I understand what the hon. Gentleman is getting at in his amendments, they are so restrictively drawn that they would stop the authorities carrying out their day-to-day functions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> Working separately, my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton and I each tabled an amendment to the same effect. We thought that the clause should not allow such a power. Indeed, giving power to a non- governmental body without reference to Parliament, the Secretary of State or anyone is draconian. The right hon. Lady says that it must merely clear its annual budget with the Treasury.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I shall not comment on the personal relationship between the hon. Members for South Dorset and for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton. It is not my fault that they do not talk to one another.
<P>
The hon. Gentlemen drew attention to the fact that existing regulators do not have such an incidental power. That power, however, is implied—not expressed—in the Bill, which is concerned with clarity. As I said earlier, for legal reasons it is easier to attribute incidental powers to individuals than to corporate bodies such as the new regulatory authorities. However, the justification for making that incidental power clear in the Bill is stronger than it was in relation to previous regulatory authorities. In the absence of an explicit provision, it is likely that such incidental powers will be implied. It is better to be open and honest about the nature of powers, given the checks and balances that I have mentioned.
<P>
Therefore, the clause is a commonsense provision with a commonsense Outcome. If the hon. Member for South Dorset is not prepared to withdraw his amendment, I shall urge Committee members to oppose it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I accept the right hon. Lady's point about the difference between an individual regulator and a corporate regulator. Indeed, she made it well.
<P>
Paragraph 11 of schedule 1 is headed ``Supplementary powers'' and uses the word ``or''. I would be happy not to press amendment No. 36 if the paragraph were more narrowly phrased. However, the drafting is too wide, and I should prefer the Government to provide a more narrowly focused power for ancillary things. In view of that, I believe that the amendment should be pressed to a vote.

<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> Are the Government willing to change the phrase ``is calculated to facilitate'' in paragraph 11 to ``is necessary to facilitate''? At the moment, the power in the Bill is simply too wide. Indeed, it is as if a lawyer wants to allow the regulator to do whatever it feels right. The authority has too a wide power to go off and do what it likes, and that is not what Parliament intends. I shall therefore press the amendment to a vote.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Amendments Nos. 27 and 28, those tabled only by my hon. Friend the Member for South Dorset and those tabled by Liberal Democrat Members deal with the type of people who will be appointed to the authority. Amendment No. 27 is not strictly necessary, as what it covers is dealt with in schedule 1.
<P>
The amendments would ensure that appointments to the authority are made in accordance with a set of criteria that the Secretary of State should publish before the Bill comes into force. Such criteria should include the requirement for at least one person with relevant experience in the telecommunications and energy industries. That would help the Government, who themselves said that they wanted such appointments. Paragraph 70, on page 24 of their response to the consultation states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``This model—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
the authority model—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``offers the advantage of collective but streamlined decision-making by a small cadre of high calibre, professional regulators . . . this is particularly important in energy and telecommunications, given the increasing complexity of these sectors.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Government believe that people of high calibre should serve on such authorities, although the Bill makes no mention of the sort of person who should be appointed. The Secretary of State should clearly set out what sort of person should serve on the authority.
<P>
The regulatory appraisal published by the Government refers to the sort of person who should serve on the authority. Page 28 states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The Bill creates a number of new appointments to regulatory and consumer bodies. These appointments will be governed by the overriding principle of selection based on merit.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
 So the Government have said that they want to make appointments based on merit, but that does not appear in the Bill. The appraisal document continues:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``In accordance with the guidance issued by the Commissioner for Public Appointments''—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
meaning the Nolan principles—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``. . . recruitment will be open and transparent, and subject to independent assessment.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Therefore, the criteria that I mentioned should refer to the Nolan principles, should specify the sort of people who are wanted and how appointments are to be made. As a result, the arrangement would be much more transparent and clear.
<P>
The amendments assist the Government by seeking to incorporate such wording in the Bill, so that we are all clear about the sort of people to be appointed to the authority and can be sure that the appointments are above board and not the result of the Government appointing Labour party front men.
<P>
<B>Mr. Baker:</B> As the hon. Gentleman said, it is interesting that Conservative Members have tabled amendments not dissimilar in direction from that which my hon. Friend the Member for Hazel Grove (Mr. Stunell) and I tabled. I trust that the Government recognise that we are pushing at an open door. Our amendment and those tabled by Conservative Members—which I support—are in line with the Government's policy, as set out in the Bill and other Bills.
<P>
I am concerned that the Bill is too open-ended. The details of the membership given in lines 5 to 8 are limited to say the least. The reference to only two other members leaves open the possibility that the membership of the authority will not necessarily be as representative as we would wish.
<P>
The amendment that I have tabled with my hon. Friend the Member for Hazel Grove (Mr. Stunell) seeks to ensure that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``at least one member shall have experience in relation to the interests of consumers as set out in Section 8(3)''
<P>
</UL></FONT>Clause 8(3) refers to consumers who are chronically sick or disabled, those of pensionable age, those with low incomes and those residing in rural areas. We had an interesting philosophical discussion earlier about whether the free market itself will guarantee to meet the interests of consumers, let alone the environment. The view that seemed to emerge was that a genuinely open free market would look after the interests of consumers.
<P>
As we know from discussions on the Post Office, for example, the majority of consumers might be protected by fair and open competition, but consumers with particular needs might be overlooked. As the Government recognised earlier in the Bill, all steps should be taken to ensure that they are protected. It seems only right to ensure that the Gas and Electricity Markets Authority includes someone who can look after their interests.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Equally, it is in line with Government policy to expect all appointments to be made in line with the known principles referred to by the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton. Similarly, as I have set out in the amendment that I tabled with my hon. Friend the Member for Hazel Grove, where
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``any person he proposes to appoint has any financial or other interest which is likely to prejudice the exercise of his duties'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
it shall be taken into account.
<P>
Given the substance of the authority, members should be fully accountable and the public should be aware of any financial and pecuniary interest so that they can assess whether such interests could influence an individual's decisions. I am simply trying to encourage the Government to write into the Bill principles that they rightly espouse on other occasions and to make it clear that the membership of the authority shall have regard to those two important factors.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Bruce:</B> I am grateful to other hon. Members for taking the lead. Amendment No. 75 aims to make the Bill completely open about the membership of the authority. I believe that there is no requirement on the authority to have a register of its members' interests. It is extremely important when Governments effectively have the ability to pluck people out of the community, give them large salaries, the opportunity to boost their careers and to have a great deal of power within an industry, that we know where they are coming from. We should know what their experience is—amendment No. 76 deals with that—and we should have a declaration of their interests.
<P>
We have an honest society. When they were in opposition, the Government did a great disservice to public life in this country by constantly going on about the sleaze that they believed was in public life. If one looks around at what is happening in other countries and compares it with the obvious misdeeds of politicians on both sides of the House in the past, we can see that we have a very honest system. When someone is appointed to a particular position, generally by the Secretary of State, the public and the industry that is being regulated should know the individual's background. I have added party political affiliations and donations in the amendment. As the Bill stands, that is not an absolute requirement.
<P>
<B>Mr. Baker:</B> I am listening carefully to the hon. Gentleman. He will be aware that party political affiliations are declared in appointments to health authorities.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> Yes, indeed. It is part of the application form. The Cabinet Office has a special public appointments register. When people have offered to act in either a voluntary or a paid capacity, they declare their party affiliations. One issue is particularly important here. I do not want to be too controversial, but just before this Government came into office it was decided that Labour Ministers would be able to take money in blind trusts. That facility has been ruled out of order by the various committees that have looked at this. It is no longer seen as a proper way of directly contributing to an individual's party work.
<P>
I have taken the issue up with the Prime Minister's office and I was told that neither he, nor other Secretaries of State who have blind trusts, know who gave money. One needs to have a certain amount of blind trust to believe that, but let us accept it. The individual Secretary of State probably has no way of knowing whether an individual has given money to the Labour party or indeed to a Conservative or Liberal Democrat blind trust. These blind trusts are run by trustees. One needs to ask the individual to make a declaration on being appointed and to be honest about whether he or she has given funds to any political party.
<P>
When Greg Dyke was appointed Director-General of the BBC he made it clear that he had given funds to the Labour party. The Conservative party made representations about that. The public should know what is happening. A number of individuals will get these highly paid jobs and people will ask how they got them. The public are entitled to know whether they have given money to a political party. That requirement should be in the Bill. We do not expect anyone to be dishonest about that but unless it is there the public or the Secretary of State cannot know whether that individual is a contributor to or active within a political party. That allows our public life to be that much more honest and open.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I turn first to amendments Nos. 27 and 28. I may refer in passing to amendment No. 76. As I understand it, these amendments would require the Secretary of State first to publish criteria to be used for appointments to the new regulatory authority and then to make appointments in accordance with those criteria. The criteria must relate to the composition of the authorities as a whole rather than to requirements that would be common to each individual member. If my understanding is correct, the high-level criteria that the Secretary of State will use to make decisions about appointments to the Gas and Electricity Markets Authority and to the Telecommunications Authority are clear. They are to ensure that the authority has the right mix of skills, perspective and experience to make it an effective regulator of the utility sector.
<P>
The right mix of skills and experience is likely to change as the industry changes. We have already noted that the utility sector is fast moving. For example, the demands on the Telecom regulator today are not the same as they were 10 or 15 years ago. Publishing the criteria, as suggested in the amendments, would require specifying more detailed criteria for the appointment of members and would restrict the skills that the Secretary of State could consider in choosing appointments to the fast-moving commercial telecoms market. In other words, the skill mix could be completely out of date.
<P>
One of the strengths of the Bill is that it allows flexibility in respect of the size and composition of the regulatory authorities. That flexibility is there for a reason—to ensure that the make-up of each authority meets the specific requirements of the office, which can change over time in response to developments. The amendments could damage that important element of flexibility.
<P>
The Government will make appointments to authorities with a view to ensuring that they have the necessary breadth of skills, perspective and experience to make them effective regulators of the appropriate utility sector. It is likely that someone on the Telecommunications Authority will have telecoms experience and someone on the Gas and Electricity Markets Authority will have experience of the energy industry. Critically, however, members of the regulatory authorities are to be appointed in their own right as highly qualified individuals rather than as delegates from a particular sector representing a particular interest.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I am experiencing déjà vu, having heard the Minister for Competition and Consumer Affairs, in a debate on a previous employment Bill, explaining why it was decided to specify exactly the sort of people who should be appointed to particular bodies. It is strange the right hon. Lady has a brief from her Department saying exactly the opposite of what was said by the same Department approximately a year ago.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I am surprised that the hon. Gentleman is surprised. The regulations are about dealing with changes in a fast-moving industrial market sector that is changing its technology rapidly. The hon. Gentleman made a fair point half an hour ago about the need for regulation to change and diminish as competition is brought into play. That is precisely the reason for flexibility: the market will change, and losing flexibility will lose much of the advantage of the Bill. The amendments would jeopardise the skill mix of appointments to the regulatory authorities.
<P>
Amendment No. 14 would have two intended effects. It would require the Secretary of State to establish whether a person appointed to an authority has any interest that could prejudice the exercise of his duties. I remind the hon. Member for Lewes (Mr. Baker) of the Nolan requirements, which we debated earlier. The amendment would require that someone representing the interests of consumers, as set out in clause 8(3), be appointed to the regulatory authorities. That would incorporate four specific groups—the disabled or chronically sick, people of pensionable age, those on low incomes and those inhabiting rural areas—specified as types of consumer in clause 8(3). The authorities could become unwieldy or move in one particular direction rather than another. The Government must ensure that the requisite breadth of skills and experience are added to the overall complexion of the authorities, but I repeat that the authorities must not appoint people who could be perceived as delegates representing only one particular interest. That is why it is important to ensure that we maintain flexibility. I hope that I can reassure the hon. Gentleman that the Government want to ensure that we specify the right mix of skills and experience so that the needs of, for example, disadvantaged consumers are taken into account.

<P>
<B>Mr. Baker:</B> As I understand it, the Minister does not want one particular person to represent those four elements. I understand that. In a sense, the authority should have a broad remit to cover those elements. If that is what she is saying, I agree. Does she accept that to look after those consumers, the authority must address those elements? She must ensure that there is, loosely speaking, a duty on the authority to address those consumers' needs. That is what I want to achieve.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I understand what the hon. Gentleman wants to achieve, but if we include ``loosely speaking a duty'' in the Bill, it becomes a specific requirement, with the consequent difficulty that I explained earlier. It is important to ensure that those consumer interests are taken into account, but to operate in a quasi-delegated manner would remove from the Bill the necessary flexibility. In the social and environmental guidelines that the regulators will have to follow, it is incumbent on the regulatory authority to take into account the needs of, for example, disadvantaged consumers, but for the Bill to be over-prescriptive could weaken the authority's structure.
<P>
With regard to the second intended effect of the hon. Gentleman's amendment, I hope that I can reassure him that it is standard administrative practice to establish potential conflicts of interest, financial or otherwise, well in advance of making such appointments. I assure the Committee that what he seeks to achieve is already a matter of good administrative practice. It would therefore serve no useful purpose to amend the Bill. Although I concur with his sentiments, I shall have to resist his amendment.
<P>
The Government do not accept amendment No. 75. It would impose a range of obligations on candidates for appointment to the authority that go well beyond the Nolan requirements. In our view, it is essential to follow the Nolan procedures. Any potential conflict of interest will be reviewed before a decision is made to appoint any candidate and appropriate steps will have be taken to guard against a conflict on appointment. If the Nolan procedures change over time, there is no doubt that associated public appointments will change, too.
<P>
We must balance the requirements of Nolan with an individual's private rights in relation to his or her political views. We must be careful that we do not inhibit well-qualified individuals from taking the opportunity to serve in that capacity. As the hon. Member for South Dorset said, public life in Britain is—regardless of the tabloid headlines—by and large a remarkably straightforward and sleaze-free zone. We want to avoid putting into legislation inhibitors that stop people with a range of interests taking on the onerous responsibilities of public appointments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> Is the right hon. Lady saying that she does not believe that every candidate who has made a substantial donation to a political party should declare that before being appointed to a particular official body? Surely that is exactly what Nolan is insisting should happen.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> Under new party funding arrangements, they would have to declare any specific donations to political parties. Indeed, the Labour party makes a point of overtly publishing significant donations, which is the right way to do it. With regard to past interests, a member of an authority has to manage his or her affairs in a way that avoids a conflict of interests. At our first sitting, the hon. Member for South Dorset was explicit in pointing out certain areas where he may have a conflict of interests. I am grateful for that. We expect the same of those who acknowledge public appointments. Past interests could be of great benefit; people might have knowledge of an industry and related social, consumer or green interests. However, an interest that ceases on appointment cannot be said to constitute a conflict of interests. For those reasons, I urge the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I am disappointed by the Minister's response. These authorities have enormous powers and industry will be disappointed by her reply. There should be someone on the authority who understands the industries that they are regulating. As the right hon. Lady has today announced criteria for members of the authority, I see no reason why the announcement could not be made more formal through her acceptance of our amendment. She said that the mix might be out of date. But the Government can re-issue criteria when necessary, or before a new appointment, so that argument does not stand. There will be huge disappointment that the amendment is not being accepted.
<P>
<B>Mr. Baker:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for her response and for saying that she concurs with the sentiments of my amendments even if she does not want their provisions transferred to the Bill. I am happy to accept her assurances but I hope that before we finish this process she will give further details of how she envisages the membership structure of the authority.
<P>
The right hon. Lady talked about flexibility. I understand the need for it, but sometimes it can be interpreted as carte blanche for the Government of the day. I do not suggest that there is anything ulterior in her comments; far from it. Nevertheless, in my view it is always better to have a clear understanding of legislation than to leave it to regulations and other announcements subsequent to a Bill becoming law, only to discover that something that Members did not want to happen has happened. I hope that flexibility will be used sparingly.

<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Clause 84 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Schedule 1</center></H4>
<H4><center>The Gas and Electricity Markets Authority</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 29, in page 152, line 5, after `two', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and no more than five.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 13, in page 152, line 6, after `State', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`who shall be executive directors.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> One of the Opposition's main concerns about the Bill is that it will increase the cost of regulation. The Gas and Electricity Markets Authority is already being seen as more cottage-run than its two predecessors, and that is even before the new duties and guidelines have been imposed on it. Callum McCarthy, the Director General of Ofgem, has already spoken about the huge cost of the new combined authority. Answering a question from my hon. Friend the Member for South Dorset, he drew attention to Ofgem's £64.5 million budget for the year 2000–01, which my hon. Friend compared with the combined spend of £29.8 million by the Office of Electricity Regulation and the Office of Gas Supply only three years ago. The reason, according to the regulator, was redundancy payments to Offer's staff who were unwilling to move from Birmingham to London headquarters.
<P>
Our second concern is about the public choice theory that was touched on earlier. We worry that once established, the authority will grow and employ ever more highly paid staff and that this will lead to escalating costs which will in turn be borne by consumers.
<P>
The Green Paper states in proposal 7.2 on page 46:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The Government recognises the importance of ensuring that the level of resources available to the regulators, along with the flexibility that they have over how to deploy those resources is sufficient to enable them to regulate their sectors effectively, taking account of final decisions on reforms to the regulatory process.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
So there we have it. The Government intend to ensure that the regulators are fully funded.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for South Dorset referred earlier to the concern that the authorities will become expansionary because they will have the resources to do so. The Committee must therefore seek to cap authorities' expansionary tendencies. It is not sufficient to say that Callum McCarthy is a good chap and will not do this or the other, or that David Edmonds is a good chap who will not do something, or that Ian Byatt is—although I doubt that the Government will say that of Ian Byatt in view of his comments about their Bill. We cannot rely on the authorities not to expand because there will be subsequent appointees and the tendency in the public sector has always been to expand and empire-build. As a Committee, we must try to build caps into the Bill to prevent that. One proposal is to limit the number of authority members to five. That fits in with what the Government have said elsewhere.
<P>
Page 24 of the Government response states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The Green Paper canvassed views on three possible options: appointing a statutory advisory group to support each sectoral regulator; replacing individual regulators with small executive boards; and replacing individual regulators with small commissions.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Of the three options, the Government concluded that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``small executive boards of three full-time members should provide the most effective regulatory model for all the sectors covered in the Green Paper.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
So the Government's intention is clearly to limit the size of these authorities to three people.
<P>
There is no mention of three people in schedule 1. Amendment No. 29 would impose a cap—five—beyond what we expect the Government to want. The figure of five would give them scope to expand on what they say in the document. Some cap is imperative. If the Government were to propose a different cap, the Committee, or the House on Report, would consider it.
<P>
The average annual cost of running the various regulators in the past few years was £17.2 million for Offer, £11.4 million for Ofgas, and £10 million for Oftel. The regulatory impact assessment cites an extra £1.2 million annual running cost for the authority and an extra £3 million to £4 million for the consumer councils whose functions cannot be carried out by the regulator. Regulatory impact assessments are notoriously conservative in estimating the cost of regulation. Page 16 of the RIA states that £3 million to £4 million is only a provisional estimate. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Costs are likely to be higher if the councils decide to establish an extensive network of regional offices. In addition, there will be initial set-up costs estimated at between £3m and £7.5m . . . to cover such work as the installation of IT systems, staff recruitment, staff transfers and accommodation.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The tragedy is that these costs will pass to the consumer. That is the most important aspect of the amendments. We want to limit the numbers so that cost are not passed onto consumers. As always, they bear the brunt of excessive burdensome regulations. The assessment states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The costs of the consumer councils will be met, wherever possible, through licence fees and will ultimately be passed on to consumers.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The summary of the regulatory impact assessment states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Companies will be able to recover costs from consumers . . . All costs borne by regulators, but recovered from licence fees and ultimately borne by consumers.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is another of our concerns. If the number of people on the authority is not capped, costs will pass to the consumer.
<P>
