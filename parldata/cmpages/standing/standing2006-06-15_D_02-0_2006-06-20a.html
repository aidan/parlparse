<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000496"></a>The
Chairman:</b> We begin this morning by resuming the debate on
the Government&#146;s second programme motion. Debate may last for no
more than the seven minutes remaining of the 30. I call the hon. Member
for Solihull (Lorely Burt) to resume her
speech.</div>
<a name="0606215000032"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0606215000497"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Crispin Blunt</b> (Reigate) (Con): On a point of order, Mr.
Illsley. Happily, the opportunity afforded to us by the break in the
debate allowed me to consult &#147;Erskine May&#148; and pick up a
point that I should have picked up when we began to discuss the second
motion in the Programming
Sub-Committee.</div><a name="0606215000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
motion is so substantially the same as that rejected by the Committee
last week that it is my contention that it is out of order. Page 388 of
&#147;Erskine May&#148;, which refers to matters that have already
been decided during the same Session,
says:</div><a name="0606215000449"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Whether
the second motion is substantially the same as the first is finally a
matter for the judgment of the Chair.&#148;</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column19" />Column number: 20</div><a name="0606215000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">If we are considering a motion that is
substantially the same as the first, I would contend that altering the
time-out for the Committee by only one hour, as is self-evidently the
case, means that this motion has already been substantially decided on
by the Committee.</div><a name="0606215000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
point of substance here is that the Opposition are anxious that the
Government and their draftsmen should have enough time to come forward
with their amendments on the consolidation effect. We see the summer
recess as an opportunity for that and we would like the out-date to be
not 13 July, but 19
October.</div><a name="0606215000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is the
substantive point, but the technical and procedural one is
self-evident&#151;this is substantially the same motion. It has
already been rejected by the Committee and cannot be put to us
again.</div>
<a name="0606215000037"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000498"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I have listened to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
point and, obviously, taken advice on the issue in the short time that
I had available this morning. Given that we are now some 23 minutes
into the 30-minute allocation of time for the programme motion and that
the Programming Sub-Committee has already agreed that
motion&#151;albeit with some reservations on the part of the
Opposition&#151;I am not prepared to reverse the decision that I made
to consider the programme
motion.</div><a name="0606215000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">In my view,
this is not a procedural issue as such. It is a matter for debate as to
whether the programme motion has substantially altered. I have made the
ruling and will stick with it. We will continue with the motion as it
stands.</div><a name="0606215000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the
substantive point of extending the out-date, we rehearsed that last
Thursday in the Programming Sub-Committee and in the opening debate.
Obviously, there may well be a further meeting of the Programming
Sub-Committee, when the hon. Gentleman will again have the opportunity
to press for further time for the Bill. At the moment, that is still in
the hands of the usual channels. I hope that deals with his
point.</div>
<a name="0606215000040"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000499"></a>Mr.
Blunt:</b> Further to that point of order, Mr. Illsley. I have
to accept your
ruling.</div><a name="0606215000041"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0606215000500"></a><b class="B">Lorely
Burt</b> (Solihull) (LD): I am heartened by your words, Mr.
Illsley, regarding the possible flexibility on further time. As I was
saying in the previous sitting, we are disappointed, particularly in
view of the fact that the Bill has been seven years in gestation, and
four more days to get the consolidation right would have been helpful,
not least for the civil servants, who need the
time.</div><a name="0606215000042"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000501"></a>The
Minister for Industry and the Regions (Margaret Hodge):</b>
This morning, we are anxious to proceed with the meat of the clauses
that we must consider, and we in the Government are keen to reach
agreement with other parties represented in Committee. If we can, we
will have further discussions about additional time. If we can reach an
understanding, we will return to the Committee with a fresh programme
motion. It is probably best if we reach such an outstanding outside the
Committee and get on with the Bill today.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column20" />Column number: 21</div><a name="0606215000043"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000502"></a>Lorely
Burt:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for those words. She
began by saying that we will be considering the Bill in a spirit of
conciliation, so I hope that we can achieve that. Without further ado,
I shall sit down and let us get on with our
consideration.</div><a name="0606215000044"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

Jonathan Djanogly</b> (Huntingdon) (Con): Following a somewhat
unsatisfactory set of preliminaries, in which I sat in awe at the
dexterity and skill of my hon. Friend the Member for Reigate (Mr.
Blunt), we move on.</div><a name="0606215000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Illsley, and look forward to receiving
your help over the coming weeks, as well as that of Mr. Bercow. I want
to make a few brief preliminary remarks, starting by declaring my
interests as they appear in the
register.</div><a name="0606215000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">We welcome
the Minister to her first Department of Trade and Industry Bill in her
new role and look forward to working with her and other members of the
Committee in the spirit of co-operation that she expressed last
Thursday on behalf of the Government.
</div><a name="0606215000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">For the largest Bill
on record, we have assembled a crack team of my hon. Friends, boasting
no fewer than four lawyers, of whom three have corporate experience; a
corporate accountant; and a colleague with good experience as a company
director. Their experience will, I am sure, greatly help our
deliberations. We have put on record our concerns and noted the lack of
understanding in relation to the programme motion, but short as time
may therefore be, I am sure that we shall all end up somewhat the wiser
at the end of the process.</div>
<a name="0606215000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">The issues in the Bill are many.
Perhaps they are mainly technical, but they are certainly important in
establishing and improving the framework in which British companies can
operate in a secure, efficient, low regulatory and competitive
environment. So the journey begins, and I address first the question,
which is clause 8 stand part.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column21" />Column number: 22</div><a name="0606215000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause in effect replaces
section 2 of the Companies Act 1985 and deals with the memorandum of
association. That document, of course, deals with the company&#146;s
relationship with the outside world, as opposed to the articles of
association, which regulate the relationship between the company, its
members and its officers. The clause retains the requirement that
individuals who wish to form a company must subscribe their names to
the memorandum of association.</div>
<a name="0606215000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">The memorandum now serves a more
limited purpose and evidences the intention of the subscribers to the
memorandum to form a company and to become members of that company on
formation. In the case of a company that is to be limited by shares,
the memorandum will also provide evidence of the members&#146;
agreement to take at least one share each in the
company.</div><a name="0606215000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">In Grand
Committee in the Lords, addressing a different amendment, Lord
Sainsbury explained how that came
about:</div><a name="0606215000450"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It may
be worth setting out what the memorandum of a company will be under the
Bill. The Company Law Review looked very carefully at the question of
the company&#146;s constitution. It was keen to see the
company&#146;s internal rules as far as possible set out logically in
one place and pointed out the potential for overlap under current
arrangements between a company&#146;s memorandum and its
articles.</div> <a name="0606215000451"></a><div class="hs_brev">In taking
forward those valuable suggestions, we wanted to do away with any scope
for confusion between the memorandum and the articles, and introduce a
clear distinction between the information in the memorandum, which will
be in effect an historical snapshot, which, once provided, has no
continuing relevance, and the constitution of the company
properly-so-called, as contained essentially in its articles, which
will be of real significance in the company&#146;s
life.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 30
January 2006; Vol. 678, c.
GC3-4.]</div><a name="0606215000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">We agree with
all that. The importance of the memorandum in the context of setting
out a company&#146;s relationship with outside parties and the once
hallowed ultra vires implications have in practice been somewhat
whittled down over the years by a mixture of precedent and statute. In
reality, the wide use of non-specific object clauses means that
confusion was setting in with the mainly older and specialist companies
that retain specific objects. However, the Bill represents a halfway
house.</div><a name="0606215000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">We say that the
mere formality of noting a corporation is fine, but ask why it needs a
different document. That was partially addressed on Report in the Lords
by Government amendment No. 3, which merged clause 9(4)(a)(i) and (ii)
and reduced two filing documents to one. But why do we need a
memorandum at all? Let us simply get rid of it and insert the
information required by clause 8 in the first articles of association,
which will always need to be filed at the same time in any event. That
would bring further simplicity and be in the deregulatory spirit of the

amendment to that effect&#151;perhaps the poor drafting meant it

fact that it was not accepted, I would be grateful to hear the

Howarth</b> (Cambridge) (LD): I welcome you, Mr. Illsley, to
the Chair of this important and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column22" />Column number: 23</div>potentially long-running Committee, and I welcome the Minister to her
new post. This must be the most strenuous first Bill that a Minister
could have faced in a new job.</div>
<a name="0606215000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">I echo the remarks of the hon.
Gentleman, who said that the Bill not only clarifies many issues of
company law, but is economically important. If such a Bill were to go
wrong, it might lose companies millions of pounds in litigation. That
is why I support what he said about clause 8.</div>
<a name="0606215000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">The company law review has taken
a long time, and it has taken up vast amounts of effort&#151;not
least the time of many of my erstwhile academic colleagues. Its purpose
is to simplify company law. It is surprising that something as obvious
as the difference between articles and memorandums of association has
not been abolished. Multiplying various documents does not seem to be
an obvious way to regulate company law. I therefore ask the Minister
why the Government still think it important to have a number of
separate documents on registration in respect of not only the clause,
but other clauses in this part of the Bill.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000523"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> I welcome the general remarks made by those who
speak for the Opposition parties. I look forward to getting on with the
meat of this complex Bill.</div>
<a name="0606215000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">It might not surprise the
Committee that I asked precisely the same question about clause 8. I do
not know whether my question was the result of my naivety in trying to
get to grips with the matter or whether it was sensible. All I can do
is offer the response given by my officials.</div>
<a name="0606215000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was told that after
discussions across the board with interested parties, and after the Law
Commission review of company law, everyone felt that it was important
to preserve the fundamental principle of company law&#151;it has been
part of our law for ever&#151;that a company is an association. As a
result, we decided to keep the memorandum. It is almost a historical
document. Once set, it can never be amended. It is a record of the fact
that people have come together in an association and agreed to form a
company.</div> <a name="0606215000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
principle provides the flexibility that I am told is the key feature
that underpins company law. However, information on how functions and
powers are allocated between directors and members of companies will in
future be in not the memorandum, but the articles of association. Other
information contained in the 1985-style memorandum will be provided in
the form of a statement. To underpin that principle, which informs all
company law, we have kept the memorandum, although its purpose will be
very
different.</div><a name="0606215000086"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000524"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I hear what the Minister says, and I thank her
for her response. She spoke about preserving and underpinning the
principle, but if there is no practical or legal reason for it, why
should not the Government reconsider the matter? She might like to have
another look at it.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column23" />Column number: 24</div><a name="0606215000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">We support the principle of
moving away from a memorandum. If we are going to go half
way&#151;this will come up in later amendments&#151;it could be
confusing to have half of it left over. Why not get rid of it and move
on? I hear what the Minister says, but she might like to have a rethink
before consideration on
Report.</div><a name="0606215000088"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000525"></a>Margaret

9</h4><a name="0606215000006"></a><div class="hs_7SmCapsHdg">Registration
documents</div><a name="0606215000091"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000526"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 2, in clause 9, page
4, line 16, leave out paragraph (b) and
insert&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel2">&#145;(b) the address in
the United Kingdom where the registered office is to be
situated,'.</div><a name="0606215000092"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000527"></a>The
Chairman:</b> With this it will be convenient to discuss
amendment No. 64, in clause 86, page 36,line 29, after
&#145;office', insert &#145;in the United
Kingdom'.</div><a name="0606215000093"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000528"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> The clause replaces sections 2 and 10 of the
1985 Act, which refer exclusively to the delivery of a memorandum. The
Bill changes how certain information is delivered: information that is
set out in the memorandum will be provided to the registrar in
accordance with the clause, which describes, among other things, the
contents of an application for registration. It states that the
application must contain a statement of the intended address of the
company&#146;s registered office and a copy of any proposed articles
of association.</div><a name="0606215000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
probing Opposition amendment tabled in Grand Committee in the Lords was
designed to find out why companies will need to state their country of
incorporation, as an objective of the Bill is to extend company law to
the whole of the UK. We feel that that point merits further
discussion.</div> <a name="0606215000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
application for registration, which is covered by amendment No. 2, and
the resulting registered office, which is covered by amendment No. 64,
must be in England, Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland, as set out in
part 6. In this globalised age, we are trying to simplify rules as much
as possible to facilitate companies doing business. One reason for
doing so is the certificate of incorporation, which will often need to
be sent to overseas companies or used in legal opinions to validate the
existence or good standing of a
company.</div><a name="0606215000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the clause
stands, the certificate will say that a company is incorporated in
England and Wales, in Scotland or in Northern Ireland. Frankly, that
could be confusing for foreigners, who like to think that they are
dealing with the United Kingdom. It would therefore 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column24" />Column number: 25</div>be easier if the certificate said, &#147;Registered in the United
Kingdom.&#148; That is what the amendments would
achieve.</div><a name="0606215000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">In Committee
in the Lords, it was mentioned that non-company laws, such as
insolvency laws, vary between the countries of the UK. In trying to
move the Lords debate on a bit, I say to the Minister that insolvency
processes can be started in any country, in the same way that a
Scottish and French company could agree to a contract under English
law. I am therefore not sure why it is necessary to have the country of
incorporation on the certificate. I ask the Government to consider the
issue.</div><a name="0606215000098"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000529"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> As the hon. Gentleman said, the matter was
considered in Committee in the Lords. I appreciate the motivation that
underpins the reconsidered amendment before us, because in a sense it
seems overly bureaucratic to require that an application for
registration must state whether the company&#146;s office is to be
registered in England and Wales, in Wales, in Scotland or in Northern
Ireland.</div><a name="0606215000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the hon.
Gentleman said, the main reason for that is that there are three
separate jurisdictions within the UK. He mentioned the need for clarity
for the international interests that will be involved in the operation
of UK companies, but I put the opposite point to him. For an
international organisation or somebody from abroad who wishes to engage
with a company in the UK, it will be more helpful to know which
jurisdiction they will have to deal with rather than have to attempt to
find out for themselves whether the jurisdiction is English and Welsh,
Scottish or Northern Irish. That will bring clarity to the increasingly
international nature of business
dealings.</div><a name="0606215000100"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0606215000530"></a><b class="B">Mr.
David Jones</b> (Clwyd, West) (Con): Appreciating all that the
Minister says about the jurisdictional points, is it not the case that
England and Wales is a unified jurisdiction? Why, therefore, is it
necessary to distinguish between England and Wales, and Wales?
Admittedly, there are certain language requirements in Wales, but that
is not a jurisdictional point. It is purely a procedural
one.</div>
<a name="0606215000101"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000531"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> We have put that particular facility in place
because it will give a company the opportunity to opt for the
jurisdiction in which it wishes to operate. A company may want to take
advantage of special provisions that might apply, for example, to Welsh
companies. Taking the example of the Welsh language, a company may wish
to use the Welsh equivalent of &#147;limited&#148; or
&#147;plc&#148;, and provided it gives a translation, the company
may then file documents in Welsh. If a company wishes to do that, I see
no reason why we should remove or widen that
concession.</div><a name="0606215000102"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000532"></a>Mr.
Jones:</b> I appreciate that fully, but surely this is not a
jurisdictional point. It is a matter of procedure and the filing of
documents. It does not relate to jurisdiction because England and Wales
are a unified
jurisdiction.</div><a name="0606215000103"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000533"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> My notes say that it is a jurisdictional point, and
if a company wishes to take 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column25" />Column number: 26</div>advantage of the legal facilities that are available through
incorporation in Wales, it can do so. If the legal facilities are Welsh
facilities, we must spell that out in the place in which the company
incorporates itself.</div><a name="0606215000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
company pleading insolvency could start insolvency litigation wherever
it wished to do so. The hon. Member for Huntingdon (Mr. Djanogly) is
right in principle, but there is a strong presumption in EU insolvency
regulation that it is proper to start insolvency proceedings in the
place of incorporation. He will also know, if he has read the House of
Lords debate, that not only insolvency legislation, but property
legislation and disputes over registers, differ between the legislative
frameworks for the separate
nations.</div><a name="0606215000105"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0606215000534"></a><b class="B">Justine
Greening</b> (Putney) (Con): I am slightly confused by the
Minister&#146;s comments about jurisdiction, mainly because, for
example, in part 16, which deals with the auditor offence that is being
introduced by the Government, there are separate clauses for England
and Wales, for Northern Ireland and for Scotland, but no separate
clause for Wales. I seek clarification as to whether the jurisdictional
position is separate, or indeed joint, for England and
Wales.</div><a name="0606215000106"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000535"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> Separate parts of legislation may have a Wales-only
implication. I am referring in particular to the desire of a company to
do business in the Welsh language. That might be particular to Wales.
Other legislation will be relevant to companies where the jurisdiction
in England and Wales is the same. I do not dispute that, but if there
are clauses that are specific to Wales, we should not limit the
capacity of a company that wishes to choose to incorporate in Wales to
do so. That is all we are trying to
do.</div><a name="0606215000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">The requirement to
state the jurisdiction in which the company&#146;s registered office
is situated might appear bureaucratic and purposeless, but in fact it
is much needed. It is neither outmoded nor, if I may say so, trivial.
If the amendment were adopted, other amendments would be needed to
determine, when relevant, the law applicable in the part of the UK in
which the registered office was
located.</div><a name="0606215000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
64 is unnecessary because a company&#146;s registered office must
always be in the jurisdiction chosen when it was incorporated. There is
no provision for the change of jurisdiction. A company&#146;s
registered office can be changed only by giving notice to the
registrar, so it is impossible for the registered office to be moved
elsewhere.</div><a name="0606215000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">With that
explanation and response to issues raised by hon. Members, I hope that
the amendment will be
withdrawn.</div><a name="0606215000460"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.30

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000536"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> My hon. Friend the Member for Clwyd, West (Mr.
Jones) made an important point: we have to differentiate between
jurisdiction and mechanics. He made that point
well.</div><a name="0606215000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">One of the better
aspects of the Bill is the merger of Northern Ireland with England and
Wales for the purposes of company law. That will save time and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column26" />Column number: 27</div>provide transparency. We thought that the amendment went down the same
route. The Minister has a point: the proposed changes would require
knock-on amendments. However, we do not believe that the amendment is
any worse because of that. Nevertheless, I hear what she says, and I am
pleased that we have had the debate. On that basis, I beg to ask leave
to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="0606215000112"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000537"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 3, in clause 10,
page 5, line 2, leave out subsection (1) and
insert&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(1) The articles of
association of a company on its incorporation shall contain a
statement, which must comply with this
section.'.</div><a name="0606215000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause relates to sections 2(5)(a) and (c), 6 and (6A) of the Companies
Act 1985 and effectively accepts a recommendation by the company law
review to abolish the requirement on a company to have an authorised
share capital. In future, the memorandum will contain only a limited
amount of information on a company&#146;s founder members&#151;the
subscribers to the memorandum. Information about the shares subscribed
for by them, which is currently set out in the memorandum itself, will
in future be provided to the registrar in the form of two statements
made inthe application for registration&#151;one of initial
shareholders, and one of share
capital.</div><a name="0606215000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">The statement
of initial shareholdings must contain the names and addresses of the
subscribers to the memorandum. In all cases, the requirement is for a
contact address. House of Lords amendments took issue over the point at
which names and addresses of initial shareholders of a company should
first be published. The Bill required that to be at the point of
formation, but the amendments would require it to be at the time of the
first annual return.</div><a name="0606215000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
noble Friends argued that it was better to have a later declaration
when it was more meaningful than one at the formation of the company,
as the Government argued, when individuals were often essentially
nominees. We do not intend to review that debate. However, to return to
an earlier point, why is there the need for a separate form? We think
that the Bill should be about limiting forms to the bare
minimum.</div><a name="0606215000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">In any event,
newly formed companies will often include in their articles details of
the share capital on incorporation. So making that compulsory and
removing the form would be uncontroversial. That form might be linked
to the implementation of the EU second company law directive 77/91/EC,
but I do not see why that could not be complied with by using the
articles to provide the information, rather than another
form.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column27" />Column number: 28</div><a name="0606215000119"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000538"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> It is important that we consider clause 10 against
the background of other provisions, particularly those in part 19 on
share capital, which requires certain types of company to provide an
updated statement of subscribed capital whenever the subscribed capital
changes. The statement required in clause 10 is essentially a snapshot
taken at the time of the formation of the company, as the hon.
Gentleman said. It is likely to be superseded over time by further
statements of the same sort&#151;for example, if new shares are
allotted or the company&#146;s share capital is reorganised. The
question then becomes where those statements should appear. The choice
seems to be among the memorandum, the articles or, as the Bill
provides, a separate statement. I shall explain why we believe that a
separate statement is the right
approach.</div><a name="0606215000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">As we have
discussed, the memorandum will contain nothing other than the
historical information. As the statement of capital will change over
time, that does not appear to be the appropriate place in which to put
the statement. On the face of it, as the hon. Gentleman said, using the
articles makes more sense. I can see why he is attracted to the logic
of that argument. Articles contain information of ongoing relevance
about the company and may, on occasion, need to be
updated.</div><a name="0606215000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, there
is a requirement in the law that whenever any element of the articles
is changed, a full new and updated copy of the articles has to be
produced and filed with Companies House. That requirement is sensible,
ensuring that those who need to consult the articles will never need to
look in more than one place to understand all the provisions contained
in them, but the implications could be onerous if the statement of
capital was involved. Some companies may well change their subscribed
capital frequently, and certainly more frequently than we would expect
them to change other elements of their articles. It would be excessive
to require them to produce a fully revised new set of articles every
time they changed their share
capital.</div><a name="0606215000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have taken
a pragmatic approach. The Bill provides for the statement to be an
independent element of information that will appear separately on the
Companies House register and which will be easier to identify by
searchers of the
register.</div><a name="0606215000123"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000539"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I agree with the Minister. On an ongoing basis,
it would be very onerous for most companies to have to refile their
articles every time they changed their share capital, although
manylarge companies do exactly that. However, I thought that
we were discussing the statement of initial shareholdings&#151;the
shareholdings that the company is incorporated with&#151;rather than
the position on an ongoing basis. I appreciate that there might have to
be a form on an ongoing basis, but that should not have to be the case
on day
one.</div><a name="0606215000124"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000540"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> If the statement of initial shareholdings were
incorporated into the articles of association, which I think is what
the hon. Gentleman is talking about, it would become an integral part
of the articles of association, so any change to them would mean that
all the articles would have to be changed. We propose a separate
statement.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column28" />Column number: 29</div><a name="0606215000125"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000541"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> The practice of most companies that put their
initial share capital into the articles is that the first time they
change them, they remove it at that point, so rather than being an
ongoing obligation, it would probably be a one-off when the company was
recapitalised for the first
time.</div><a name="0606215000126"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000542"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> I think that that would of itself become extremely
bureaucratic and the statement of share capital could well be out of
date on day one after the company was incorporated. Having a separate
statement from the beginning is clearer. There may be variants of view
on that, but we believe that it will be simpler to update the statement
if it is separate, not least if the company chooses to use electronic
means to do so. I hope that, having had that little exchange, the hon.
Gentleman will withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="0606215000127"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000543"></a>Mr.

5, line 30, leave out from &#145;contain' to end of line 31 and

prescribed for the purpose of identifying the subscribers to the
memorandum of
association'.</div><a name="0606215000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment arises from a debate that took place on Report in another
place, when the Bill was amended to remove the requirement for
subscribers&#146; names and addresses and the statement of capital
and initial shareholdings. That requirement was replaced with a power
that would enable the Secretary of State, in regulations that can be
made under the Bill, to prescribe the types of information that are to
be provided in the statement of capital and initial shareholdings for
the purpose of identifying the subscribers to the memorandum of
companies to be formed with share capital. Consistent with that
approach taken to companies that are to have a share capital on
formation, the amendment carries forward the principle that the
Secretary of State should be able to specify what is required for the
purposes of identifying the subscribers, where it is proposed that a
company will be formed as a company limited by guarantee.</div>
<a name="0606215000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">As we mentioned in the other
place, we envisage that the power will be used initially to continue to
require the names and addresses of the subscribers to be provided. Both
the Serious Fraud Office and the companies investigation branch have
confirmed to us that that information is useful in combating fraud, and
we see no reason not to retain it as a requirement for the time being.
The address, as now, does not need to be a residential address; a
contact address is sufficient. The power will provide flexibility for
the future if, for example, it is concluded that the requirement for 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column29" />Column number: 30</div>subscribers&#146; addresses is no longer necessary. The power could be
used to remove that requirement or to provide for an alternative or for
better information pertaining to a subscriber&#146;s
identity.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000548"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> It looks like the Government have something to
say on this clause as well, but I shall kick off. The clause replaces
section 10 of the 1985 Act. In 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column30" />Column number: 31</div>so far as it coincides with the question of authorised signatories, I
note that the Chairman has chosen also to include amendments to clause
44.</div> <a name="0606215000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are two
basic regulatory changes to consider. First, as recommended by the CLR,
once the legislation is in force all directors will have the option of
having their home addresses kept on a separate record to which access
is restricted. To benefit from that option, a director will have to
provide a service address for the public record. We will discuss that
in detail under part 10.</div>
<a name="0606215000461"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.45
am</div><a name="0606215000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, as
recommended by the CLR, the Bill reflects the abolition of the
requirement for private companies to have a secretary. We will debate
that in further detail when we get to part 12. There is a consequential
issue concerning company secretaries&#151;I repeat that this will be
debated in greater detail later&#151;namely whether, if a private
company decides to have a non-statutory company secretary, it should
then have to notify particulars. Lord Sainsbury said emphatically in
the Lords Grand Committee that it should not. On Report in the Lords,
Lord Hodgson said:</div>
<a name="0606215000452"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#145;&#147;Our position on
this is simple&#151;where a company chooses to have a secretary, that
secretary should be fully empowered to exercise all the functions and
bear all the responsibilities of a legally required
secretary.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, House of
Lords,</i>9 May 2006; Vol. 681, c.
782.]</div><a name="0606215000158"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"></i>I restate that as
our position today. As Lord Hodgson said on Third Reading:</div>
<a name="0606215000453"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The lack of any
requirement for the registration of secretaries will leave those that
still exist in limbo, with no official recognition of their
status.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 23 May
2006; Vol. 682, c. 710.]</div><a name="0606215000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">Lord
Sainsbury said that the only time third parties should need to know the
information about a secretary is when executing documents. Technically,
the Minister may have been right, although
practically&#151;particularly for larger companies and for corporate
governance purposes&#151;we do not think that he was. That will be
the debate on part
12.</div><a name="0606215000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">On Third Reading in
the Lords, Lord Sainsbury addressed the question of secretaries and
others signing documents in detail. He said that the Government would
consult on four issues. He stated:</div>
<a name="0606215000454"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;There are four questions
that need to be addressed with this group of amendments. First, who
should be able to execute documents for a company? Secondly, and
related to the first, if private companies appoint a secretary, should
that secretary be able to participate in the execution of documents for
the company? Thirdly, should the details of any secretary voluntarily
appointed by a private company be on the public record? Fourthly, and
finally, if private companies appoint a secretary, should the directors
be under an express duty, imposed by the Bill, to secure that the
secretary is a person who appears to them to have the requisite
knowledge and experience to discharge the functions of a
secretary?&#148; &#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, House of
Lords,</i>23 May 2006; Vol. 682, c.
711.]</div><a name="0606215000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those were fair
questions and we looked forward to hearing the response to the results
of the consultation. Unfortunately, it seems that the Government
decided not to answer those questions or, rather, by coming out with
their proposal for authorised signatories, said that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column31" />Column number: 32</div>they were all answered. We do not think that that is adequate. I know
that the Government have been under time pressure during the
consultation but20 complicated Government amendments were
filed a few days ago and we have not been able to consult on them. So,
as far as we are concerned, it has not been a good start to
consideration of this clause.</div>
<a name="0606215000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, it is clear that the
Government are moving on from the concept of the company secretary to
that of the authorised signatory. We believe that there is room for
both. Having made that clear, and on the basis that we want to return
to this issue when considering part 12, let me move on to the
provisions relating to authorised signatories.</div>
<a name="0606215000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">I note the position of the
Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators, which put a
strong case in its note of 15 June 2006. It said:</div>
<a name="0606215000455"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The proposed authorised
signatory regime may provide further flexibility to some companies, but
this new regime will not suit all private companies. The authorised
signatory, as proposed in the draft clauses from the DTI, is a
different beast to a secretary and can sign any document on behalf of
the company. This contrasts with the secretary&#146;s automatic
powers, which beyond their statutory powers, have been established in
case law to be limited to signing documents of an administrative
nature.&#148;</div><a name="0606215000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Secretary of State made clear on Second Reading that he supports the
optional regime, but he and many others may not have realised that all
the statutory power of a secretary of a private company has been
completely stripped away by the Company Law Reform Bill as drafted.
Where the board of a private company wants the secretary to continue in
his position post the enactment of the Bill, it will find that all the
secretary&#146;s automatic statutory powers under the 1985 Act to
certify and execute documents and file returns to Companies House will
no longer exist. For any of the 2 million private companies that find
their secretary useful and want to continue to employ such a person,
there will be the confusing burden of having to set up appropriate
authorisations to try to mimic the current statutory powers that are
well understood. The new burden will bring complication, not
simplification. A secretary remains an officer of the company, so his
statutory powers should be clear along with his
liabilities.</div><a name="0606215000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">Should
such a company want to appoint a secretary, there is no provision for
it to register the appointment at Companies House. Registration is
essential, as it provides an easy authorisation check for third parties
dealing with the secretary. It is common sense that the automatic
powers under the 1985 Act should continue to apply to those secretaries
who continue in their position, and it should be possible to register
future secretary appointments at Companies House. It is not difficult
to amend the Bill to capture the idea that private companies have a
choice as to whether to have a secretary, and that the existing powers
will apply if they do have one. It will be far more burdensome and
confusing for companies if the Bill is left as
drafted.</div><a name="0606215000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">These are
important points. In fact, the more I consider the subject, the more I
wonder why we need an either/or approach. Why not retain the secretary
regime for those companies that have them, which admittedly will be far
fewer after the Bill comes into effect, but also put in place an
authorised signatory regime?</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column32" />Column number: 33</div><a name="0606215000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having said that, we do not have
a problem in principle with the concept of the new authorising
signatory regime per se, but given the lack of time&#151;those
comments were received in the brief time since the amendments were
tabled&#151;I must reserve our right to come back on the detail of
the provisions on Report. I look forward to hearing the
Minister&#146;s explanation of how the separate register and
execution powers will work in
practice.</div><a name="0606215000168"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000549"></a>Lorely
Burt:</b> I preface my questions with an admission that I am
not a lawyer&#151;far from it&#151;and as my hon. Friend the Member
for Cambridge has been unavoidably called away, I ask for the patience
of the Committee. I shall do my best to put the points that we wish to
make.</div><a name="0606215000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">We want to
understand the difference that amendments Nos. 4 and 47 would make to
what has been proposed. The intention appears to be to set up the
possibility that the distinction between companies required to have
company secretaries and those not so required should rest on something
other than the fact that the company is or is not a public company. Our
position is that it is right to remove the requirement from private
companies, but there may be an argument from other parties that very
large companies should have a secretary even if they are private
companies.</div><a name="0606215000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government amendments, including the new clauses, appear to create a
new authorised signature regime for companies, presumably in response
to the complaint that removing the need for company secretaries will
lead to confusion about who is authorised to sign documents on behalf
of the company. In effect, they will allow companies to say that people
other than directors are also authorised and to put those names on a
register that other people can see. We are not entirely convinced that
this is technically necessary, but people may genuinely be confused by
the new
situation.</div><a name="0606215000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 51, which would amend clause 44, continues the company secretary
debate, but it seems to conflict with clause 12. Amendment No. 52,
which could be a drafting amendment, would make it clear that a
document is associated with the company and not anyone else. We want to
understand why that is important if a single director could sign in the
presence of a
witness.</div><a name="0606215000172"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000550"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs (Vera
Baird):</b> The hon. Gentleman argued that there will be some
difficulty for companies if the first secretary of a private company is
not included in the statement of proposed officers. There is a long
debate to come about that. However, as his amendment is consequential
to later amendments relating both to the execution of documents and to
private company secretaries, I shall start by addressing who can act
for a company in the execution of documents. I shall pause there, as
some specific points have been made.</div>
<a name="0606215000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">First, let me be glad that the
hon. Gentleman has no problem with the concept of authorised
signatures, except in the caveat that he has put forward, and
apparently neither does the hon. Lady, who merely asked whether it
would be confusing. In fact, it is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column33" />Column number: 34</div>probably a reasonably clear provision. Of the questions raised by Lord
Sainsbury, the three that are relevant were probably all answered. Who
can execute documents? If there is a company secretary in a private
company, there is case law to say that they can sign documents relating
to administrative matters, so that presents no problem. If the private
company makes their company secretary an authorised signatory, of
course they can sign in that capacity. The third question was whether
the company secretary has to go on record, to which the answer is yes
if they are an authorised signatory. I hope that is clear. I do not
think that the last point was relevant.</div>
<a name="0606215000174"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000551"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Looking at the remarks of Lord Sainsbury at
Grand Committee stage, most people would probably think that he wanted
to see how the concept of the company secretary could be built in,
whereas what came out of the mill, so to speak, was the total
cutting-out of company secretaries. That is the point that I was trying
to make.</div>
<a name="0606215000175"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000552"></a>Vera
Baird:</b> I think that is probably an interesting item for
the later debate, says she who is hopefully not conducting it. Who may
enter into a contract on behalf of the company is really entirely a
matter for each company&#146;s internal organisation, and it is
wholly a matter for the company how, and by whom, its official seal is
affixed for the purposes of contracts.</div>
<a name="0606215000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">The ability to execute documents
by the signature of two directors, or one director and a secretary has
been available since 1989. The nub is the nature of the alternative
proposed in clause 44 to affixing the seal for execution of
documents&#151;that is, signature by two directors, or by one and a
witness. The point of the provision was to grant new flexibility and
allow a signature by a single director&#151;that, I think, was how it
went into the Lords&#151;as long as that was duly witnessed, with no
restriction on who may witness it. However, it has been pointed
out&#151;we have taken this on board&#151;that that reduces
flexibility for private companies in certain, limited circumstances
since the witness and signatory have to be present together whereas the
directors, or the director and secretary, may sign
separately.</div> <a name="0606215000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">As nobody
wants to restrict flexibility, and as the whole point is to improve it,
we have considered the matter further. By discussing it with
stakeholders&#151;in particular, the City of London Law
Society&#151;we discovered that some public companies would value
having the freedom to authorise who can sign on their behalf, just as
they value their existing freedom to authorise who can put their seal
on. That freedom would be of particular benefit to private companies
that have only one director. Hence, we have gone further to introduce
more flexibility.</div> <a name="0606215000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government amendments will enable any company to appoint any number of
people to execute documents of any description on its behalf.
Directors, and in the case of public companies their secretaries, will
automatically be authorised signatories by virtue of their office,
although the company can appoint more such signatories if it wants. For
all companies executing deeds, the alternative to affixing their seal
will be either by the signature of two authorised signatories, or by
one in the presence of a witness. It is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column34" />Column number: 35</div>important that third parties know whether someone is authorised to sign,
which may be relevant long after the event.</div>
<a name="0606215000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">As for directors, the Bill
already requires a company to keep a public register of its directors
and file the information with the registrar. The same is the case with
secretaries of public companies. Government amendments Nos. 76 to 78
and Government new clauses 17 to 20 ensure that the name and address of
any authorised signatory is similarly on the public record at formation
and thereafter.</div>
<a name="0606215000180"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0606215000553"></a><b class="B">James
Brokenshire</b> (Hornchurch) (Con): I note that the Minister
said that it was important for third parties to know with whom they are
dealing, which obviously underpins the concept of authorised
signatories. I briefly return to the issue of company secretaries and
private companies. She said that case law states that company
secretaries could sign administrative documents. Does she accept that
third parties not familiar with case law may want something that is
more codified to assure third parties that a company secretary in a
private company is duly
authorised?</div><a name="0606215000181"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000554"></a>Vera
Baird:</b> If the company secretary of a private company is an
authorised signatory, it will be on the
record.</div>
<a name="0606215000182"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000555"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> And if
not?</div><a name="0606215000462"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11
am</div><a name="0606215000183"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000556"></a>Vera
Baird:</b> Then the hon. Gentleman probably makes a good
point, and I shall reflect upon it.</div>
<a name="0606215000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendments are intended to
enable a company to appoint any number of people to execute documents.
I am sorry to go back to this point, but it is important to make it
clear to third parties who can exercise that function: authorised
signatories will have to go on to the public record on formation of a
company and thereafter as they are appointed. The requirements of the
record will, I think, be the same as for public company secretaries,
except apparently it will not be necessary for a public company
secretary to be 16&#151;although I doubt whether that will be
relevant terribly
often.</div><a name="0606215000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">The proposals
have real attractions both to private and public companies. Several
public companies have made it clear they would find it useful to have
such a facility, especially those that have to execute lots of
documents&#151;for instance, banks issuing powers of attorney. It
will be possible for a private company appointing an individual to the
office of secretary to appoint the same individual as an authorised
signatory, but that would be entirely up to the company. On the other
hand, the abolition of the requirement to have a company secretary is
likely to lead to some private companies finding other ways to meet
their administrative
needs.</div><a name="0606215000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">In recommending
abolition of the requirement to appoint a company secretary, the
company law review argued that it would give greater flexibility. A few
large companies will of course continue to have secretaries; and it is
likely that such companies will use the facility 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column35" />Column number: 36</div>provided by this group of amendments to give the secretary the authority
to execute documents, so secretaries would have that authority as they
now do under the Act.</div>
<a name="0606215000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, about 1 million private
companies have only one director and a secretary, and more than half of
them have fewer than five shareholders. Such companies are likely to
use the flexibility provided by the Bill in other ways. It is possible
that people would appoint secretaries only to cover peak periods, and
in such situations they might not want them to be able to execute
documents. Others might divide the function between two or more people,
who may or may not be directors; or the directors might appoint a
secretary but not want that person to be an authorised signatory. We
want to give all companies the maximum freedom as to who can execute
documents. Such flexibility will be useful.</div>
<a name="0606215000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not know if this answers
the hon. Member for Hornchurch (James Brokenshire), but we are not
codifying who can sign. As an agent, that would be an immense and
unnecessary task. Companies enter into transactions at every level
every day, but we are talking about formal contracts, and the case law
relates to agencies. Does that help?</div>
<a name="0606215000189"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000557"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I was seeking some transparency and clarity
about the role of the company secretary. If there is case law&#151;if
there is some uncertainty as to whether the secretary of a private
company can sign a formal contractual document&#151;it is important
to have clarity about the continuing role of the secretary. We need to
know whether such people are duly authorised to sign formal documents
without the need to go through the formality of becoming an authorised
signatory, and I am not sure that the Minister has addressed that
point.</div>
<a name="0606215000190"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000558"></a>Vera
Baird:</b> I do not think the hon. Gentleman needs to worry.
It is plain that a company secretary can sign because, under the new
system, the signature will be tendered on the basis that the person is
an authorised signatory. I shall try to develop the argument, as the
hon. Gentleman is obviously not entirely happy.</div>
<a name="0606215000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">Who may sign on behalf of a
company is a matter for the company. Who may sign as the
company&#151;that is what we are dealing with&#151;is limited by
statute and details will have to be on the record. A person can sign as
the company only if he is an authorised signature; it is for the
company to decide whether a person can sign day by day on its
behalf.</div><a name="0606215000192"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000559"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> Perhaps we can debate the subject more fully
when we come to part 12. A private company that has a company secretary
is now able to execute documents, under company seal or executed as
deeds, through the company director and the company secretary. Existing
private limited companies with secretaries who wish to retain them will
clearly face a further administrative burden inasmuch as the existing
secretary will now formally have to be appointed as an authorised
signatory. We are trying to raise such issues, and I shall develop that
point in more formal and further detail when we reach part
12.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column36" />Column number: 37</div><a name="0606215000193"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000560"></a>Vera
Baird:</b><b class="B"> </b>I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for
making it clear to what he was referring, but the increased flexibility
in the provisions overwhelmingly outweighs the need to appoint a
company secretary as an authorised signatory. The hon. Gentleman has
talked about formalities as if there is a great procedure to go
through, but I do not think so. Existing company secretaries of private
companies might or might not be allowed to be deemed authorised
signatories by virtue of their office&#151;we are still considering
that&#151;but new company secretaries and new private companies will
clearly follow the new regime of authorised signatories. Transitional
provisions are still a little up in the air, but I hope that that
satisfies the hon. Gentleman that we are still considering the
matter.</div> <a name="0606215000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">In view of the
maximum flexibility in the amendments, I hope that the hon. Gentleman
will withdraw his amendments and support those tabled by the
Government.</div>
<a name="0606215000195"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000561"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I said that we would need to look more closely
at the mechanics of the provisions&#151;that will obviously be
important&#151;rather than at the execution of the provisions per
se.</div> <a name="0606215000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">As regards company
secretaries, we are concerned that the provision could give rein to
confusion on the part of companies and the people who deal with them.
Until the new system beds down, there will be a dangerous transitional
stage as company secretaries will look to change companies&#146;
articles of association, as standard inserts will presumably be
prepared to go into articles to put back in place the powers that were
there under statute and under constitutions, and as different companies
will have different ways of doing things. The process of passing
resolutions and changing articles is regulatory by nature and will
involve costs to companies, as well as time.</div>
<a name="0606215000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was certainly interested to
hear that the Minister would consider the issue of existing company
secretaries. I am sure that they will be pleased to hear that, but from
a rational point of view I am not entirely sure that to differentiate
between existing company directors and training company directors is
the right route to follow.</div>
<a name="0606215000198"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000562"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> The hon. Gentleman alludes to a series of issues
that are part of the transition we shall have to reflect on as the Bill
moves towards becoming an Act. I hope he accepts our assurance that we
will be putting out regulations for the transitional arrangements.
There will be extensive consultation on the regulations, which will not
come into force until October 2007. We appreciate, as he does, that
there is a degree of complexity in getting the transition right for
existing companies. I hope he accepts that there will be extensive
consultation on our part with all interested
parties.</div>
<a name="0606215000199"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000563"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I am certainly pleased to hear that there will
be extensive consultation. From what I saw in the Lords Committee
stage, and even through to today, with Government amendments being put
in regularly with little notice to the Opposition, there needs to be a
lot more thought.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000564"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> Any amendments&#151;I am the first to admit this,
having taken other Bills through the House&#151;by Government at a
late stage are always resisted by Ministers unless they are necessary.
<i class="I">[Interruption.] </i>No, unless they are absolutely essential and
should have been thought through before.</div>
<a name="0606215000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">Today&#146;s Government
amendments come out of debate with people in the legal profession and
the associations we have consulted, as well as out of debate in the
House of Lords. That has been part of the inclusive way in which we
have tried to develop the Bill, and the hon. Gentleman should welcome
that, but instead he laughed. When I have led on other Bills, I have
been resistant to amendments because it would have been bad for the
Government to accept them. In this instance, we are responding to
legitimate concerns raised either in the debates elsewhere or by
professional associations, and the hon. Gentleman should welcome that.
The Government amendments reflect the debate
elsewhere.</div><a name="0606215000202"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000565"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I hear the Minister&#146;s explanation, but
the proposals are not new. They went through the CLR and were consulted
on for six or seven years in one way or another. Here we are seven
years later and I think&#151;the Minister will tell me if I get this
wrong&#151;that the amendments were tabled last week. To say that we
have had a good period to review them is
wrong.</div><a name="0606215000203"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000566"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> Is the hon. Gentleman therefore suggesting that the
idea that we should not impose on private companies the obligation to
have a company secretary has been disputed for the last seven or eight
years, or that there has not been consensus? Does he not accept that
that deregulatory move has been welcomed warmly by most of those with
an interest, which was the original drive behind the
proposal?</div><a name="0606215000204"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000567"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Warmly welcomed or not&#151;and I shall not
pre-empt a debate on part 12&#151;the fact remains that the knock-on
effects of policy decisions such as those we are debating on the
signing of documents have not been thought
through.</div><a name="0606215000205"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000569"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I am afraid that that is the implication of the
amendments having been produced in the past few days. We have concerns,
and in the past two days I have received about 30 letters from
concerned company secretaries. I feel it fair and just that these
concerns be
put.</div><a name="0606215000207"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000570"></a>Vera
Baird:</b> I hope that the hon. Gentleman does not feel that
we are ganging up on him. We are keen to respond to problems that have
arisen from measures that we saw as increasing flexibility, and to meet
the concerns that have been expressed by increasing that flexibility
even more. The thrust of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s earlier argument
was the difficulty of moving from a current situation in which duties
are set out clearly to a new flexibility, and whether the transitional
period will be confusing, particularly when mixed with any confusion
that might arise from the provisions before us. However, the provisions
are clear: 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column38" />Column number: 39</div>a company may appoint anybody it wishes to be an authorised signatory
and they need only be registered. That cannot be something to complain
about. My right hon. Friend has made it clear that because there will
be an awkward transition period, we will consult heavily as we go
along. The hon. Gentleman should be
content.</div><a name="0606215000208"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000571"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I wish I could say that I was content. I am not,
although I am grateful for the pledge of further consultation, which
will be necessary. Company secretaries are valued and useful people,
and we do not believe that they have been treated appropriately by the
Government. Their views must be given a full airing, and we will make
that point later in our proceedings. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000572"></a>Mr.

page 12, line 19, after &#145;a', insert
&#145;public'.</div><a name="0606215000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
13 deals with the statement of compliance. It relates to section 12(3)
and (3)A of the Companies Act 1985. Based on recommendations of the
CLR, the current requirement of a statutory declaration or a chronic
statement here and elsewhere in the Bill is replaced by a requirement
to make a statement of compliance. This statement does not need to be
witnessed and may be made on paper or in electronic form. It will be
for the registrar&#146;s rules under clause 75 to specify who makes a
statement and its form. Will the Minister advise us whether her
Department has now considered the form of the statement or whether that
will follow?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column39" />Column number: 40</div><a name="0606215000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">My probing amendment provides for
retaining the use of the statutory declaration. Our concern here is
related to impersonation and the growing problem of identity theft.
There is a growing problem of forms 288 being sent in by crooked
individuals to change the directors of registered companies. They may
do that in their own name or under a pseudonym or, often, the name of a
dead individual. These so-called directors then change the registered
office to one of their own choice so that the company has therefore
been hijacked to some extent, and typically they enter into contracts
using the false details.</div>
<a name="0606215000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">The safest stage of the
registration process at the moment is the company formation stage. That
is because at that moment one has to go in front of a solicitor or
possibly a commissioner for oaths and make a statutory declaration.
Will the safety that we have within the system now disappear? I assume
that it will. How do the Government intend to make sure that we retain
this element of safety without the statutory declaration, not least in
view of the additional risks of accepting details online? This is a
probing amendment, I hasten to add. I am generally in favour of
e-commerce and using the internet, but we need to appreciate that there
are security concerns here that they are being misused. This is not me
suggesting that a problem will happen; it is a growing problem and we
need to have a remedy in place by the time the Bill comes into
force.</div>
<a name="0606215000219"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000573"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> The hon. Gentleman rightly said that the statutory
declaration and the electronic statement will be replaced by this new
statement of compliance. He asked me whether the form of the statement
had yet been published. It is not yet published; it will be for the
registrar&#146;s rules, although he will understand that the rules
will not require the presence of the solicitor or a commissioner of
oaths. They are likely to allow greater flexibility as to the persons
who are able to make the statement on behalf of the company: for
example, we could have such professionals as accountants making such a
statement on behalf of the company.</div>
<a name="0606215000220"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000574"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I may have missed something here. Is the
Minister saying that someone will still have to give some kind of
compliance statement on the form, even though it does not take the form
of a statutory
declaration?</div><a name="0606215000221"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000575"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> Yes.</div>
<a name="0606215000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Gentleman then raised
the issue of fraud. Clearly it is a problem that we all constantly have
to grapple with, but I am not convinced that the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s answer will really help. The registrar&#146;s
rules will enable provision to be made for authentication, and we may,
for example, be moving towards a unique identifier. Breaches will
continue to be a serious matter, but there are various clauses in the
Bill to deal with the issue. Making a false statutory declaration would
be a matter for the law of perjury, while making a false electronic
statement would be an offence. Under clause 764, a false statement of
compliance will become a false statement, and the clause sets out the
penalties on conviction, including fines and custodial sentences.
Although the hon. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column40" />Column number: 41</div>Gentleman is right to allude to a problem, therefore, I am not sure that
the answer lies in maintaining the statutory
declaration.</div>
<a name="0606215000223"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0606215000576"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Shailesh Vara</b> (North-West Cambridgeshire) (Con): Although
the Minister is right to say that there are penalties for those who use
a wrong identity, would she none the less agree that the idea in
effecting the relevant clauses is not to punish people but to prevent
the offences from being committed in the first place? That is where our
argument is coming from: we want to avoid the offences, rather than to
prosecute later on.</div>
<a name="0606215000224"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000577"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> Clearly, prevention is the better route, and we all
want to go down it. As has been said, we hope that the existence of the
penalties will become a disincentive to breaking the rules. I am simply
not convinced that we shall be better able to prevent fraud if we have
a witnessed statutory declaration. That was all I was saying, although
I entirely accept that we would rather prevent fraud, and we need
constantly to look at the development of electronic communication to
see how we can improve facilities for doing so. The issue regularly
comes across my desk in relation to other parts of my
portfolio.</div>
<a name="0606215000225"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000578"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I am a little confused. As I understand it,
there will be a declaration from someone else, rather than a statutory
declaration. Presumably, there will be a wider pool of people who can
give a declaration, so the process will become easier, and there will
be less red tape. Conceptually, that is fine, but if the idea is also
to move online, will the Minister explain how that ties in with
someone&#151;albeit someone else&#151;giving a declaration? Will
the fact that it has been given be declared
online?</div>
<a name="0606215000226"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000579"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> I think that the answer is yes. What I was trying
to say was that the current developments in electronic communication
support improvements to ensure that the statement is not given
fraudulently or by an impostor. I am also told that, currently,
somebody can give a statement online that what someone else has
declared online is already the position, and we are not changing
that.</div> <a name="0606215000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">It might help
the hon. Gentleman if I say two things. First, we are trying to widen
the range of people who can give the statutory declaration. Secondly,
two declarations have to be made at present. One is made by the first
director, or secretary, of a company or by a solicitor engaged on the
formation of a company, and it must be made or witnessed before a
solicitor or commissioner of oaths. In other words, it cannot simply be
made by the person or persons forming the company, and the statutory
declaration cannot, seemingly, be made electronically. That is why the
current Act explicitly provides for an electronic statement as an
alternative. Currently, there are two different sets of requirements,
which depend on the form of communication that is adopted.</div>
<a name="0606215000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under clause 721 in part 29,
which relates to the registrar of companies, it will be for the
registrar to determine the form of the new statement of compliance and
issues such as who can authenticate it. Such matters may be set out in
the registrar&#146;s rules 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column41" />Column number: 42</div>under clause 770. In other words, the details will, for the most part,
be matters for rules established by the registrar of
companies.</div> <a name="0606215000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think I
have covered most of the points raised, and I hope that I have given
sufficient assurances for the hon. Gentleman to feel able to withdraw
his amendment.</div>
<a name="0606215000230"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000580"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I thank my hon. Friend the Member for North-West
Cambridgeshire (Mr. Vara) for pointing out that prevention is as
important as penalties, if not more so. That is a central theme of the
clauses dealing with the filing of documents. I have no doubt that the
mechanics of the use of electronic filing will make the area more risky
and more open to abuse, so the chance of fraud will be increased. The
right hon. Lady said that a person can currently file online. I think
that that is true, but in practice it probably applies to a small
number of company formation agents. I have the feeling that the
proposals are intended to broaden the use of electronic filing. That is
not necessarily a wrong thing to do, but it will increase the risk of
abuse.</div>
<a name="0606215000231"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0606215000581"></a><b class="B">Jim
Cousins</b> (Newcastle upon Tyne, Central) (Lab): Can the hon.

our attention are widespread, excepting, of course, that he anticipates
they will become even more widespread in a purely electronic

<a name="0606215000232"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000582"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> My understanding is that the hijacking of
companies, as I described it earlier, is becoming increasingly
widespread. I do not have statistics. The Minister might have them, and
if she does, I shall be grateful to hear them. It is increasingly
common and very simple to do. All that one has to do is to go to
Ryman&#146;s get a couple of 288s&#151;<i class="I">[Interruption.] </i>I
take the Whip&#146;s point that I should not, perhaps, explain too
clearly what to do. However, it is a simple
procedure.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000583"></a>Jim

clarification, and no doubt we can look into the matter. I was not

<div class="Column"><a name="Column42" />Column number: 43</div><a name="0606215000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall be brief. Why is it
necessary for the certificate to be signed by the registrar? On the
back of the previous debate, the Minister might say that it is for
security purposes. However, proof is publication on the Companies House
register. In practice, companies often lose their certificates, it is
difficult to get replacements and there is a cost involved in doing so.
What is the Minister&#146;s
view?</div><a name="0606215000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">On a slightly

or will there be a possibility of issuing it

is a practical point, because at present a same-day incorporation
requires a trip to Companies House, with all the hurdles that that
entails, whereas it would be quicker to do it online. Harking back to
the previous debate, I am aware that there are security implications,
and I shall be grateful if the Minister will advise us on how they
might be
addressed.</div><a name="0606215000464"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.30

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"></b><b class="B"><a name="0606215000586"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> I shall deal with the security implications before
the issue of signing of certificates by the registrar. There are
increasing requirements,not least in European Union
directives, that communication take place electronically, so we would
probably have to adopt the practice anyway. Ensuring security therefore
becomes a major issue, and that is at the top of the agenda of all the
companies that are involved in such business. I see lots of documents
on advances in the area&#151;I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman
does too. A week or two ago I attended a Council meeting at which, in
light of our particular responsibility for information and
communications technology, the Council of Ministers discussed it as the
next major area of work. We shall see whether that leads to further
measures or directives at the European level, which is probably the
sensible level at which to take such action.</div>
<a name="0606215000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">As to online issuing of
certificates, in principle we do not have any objection, although we
shall have to consider the practicalities. The certificate can be
signed online, so I do not see why on earth it should not be issued
online. If the hon. Gentleman will allow me to take that idea away, we
shall reflect on it, as it is obviously sensible. As to the presence of
the provision in the Bill, I am told that everybody wants conclusive
evidence to the whole world that a company has been duly and properly
formed and can be relied on by third parties who want to know that they
are dealing with a properly established company&#151;I think that the
hon. Gentleman would accept that. It is now much simpler to get such
authentications: I am told that it is now possible for the registrar to
sign documents electronically and, indeed, her official seal can now be
applied electronically.</div>
<a name="0606215000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the Bill&#146;s provisions
concerning duties and functions of the registrar, clause 768(2)
provides that her rules may make provision on how a signature or seal
is to be authenticated in such circumstances. That requirement is not
overtaken by other provisions of the Bill that enable the registrar to
specify matters relating to the authentication of certain documents.
The new provisions in part 29 deal primarily with the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column43" />Column number: 44</div>authentication of documents that are sent to the registrar, whereas the
clause deals with a document that is sent by her. That is why the
provision appears where it does.</div>
<a name="0606215000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">The argument that is made is
that the clause is useful and necessary. In that spirit, I hope that
the hon. Member will withdraw his
amendment.</div>
<a name="0606215000246"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000587"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I thank the Minister for her helpful response,
her agreement to look into the matter further, and her recognition of
the important security implications of electronic communication. I am

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000588"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I understand that new table A model articles and
other model articles are to be issued. Will the Minister provide a
timetable for consultation on such matters and details of any problems
with them that may have arisen to date? Such documents are vital to
companies and the operation of their businesses. Is it the
Government&#146;s intention to adjust existing articles, table A and
so forth, or to give them a thorough overhaul? I note, in that regard,
that the language under table A is somewhat dated and it is probably
about time that it was given a thorough going
over.</div><a name="0606215000254"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0606215000589"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Quentin Davies</b> (Grantham and Stamford) (Con): I want to
probe a little the idea of model articles. Presumably, it is the state
not in legislative mode but in advisory or nanny mode. I want to make
it clear that I had properly understood that that is the case because,
under subsection (3),</div>
<a name="0606215000456"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A company may adopt all
or any of the provisions of model
articles&#148;,</div><a name="0606215000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">which makes the
idea look very
voluntary.</div><a name="0606215000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">The word
&#147;prescribe&#148; is used under subsections (1) and (2), and I
want to be clear whether it is intended that pressure is to be put on
companies to adopt the model articles or whether the Government
envisage sanctions for companies that do not adopt them. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column44" />Column number: 45</div>Above all, I protest slightly that we have reached the clause that
provides for the model articles without having any notion of what the
Government have in mind. That very bad habit is becoming more and more
common and, as each year goes by, we come across Bills that provide for
the Government subsequently to make regulations, produce guidance
documents or, in this case, produce model articles without our having
any idea what they have in mind.</div>
<a name="0606215000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">After seven years of
consultation on the subject, it is reasonable to expect that, by the
time the Bill is brought before Parliament, the Government have shown
us the colour of their money and explained what the model articles
would be. That would enable us in the House of Commons to do our job
and see whether there were any difficulties or perversities about the
proposals. Even though they are voluntary, presumably they will have a
quasi legal force so that, if a company were challenged about the
adequacy of its articles and it can point to having adopted the model
articles provided by the Secretary of State, that will be a full
defence. We do not know whether the model articles will be adequate for
the purpose.</div><a name="0606215000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will the
Minister explain the status of the model articles? Are they purely
advisory? Is there any intention to put pressure on companies to adopt
them? Will the Minister explain why we do not have the model articles
in front of us? The position is highly unsatisfactory. Can we have an
opportunity before we discuss the Bill on Third Reading&#151;at least
before it is debated on Report, so that we can consider the matter on
the Floor of the House&#151;to know what the Government have in mind
for the model articles? After all, surely seven years is long enough
for someone to draft them. If the Government had the concept that model
articles are required, the onus is on them to show us what they have in
mind.</div><a name="0606215000259"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000590"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> I hate to disappoint Opposition Members, but the
articles are out for consultation. Clearly, they have not seen them.
The articles are on the Department of Trade and Industry website, as
well as in the Library. I suggest that Opposition Members look at them
and, if anything worries them, they can ask me about
it.</div><a name="0606215000260"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000591"></a>Mr.
Davies:</b> That is simply not good enough. The Government are
not treating Parliament as Parliament ought to be treated. If there are
model articles and other documents referred to in the text of the Bill
that are germane to proceedings, they should be distributed to Members
of Parliament. There are all kinds of information on all kinds of
websites across the Government; Members of Parliament cannot be
expected simply to trail through every Government website on the
off-chance that they will discover something relevant to the Bill. It
is up to the Government, who are submitting this draft legislation to
us, to ensure that we see the relevant documents.</div>
<a name="0606215000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have not seen a copy of the
model articles; I do not know whether Committee colleagues have been
luckier than me. If the Minister has a copy, I should be grateful if
she passed it to
me.</div><a name="0606215000262"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000592"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> The articles may have passed the hon. Gentleman by.
I accept that we are all busy and that lots of documents pass over our
desks, but 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column45" />Column number: 46</div>presumably he knows that the articles for private companies were
published in draft with the White Paper in March 2005. I presume that
he had the chance to look at them then. Approximately a week ago, we
placed the model articles for public companies in the Library of the
House. They were certainly there for the Committee to consider, and the
hon. Gentleman can no doubt access them
now.</div><a name="0606215000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the hon.
Gentleman wishes, I shall be happy to ensure that all Committee members
are sent copies. However, the articles have been
published.</div>
<a name="0606215000264"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000593"></a>Mr.
Davies:</b> Once again, far from apologising, I want to
emphasise my point. The Government are simply not treating Committee
members as they should. The Government should take the initiative in
ensuring that the Committee sees such documents. The Minister knows
perfectly well that the amount of paper produced every day by the
Government, including by her own Department, probably equals several
editions of the &#147;Encyclopaedia Britannica&#148;.</div>
<a name="0606215000265"></a><div class="hs_Para">All kinds of documents are
placed in the House. A year ago, I was hardly likely to read a White
Paper on the off-chance that a year later I might be selected to sit on
a Committee that was considering a Bill relevant to it. If I did that,
I would do nothing else for the whole of my
life.</div><a name="0606215000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister is
being not reasonable but bureaucratic in dealing with my point. I hope
that she will now become practical. I should be very grateful if she
circulated the model articles to me and all other Committee members
without further delay.</div>
<a name="0606215000267"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000594"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> We can certainly circulate them to Committee
members, but the draft model articles were published 15 months ago. I
get a lot of correspondence on issues relating to this Bill. Had he
shown an interest in the articles, the hon. Gentleman might have
written to me and asked what further steps had been taken. When we
published them in draft, it was clear that they were for consultation.
Obviously, we want Committee members to have access to the articles so
that they can be properly considered as we come to the clauses that we
are
considering.</div><a name="0606215000268"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000595"></a>Mr.
Davies:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for giving way yet
again. I have made my point. May I ask her to ask her officials
today&#151;without delay&#151;to go through the remaining 90-odd
per cent. of the Bill and see whether it refers explicitly to any
documents that have not been distributed to the Committee? If there are
such documents, will the Minister be kind enough to ask her officials
to ensure directly that the Committee has sight of them, so that we
know that they are relevant to our
proceedings?</div><a name="0606215000269"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000596"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> I am happy to do
that.</div><a name="0606215000270"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000597"></a>Mr.
Vara:</b> For the sake of clarity, may I ask the Minister when
precisely the consultation period for the articles started? For the
record, 15 months ago, at least four Conservative Committee members
were not even Members of Parliament. The hon. Member for Solihull takes
that number to five. To expect people who are not 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column46" />Column number: 47</div>even Members of Parliament to start a consultation process on a document
is somewhat lame.</div> <a name="0606215000271"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
wholeheartedly endorse the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for
Grantham and Stamford(Mr. Davies), that the Committee should
be informed about any other items intended to be introduced by stealth,
to the extent that it is unaware of
them.</div><a name="0606215000272"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000598"></a>The
Chairman:</b> For the sake of clarity, I should say that
interventions have taken up too much time this morning. Members&#146;
interventions should be brief, and Members should clarify whether they
are intervening to make interventions or
speeches.</div><a name="0606215000273"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000599"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> Thank you for that guidance,Mr. Illsley. I
am slightly surprised by the interventions made, both last week and
this, by the hon. Member for North-West Cambridgeshire. The idea that
the model articles, which were published before he was a Member of
Parliament and I was the Minister with the relevant responsibility,
should suddenly have been republished when he became a Member of
Parliament or when I became the Minister with responsibility for these
issues, is patently
absurd.</div><a name="0606215000465"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.45

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000601"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> If the hon. Gentleman will give me a chance, I am
responding to his previous point. The idea that we are doing anything
by stealth is ludicrous. All the parties with which we have engaged
since 1998 in taking forward the review of that intricate area of
company law have been clear that it was an inclusive and open
process.</div> <a name="0606215000276"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the hon.
Member for North-West Cambridgeshire failed to see that or to have it
drawn to his attention as he prepared for the Committee, I am sorry. I
shall ensure that the articles that have been placed in the Library are
circulated. On any other matters, it would be sensible probably to draw
the Committee&#146;s attention to the location of the relevant
papers, rather than to distribute them. That way people will know where
on the website or in the Library they can get them. I hope that that
will be sufficient for hon. Members&#151;in order to save a few
trees.</div><a name="0606215000277"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000602"></a>Mr.
Blunt:</b> The Minister and her Department have proceeded with
good intentions over a long consultation process, but she needs to
differentiate between Members. My hon. Friends behind me, like her hon.
Friends behind her, will not have known that they were going to be
selected for the Committee until the Selection Committee met. My hon.
Friend the Member for Huntingdon will have had some idea that the Bill
was coming down the tracks and an opportunity to follow it in detail.
However, I ask her to give as much assistance as she can to Back
Benchers by identifying and producing documents to make their job as
easy as possible. They have not been involved in the process since 1998
like officials in her Department.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column47" />Column number: 48</div><a name="0606215000278"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000603"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> This might help the Committee; I have just been
informed that there is a list of the relevant websites at the back of
the House of Commons Library note on the Bill. That might be of further
assistance to the
Committee.</div><a name="0606215000279"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000604"></a>Mr.
Davies:</b> Briefly, the Minister now seems to be going back
on the promise that she gave me a moment ago, for which I was grateful.
The Government should give us the documents, not say, &#147;Go and
look at websites&#148;, so that we spend our time looking at
websites. We need to have the documents. The Government have them, or
claimed to have them, and she was gracious enough to say that she would
make them available. I take it that that undertaking is still valid. I
am still grateful for it and look forward to seeing the
documents.</div><a name="0606215000280"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000605"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> I was simply reflecting the fact that I would like
to save a little bit of paper. But if Members feel strongly about
having all the bits of papers, rather than references to them, I am
happy to help out. I know how much paper we get through, and how much
we bin before even looking at it, so it seemed sensible just to provide
the relevant references. However, if the Committee so wishes, I shall
provide the documents. It is no great
problem.</div><a name="0606215000281"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000606"></a>Mr.
Vara:</b> The Minister should speak for herself on the amount
of material that is binned. The Opposition take the Bill seriously and
certainly will read through all the material that comes our
way.</div><a name="0606215000282"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister has
repeatedly made the point that there has been a lengthy consultation
process, that many organisations have been consulted and that the Bill
has been debated in the House of Lords. I point out to her that many of
those organisations have put forward conflicting views, and it would
not be right for the Committee simply to accept all those views; it is
not possible to do so because of the conflicts. It is the purpose of
the Committee therefore to try
and&#151;</div><a name="0606215000283"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000607"></a>The
Chairman:</b>
Briefly.</div><a name="0606215000284"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000608"></a>Mr.
Vara:</b> Certainly, Sir. The Committee must ensure that we
arrive at a proper decision, so constant reference to previous
organisations is perhaps not appropriate.</div>
<a name="0606215000285"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000609"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> After that debate, I cannot remember all the points
that have been raised. Opposition Members are not the only people in
the Committee taking the Bill seriously. This Government instituted the
review of company law; we did it thoroughly, and it is insulting, yet
again, for him to suggest that he and his colleagues are the only ones
who take the matter seriously.</div>
<a name="0606215000286"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of course there are conflicts.
We have just spent considerable time discussing one such conflict, to
which we shall return&#151;whether there should be regulation and we
should insist that every company, be it public or private, have a
company secretary. That is a contentious issue, on which the Government
have taken a view. No doubt the hon. Gentleman will also 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column48" />Column number: 49</div>reflect on what is right, rather than what has been requested by a
certain group of people lobbying him at a certain
time.</div><a name="0606215000287"></a><div class="hs_Para">I wrote, I hope,
to all members of the Committee when welcoming them to the Committee
and in that letter I highlighted other information available on the
various DTI websites. It might help hon. Members if they return to that
information. I asked them to contact me for further information if they
so wished and it would be helpful if they did
that.</div><a name="0606215000288"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was asked about
the status of the model articles, as I recall. I hope that hon. Members
will come back to me if I forget something. I was asked whether the
model articles were advisory, I think by the hon. Member for
Huntingdon&#151;[<span class="SmallCaps">Hon. Members:</span>
&#147;No.&#148;] Sorry, I should have said the hon. Member for
Grantham and Stamford. The model articles are advisory. They are not in
any way required; no company is required to adopt them. However, they
operate in default, so if a company has not adopted articles, these can
be used if the need so arises. It is because of the default provision
that they are prescribed; that is why the term
&#147;prescribed&#148; is used in the
clause.</div><a name="0606215000289"></a><div class="hs_Para">In discussions
that I have had with companies recently, there has been quite a lot of
support for the development of the advisory articles. That means that
people do not have to reinvent wheels and think through themselves what
they have to put into articles. They can look at these articles and see
whether they need to adopt
them.</div><a name="0606215000290"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was also
asked&#151;I think it was indeed by the hon. Member for Huntingdon
this time&#151;whether there was an intention to adjust existing
articles. No, it has never been the case that successive Governments
have replaced the articles of existing companies. I hope that what I
have said deals with the issues that Opposition Members have raised
about the clause, that I have convinced them that the Bill makes sense
and that we can approve the
clause.</div><a name="0606215000291"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000610"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for
Grantham and Stamford for initiating the debate, to which several of my
hon. Friends have contributed. It has highlighted the importance of the
model articles for companies&#151;that is an essential part of what
we are doing with the Bill&#151;and the need to consult fully on the
matter.</div><a name="0606215000292"></a><div class="hs_Para">There has been
some confusion about when the model articles were put forward in the
White Paper and when they were consulted on. I have just seen in a pile
of paper that the consultation started on 8 June, so it has not being
going on for long. My first point is that the consultation is ongoing.
The fact that a White Paper was published, however long ago that was,
is unrelated to the fact that the consultation has been going on for
only a couple of weeks. On that basis, my hon. Friend the Member for
Grantham and Stamford made an important
point.</div><a name="0606215000293"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000611"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> There is a misunderstanding. There was a
consultation on draft articles, which was initiated when we published
the White Paper in 2005. We then commenced a further consultation on
articles for public companies; the one in 2005 related to private 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column49" />Column number: 50</div>companies. We commenced a consultation relating to public companies on
the articles that we published before the Committee sat. It is those
that I have agreed to distribute around the
Committee.</div><a name="0606215000294"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000612"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> That clarification is
helpful.</div><a name="0606215000295"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second
point that I wanted to make is that what was in a White Paper is not
necessarily what was consulted on. There may have been changes between
the two dates. For that reason as well, it is fair to make the point
that we need to have a fresh look at this matter. However, I thank the
Minister for her offer to send out the documents and related
documents&#151;I think that is what she said&#151;so that what has
happened will not happen again and the Committee will be advised in
advance. Finally, I would be grateful if she could say when the
consultation is likely to end and when the results are likely to be
published. I hope that these important model articles will come into
play at the same time as the overall provisions of the
Bill.</div><a name="0606215000296"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000613"></a>Margaret

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000614"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 80, in clause 21, page
8, line 28, leave out &#145;alter' and insert
&#145;amend'.</div><a name="0606215000300"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000615"></a>The
Chairman:</b> With this it will be convenient to discuss Govt
amendments Nos. 82, 84 to 89, 101, 102, 105 to 107, 104, 108 to
111.</div><a name="0606215000301"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000616"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> The amendments look extremely complicated. In fact,
they are tidying-up amendments arising out of debates in another place.
The Bill makes provision in clause 21 for changes to company articles
that may be made by a company&#146;s members, and for changes that
may be made by other means such as legislation, which is dealt with in
clause 35, or by the courts or other authorities such as the Charities
Commission, which is dealt with in clause 36. The amendments are
intended simply to introduce a greater consistency in the way that the
Bill talks about different kinds of
changes.</div><a name="0606215000302"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendments
ensure that when the Bill refers to changes made to a company&#146;s
articles by its members, the company&#146;s articles are generally
referred to as being amended, and the changes are referred to as
amendments. When the Bill refers to changes made by legislative,
judicial or other external intervention, the company&#146;s articles
are generally referred to as being altered, and the changes are
referred to as
alterations.</div><a name="0606215000303"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
thinking behind this approach is that a company&#146;s articles can
be changed either by changing the text or by means of some
free-standing overriding provision. We think that
&#147;amendment&#148; is the normal way of describing textual
changes, and that it is by 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column50" />Column number: 51</div>textual changes that companies normally change their articles, whereas
legislation and courts are more likely to adopt free-standing
overriding provisions. Since &#147;alteration&#148; naturally has a
broader range of meaning, encompassing both textual changes and
overriding provisions, the Bill should generally refer to amendments
when it is dealing with changes made by the company&#146;s members
and to alterations when it is dealing with changes made by legislation
or external agencies. I should make it clear, however, that we do not
intend in this way to limit the ability of companies to change their

clauses 22, 23 and 24 are grouped for debate with the amendments under
clause 22 on the selection list. That means that the questions on those

the Committee for decision without further debate when we reach them.
The point is, obviously, that as we debate clause 22 and the amendments
that go with it, we will debate clauses 22, 23 and 24 stand part as
well, because the amendments to the group of clauses are so substantial
to them that it would be easier to debate them in that way. So, if any

would have come under the debate on clause stand part, they should

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000622"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> At present, under section 17(2)(b) of the 1985 Act,
companies are able to provide that certain provisions of their
memorandum can never be changed. As we discussed, under the Bill, the
memorandum will contain the bare information that is required to
evidence the intention of the founder members to form a company and
companies will not need, or be able, to alter their
memorandum.</div>
<a name="0606215000321"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000623"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Will the Minister explain what part of the
memorandum a company cannot change at present? I thought that changes
were limited to company incorporation or something similarly limited?
</div><a name="0606215000322"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000624"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> It is limited. Would it be helpful if I wrote to
the hon. Gentleman with the specifics?</div>
<a name="0606215000323"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000625"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> That is fine.</div>
<a name="0606215000324"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000626"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> Clause 22(1)(a) is an attempt to replicate section
17(2)(b) in the context of new Bill provisions, where all information
of constitutional significance will be contained in articles. More
generally, clause 22 implements the recommendation of the company law
review that companies should be permitted to entrench their provisions
and their articles by making the amendment of those provisions subject
to the fulfilment of conditions more onerous than the passing of a
special resolution. That is what is normally needed to amend articles.
If a company wished to do so, it could state that a particular
provision could be changed only with the consent of all
members.</div><a name="0606215000325"></a><div class="hs_Para">We were
prompted to table amendment Nos. 81 and 83 by similar amendments that
were laid in another place by Lord Hodgson, to whom we are grateful for
having directed our attention to reconsideration of the provision. I
think that the hon. Member for Huntingdon raised these issues on Second
Reading too. It seems to us that the absolute entrenchment provided for
by section 17(2)(b) and clause 22(1)(a) is not a good idea except in
the case of special types of companies, such as charities, for which,
in any case, we have separate rules. We cannot see any general benefit
in allowing companies to set bits of their constitution in stone and
put them beyond the reach of amendment even if they get unanimous
agreement of all their members. Inflexibility can, as we all know, be a
weakness. More often than not, things that seemed a good idea may turn
out to be more trouble than they are worth.</div>
<a name="0606215000326"></a><div class="hs_Para">For that reason, I do not wish
to accept amendment No. 8, which seems to offer a world in which
provisions can only be entrenched absolutely. I am not sure whether
that is the purpose of the amendment, but that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column52" />Column number: 53</div>is how I read it. Instead, Government amendmentNo. 83 allows
for the possibility of change where it is clearly sensible, by saying
that any provision for entrenchment can be bypassed if all the members
agree.</div><a name="0606215000327"></a><div class="hs_Para">I turn now to
amendments Nos. 9 and 48. If entrenched provisions are to be capable of
amendment, it is none the less important that they are amended only in
accordance with the provisions for entrenchment that are set out in a
company&#146;s articles. Clause 23 aims to create a straightforward
mechanism for checking that that has happened. First, we would require
the company to notify the registrar when it has included provision for
entrenchment in its articles. Secondly, when such a company delivers a
document that makes or evidences an amendment to its articles, it is
required to deliver, with that document, a statement of compliance.
That should state that the amendment has been made in accordance with
the company&#146;s articles&#151;in other words, in accordance with
any relevant provision for entrenchment. The requirement to file a
statement of compliance provides the registrar, and anyone who consults
the public register, with an assurance that the company was at least
aware that special rules were in force in relation to changes to its
articles.</div> <a name="0606215000328"></a><div class="hs_Para">In addition,
if the provision for entrenchment has been inadvertently overlooked by
the company and the change to the articles is simply filed as a special
resolution, without a statement of compliance, the registrar will be
able to ask the company to certify whether it has observed all the
relevant formalities before registering, what might otherwise be, an
unauthorised change to the company&#146;s constitution.</div>
<a name="0606215000329"></a><div class="hs_Para">Few companies will take
advantage of the entrenchment process. For those that do, it is not a
major additional bureaucratic burden. It may help some of them make
sure that they have got things
right.</div><a name="0606215000330"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, I turn
to amendments Nos. 10, 11 and 12. In clause 24, the thrust of the
amendments specifies a default threshold for removing a provision for
entrenchment. I applaud the creativity of the hon. Member for
Huntingdon in providing three thresholds to choose from. However, I
fear that I will reject all of them because, in our view, that
provision is not
necessary.</div><a name="0606215000331"></a><div class="hs_Para">Provision
for entrenchment may itself set out the conditions in which that
entrenchment can be removed. That is the prudent course. As with any of
the other articles, if it does not, it can be removed by a special
resolution, which may not be what was
intended.</div><a name="0606215000332"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is not
appropriate or desirable for the statute either to prevent companies
from setting their own laws about conditions in which a provision for
entrenchment can be removed or by imposing a condition, other than the
passing of an existing special resolution when companies have not made
their own rules on that point.</div>
<a name="0606215000333"></a><div class="hs_Para">It could be argued that the
default position should be unanimity, rather than allowing for removal
by special resolution where the provision for entrenchment is not
itself entrenched. That is more likely than not to cause inconvenience
in some cases, particularly in companies with many
members.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column53" />Column number: 54</div><a name="0606215000334"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000627"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> What the Minister called inconvenience, I would
call shareholder
democracy.</div><a name="0606215000335"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000628"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> Shareholder democracy can be entrenched in other
ways&#151;through other existing provisions&#151;to enable
shareholders to raise issues through resolutions in meetings of
shareholders, but is it appropriate to involve 100 per cent. of them?
Is the hon. Gentleman suggesting that 100 per cent. of shareholders
should be involved if a rule is
changed?</div><a name="0606215000336"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000629"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> No, I am saying that we should keep things as
they are, which is that 75 per cent. are needed to change the articles
of a
company.</div><a name="0606215000337"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000630"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> Yes, indeed. Under a special resolution, if there
are no provisions around entrenchment, a special resolution would be
the way in which articles are changed. I am not sure how
that75 per cent. fits with the point about 100 per cent.,
which is what I was addressing when he suggested that we would only
have true shareholder democracy through 100 per cent.
participation.</div><a name="0606215000338"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000631"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I am not sure about participation, because that
would involve encouraging people to vote rather than percentages
required to pass resolutions. However, in terms of passing resolutions,
we will be maintaining that the status quo is appropriate.
Notwithstanding that, we have provided the Minister with some fallback
positions to take away the pain that she is going to be leading
companies into through her proposed
clause.</div><a name="0606215000339"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000632"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> No doubt the hon. Gentleman will make it clear when
responding to my contribution where he thinks the pain is. In our view,
we are protecting shareholders appropriately by leaving it to them to
decide what threshold to set rather than setting it in
statute.</div> <a name="0606215000340"></a><div class="hs_Para">The other
point that I ought to make is that the special resolution provision
allows a resolution to be passed with a 75 per cent. shareholder vote.
In a proper shareholder democracy or, indeed any democracy, minorities
must be looked after as well. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will
accept that.</div><a name="0606215000341"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was
arguing that unanimity less one vote and 90 per cent. of members seem
rather arbitrary options. What if a company has thousands of members,
or one member who holds 90 per cent. of the voting rights? Anomalies
could arise because of the way that the hon. Gentleman has framed his
amendments. Well advised companies will provide a threshold for
removing provisions for entrenchment to suit their own circumstances
with regard to the shareholding composition of each particular company.
We cannot see that a default threshold other than the passing of a
special resolution makes
sense.</div><a name="0606215000342"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000633"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Companies can, indeed, set thresholds, either in
their articles or through contract, but the ability to prevent the
articles from being changed by requiring more than a 75 per cent.
majority is not permitted. At 75 per cent., the articles can be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column54" />Column number: 55</div>changed. Therefore, when people talk about entrenchment, it is within
that
remit.</div><a name="0606215000343"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000634"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> I understand that, but I hope that the hon.
Gentleman will also accept that we should enable companies to set their
own walls around how they want to deal with entrenchment. That is all
that the clauses try to
do.</div><a name="0606215000344"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have given a
lengthy explanation. The hon. Gentleman is shaking his head from a
sedentary position. I shall listen to what he says and then respond. I
hope that he will agree to withdraw his amendments, which we believe to
be
undesirable.</div><a name="0606215000345"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000635"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Given the way that the clause and amendments are
structured, the Chairman&#146;s decision to merge them was a wise
one. I shall start with clause 23, move to clause 24 and then discuss
clause 22, which I hope will provide clarity and structure in what I
say.</div><a name="0606215000346"></a><div class="hs_Para">I begin with
amendment No. 9. Clause 23 provides for a notice of entrenchment to be
filed, but if an entrenchment resolution is passed, surely the
resolution file at Companies House plus the revised version of the
articles filed should be adequate. I cannot think of other such
compliance provisions&#151;perhaps the Minister could name
some&#151;so I ask the purpose of the extra piece of paper.
Furthermore, the measures will increase regulation. The director will
need to ask a lawyer to confirm whether the new notice is compliant.
Even if it is blatant, he might want to do so as a belt-and-braces
safeguard.</div> <a name="0606215000347"></a><div class="hs_Para">I turn to
amendments Nos. 10 to 12. If the entrenchment clauses remain in the
Bill&#151;I shall argue in the stand part debate that they should
not&#151;better provision should be made for removing them. As the
Minister pointed out, I have provided three possibilities for probing
purposes. The first, in amendment No. 10, is a unanimous resolution. I
note that, at last, the Government have accepted that concept and
introduced their own amendment to that effect, so that is at least a
move in the right direction, and we are
pleased.</div><a name="0606215000467"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.15
pm</div><a name="0606215000348"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
amendment No. 11 allows for the fact that public companies always have
more than one shareholder and private companies pre-1989 had to have at
least two. Many still do because they never got rid of the spare
shareholder post-1989. The way in which public holding companies got
round that was to find an individual, normally one of the
company&#146;s directors, who would hold the second share subject to
a declaration of trust, whereby that director promised to act in
accordance with the holding company&#146;s wishes. Such declarations
of trust were in practice sometimes not made, depending on how
efficient the company secretary was; sometimes they have been lost in
the mists of time; or sometimes directors leave a company and old forms
get thrown away. That means that getting unanimity can often be tough,
which is why I suggest that articles should be removed by unanimous
resolution less one vote. There may be other ways to get round the
problem, and I would be grateful to hear them from the
Minister.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column55" />Column number: 56</div><a name="0606215000349"></a><div class="hs_Para">Thirdly, amendment No. 12 puts
back into play an amendment tabled by Lord Hodgson to reduce
to90 per cent. the level of agreement required for the removal
of articles. Lord Hodgson said that a figure of 90 per cent. would tie
in with the amount required to buy out a minority in a takeover
situation. I add that10 per cent. is the level needed to call
a general meeting. Those amendments represent our three fall-back
positions.</div> <a name="0606215000350"></a><div class="hs_Para">I now come
on to amendment No. 8, amendment No. 7, which has not been selected,
and clause stand part. As I have said, their provisions were discussed
in Grand Committee and on Report in the Lords. The more I look at it,
the more concerns I have about the company law review proposal both in
mechanical and, increasingly, conceptual terms. Will the Minister
explain clause 22(1)(b), which as often as I have read it, I simply do
not understand? I note that she has tabled an amendment to delete
paragraph (a), and I was not sure what that meant either. Perhaps it
does not have to be explained now that it has been deleted. Why is
there a reference to procedures &#147;more restrictive&#148; than
those applicable to a special resolution, particularly as such
resolutions can themselves be passed conditionally?</div>
<a name="0606215000351"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister said that one
reason for including these clauses is that some items in a memorandum
of association cannot currently be changed. I intervened to ask about
that, and she confirmed that the only current absolute entrenchment
provision relates to the country of incorporation. With respect, that
is not a strong point. I note that in the Lords Ministers explained
that the mechanism in question will be useful now that there is to be
no memorandum of association, and I appreciate that while a company can
currently change its articles, it can only amend its memorandum. Other
than that one provision, however, it can be amended with 75 per cent.
agreement. I am not sure what the Government&#146;s point was. Will
the Minister elaborate on
it?</div><a name="0606215000352"></a><div class="hs_Para">One hears talk of
investors, particularly venture capitalists, wanting to entrench
rights. That is normally done by inserting veto provisions into the
articles of association, usually relating to the management of the
company. The same items are also typically agreed through consent
clauses in contracts, with a shareholders&#146; agreement. However,
because changing articles requires a 75 per cent. vote, the
entrenchment aspect is liked by venture capitalists. As the articles
are publicly filed, the entrenchment also acts as notification of the
special arrangements to third parties. To what extent is the situation
improved by extending those entrenchment provisions to 100 per cent. of
a vote, rather than 75 per cent., which currently exists and will still
exist, as the Minister rightly said, after we agree the
Bill?</div><a name="0606215000353"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not entirely
in the know about why we need this provision. What is worse is that a
single shareholder&#151;a holding company, say, or a group of
manager-owners&#151;could use this entrenchment procedure as an
effective poison pill, for instance, to entrench their rights to named
individuals being paid huge or index-linked salaries. If the company
were taken over or purchased, it would presumably need to be wound up
to get round the entrenching procedures in the Bill. What if that
company held other assets? The situation could become
messy.</div>

Howarth:</b> The hon. Gentleman is making an interesting
point, but surely the answer to it is that under clause 23 the
entrenchments can only be made at the start when the company is formed

created
later.</div><a name="0606215000355"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000637"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> If two owners were to set up a company and they
owned 100 per cent. of it, they could put in place whatever provisions
that they wanted at the outset. That is my point and my
concern.</div><a name="0606215000356"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government
said that they would review this matter on Report, but we heard nothing
on Third Reading in the Lords. Now the Minister comes up with a
compromise, saying that 100 per cent. of shareholders can end the
entrenchment. That is an improvement but hardly, we would maintain,
most people&#146;s idea of democracy. It is interesting that, in
opposition, Labour was happy to attack company director fat cats at
every opportunity, but now it is proposing a method of entrenching fat
cats&#146; rights and attacking shareholder democracy. The Government
need to answer conceptually how they got to this
position.</div><a name="0606215000357"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Institute
of Directors said in its June 2005
brief:</div><a name="0606215000457"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In
response to &#145;Modernising Company Law&#146; we stated:
&#145;Entrenching provisions need to be approached with care. In
commercial companies they could be dangerous as a company could be held
to ransom by a single shareholder holding one share (if he has a
genuine grievance, his remedy will normally be to apply to the courts).
We think it is essential to make it explicit in the legislation that
any entrenching provision (and any entrenched provision) may be changed
by a scheme of arrangement approved by the court regardless of absence
of unanimity (or other level of approval stipulated in the
constitution). We consider that this will reduce the impact of
companies happily introducing a requirement for unanimity then living
to regret it when the business cannot move on. We also think that there
should be no encouragement for commercial companies to adopt
entrenching provisions&#151;for instance, any model form of
constitution for such a company should not include wording for
entrenching provisions (even as an optional
extra).&#146;&#148;</div><a name="0606215000358"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
relation to the latter point, I should be grateful if the Minister
confirmed that the model articles that we have previously debated will
not hold an automatic entrenching
provision.</div><a name="0606215000359"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
is unnecessary, will lead to trouble and I suggest that the Minister
considers dropping it. We should be considering ways to improve
shareholder democracy, not restricting it with entrenchment provisions.
I do not know what Cedric the Pig is up to these days, but the
Government are looking more like &#147;Animal Farm&#148; every day.
I shall recommend that my colleagues vote against the

elsewhere.</div><a name="0606215000361"></a><div class="hs_Para">The argument
against entrenchment seems to go against one of the fundamental ideas
of company law, which is that members of the company should be able to
set up their business as they wish. If they want to set it up with
entrenched clauses and rights, that is up to them. If they want to set
it up with entrenched clauses 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column57" />Column number: 58</div>and rights, that is up to them. If that puts off other investors, which
it might, that is their problem, because they could set it up in a

seems not to exist.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000639"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Using the hon. Gentleman&#146;s rationale,
presumably companies can ignore not only future shareholders, but
creditors, stakeholders and anyone else they like so long a couple of
directors get together at the start to say, &#147;This is what we
will do; we will entrench it forever and a day. That is fine.&#148; I
do not buy that.</div>
<a name="0606215000363"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000640"></a>David
Howarth:</b> When we get on to clause 105 we will have a
debate about the balance between creditors and shareholders. If a
company is set up in a way that puts off people from dealing with it,
that is the problem of the people who set it up, not the problem of the
law. This is an unnecessary restriction on what people can do with
their own companies.</div>
<a name="0606215000364"></a><div class="hs_Para">Getting rid of the possibility
of entrenchment undermines a particular use of entrenchment that has
not been properly considered yet. I am thinking of joint venture
situations, where two companies or organisations come together to set
up a company to undertake a joint venture for a limited purpose. It is
important for such deals that they cannot be changed or undermined for
the period of the deal. Entrenchment is an important aspect of
that.</div>
<a name="0606215000365"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000641"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Again, I am afraid that I must disagree. A
venture capitalist may want to entrench through a 75 per cent.
proceeding but they will always be keeping in mind the next round of
investment and the appreciation that additional investors will come
into the company and therefore there must be an element of
fluidity.</div>
<a name="0606215000366"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000642"></a>David
Howarth:</b> The hon. Gentleman is discussing a different
point about venture capital. I was going to move on to that, so we
might as well talk about it now. Again, it seems to me that if venture
capitalists are prepared to put with various risks, that is up to them.
An entrenched section of a company&#146;s constitution obviously
affects the business risk faced by investors in that company in
particular ways. As long as everything is open and up front, people
will be able to make their own judgments about whether investments are
worth making.</div> <a name="0606215000367"></a><div class="hs_Para">My point
was not about venture capitalists; it was about joint ventures and
organisations coming together to create a special-purpose company to
carry out a particular joint project between two organisations. In
those sorts of situations, entrenchment becomes commercially important.
Someone might ask why one would want an entrenchment under which people
cannot agree to get out of
it&#151;</div><a name="0606215000368"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000643"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I am listening carefully to the point the
hon. Gentleman is making about joint ventures. Does he accept that in
practice it is possible, by way of contract, to have a class A share
and a class B share and therefore for decisions to be made for the
class A share for one joint-venture party and the class 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column58" />Column number: 59</div>B share for the second joint-venture party to have to vote together.
They are able to create such an arrangement by way of contract, rather
than having to rely on a statutory provision that may not be able to be
undone.</div><a name="0606215000369"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000644"></a>David
Howarth:</b> Yes, indeed. As the hon. Gentleman undoubtedly
knows, there are other ways of doing things, connected with deadlocking
companies in various ways. Those ways of undertaking joint ventures
have grown up as a way of getting round the problem of not being able
to entrench. It would be far simpler to be able to entrench provisions
in the first place as part of a company&#146;s
constitution.</div> <a name="0606215000370"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is
a point against absolute entrenchment: why should there be a situation
in which the two parties come together and agree a situation where
there is entrenchment even against their own agreement to give up the
deal? That is because there is a commercial possibility that the two
partners might wish to put themselves in a position where they cannot
agree to call off the deal. They might wish to do that because they
fear that they might give in to the blandishments of the other party at
some later stage, so they set up a deal that cannot be called off. If
we do not allow absolute entrenchment, we make such a deal
impossible.</div> <a name="0606215000371"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
arrangement contrasts with the deal that we were discussing a few
moments ago, which can be called off by the parties by agreement. The
two deals are quite different. Someone cannot set up a contract that
cannot be called off by the parties, whereas entrenchment can go one
step
further.</div>
<a name="0606215000372"></a><div class="hs_Para">The company law review team
thought about a much wider set of commercial possibilities than the
Government and the Opposition did. By removing the possibilities for
entrenchment, we are removing commercial possibilities that might be
valuable in
future.</div><a name="0606215000468"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.30
pm</div><a name="0606215000373"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000645"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> The hon. Gentleman says that it is impossible
to entrench through contract, but surely it would be possible to
entrench an understanding or agreement through contract using the sort
of mechanisms to which we have
alluded.</div><a name="0606215000374"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000646"></a>David
Howarth:</b> Not in the absolute way that the clause allows.
Under a contractual arrangement, the two parties can get together to
agree to end the contract. The entrenchment provision in the Bill goes
one stage further and allows an entrenchment that can apply even if the
parties agree to remove the entrenchment. There is a commercial reason
why that might be desired: parties might not want to be put in a
position in which the other side tries to persuade them to change their
minds.</div> <a name="0606215000375"></a><div class="hs_Para">I suppose that
the illustration to give is the story of Ulysses and the Siren. Members
will remember that Ulysses&#151;Odysseus&#151;was travelling on his
ship and heard about the beautiful song of the Sirens, but he knew that
the song would attract his sailors and make them leave their ships, and
they would be killed on the rocks. He got his sailors to bind him to
the mast, so 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column59" />Column number: 60</div>that he could listen to the song of the Sirens and not be destroyed. The
entrenchment provisions are an attempt to allow that possibility in
commercial circumstances. They mean that the only way out of the
problem of disagreement or people changing their minds is not agreement
by the parties, but by action by the court under section 459 of the
1985 Act or by winding up on just and equitable grounds. That is what
the parties in this kind of deal want; they want the deal to be so
heavily entrenched that the only way out of it includes the supervision
of the court. I ask the Minister to reconsider her amendment, and I
hope that the hon. Member for Huntingdon will not press his amendment
to a
vote.</div><a name="0606215000376"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000647"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> We sit in the middle of the two arguments, and that
is probably the right place to be. I shall deal with some of the
detailed issues before discussing the point of principle.</div>
<a name="0606215000377"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was asked why notice needs to
be given to the registrar. I have already given the answer, but I shall
repeat it, if that helps the hon. Member for Huntingdon. In clause 23,
we are trying to create a straightforward mechanism for checking that
that has happened. First, we require the company to notify the
registrar when it concludes provision for entrenchment in its articles.
Secondly, when such a company delivers a document making or evidencing
an amendment in its articles, we require it to deliver with that
document a statement of compliance, stating that the amendment has been
made in accordance with the company&#146;s articles&#151;that is,
in accordance with any relevant provision for
entrenchment.</div><a name="0606215000378"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was
asked what clause 22(1)(b) is about. It enables companies to set a
higher threshold than that required to pass a special resolution. That
is, in fact, the essence of entrenchment. Companies are also currently
permitted to entrench provision in their
memorandums.</div>
<a name="0606215000379"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000648"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Will the Minister explain the purpose of
deleting paragraph (a)?</div>
<a name="0606215000380"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000649"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> We are deleting that paragraph because we
accept&#151;this is why I said that we sit in the middle of the two
arguments&#151;that there may be circumstances in which it is right
to give a provision that enables people to review whether the
entrenchment should hold. Clearly, leaving in clause 22(1)(a) would not
enable that to happen.</div>
<a name="0606215000381"></a><div class="hs_Para">It was alleged that directors
could use the entrenchment mechanisms to give themselves permanent
rights to, say, excessive salaries; that was one of the things that the
hon. Gentleman alleged that we were doing. Directors are not able to
enforce rights that are given to them as directors under a
company&#146;s articles, so that would not be an effective way for
directors to guarantee their level of remuneration. The articles are a
contract between a company and its members as members.</div>
<a name="0606215000382"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the short time that I have
had to get to grips with the Bill, I have, as a non-lawyer, learned a
lot&#151;Imight even get a degree out of it&#151;about the
case of Hickman <i class="I">v. </i>Kent or Romney Marshes Sheep Breeders
Association, and the provisions reflect that. If 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column60" />Column number: 61</div>companies want to entrench provisions about directors&#146;
remuneration, or anything else in the articles, they may do so; we are
not preventing that from happening. However, the amendments seek to
ensure that any entrenchment should be capable of being removed if a
company&#146;s members change their minds.</div>
<a name="0606215000383"></a><div class="hs_Para">Why have a concept of
entrenchment? Why go beyond the special resolution? That is the nub of
the argument. We have to look back at the Companies (Audit,
Investigations and Community Enterprise)Act 2004, which
introduced new provisions that make it difficult to entrench provisions
in articles. There was a demand for us to do so, particularly from
social enterprise and community interest companies. Not every company
will want to be eligible, or to be a community interest company. We
agree with the CLR that the facility should be available generally, so
that people can avail themselves of it if they wish to do
so.</div>
<a name="0606215000384"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000650"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> What sort of things might community interest
companies want to see entrenched?</div>
<a name="0606215000385"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000651"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> I suppose that they might want to entrench in their
articles things such as the activities that they undertake and the
purposes to which their profits might be
put.</div>
<a name="0606215000386"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000652"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I am pleased to hear that. However, if the
driver of the provision is community interest companies, why can
provisions not be put in place for community interest companies only?
Why should they affect all other companies as
well?</div><a name="0606215000387"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000653"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> If these are just provisions of which companies can
avail themselves, why limit it? I cannot, off the top of my head, think
of other circumstances in which a company might wish to entrench its
provisions. We might go back to what we were saying earlier about a
specialist company wanting to limit itself to its specialist activity.
There is a range of things&#151;<i class="I">[Interruption.] </i>I am being
assisted with ideas. It might be, as the hon. Member for Cambridge
said, a joint venture. There are all sorts of situations in which
companies might seek to entrench, and we should not try, in this Bill,
to limit their ability to do so.
</div><a name="0606215000388"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000654"></a>Mr.
Vara:</b> By way of clarification, can the Minister give any
indication as to roughly how many community interest companies there
are?</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000656"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> The Minister looks at me in astonishment. The
reason for my astonishment is the news that the driver for destroying
company shareholder democracy is 300 community interest
companies.</div>
<a name="0606215000391"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000657"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> I have two things to say to the hon. Gentleman. I
did not say that that was the driver for destroying company shareholder
democracy&#151;I do not think that it is&#151;and community
interest companies are pretty new. We passed the legislation to
facilitate their development only a year ago. They might well grow over
time. However, other bodies&#151;joint venture companies 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column61" />Column number: 62</div>could be one, and those who are better versed in these matters might be
able to think of further examples&#151;might want entrenchment
provisions.</div>
<a name="0606215000392"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000658"></a>Jim
Cousins:</b> Under the Government&#146;s building schools
for the future programme, there is provision for local education
partnerships to operate the programme in company format. My local
authority is doing that, and it will have a 10 per cent. shareholding.
It might well&#151;indeed, it might be well advised
to&#151;entrench a limitation on how the company might operate to
protect its interests in future.</div>
<a name="0606215000393"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000659"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> That is an excellent example, and I thank my hon.
Friend for it. I am somewhat puzzled as to why there is an objection to
such a facility, because without it we would limit the ability of
companies to pursue their objectives in the way that they would
wish.</div><a name="0606215000394"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000660"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Is it not the case that the proposal is to
remove CICs from the consolidated Bill into a stand-alone Bill? If that
is the case&#151;the Minister may wish to elaborate on
that&#151;would it not be wise to put the provisions into that
separate piece of
legislation?</div><a name="0606215000395"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000661"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> It would be if we wanted to limit the provisions to
CICs, which we do not necessarily need to do. The hon. Gentleman keeps
saying that he believes the provisions to be an attack on shareholder
democracy. All I can say is that it is up to members of a company to
decide for themselves how they wish to deal with such issues in the
articles that they themselves agree. We are not compelling them to go
down a particular
route.</div><a name="0606215000396"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000662"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I do not think that to be the case in practice.
What if, as the Minister said, that decision was taken at the outset
by, say, the original two members. By the time lots more members come
along, under the Government&#146;s proposal&#151;at least we have
that&#151;they cannot change anything unless 100 per cent. of them
agree. It is
entrenched.</div><a name="0606215000397"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000663"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> There will be facilities. That is why we have a
middle route. We are not saying what the hon. Gentleman sets out,
although it is what the hon. Member for Cambridge would like us to say.
He would like the entrenchment to be
permanent.</div><a name="0606215000398"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
reflecting on the debate in the House of Lords, we understood the
argument that there may well be situations in which people want to
challenge the entrenchment and override it. Therefore, we have provided
that companies can set the rules under which they will decide whether
to lift the
entrenchment.</div><a name="0606215000399"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the
course of the debate, I have agreed rather more with the hon. Member
for Cambridge than with the hon. Member for Huntingdon. We have had a
pretty considered view on how to deal with entrenchment. I hope that I
can convince the Committee that we have listened to the debate, which
has taken place both in the House of Lords and outside with various
stakeholder interests. We have produced a sensible compromise. It is a
way forward that provides for entrenchment but ensures that it is not
for ever.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column62" />Column number: 63</div><a name="0606215000400"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000664"></a>Mr.
Davies:</b> I am a little concerned. I strongly believe that
legislation in general, particularly company law, should be permissive.
We should try to ensure that we provide the greatest degree of
flexibility for the future, and that we allow people to run their
businesses and order their lives in whatever way they want, subject
only to ensuring that the rights of other people are
defended.</div><a name="0606215000401"></a><div class="hs_Para">It may well
be that there are a limited number of cases when somebody wishes to
entrench the articles of association of a company. What is clear is
that one cannot entrench by contract for the simple reason that a
contract under common law can always be varied by agreement of the two
parties. If one wants to have a genuine sense of entrenchment&#151;of
something being absolutely permanent and irrevocable except only when
it is overridden by a court decision&#151;then one has to have the
entrenchment provisions in company law, which we already have. Before
we remove them, we ought to be careful, because we will be taking away
one specific option that currently exists. I do not always have a lot
of sympathy with the Liberal Democrats, but I do in this
case.</div><a name="0606215000402"></a><div class="hs_Para">The right hon.
Lady is possibly on the wrong lines, because amendment No. 83 will
provide for something less than entrenchment in our company legal
system. It will mean that something is only entrenched to the extent
that all the shareholders involved did not agree to change it. That is
not strictly speaking entrenchment.</div>
<a name="0606215000403"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not familiar with the
Bill&#146;s form before it arrived in this House, but in the form in
which it appears before us now it genuinely provides for entrenchment.
It is clear from clause 22 that entrenchment can only take place either
at the outset, when a company is formed, when, by definition, all
members agree to it because otherwise they would not be joining the
company, or subsequently by unanimous agreement. So the concern of my
hon. Friend the Member for Huntingdon on shareholder democracy is
fairly met in that provision, because the people forming the company
are voluntarily binding themselves to an irrevocable
arrangement.</div>
<a name="0606215000469"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.45
pm</div><a name="0606215000404"></a><div class="hs_Para">If we go down
the Government&#146;s road and provide for such entrenchment
subsequently to be capable of relaxation by agreement, there will not
be an irrevocable arrangement and we shall deprive people of being able
to reach such irrevocable agreements in future. It is not clear to me
that the interests of third parties might be unreasonably damaged by
entrenchment&#151;I do not follow the argument that there will be
damage to the company&#146;s creditors or to other stakeholder
interests.</div><a name="0606215000405"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those people
will know when they start to deal with the company concerned that they
are dealing with a company that was formed in such a fashion. So,
unless I am persuaded that there is some third party whose interests
the House of Commons ought to have at heart and who will not be
properly protected, I shall be very reluctant indeed to vote to destroy
the possibility of forming a particular type of company and a
particular type of arrangement between people who want to form a
company.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column63" />Column number: 64</div><a name="0606215000406"></a><div class="hs_Para">The arrangement is provided for
in the law and has not, so as far I know, produced any great scandals
or difficulties. If we abolish it, we will restrict the scope of
company law in this
country.</div><a name="0606215000407"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000665"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman for that
contribution&#151;I have a lot of sympathy with it. I am not sure how
people will vote if we divide, but he might vote with the hon. Member
for Cambridge, and perhaps with us. The provisions that will be made in
company articles on entrenchment will be freely entered into, so if on
establishing its articles the company wishes to make entrenchment
irrevocable, it can do so freely. Our amendments simply provide, in
response to the debate in another place, the facility for companies to
choose how to tackle the issue of entrenchment. We want to provide that
choice for
them.</div><a name="0606215000408"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000666"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> The Minister says that people can freely decide
to enter entrenchment and that therefore it is justified. Hon. Members
can agree freely to vote and pass whatever law they want, but they
cannot bind future Parliaments; they cannot entrench legislation such
that future Parliaments never have the right to change laws again. That
is what we are talking about
here.</div><a name="0606215000409"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000667"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> That is nonsense, if I may say so. It is always
open to any party to change company law. Through the facilities that we
propose, we are trying to provide some certainty for the operation of
companies.</div><a name="0606215000410"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman has banged on and on and on about shareholder democracy. If
we do nothing, however, the special resolution provisions will be the
only ones that determine how changes can take place and they will be a
challenge for minority shareholders&#151;the 25 per cent. who will
not be
needed.</div><a name="0606215000411"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000668"></a>Mr.
Vara:</b> If the Minister will not accept the shareholder
democracy argument, will she accept the argument that other legislation
will impact on companies? For example, there are numerous blocks of
flats around this Palace, and the owner of each flat is a shareholder
in a company for that block&#151;the management company. The
Commonhold and Leasehold Reform Act 2002 provided for leasehold
enfranchisement by allowing leaseholders to purchase the freehold, and
clearly the mentality and thought process of each shareholder were
completely changed in light of the legislation. If that company was
entrenched and, as is the case for many of the flats around here,
people were overseas, it would be impossible to wind it up and to adapt
to new legislation. Flexibility is needed. We cannot account for other
legislation that will have an impact on companies.
</div><a name="0606215000412"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000669"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> I understand that, and it is precisely the purpose
of the amendments we have tabled today. They will ensure that when the
company forms itself in the first instance, the people who freely come
together and decide to form a company can decide whether they wish to
entrench themselves. Members of a company in the situation described by

<div class="Column"><a name="Column64" />Column number: 65</div>the hon. Gentleman could take the option of winding up the company if
they so wished, if it became irrelevant to
them.</div><a name="0606215000413"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000670"></a>Mr.
Vara:</b> If those companies cannot get each of the
shareholders, they cannot wind themselves up. What might be freely
entered into today does not take into account the circumstances that
might exist in five or10 years in a fast-moving commercial
world.</div><a name="0606215000414"></a><div class="hs_Para">The whole
company law structure has had to be consolidated and reconsidered in
the 20 years following the passing of the 1985 Act. We are in an
international world, technology is fast-moving, there are booms and the
economy is fluctuating. The life of companies will alter with the
economic cycles. To entrench companies in such a fast-moving economic
reality does not help the business world.</div>
<a name="0606215000415"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000671"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> To be honest, we have been going round the houses
on this argument long
enough.</div><a name="0606215000416"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000672"></a>David
Howarth:</b> There are two problems. The first is a false
analogy between politics and business. An unamendable constitution in
politics might lead to terrible problems; revolution might end up as
the only way to change the constitution. In business, the company
merely gets wound
up.</div><a name="0606215000417"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second problem
is that those who have spoken do not appear to have remembered that the
court can wind up a company on the just and equitable ground, or
minority shareholders can effectively be bought out on fair grounds
under section 459 of the 1985 Act. It is not the same in principle or
in
practice.</div><a name="0606215000418"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000673"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> That is a helpful intervention. We shall support
the amendments that stand in our name and resist those tabled by the
Opposition.</div><a name="0606215000419"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000674"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> We have had an interesting debate, although I
cannot say that I am happy with how it has gone, and the hon. Member
for Cambridge has been logical in some of his thought processes, but
not in his conclusions. Are we really saying that if shareholders
cannot get on and have entrenchments, the way to bring it all to an end
is to wind the company
up?</div><a name="0606215000420"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000675"></a>David
Howarth:</b> That is not what anyone is saying. A company that
is set up with an entrenchment takes that risk, but it is a risk taken
by the people who form the company. It is up to them whether they wish
to take that risk or
not.</div><a name="0606215000421"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000676"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> But companies evolve. The Committee is here to
produce, formulate and enhance a framework so that companies can thrive
and move forward as members come in and out, not to wind up those
companies.</div>
<a name="0606215000422"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000677"></a>Mr.
Jones:</b> Does my hon. Friend share my concern about the
adverse effects that entrenchment might have on the families and
successors in title to the original shareholders? It is all very well
for the hon. Member for Cambridge to refer to contractual obligations
freely 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column65" />Column number: 66</div>entered into, but there may be successors in title who do not have that
freedom and might be adversely affected by the
provision.</div>
<a name="0606215000423"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000678"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> My hon. Friend makes a fair point, as did my
hon. Friend the Member for North-West Cambridgeshire when he mentioned
mansion blocks. The proposals will have serious practical implications
for small family-owned companies or the blocks of flats in which people
live, let alone for commercial companies, and that will lead to
trouble.</div><a name="0606215000424"></a><div class="hs_Para">I simply do
not accept, as the hon. Member for Cambridge suggested, that winding up
would be the logical conclusion. Of course, it might be, but we want to
encourage companies to sort out their problems, not wind themselves
up.</div><a name="0606215000425"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Gentleman
also seemed to justify the entrenchment provisions and the possible
impact of undermining minority shareholders by saying that they have
access to other parts of the law. He mentioned just and equitable
winding-up and section 459 of the 1985 Act. It is true that those
existing measures provide for the protection of minorities, but I
cannot make the jump to saying that we should take away
shareholders&#146; right to vote just because those provisions
exist.</div><a name="0606215000426"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon. Friend
the Member for Grantham and Stamford made some important points about
the importance of flexibility, and the most interesting aspect was when
we asked the Minister clearly to identify what led us to this clause
and what happened to suggest that entrenchment should be considered.
There is no interest in entrenchment, or demand for it, from large
companies, small family companies or venture capital companies, but 300
CICs apparently liked the idea. I do not know how many companies we
have in this country, but perhaps the Minister can advise me. Tens of
thousands of commercial
companies&#151;</div><a name="0606215000427"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000679"></a>David
Howarth:</b> The hon. Gentleman has just defeated his own
argument. If a large number of companies do not want to entrench
because of the commercial consequences of doing so, the dangers he is
talking about will not
follow.</div><a name="0606215000428"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000680"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> With respect to the hon. Gentleman, that is a
weak argument. The vast majority of companies respect and appreciate
the framework in which they have been operating and have no wish for
change. The Institute of Directors made that clear, and referred to its
points earlier.</div> <a name="0606215000429"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
sure that CICs are being set up for valid charitable and voluntary
objectives, and if they want certain elements in their constitution to
be entrenched, that perhaps is the way we should go, but it should be a
matter for CICs.</div><a name="0606215000430"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
think that the Minister agreed that CICs will have separate
legislation, and they will form their own separate group as we move to
consolidate the provisions. Conservative Members have argued for
consolidation for three or four years, so none of us will argue against
it. If the Minister wants to present arguments for entrenchment in
relation to CICs, that is the place to do it.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column66" />Column number: 67</div><a name="0606215000431"></a><div class="hs_Para">As it happens, we shall have a
formula for entrenchment that no companies seem to want, and the
justifications that I have heard are very weak. I do not see how
shareholder democracy will be enhanced by these provisions; indeed,
quite the opposite&#151;it will only be damaged. It might seem like a
great idea to have entrenchment provisions when companies are first set
up, but those companies that do will regret it, and there will be a
dispute among the
shareholders.</div><a name="0606215000432"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000681"></a>Mr.
Vara:</b> Does my hon. Friend agree that companies that think
entrenchment provisions a good 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column67" />Column number: 68</div>idea in principle might subsequently find them barrier? A bank that is
looking to give a loan might say that it is unhappy with the
restrictions imposed by the constitution and might be reluctant to give
the loan to assist further business.</div>
<a name="0606215000433"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606215000682"></a>Mr.
