Brake:
						</b> It is a pleasure to see you this morning,
Mr. Chope. The purpose of the amendments is to help the
Government to achieve what they set out to achieve&#151;to give local
authorities greater powers. On Second Reading, the Secretary of State
for Communities and Local Government
said:</div>
					<a name="07022754000311"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It is
the job of central Government to enable local government to
play&#148;</div>

of</div>

sustainable communities, regenerating our city
centres&#148;.&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report</i>, 22 January 2007; Vol.
455, c. 1145.]</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column387" />Column number: 388</div>
					<a name="07022754000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">Allowing local authorities to make and
confirm byelaws must be part of the recipe for that, yet only the
Department for Communities and Local Government is giving up its power
to confirm local authority byelaws; other Departments are not. Hence,
we have in front of us a series of rather complicated amendments. They
refer to a number of Acts and are designed to ensure that other
Departments are required to give up their powers to confirm
byelaws.</div>
					<a name="07022754000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">The approach
that the Government have adopted hardly demonstrates joined-up
government. What is the logic of the DCLG giving up its confirmatory
powers when, for instance, the Department for Transport does not? Is
the problem that the Department for Communities and Local Government
has not managed to secure support for its Bill from the Department for
Transport?</div>
					<a name="07022754000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">Hon.
Members may be wondering whether that really matters: the answer is
that it does. I have been supplied with a helpful briefing by the Local
Government Association, which sets out a very good reason why it
matters. Newcastle city council has been unable to get confirmation of
a byelaw to ban smoking in a particular public place from the
Department of Transport. The council made a byelaw application under
section 35 of the Highways Act 1980 to ban smoking in Eldon Garden,
which I am sure is a very pretty place. I do not know if any members of
the Committee have visited Eldon Garden&#151;perhaps they could
describe it if they have. The application, which was submitted in March
2004, remains unconfirmed by the Department for Transport. At one point
in the process, the Department said that it did not have time to
consider the application.</div>
					<a name="07022754000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another smoking ban,
confirmation of which was this time requested of the then Office of the
Deputy Prime Minister by Newcastle, was submitted in September 2004 and
took two years to confirm. Clearly, there is a need for Departments
other than the Department for Communities and Local Government to give
up their powers to confirm byelaws. If the Minister will not accept our
sensible and straightforward amendments, I hope that at the very least
he will bang his colleagues&#146; heads together at the Department
for Transport to try to accelerate the process of confirming the byelaw
to which I referred. That proposal might well be overtaken by other
measures relating to smoking, but if a Department is taking nearly
three years&#151;from March 2004 to now&#151;to fail to make
progress on a byelaw, the Department for Communities and Local
Government needs to pick up the issue and run with it.</div>
					<a name="07022754000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of course, the Department for
Transport is involved with byelaws that apply to many other matters, be
it taxis, walkways, horse-drawn omnibuses&#151;I am not sure how many
of those are still in operation&#151;or guided transport systems
other than railways. Bylaws on countryside recreation and local nature
reserves are obviously the responsibility of the Department for
Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. Byelaws on public libraries are
the responsibility of the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, and
those involving acupuncture, piercing and tattooing are the
responsibility of the Department of Health.</div>
					<a name="07022754000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">The experiences of Newcastle
city council tell us why the amendments are necessary. I hope that when
the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column388" />Column number: 389</div>Minister responds to the debate, he will tell us whether his Department
made any attempt to secure the support of other Departments. If it did,
why did discussions about giving up confirmatory powers not bear fruit?
Will he also confirm whether he will, in the example that I have
referred to, put pressure on the Department of Transport to accelerate
the process? Will the Government consider returning to this matter to
ensure that their bid to give local authorities greater powers in
relation to byelaws is delivered? I await the Minister&#146;s
response with interest.</div>
					
					<a name="07022754000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07022754000350"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Robert Syms</b> (Poole) (Con): The hon. Member for Carshalton
and Wallington has made a very good argument. One Department allowing
the procedure but others not allowing it does not seem like joined-up
government. The LGA has made a very good point and I hope the Minister
can, if not today then before the end of proceedings on the Bill, at
least reassure us that the Government have looked at the possibility of
broadening the measure to include other Departments, which would be
sensible.</div>
					
					<a name="07022754000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07022754000351"></a>The
Minister for Local Government (Mr. Phil
Woolas):
						</b> I agree with the point the hon. Member for
Carshalton and Wallington makes and I intend to explain why the Bill as
it stands does what he wants it to do&#151;and does a little bit
more. I acknowledge that that is not the impression that hon. Members
would have got on reading the Bill and the explanatory
notes&#151;indeed, I confess that it was not my impression&#151;but
it is the case.</div>
					<a name="07022754000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
part of the Bill to which the amendments refer is an important part of
the handing over of powers to local government. I urge the Committee to
consider that the point the hon. Gentleman made regarding the time
taken for byelaws to go through the machinery of Government is not in
itself an argument for devolving those powers. A period of two or three
years does not reflect laziness on the part of the Government; that
period has always been fairly constant under all Governments. It simply
reflects the fact that in the greater course of Government decisions,
banning smoking in a park in Newcastle is not at the top of the agenda,
although Opposition Members may think it should be, to take our minds
off some of the bigger questions on which they disagree with us.
Separate from considerations of devolution, good governance requires
the measure.</div>
					<a name="07022754000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
essence, the clause allows the local authority, having consulted on,
prepared and advertised draft byelaws locally, to determine them
itself. There is a proper process that an authority has to go through
to enact a byelaw&#151;after all, they are laws that are being passed
under the powers that Parliament, not Government, has given. The remit
of byelaws is defined by what is already in law, so Parliament is
rightly the arbitrator. Once a council has prepared, advertised, and
consulted upon draft byelaws, the byelaws can then be enacted without
the authority of the Secretary of State. That is the important
shift.</div>
					<a name="07022754000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The hon.
Gentleman asked about the Secretary of State for Communities and Local
Government as distinct from the other Secretaries of State. I assure
him that a Government Bill is introduced on behalf of the whole
Government, agreed through the proper collective 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column389" />Column number: 390</div>procedures, it is not a Bill of one Department. As I said in response to
the debate last week, the Secretary of State, in law, is not an
individual; it is the Secretaries of State in practice. To give the
hon. Gentleman more detail, I shall explain the process.</div>

						If Parliament
gives the go-ahead, we intend to use the powers to introduce the new
procedures first in relation to byelaws that are confirmed by the
Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government. The byelaws
regulate low-level nuisance in local spaces, such as parks and beaches.
The Committee will recall from evidence that beaches and areas near to
them are often subject to byelaws, as are marketplaces. They deal with
local matters that councils and their communities are best placed to
decide on. Reference to central Government in such circumstances is an
unnecessary bureaucratic step. That backs up the point about time
delays.</div>
					<a name="07022754000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">In future,
other Secretaries of State with responsibility for confirming byelaws
may decide, following consultation&#151;that is not a caveat
&#147;may&#148;, but a permissive power&#151;that it would be
appropriate to make use of the powers. In other words, the Bill allows
the devolution of byelaw-making powers to councils across the board. As
in all other functions, it will be for authorities to ensure that they
are acting reasonably and within their powers when making byelaws under
the new procedure. If they fail to do so, they risk challenge in the
courts. I anticipate being asked whether there is an appeal on a
byelaw. There is not, other than the normal democratic procedures in
councils. The only recourse would be to the courts if proper due
process had not been followed. That reflects the Government&#146;s
genuinely devolutionary approach.</div>
					<a name="07022754000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">To support the local
authorities in following the new procedures, we shall maintain the
stock of general advice and model byelaws that is currently available,
so that byelaws in future are prepared within a robust framework of
guidance and good practice. That is necessary to help local
authorities.</div>
					<a name="07022754000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments, backed by an LGA briefing, are unnecessary. The Bill goes
further. I shall explain why. Some byelaws deal with matters on which
it might, on the face of it, be considered that some degree of central
scrutiny by the Government should be retained. For example, certain
transport matters might be subject to byelaws made by private operators
such as tram companies or airports, which have no direct accountability
to local people in the same way as local authorities do. I am sure that
members of the Committee agree that there should be
accountability.</div>
					<a name="07022754000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another
example is byelaws to deal with countryside recreation in national open
spaces, such as national parks and areas of outstanding natural beauty.
Those sometimes raise national issues that cause significant
controversy and debate. A specific example was the proposed byelaw on
speed limits applying to boats on Lake Windermere. Those of us in the
north-west will remember that that proposal caused huge controversy not
only in the Windermere area, but throughout the region and probably the
country because the users of the boats on Lake Windermere come from all
over the country. That is a good example of my argument, so I thought
that I would labour it. To add to the chuckles from Opposition Members,
I must say that it was a huge issue in the <i class="I">Oldham Evening
Chronicle</i>.</div>

						It
is for such reasons that we propose the approach provided for in clause
97 whereby, for the byelaws prescribed in regulations, the Secretary of
State will no longer have a role. In that way, the policy decision on
whether particular byelaws should remain subject to the Secretary of
State&#146;s consent can be taken on a subject-by-subject basis. If,
following consultation, it is decided that a central confirming role is
no longer required for particular types of byelaw, the Bill will allow
us to use the new powers provided in regulations made under new section
236A of the Local Government Act 1992, which we propose in the
clause.</div>

						</b> I can give the reassurance that the hon. Gentleman
is looking for in two ways. First, this is a Government Bill and,
secondly, it is not only agreed, but pursued with enthusiasm. Such
matters are not at the top of the in-trays of Secretaries of State. As
the evidence sessions showed, although the decisions are signed off by
the Secretaries of State, in practice it is humble junior Ministers
such as I&#151;with the professional advice of our
officials&#151;who deal with these matters. It is sensible not to
have such matters dealt with by a Secretary of State. New section 236A
will allow for the new approach to be
adopted.</div>
					<a name="07022754000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
offers a specific list of organisations. Prescribing clearly in
regulations the types of byelaw that can be enacted without first
seeking central confirmation also enables certain elements of the
byelaw-making process to be subject to minimum requirements&#151;for
example, consultation on draft byelaws and publicity of byelaws
following their enactment&#151;that are different from those provided
for in current legislation, ensuring some consistency of standard if
necessary. Through that regulation and through the change to section
236 of the 1972 Act, we will capture the totality and other
organisations that may not be included in the amendment, as well as
future bodies that may come about as a result of process and some of
the processes in the Bill.</div>
					<a name="07022754000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">My rationale for not listing
the organisations as the amendment does, which on the face of it seems
to move against the approach that we took regarding the list of bodies
that are subject to the duty to co-operate, was twofold. First, there
is the pragmatic consideration that we need to be certain that we cover
all bodies. We did not want to have to come back to primary legislation
because we missed some out. Some of these bodies are pretty obscure and
date back centuries, although that is not to say they are not
honourable and worthy bodies&#151;Lichfield park may be included for
all I know. Secondly, not listing them gave us a catch-all regulation
for which we believe there is a
consensus.</div>

							<b class="B">Mr.
David Burrowes</b> (Enfield, Southgate) (Con): I have a quick
question on the clause. Given that the central confirming role of the
Secretary of State is not necessary in relation to certain prescribed
subjects, why not give the power of enforcement in relation to those
subjects to which the alternative arrangements apply? The Secretary of
State is willing to devolve powers to create some byelaws, so why not
allow enforcement in respect of those subjects that have been
prescribed in that manner without having to go back to the Secretary of
State for
confirmation?</div>
					
					<a name="07022754000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07022754000358"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b>
						<b class="B"> </b>Let me explain what we are trying to do,
which I think will answer the point arising from clauses 98
and 99. Clause 98, which refers to fixed penalties for breach of
byelaws, gives the Secretary of State the power to make regulations
that will provide for the enforcement of the types of byelaws specified
in the regulations through fixed penalty notices as an alternative to
enforcement through magistrates courts. Fixed penalties are an
established way of dealing with low-level environmental nuisances, such
as dog fouling and graffiti. Extending fixed penalties to the
enforcement of certain byelaws will be consistent with their use in
other areas and allow a co-ordinated approach by the local authority
and Departments. Fixed penalties provide an effective deterrent and
avoid the cost of court action.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column392" />Column number: 393</div>
					<a name="07022754000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">Initially, we intend that the
new arrangements will apply only to byelaws that are subject to the
alternative procedures set out in the previous clause. In future, other
Departments with policy responsibility for byelaws may, following
consultation, decide that it would be appropriate to make use of the
new powers. I am repeating the point that I made to the hon. Member for
Carshalton and Wallington on his amendment. The clause also confers on
the Secretary of State the power to make regulations that specify the
range within which the amount of a fixed penalty must fall.</div>
					<a name="07022754000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">Where a range has been
specified, local authorities may choose to set an amount within that
range. If no range has been set, local authorities will have the
freedom to set the penalty. Where the local authority does not specify
a penalty for the breach of a byelaw, the clause provides for a default
amount of &#163;75. Giving local authorities the ability to vary
penalties and offer discounts for early payment will enable them to
take account of local conditions and to encourage early payment of
fines.</div>
					<a name="07022754000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
empowers the Secretary of State to make an order to change the default
amount as necessary so that the level remains in line with similar
low-level offences. The clause also gives an authorised officer who
proposes to issue a fixed penalty notice for breach of a byelaw the
power to require the person to whom he or she is giving the notice to
give their name and address. A person who fails to give their name and
address or who gives a false name and address will be committing an
offence. That is within established procedures for the issue of fixed
penalties. I think that that answers the point that the hon. Gentleman
makes about enforcement. Perhaps he would indicate whether that is the
case.</div>

								Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> Finally, we could make regulations providing for a
fixed penalty regime in relation to a byelaw for which the Secretary of
State kept his or her confirmation powers. We are not doing anything
new in terms of existing procedures and powers in some areas, dog
fouling being the most well known. We are extending that process to a
wider range of byelaws to allow Departments to devolve powers to local
authorities to make real the enactment and enforcement of byelaws. On
that basis, I commend the clause to the
Committee.</div>

							<a name="07022754000362"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> That is a finely balanced argument, and it is
reasonable of the hon. Gentleman to make it. On the one hand, one could
say that local authorities should not use the fixed penalty notice
powers as an income-generating method, lest an accusation of stealth
tax or some other such spurious accusation be made by the political
parties that make such accusations. The real point, however, is that
for a fixed penalty to carry public consent, as any law, fee or fine
must do, there must be confidence that it is being levied for its
stated purpose.</div>
					<a name="07022754000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the other hand, one could say, as the hon. Gentleman has, that if we
are genuinely devolutionary and trust local authorities, we should
allow them to make that decision and carry the can. In practice, if the
ring-fenced and hypothecated approach is taken, there are problems in
defining how it will work out. Hon. Members will be familiar with the
difficulties of identifying fixed costs, marginal costs and so on in
allocation.</div>
					<a name="07022754000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government have taken the middle route, proposing simply that the
councils should have regard to using the money generated by such fixed
penalty notices to address the general problem on which the fixed
penalty notice is meant to bear down, without being too prescriptive.
To help to carry public consent and help the councils to carry it, it
makes sense to ask the Committee to agree to the measures to put that
encouragement into the Bill.</div>
					<a name="07022754000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">Hon. Members will be aware of
the controversy surrounding fines from speeding cameras&#151;various
campaigns suggest that the fines have nothing to do with bearing down
on speeding but are meant to raise revenues. I want to declare that
councils have the power to bear down on offences. In that way, we can
bolster local government&#146;s ability to improve communities. That
is the reason for the

specifically dedicated officers, who will occasionally be able to issue
fixed penalty notices in some circumstances: on some occasions, those
will be wardens or rangers who are employed by the local authority or
partner organisations. In some cases, trading standards officers may be
involved. That may be appropriate.</div>

					<a name="07022754000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the police community support
officers, the role of the police is established in the Police Reform
Act 2002, schedule 5 of which contains a list. That allows a local
authority flexibility to designate which officers or officials would be
covered, so it is a flexible power. Before a community support officer,
or such an accredited person, is able to issue fixed penalty notices,
the chief police officer is involved in the designation. Indeed, an
officer cannot be designated without the chief police officer&#146;s
consent. We have rightly built that safety net into previous
legislation, which applies to this
measure.</div>

						</b> The citizen is backed by the law and access to the
courts. If a fixed penalty notice is issued by an accredited officer of
the local authority, including a police community support officer, that
officer will have been accredited by the chief police officer. On an
appeal against the issue of a notice&#151;that is, &#147;Not
guilty, guv!&#148;&#151;or a challenge to the process and the right
of a person to issue it, people will have recourse to the courts, as is
currently the case under byelaws. Often, the public do not realise
that, but it is so.</div>

							<b class="B">Mr.
Philip Dunne</b> (Ludlow) (Con): I should like the Minister to
clarify two aspects of the clause. First, does it, or previous clauses,
cover local authorities wishing to amend, rather than revoke, a byelaw?
Secondly, subsection (2) provides a power to local authorities in
relation to byelaws that they have made. I accept that separate clauses
will give power to a Secretary of State to revoke a byelaw. However,
revoking a byelaw set up by some other authority, perhaps in respect of
bridleways open to all traffic, which are an issue in my constituency,
or re-routeing a footpath, is often highly controversial even though it
may be appropriate given the changes in agricultural techniques since
it was originally introduced. Could amendments of that nature, or
revocations of powers that may not have originally been made by the
relevant authority, be revoked or amended under the
clause?</div>
					
					<a name="07022754000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07022754000368"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> The clause is in the Bill for two reasons. The
first is that we need to give the power to make a byelaw revoking one
previously made by the authority, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column395" />Column number: 396</div>where, for some reason, there is no other power to do so, either because
the byelaw has become obsolete or it is not known from where it
derived. That is why we have put in a fall-back for the Secretary of
State, which appears to be, on the face of the Bill, contrary to the
general direction of travel.</div>
					<a name="07022754000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
example shows, some byelaws were put into place by bodies that no
longer exist. It is not intended that amendments to byelaws should be
covered. The process for a new byelaw requires the revocation of the
old one and we believe that putting this power down to local authority
level is the sensible way to approach the
issue.</div>
					<a name="07022754000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause also
gives Ministers in Wales, as well as the Secretary of State, the powers
to revoke byelaws that have become obsolete or unnecessary under the
process that I have described. It is our intention&#151;and it is
important to put this on the record&#151;that the power will be used
only where the power to revoke the byelaw, or the identity of the
authority which should otherwise revoke it, is unclear. In other words,
it might not be known where the byelaw comes from and the authority
that should revoke it may be unclear. In those circumstances, we have
this tidying-up exercise.</div>
					<a name="07022754000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">In summary, the clause is
designed to cover cases where the aim is to get rid of a byelaw but it
is not clear, as I have said, who can do that. That is the answer to

give an overview of the likely impact of this clause. I welcome the

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local
Government (Angela E. Smith):
						</b> It may be helpful to set the
clause in the context of general devolutionary thrust of the Bill and
the responsibility on local authorities to monitor their own
performance. The clause amends the definition of local authorities, and
therefore the definition of best value authorities for the purpose of
part 1 of the Local Government Act 1999. Applying the principle of
proportionality, this clause removes various smaller bodies from the
scope of best value.</div>
					<a name="07022754000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection (1) amends both the
definition of English and Welsh local authorities by removing parish
councils, parish meetings and community councils from the definition of
local authority in section 1 of the London Government Act 1999.
Subsection (2) removes local precepting authorities from the list of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column396" />Column number: 397</div>bodies to which the Secretary of State may, by order, extend the duty of
best value. That ensures that the definition of best value authority
cannot be amended by an order under section 2 of the 1999 Act to make
parish councils and parish meetings best value authorities. Subsection
(3) refers to schedule 7, which makes minor and consequential
amendments.</div>
					<a name="07022754000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The clause
affects only those larger towns and parish councils that are currently
subject to best value. That is 41 out of more than 8,500 town and
parish councils. All other parish councils, including Welsh community
councils, were exempted from best value by orders made in 2002 and
2003. That will give those authorities more discretion to monitor and
manage their own internal performance and we consider that it will give
them more room to deliver high-quality and responsive local services
and to improve their internal
performance.</div>

E. Smith:
						</b> The clause is a key plank in the
Government&#146;s commitment to ensuring greater engagement and
empowerment of local communities. It will insert a new section 3A into
the Local Government Act 1999 placing a duty on best value authorities
in England, except police authorities, to involve representatives of
local persons in the exercise of authority functions where
appropriate.</div>
					<a name="07022754000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">Authorities
will need to consider if and how local representatives should be
informed of, consulted on and/or involved in local authority decisions.
It will be for the authorities themselves to determine the most
appropriate means of involvement, but they must have regard to any
guidance issued by the Secretary of State. Within those existing
powers, authorities will be able to involve local people directly in
management and in decision-making
responsibilities.</div>
					<a name="07022754000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The
leverage provided by the duties is essential to ensure that authorities
engage appropriately with local communities. It will provide an
important counterbalance to the reduction in top-down controls in the
new performance framework. A number of authorities already inform,
consult and involve local people, but not all of them do. We want all
people, irrespective of which authority area they live in, to benefit
from greater engagement and
empowerment.</div>
					<a name="07022754000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">Several
mechanisms will provide recourse should an authority not meet
requirements of the duty. Risk assessment, audit and inspection will
have a greater focus on outcomes for citizens, including consideration
of how an authority is meeting the duty. That will be an external
challenge to authorities and may lead to closer inspection if they are
found wanting.</div>
					<a name="07022754000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						National
performance indicators, including citizen perspective indicators, will
also be published to increase accountability not only to inspectorates
and partners 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column397" />Column number: 398</div>but to local people. If the indicators show cause for concern, it could
lead to additional inspection or to challenge from peers or from local
people who raise a community call for action. The new overview and
scrutiny arrangements will also provide an opportunity, if an authority
appears to be failing in its duty, for internal challenge by
councillors. Should the issues be raised by a community call for
action, that in turn could be examined by overview and
scrutiny.</div>
					<a name="07022754000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
will provide the Secretary of State with powers to make additional
exemptions from the duty using secondary legislation subject to the
negative resolution procedure. It will not provide authorities with any
additional powers, and is therefore not a duty to devolve. I commend
the clause to the
Committee.</div>

						</b> We have moved swiftly to clause
113.</div>
					<a name="07022754000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The
policy behind the clause is, first, to ensure that the Audit Commission
fulfils the purpose for which it was established and is seen to be
focusing on that. The Audit Commission was established to help local
authorities to control their costs. That was its prime objective.
Labour Members may recall that the Audit Commission was established by
the then Prime Minister, now Baroness Thatcher, as part of what was
described at the time as an onslaught on local government. That was in
the days when central Government was not a friend of councils, unlike
the present time, when consensus is the order of the
day.</div>
					<a name="07022754000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Teasing
apart, my serious point is that it is often forgotten that the Audit
Commission is there to oversee the books and to ensure that value for
money and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column398" />Column number: 399</div>efficiency are achieved. The Audit Commission has been a huge help to
local authorities in meeting those goals, as we saw again last week in
the announcement of findings of the comprehensive performance
assessment, which is the second part of the policy in which the changes
are set. Controversial though the comprehensive performance assessment
was at the time of its introduction and painful though it has
occasionally been, it has fulfilled its purpose of securing a general
improvement in the quality of local government service provision. Those
are the two policy contexts. I am grateful to you, Mr.
Chope, for allowing me
leeway.</div>
					<a name="07022754000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						To
respond to the hon. Member for Poole, clause 113 reduces the number of
Audit Commission board members from the current minimum of 15 and
maximum of 20 to a minimum of 10 and a maximum of 15. The number of
commissioners that is currently prescribed is more than the ideal
number for incisive debate of strategic issues. It is a bit too big and
unwieldy. The Audit Commission has been carrying vacancies on its board
for almost two years and is operating with only 13 members. Experience
shows that that is a sufficient number to carry out the relevant
functions. The Audit Commission&#146;s chair and chief executive have
expressed the view that the statutory requirement should be decreased
as proposed. We are about to embark on a recruitment exercise to bring
the number of board members up to 15 from this
summer.</div>
					<a name="07022754000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">The proposals
have been advanced by the chair and the chief executive of the Audit
Commission and I believe that 10 to 15 board members are sufficient for
proper decision-making experience and proper scrutiny of the Audit
Commission&#146;s work, without being unwieldy and over-bureaucratic.
It is a question of balance and judgment. I think that it is best to
take the advice of the chair and the chief executive and agree to the
change.</div>

E. Smith:
						</b> I am grateful to hon. Gentlemen for their
comments. I hope that I can do justice to them and address their
concerns. The clause replaces section 37 of the Audit Commission Act
1998 with a wider power for the Audit Commission to provide advice or
assistance. Section 37 enables the Audit Commission to provide
assistance to certain named inspection bodies such as Ofsted and Her
Majesty&#146;s chief inspector of prisons, and to charge for such
assistance. The clause also inserts in the 1998 Act new schedule 2A, as
set out in schedule 11, which makes provision for the interaction of
the Audit Commission with various persons and bodies in the exercise of
its inspection and studies function. If we take into account clause
122, I can extend the debate and that may help in later
discussions.</div>
					<a name="07022754000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Clause
122 repeals sections 35 and 35A of the 1998 Act, which allow
the commission to undertake fee-paid improvement studies of certain
bodies at their request, or in some cases at the request of the Mayor
of London. When we were considering such matters, we saw that there was
a potential conflict of interest arising through the same body offering
both improvement support 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column400" />Column number: 401</div>and inspection, in effect, operating as a critical friend and as an
external regulator. Concerns have been expressed that this might lead
some bodies to consider buying improvement services from the commission
to obtain a better result at inspection. Commission inspectors could
then be called on to judge impartially improvement work carried out by
their colleagues.</div>
					<a name="07022754000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						There is also
a value for money issue. The Government already fund the Improvement
and Development Agency, the IDeA, to carry out improvement work and the
commission&#151;also a publicly funded body&#151;should not be
competing in the same market for fee-paid improvement work.</div>
					<a name="07022754000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">We took on board comments made

inspectorates, referred to as &#147;inspection authorities&#148;,
and public bodies with which the Audit Commission will interact over

Commission to list the inspections that it proposes to carry out and
the way in which it will do them. Before drawing up the programme, the
commission must consult the Secretary of State, the inspection
authorities and any other body specified by the Secretary of State,
unless that requirement is waived by the body concerned. That might
occur where the commission is not proposing to inspect any bodies
within the remit of a particular inspectorate, so there would be no
benefit gained from consulting that body. Paragraph 5 provides the
Audit Commission with a gatekeeper role in relation to the inspection
of local authorities.</div>
					<a name="07022754000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">What we are proposing&#151;I
hope it will be accepted&#151;is a good act of joined-up government.
The Government&#146;s policy is to reduce the number of inspectorates
from 11 to four, but councils complain not only about the number of
inspectorates that can come in and inspect their various functions, but
about the apparent and often real unco-ordinated way in which those
inspections are carried out. At its most extreme, that can debilitate a
local authority&#146;s ability to do its business. Indeed, at the end
of the spectrum is the poor old Isles of Scilly unitary authority which
has five local government offices which were subject to more than 250
days of inspection the year before last. There are other examples that
I could give.</div>

inspectorate. That gatekeeper role is made real by paragraph 5 of the
proposed new schedule. In essence, the Audit Commission will be able
issue a notice to prevent a proposed inspection by another inspection
authority from going ahead if it considers that the inspection or the
manner of that inspection will impose an unreasonable burden on the
inspected organisation.
</div>
					<a name="07022754000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The
Secretary of State will specify which organisations are covered by the
gatekeeper provisions. I expect that the Audit Commission and the other
inspection bodies will discuss and agree the programme before formal
consultation takes place. The Secretary of State will have reserve
powers to allow inspections, as Parliament and local authorities may
require in certain circumstances. That is what we are trying to achieve
and it is consistent with other areas of Government policy. I think
that it is to be generally welcomed. <i class="I">[Interruption.] </i>Apologies
on behalf of my hon. Friend the Whip. He has got many ways of telling
me to get a move on, and I am grateful to him for that.</div>
					<a name="07022754000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph 9 of proposed new
schedule 2A was intended to confer a power on the Audit Commission to
provide advice or assistance to other public authorities in England and
to named audit bodies in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. We now
wish, after consultation, to extend the scope of that power to allow
the Audit Commission to provide advice or assistance to other public
bodies outside the United Kingdom and to any public authority within
the devolved Administrations. We consider that the provision of advice
or assistance will only be a small amount of work, but it will allow
the Audit 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column402" />Column number: 403</div>Commission to share its expertise and knowledge overseas. We believe
that that would be a valuable export and attribute to our country in
our reputation overseas. We are the best at public sector auditing and
we ought to give our commission the ability to use that expertise
overseas. It could help to generate an income stream for the Audit
Commission and to increase the body of knowledge and expertise that it
has and it will be good for the United Kingdom&#146;s reputation
overseas. </div>
					<a name="07022754000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">We intended
that the commission be able to charge a fee for carrying out work at
inspection authorities, with the requirement that it obtain consent
from the Secretary of State to charge a fee to other public bodies.
That was to ensure that the advice or assistance function did not
become onerous and lead to the commission straying from its core remit
and to ensure that the commission did not use the power to reintroduce
its voluntary improvement work which was to be repealed under clause
122. We now wish for that consent requirement to be removed for the
reasons that I have given. The Audit Commission has offered assurance
on both of those points and there is an added comfort that the
commission&#146;s core remit of audit and inspection are statutory
duties, so that it is obliged to carry them out.</div>
					<a name="07022754000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">In practice, the commission
would only provide advice or assistance at the request of another body,
so there would be a natural limit on the demands upon it. In view of
that, we are proposing that there should not a consultation for
charging for advice and assistance either in the United Kingdom or
abroad. My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary has already referred to our
wish to amend clause 122 in the light of the representations made, the
discussions in Committee, and the points made at the evidence stage and
on Second Reading. Once again, I hope that the Committee will agree
that we are adopting a sensible and open
approach.</div>

Peter Soulsby:

has outlined. In particular, I welcome the initiation of a clear
gatekeeper role, which will involve giving one body the lead
responsibility. That lead role will ensure the co-operation and
co-ordination of inspection that has often been lacking in the
past.</div>
					<a name="07022754000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">In general, I
welcome the reduction of the overall burden of inspection and the
proposals that will lead to a reduction of the number of inspectorates.
The problem is not only lack of co-ordination between inspectorates,
but the multiplicity of them.</div>
					<a name="07022754000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also welcome the intention
that underlies the proposals to tailor inspection to an assessment of
risk in the real world. Inspection has in the past been perceived as
the ticking of boxes regardless of realities on the ground and the
importance of the services being inspected. I welcome the proposals and
the intention that lies behind them, and I hope that the measures lead
to joined-up inspection.</div>

the benefit of having been the leader of a major local authority. My
observation from experience is that valuable auditing exercises can
become tick-box exercises as people gain more experience in the
inspection regime. That does not invalidate the purpose 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column403" />Column number: 404</div>and remit of the inspectorate regime as envisaged&#151;I am not
disparaging the findings of that regime. It was put to me by one chief
executive that there is a difference between learning how to pass
one&#146;s driving test and learning how to drive. Although the
driving test is a good test of whether one can drive, the experience of
driving is different. That type of argument becomes more attractive the
older one gets, but I am grateful for my hon. Friend&#146;s

								Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> We now move on to the interaction of the benefits
inspectorates and the Audit Commission. I should explain that we are
not talking about benefit fraud or the inspectorate that deals with it;
we are talking about the inspectorate that deals with the
administration of benefits. Of course, benefits and revenues&#151;or
&#147;bens and revs&#148;, as they are known in local
councils&#151;are a very important part of the function of
authorities. The interaction between the Audit Commission and benefits
inspectors is what the clause deals with.</div>
					<a name="07022754000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The clause
changes the Social Security Administration Act 1992, which some hon.
Members may remember was quite controversial. No takers? Surely I am
not the only person here who was at the demonstration? The clause will
ensure that if the Secretary of State decides to authorise people to
report on benefits administration in local authorities, those people
will have to go through the Audit Commission&#146;s gatekeeper
process before undertaking any inspection of local authorities. That is
a practical example of what my hon. Friend the Member for Leicester,
South referred to. The process will involve authorised people preparing
and sharing with the Audit Commission a document setting out the
proposed programme of
inspection.</div>
					<a name="07022754000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Subsection
(4) requires any authorised persons to co-operate with the Audit
Commission and gives them powers to work jointly with the Audit
Commission where co-operation or joint working benefits the efficient
and effective discharge of the authorised person&#146;s functions. In
other words, it will allow the expertise of the benefits inspectorate
to be utilised without creating an unco-ordinated burden on the local
authority.</div>
					<a name="07022754000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
provisions support the strategic forward planning role proposed for all
inspectorates in the Government&#146;s policy across Departments,
which is that they consult and share their proposed inspection 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column404" />Column number: 405</div>programmes and frameworks with each other to enable them collectively to
reduce duplication and the weight of inspection on local authorities.
As in other public bodies in which the Audit Commission may have a
role, that will be done through the respective gatekeeper, for example
Her Majesty&#146;s inspectorate of constabulary or the National
Offender Management Service.</div>
					<a name="07022754000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The provision
will enable the identification of opportunities for integrating
inspection events and provide a way to discuss and alter inspection
programmes to make them more efficient and less disruptive. It will
also have the consequential benefit of allowing personnel and other
resources to be shared to get the best of both worlds. The provision is
sensible and is welcomed by the Audit Commission. I commend it to the
Committee.</div>

what the clause is about. It may be a dry subject, but it is important
that local authorities understand the intention behind the
clause.</div>
					<a name="07022754000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
refers to the powers of auditors and inspectors to obtain information,
which is central to their raison d&#146;être. It clarifies the
powers of auditors and Audit Commission best value inspectors to obtain
such information. It makes explicit their right to copy and take away
documents and updates the original powers in section 6 of the Audit
Commission Act 1998 and section 11 of the Local Government Act 1999 to
include electronic information and computers to take account of the
fact that information is now routinely held electronically. I remember
debating that clause in 1999. As I recall, Members on both sides of the
House argued that it was not necessary. It seems a long time ago now.
It is important that access to information held electronically is
granted to Audit Commission best value
inspectors.</div>
					<a name="07022754000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">The power
will ensure that auditors can require such information to be produced
in a form that can be taken away if necessary, in order to help the
Audit Commission to do its job. Importantly, the clause also makes it
clear that it is a criminal offence to obstruct the exercise of the
power. The requirement for auditing information is
important.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07022754000393"></a>
								Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> I am aware of where the threat of the power has
been used, but I cannot recall the power being used during my period,
although I am sure it has been in past decades. The hon. Gentleman nods
to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column405" />Column number: 406</div>recognise my point about the threat and, without that threat and without
it being a criminal offence, shredding&#151;and its electronic
equivalent&#151;may be more prevalent. I strongly believe that there
is a good regime of propriety in local government in this country and
it will be perpetuated by this measure. The regime has been built up
under Governments of all political persuasions.</div>
					<a name="07022754000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The clause
confirms the practice employed by auditors and inspectors in obtaining
such information, so the proposed processes are current practice.
Concern may be raised about the potential for unreasonable use of these
powers and it is known that inspectors are sometimes over-zealous for
all sorts of reasons. This clause ensures that auditors and inspectors
must act reasonably. For example, they must not remove original
documents critical to the running of an organisation, without very good
reason. They must also exercise a duty of care over any documents and
information obtained. Therefore, the clause gives inspectors
responsibilities as well as rights. In that respect, I believe it
provides a properly balanced approach. I commend the clause to the
Committee.</div>

								Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> This clause clarifies that the Audit
Commission&#146;s powers of best value inspection under the Local
Government Act 1999 enable it to carry out general inspections of the
performance of best value authorities and not simply inspections of the
arrangements in place to deliver continuous
improvement.</div>
					<a name="07022754000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">The other
public service inspectorates have more explicit performance inspection
powers. The Audit Commission has expressed concern that its power
could, as a result of the changes to best value in part 8 of the Bill,
be interpreted as simply focusing on the arrangements that authorities
have in place and not about their performance, which is at the heart of
best value. As we say in Lancashire, we have got to see the wood for
the trees&#151;that is probably said elsewhere, but we certainly say
it in Lancashire.</div>
					<a name="07022754000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause ensures that the Audit Commission will continue to be able to
inspect a best value authority&#146;s performance. That will keep the
commission in line with other public service inspectorates and
eliminate possible concern about their joint working.</div>
					<a name="07022754000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The clause is
important in relation to clause 106 because it gives real power to the
best value duty to inform, involve and consult, by ensuring that that
is a continuous inspection. When citizens, residents, voluntary sector
organisations and others question where the teeth are to that best
value duty, part of the answer, as referred to by my hon. Friend the
Under-Secretary, is here. The clause appears rather obscure, but it is
important in the devolutionary process and the reconnection of the
public to public

						</b> This measure relates to the studies that the Audit
Commission undertakes on a national basis and not to the nationwide
surveys. Formally, the clause amends section 33 of the Audit Commission
Act 1998, and it allows the commission to undertake studies to help to
improve economy, efficiency and effectiveness at the best value
authorities, audited bodies and certain local government bodies in
Wales. The commission has similar powers to section 34 of that Act to
publish reports assessing the impact of, in particular, statutory
provisions or directions or guidance issued by a Minister of the
Crown.</div>
					<a name="07022754000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
requires the Audit Commission to consult the Secretary of
State&#151;or, where appropriate, Ministers in Wales&#151;before
carrying out or promoting studies or reports. The commission usually
carries out a public consultation exercise on each national
study&#146;s programme. The clause formalises the inclusion of the
Secretary of State in that consultation and is aimed at minimising
duplication and increasing efficiency. That means that when a national
study is done, it should be done in co-operation. Part of my rationale,
which I have discussed with the Audit Commission, goes back to my
introductory remarks on clause 113, regarding the focus of the
commission and the work that it has undertaken. The clause refers to

							<b class="B">Andrew
Stunell</b> (Hazel Grove) (LD): I am sure that the Minister
will recall that I raised serious concerns about the clause on Second
Reading and I understand that he suggested earlier today that the
Government 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column407" />Column number: 408</div>might be having second thoughts about it. It, along with several others,
is one of the most perplexing clauses in the
Bill.</div>
					<a name="07022754000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause takes
away from the Audit Commission the capacity to assist local councils,
or any other body that is subject to audit, in specific inquiries
commissioned by that local authority. That seems quite perverse, and if
the Government are having another look at it, that is
overdue.</div>
					<a name="07022754000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have
received information from the commission because I am interested to
know exactly what the effect of this will be and who will be harmed if
the clause is included in the Bill. It tells me that, in relation to
its overall activities, a very small proportion of its
turnover&#151;about 0.5 per cent., I gather&#151;is involved in
those special studies. The studies are nevertheless quite important
and, for those boroughs and organisations that have commissioned the
commission at very low cost, have been good value.</div>
					<a name="07022754000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						As I asked a
specific question, I understand that Tameside borough council has
benefited from commissioning such a report. We have a Committee member
who is on that council and he may later get up and say that, in his
role on scrutiny, he has taken advantage of the work done for Tameside
on transport services provided for those with special needs. Similar
studies have been conducted in the London borough of Brent on the
effectiveness of arrangements for management staff. Stockton borough
council undertook a study on performance management in social services
departments. The commission&#146;s briefing to me said
that</div>
					<a name="07022754000315"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;this followed
concern that children&#146;s social services had received only
one-star star rating when the council had clearly believed that things
were better than they
were&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07022754000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">The council
therefore asked the commission to come in, at a cost of &#163;10,000
to the council. I understand that local Members of Parliament are aware
of that study and believe that it achieved excellent results. The South
Yorkshire police authority asked the commission to undertake a study of
IT services and again a useful report was produced at a very low
cost.</div>
					<a name="07022754000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">Five Durham
districts&#151; Derwentside, Chester-le-Street, Teesdale, Easington
and Durham City&#151;jointly commissioned a development plan to get
some meaningful performance indicators for regeneration in the Durham
county area, all of which seemed to be high value in terms of results
and low cost in terms of the charge to the public purse. In other
words, they are all of great value. Yet no such studies could go ahead
if this clause is accepted.</div>
					<a name="07022754000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">It must be a challenge to the
Minister to explain why on earth this step is being taken. Something
that is simple, practical and beneficial to local government and causes
no grief to anybody is being singled out for abolition at a
time when actually, in other parts of the Bill, as we have discussed
earlier, there is an intention to create more multi-body partnerships
than ever before.</div>
					<a name="07022754000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">When the duty to co-operate is
put into effect, there is no doubt that that will result in more joint
commissioning of services. A number of issues have already been raised
in this Committee about where the buck will stop, who will be
responsible for monitoring and on how tight management control and
value for money will be ensured&#151;something perhaps delivered 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column408" />Column number: 409</div>more easily by a single organisation than a multiple body. At exactly
the time when we might expect something similar to the five Durham
districts&#146; joint approach to the Audit Commission and when it
might be very sensible for a new partnership to say that it needs the
commission to run its eye over something, the clause will prevent that
from happening. Will the Minister explain in clear terms what the
rethink consists of and give us his response to my points, which I
understand the commission itself feels should be taken into
account?</div>
					<a name="07022754000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">Depending on
the nature of the Minister&#146;s assurances, or not, my colleagues
and I might want to oppose this clause. It is only a small side issue,
but one on which the Government have made the wrong choice for no
discernable reason. We need to hear from the Minister on
that.</div>

							<a name="07022754000398"></a>Mr.
Dunne:
						</b> I rise to support the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
comments. This is a peculiar clause. Earlier, the Under-Secretary said
that the clause was somehow in conflict with the inspection role of the
Audit Commission and its role in undertaking reports or studies. I fail
to see how that conflict arises. I have more examples from my area of
when the commission had been requested by a local authority to
investigate an aspect of the council&#146;s activity. It was in
relation to a capital project when the overspend was substantial. South
Shropshire district council, the local authority, had procedures in
place for managing the capital project that were clearly inadequate. It
accepted that there was a case for the commission to be asked to review
its policies and procedures so that it could learn for the future how
to avoid the
problem.</div>
				
					<a name="07022754000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
role was entirely appropriate for an external body to undertake. The
Audit Commission, having the responsibility to audit the authority, was
best placed to do it. Why should that be excluded from its functions
for that apparent but, to my mind, non-existent conflict of
interest?</div>
					
					<a name="07022754000322"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12
noon</div>
					<a name="07022754000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">We could
envisage, for example, at some stage in the future the Audit Commission
being invited to undertake a study into the project management role
played by the relevant authorities in looking at the delivery of the
Olympic games in London in 2012. The Under-Secretary may be able to put
me right but, if my understanding is correct, by excluding an
individual study by the Audit Commission of something like this, it
might be excluded from undertaking such a role. That might be a
controversial example and I do not want to sidetrack the hon. Lady into
a debate about responsibilities for the delivery of the Olympic games.
However, it helps to illustrate the point that there are some
individual studies that the Audit Commission ought to be able to
undertake and excluding them through the clause would be
retrograde.</div>

E. Smith:
						</b> I will endeavour to choose my words carefully to
explain fully the Government&#146;s intention. I say to the hon.
Member for Hazel Grove, who said that he did not receive a satisfactory
response to the issues that he raised, that I can give him an answer
with which he will be happy. He considered voting against clause 122,
which repeals sections 35 and 35A of the Audit Commission Act 1998. It
allows the commission to undertake fee-paid improvement studies of
certain bodies at their request or in some cases at the request of the
Mayor of
London.</div>
					<a name="07022754000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Even
if we decided to remove the commission&#146;s power to undertake
improvement studies under sections 35 and 35A, we would still need to
repeal those sections as they overlap with the power to provide advice
or assistance under paragraph 9 of new schedule 2A to the 1998 Act,
inserted by schedule 11. I hope that the hon. Gentleman appreciates
that clause 22 must be included in the Bill, regardless of the points
that he makes. He said that he was perplexed at why the Government
reached the view that they did. I can say that they are reconsidering
the matter and hope to bring forward proposals at a later stage to deal
with it.</div>
					<a name="07022754000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">As for being
perplexed, I am worried about the hon. Gentleman&#146;s comments on
Second Reading. I can explain to the Committee why the Government
thought carefully about the issue. It is finely balanced, and we
concluded that we should rethink matters and change the Bill. However,
the reasoning behind the original proposal was that there is a
potential conflict of interest. The same body is offering improvement,
support and inspection. It is effectively acting both as a critical
friend and external
regulator.</div>

						The comments
made on Second Reading and in Committee today resonate with us, and we
take them on board. The Audit Commission has a role to play. When the
commission was first given the powers, no other improvement
organisations existed, so the situation was slightly different and we
were content. We shall reflect on the concerns that have been
expressed, rethink, and introduce proposals later to the Committee or

KPMG or any other adviser or supporter? Will she explain why the Audit

							<a name="07022754000410"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> To be fair to the hon. Gentleman, I have the
assistance of my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary. The hon. Member for
Poole is without his hon. Friend the Member for North-East
Bedfordshire, who we understand is detained on other parliamentary
business. I say that for two reasons: first, because it is true, and
secondly, because I may need him to say it to me later. I shall explain
the change to the performance 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column411" />Column number: 412</div>regime, because there is inevitably some jargon in such matters. New
clause 4 teases out what has been talked about.</div>
					<a name="07022754000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">Formally, clause 125 will amend
the requirement in section 99 of the Local Government Act 2003 for the
Audit Commission to produce reports on its findings on local
authorities&#146; performance in exercising their functions. The
reports place the authorities into categories according to their
performance&#151;one star, two stars, three stars and four stars.
Hon. Members will be familiar with
that.</div>
					<a name="07022754000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The
forthcoming reform of the inspection of local services will mean a move
away from rolling programmes of inspection that result in performances
categories, which are currently known as comprehensive performance
assessments. In future, inspection will be carried out according to
risk. That will reduce the burden on better performing authorities and
focus resources where improvement is most needed. In other words,
inspections will not be carried out for their own sake; they will be
carried out on an assessment of risk&#151;something that I will go on
to explain when we discuss the potential consequences of proposed new
clause 4.</div>
					<a name="07022754000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The changes
to section 99 are being made because the current requirement for the
commission to undertake a categorisation report into the performance
league tables is too prescriptive and we wish to allow more
flexibility. If a regular inspection based on performance is not
carried out, it is nonsense to categorise every body as the Audit
Commission is currently required by law to do. Clause 125 gives the
Secretary of State a power of direction&#151;the hon. Member for
Poole was right to point that out, because it appears that the
Secretary of State is taking rather than giving away a power. The
Secretary of State is taking the power to enable rather than to
require&#151;an important distinction&#151;the Audit Commission to
undertake a categorisation report in circumstances where that is
desirable and useful. In other words, if a council has been identified
by the Audit Commission as not performing well, it is able to undertake
a categorisation report in certain circumstances.</div>
					<a name="07022754000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">The categorisation will include
the direction of travel, to use the jargon. The CPA reports from last
week say that one council&#146;s performance category has moved down,
but its direction of travel is up. In layperson&#146;s terms, a
couple of years ago, the council was doing badly but has since started
to improve. Two variables are in place, and the inclusion of direction
of travel is a useful tool for focusing management and motivating
staff.</div>
					<a name="07022754000265"></a><div class="hs_Para">There seems to
be no correlation between the electoral performance of the majority
party or the party in power and categorisation by stars. There is
evidence of a correlation in some cases, but I guess that that is down
to the whims of the electorate.</div>
					<a name="07022754000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">The proposed move to the
comprehensive area assessment, which is a change from performance to
risk assessment, and which draws on a wide range of evidence, means
that a blanket categorisation report will not be required. New clause
4, as the hon. Member for Poole said, proposes changes to section 99,
which currently obliges the Audit Commission to produce a report that
sets out its findings. The commission has to carry out a comprehensive
performance assessment to determine the categorisation of an authority.
As proposed, new clause 4 will prevent the changes to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column412" />Column number: 413</div>section 99 that I hope I have convinced the Committee are desirable. The
repeal of section 99 would remove the Audit Commission&#146;s
obligation to produce reports.</div>
					<a name="07022754000267"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The new
performance framework was set out in the local government White Paper.
I emphasise that it came about as a result of substantial consultation
that took place over two years; that it carries a cross-party consensus
within the Local Government Association; and that it carries the
support of the Audit Commission. The new framework, in line with the
rest of the Bill, seeks to strengthen accountability to residents and
communities by increasing choice that is informed by timely
information, and by providing a means of redress for when things go
wrong. The White Paper set out proposals for the introduction of the
comprehensive area assessment in place of the comprehensive performance
assessment. That means that in future, the area as well as the
institution will be judged from the point of view of the resident or
citizen. It is about the services&#151;the outcomes&#151;that are
received. &#147;Outcomes&#148; is another of those jargon words
that I hate, but it is common parlance so I am forced to use
it.</div>
					<a name="07022754000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">The impact on the
citizen is being judged as well as the impact on the institution, and
the assessment is of the service received by the citizen, rather than
the performance of the council. To judge the service received by the
citizen, one has to inspect the bodies and institutions that are
collectively delivering services, hence the comprehensive area
assessment, which we hope and intend will provide for an assessment of
an area. That will give the headline writers some copy, but that
provision is more in tune with the needs of the citizen and will
benefit them.</div>
					<a name="07022754000269"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
I should like to explain how the clause will enable the comprehensive
area assessment and why new clause 4&#151;a probing
amendment&#151;is not
required.</div>

							<a name="07022754000411"></a>Mr.
Syms:
						</b> May I push the Minister a little on how he would
define an area? Does he mean an area within a local authority? Is he
talking about dividing the local authority into different areas because
service delivery may be different in different parts of a local
authority, or does he mean beyond a local
authority?</div>
					
					<a name="07022754000271"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07022754000412"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> It means the local authority area. A local
authority area is not mentioned because it is not just the local
council that delivers the service. For example, it is about looking at
Poole as a whole and recognising that the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
constituents receive services from various sources commissioned or
directly provided by the local council. As we all acknowledge, the
citizen does not need to know, and does not much care about, the
structures behind the delivery of that
service.</div>
					<a name="07022754000272"></a><div class="hs_Para">The CAA
comprises four elements, including an assessment of the risks in an
area and how well those are being managed. For example, a consideration
may be whether there is a risk of the refuse service
collapsing.</div>
					
					<a name="07022754000273"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07022754000413"></a>Mr.
Burrowes:
						</b> In relation to the comprehensiveness of the CAA,
would it entail another tier of government, such as the Greater London
authority, which covers my constituency, Transport for London 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column413" />Column number: 414</div>and other bodies? From the point of view of the citizen, in respect of
outcomes, they see what happens on the North Circular road as an
outcome that needs to be provided, whether by the borough council or
Transport for
London.</div>
					
					<a name="07022754000274"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07022754000414"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> The CAA covers services provided by or for the
local authority. With regard to other bodies, the Audit Commission
covers the GLA. It could include such a judgment of an outcome in the
assessment of the GLA and the Mayor as well, but we intend it to do
exactly what the hon. Gentleman says and consider the area. The citizen
in his constituency does not really care who provides the maintenance
on the North Circular. As somebody who used to cycle round it, I think
it should be
inspected.</div>
					
					<a name="07022754000275"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07022754000415"></a>Mr.
Syms:
						</b> So in the case of Enfield there is an area
agreement, but there would, presumably, also be an assessment of the
GLA. The good burghers of Enfield would be able to see the area
assessment for their area, but they would only be able to assess the
GLA assessment on a London-wide basis and service delivery may be
different in Enfield from that in Bethnal Green and Bow. Would it be
appropriate, for an authority of the size of the GLA, to break down how
a service is delivered in each
borough?</div>
					
					<a name="07022754000276"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07022754000416"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman makes an important point, which
his new clause has brought to light, which shows that even if one does
not know what the intention of an amendment is, it can sometimes have
beneficial consequences in shedding light on proposed legislation. He
highlights a point that has been debated. The comprehensive area
assessment does not cover the GLA, as he said. The Audit Commission can
and will inspect the GLA separately, which then raises the point about
the functions of the GLA or its delivery bodies within the area that is
to be inspected. It is of course open to the commission to pass comment
on that. What it cannot do is judge the performance of the local
authority in respect of that area. It cannot hold the council
responsible for the things that it is not responsible for, but it can,
in its assessment, draw attention to the area and judge it as a whole.
That is how better joining-up will come about.</div>
					<a name="07022754000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">Citizens, and therefore the
inspectorate, do not care who is responsible for the services. They
just want the problems sorted out. What one could not do is hold the
council directly responsible for everything that goes on within the
area. The hon. Gentleman puts his finger, perhaps inadvertently but
with wisdom, on the very point of a comprehensive area
assessment.</div>
					<a name="07022754000278"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me
finish the four points, and I said that I would be brief. The
comprehensive area assessment is an assessment of the risk in an area
and how well that risk is being managed. We all know that councils can
have problems that they do not do anything about. That is significantly
worse than a council that has a problem that it is trying to address. A
judgment on the use of resources is crucial. Is it using its resources
properly in respect of the functions? Then there is the pace and the
likelihood of improvement followed by the report on performance against
national indicators for each local authority area.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column414" />Column number: 415</div>
					<a name="07022754000279"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Those four
judgments taken together will provide a simple assessment of
performance in an area. That means that a blanket categorisation report
is unlikely to add to the information about a locality, which is the
information that builds up the picture of the CAA. The new framework,
therefore, places greater emphasis on giving power to individual
residents and their communities to require the personalisation of
service delivery. That gives them more say in the running of local
services and the right to propose suggestions or require action from
their local authorities, notwithstanding the accountability assessment
regime we see in other aspects of the Bill. We have talked about the
best value duty in clause 106 and about overview and scrutiny. The
framework provides another piece of the jigsaw.</div>
					<a name="07022754000280"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Where the
provision of clear, consistent and transparent information will help
local people make an informed view of the quality of services, then
provision should be made for such information to be made available. The
new clause, which I urge the hon. Gentleman not to press, has brought
out the opportunity for me to explain the purposes of the comprehensive
area assessment and to explain to the Committee how the beautiful
tapestry of Government policy is coming together to provide a new
framework that will empower the people of this

E. Smith:
						</b> I want take the opportunity to say something
about the new clauses. It would be helpful to the Committee if I
explain that new clause 11 will have been in section 3 (6) of
the Audit Commission Act 1998. That Act requires all members
of the firm 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column415" />Column number: 416</div>appointed by the Audit Commission to carry out an audit to be members of
specified accountancy bodies such as the Chartered Institute of Public
Finance and Accountancy, which means they have to be qualified
accountants. In reality, this provision is now out of date, as most
firms are now multi-disciplinary partnerships and it would be difficult
for every single member of that body to be a qualified accountant. This
does not mean that unqualified staff will be able to undertake audits.
The new clause retains the requirement in section 3(6) for membership
of the specified accountancy bodies, but this will apply only to the
person who is conducting the audit rather than all the employees of a
firm, which makes common sense.</div>

E. Smith:
						</b> As a former sixth-form student and not a
certified accountant, I sought enlightenment on this and I can assure
the hon. Gentleman that, having received such enlightenment, it does.
The point is that they are fully qualified accountants.</div>
					<a name="07022754000295"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause 12 amends section 15
of the Audit Commission Act 1998, which allows any interested person to
inspect the accounts to be audited, plus all documents relating to
them, such as bills, receipts, contracts and vouchers. We are concerned
about the release of personal details of people who have had dealings
with the council in a personal capacity, where they may have paid for a
service or may have received benefits. These persons will have their
personal details, such as names and addresses, the type of benefit and
the nature of services received, on documents that are held by the
council, which may then be available for inspection by other members of
the public. This is not appropriate and the new clause provides that
personal information that could identify an individual must be removed
from documents prior to inspection by the public. A similar provision
already exists for members of staff and we are merely extending that to
every individual. There are some circumstances in which it may be
desirable to disclose personal information, which may be used to ensure
transparency&#151;for example, relating to a contract or to a
council&#146;s expenses. Therefore, it is for the auditor to have the
discretion to decide whether that information should be
disclosed.</div>
					<a name="07022754000296"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause
13 amends section 29 of the Audit Commission Act. Section 29 allows the
Audit Commission to do the audit of accounts of bodies connected with
local government or the NHS if such a body requests the commission to
do so, and if the Secretary of State gives consent. However, the way
this section is drafted does not reflect good practice. In practice,
although the commission undertakes audits, in the majority of cases it
appoints auditors to undertake audits on its behalf. The new clause
provides that the commission may appoint an auditor to undertake audits
under section 29.</div>

						</b> I would be grateful if the Minister would take the

an age of devolution but we still deal with the primary part of

Woolas:
						</b> I am grateful to have the opportunity to
speak about clause 129, on the disclosure of information
obtained by the Audit Commission or by an auditor. It repeals section
49A and amends section 49 of the Audit Commission Act 1998, which
restricts the disclosure of information obtained by an auditor of the
Audit Commission in the exercise of functions under the 1998 Act or
under part 1 of the Local Government Act
1999.</div>
					<a name="07022754000304"></a><div class="hs_Para">The provision
allows for a public authority or person acting on its behalf, as
defined by the Freedom of Information Act 2000, to disclose information
except when disclosure would prejudice the effective performance of any
function of that authority. It also provides for an auditor to disclose
information except when disclosure would prejudice the effective
performance of his functions. It further provides for any other person
to disclose information with the consent of the Audit Commission or an
auditor. The commission and the auditor are obliged to give that
consent unless disclosure would prejudice the effective performance of
the functions of an auditor of the commission. I hope that that is as
clear to the Committee as it is to the Audit Commission.</div>
					<a name="07022754000305"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause removes the sanction
of imprisonment for unlawful disclosure from the current provision. As
the Committee will recall, clause 129 is in keeping with a previous
commitment given to the House during the passage through the House of
the Public Audit (Wales) Act 2004. Once again, the Government have
fulfilled their promises to Parliament, though we were not prompted to
do so by the hon. Member for Poole. I hope that I have answered
him.</div>
