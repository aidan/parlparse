<P>
Question proposed, That this schedule, as amended, be the Eighth schedule to the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bernard Jenkin </B>(North Essex): Would the Minister please use this opportunity to explain anything relevant that arises from the heads of terms of the National Air Traffic Services and Ministry of Defence contract, which has been circulated to Committee members?
<P>
<B>The Minister for Housing and Planning (Mr. Nick Raynsford):</B> With your agreement, Mr. Gale, I will take this opportunity to raise a matter on which we touched earlier, when it was suggested that it might be covered under clause 81. As passages in the schedule deal with hostilities and other events to which the agreement between the MOD and NATS might be relevant, I will make a brief statement to help the Committee.
<P>
NATS and the MOD have long provided aspects of the United Kingdom's air traffic on a joint and integrated basis. In addition, they provide a number of services to each other. These services have been provided under a variety of arrangements of greater or lesser degrees of formality. The MOD and NATS recognise the mutual benefit of their long-standing operational relationship. While requirements might differ, they share a common interest in ensuring that all air navigation services are delivered as cost effectively as possible. As part of the establishment of the public-private partnership, those arrangements have been formalised and incorporated into a contract, which will provide the benefit of clarity to both parties. The first stage in that process was the signature of the heads of terms on 19 January by NATS and the Secretary of State for Defence.
<P>
The heads of terms, which have been circulated to all Committee members, is a non-legally binding document that provides the agreed basis from which the full contract between NATS and the MOD will be developed, using agreed partnering principles and with the intention of promoting and maintaining an enduring relationship.
<P>
It is expected that all significant services between the parties will be dealt with under the single contract. The scope of individual services will be capable of change. The contract will allow for new services to be introduced and existing services to be terminated. 
<P>
The term of the contract will be 15 years. There will be provision to extend it, if both parties agree. The contract will modernise the relationship between the two bodies on pricing, planning, risk allocation and performance criteria.
<P>
On the pricing methodology for the services provided by NATS, MOD and NATS will first develop a shared understanding of the NATS cost base and then apply agreed allocation principles. The price payable for those services will be based on an agreed, firm annual amount, which is reconciled against real cost data at the end of each year. A mechanism will be included to provide NATS with an incentive to manage costs efficiently, consistent with its contractual obligations and the need to maintain safe operation. As Committee members will appreciate, that is exactly analogous to the arrangements that we will have in place for other areas in which charging applies.
<P>
As for the methodology for the services provided by the MOD, the Ministry will comply with Treasury guidance on selling services and will reciprocate NATS' open book approach.
<P>
The contract will provide for a regular planning dialogue between the two parties and will include a detailed change-control process. That process will deal with changes to services throughout the contract duration and any corresponding effect on pricing. In particular, a number of detailed rules will deal with the price impact of capital investments made by NATS, where those are used to provide services in part to the MOD.
<P>
The contract will also deal with risk allocation. It may in exceptional circumstances allow a risk premium to be included in the price to reflect NATS' acceptance of the risk, or instead it may provide an acceptance by the MOD that it will bear the risk, or the risk may be shared by both the parties should it materialise. Those judgments will be made on value-for-money grounds.
<P>
The contract will contain key performance indicators for the various services, which will be objectively defined, readily measurable criteria.
<P>
The contract will provide for early termination of the services-either in whole or in part-by reason of a party's severe default or the continuation of a force majeure event for a specified period. The MOD will also have the right to terminate the contract should NATS lose its licence. In addition, the MOD's standard purchase conditions usually allow it a right of unilateral termination, but the parties are still considering whether it is appropriate for such a term to be included in the contract. It will provide for compensation to be paid on early termination in certain circumstances.
<P>
In line with its partnership approach, the contract will provide alternative dispute resolution procedures to ensure that the process is efficient and cost effective. One of those procedures will be a fast-track procedure, principally for payment disputes on operational matters that arise from the performance monitoring regime. Detailed contract negotiations are in progress under all those headings and the contract is expected to be signed by 31 March. The effective date of the contract is intended to be 1 April.
<P>
I hope that that is helpful and that the schedule may stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The draft heads of terms contract suggests that the relationship is essentially commercial-it is about apportioning costs and risks and allocating money. Even planning relates to the commercial relationship rather than the planning of airspace. Should the arrangement not include an agreement that the military should have the airspace that it needs? Is that not a necessary part of the agreement between NATS and the MOD?
<P>
Will the Minister assure us that the Secretary of State for Defence and, indeed, the Government may still demand the airspace that they need, not for a particular situation but for on-going training and so forth? That is an important part of the understanding between the MOD and the civil aviation regulatory framework.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The hon. Gentleman is right to say that the heads of terms is predominantly concerned with the commercial arrangements between the two bodies-it is about their providing services to each other and doing so on a basis that is properly planned to reflect the costs incurred by the parties. NATS would certainly not be responsible for determining how much airspace would be available for military purposes. That is the proper responsibility of the Director of Airspace Policy, rather than NATS.
<P>
Both NATS and the MOD will have individual responsibilities for the provision of air traffic control services. NATS' responsibilities are set out in the Bill and will be in the licence, while the MOD's responsibilities will be set out in a memorandum of understanding between it and the Civil Aviation Authority. NATS and the MOD will also have a joint responsibility for the provision of the joint and integrated service.
<P>
The contract will regulate the provision by the MOD to NATS and vice versa of the services that each require and that are best dealt with in an integrated way. That is the purpose, as well as to ensure that charges can properly be levied. It is not intended that it should determine the policy on the availability of airspace for military or other purposes. I hope that that deals with the question.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for his reply. We may have missed the opportunity to discuss the allocation of military airspace, which may well have to be dealt with in another place.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Schedule 8, as amended, agreed to.
<P>
Clauses 84 to 88 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
