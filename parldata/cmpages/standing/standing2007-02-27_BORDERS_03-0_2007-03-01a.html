								Gordon
McLardy:
							</b>
						</i> Currently, the section 8 defence is not
complicated, but can be perceived as complicated. It is very
time-consuming for employers to check through the relevant
documentation. At NCP we do 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column72" />Column number: 72</div>employ quite a lot of migrant workers, with quite high turnover in
certain areas of the business, and we find a varied amount of either
fraudulent documentation, which is absolutely spot-on and really good
quality, or very poor quality documentation, where someone may have cut
out the picture and stuck a different picture on. You do get a variety
of documentation, which makes it difficult for employers.</div>
					<a name="07030161000017"></a><div class="hs_Para">We do a number of TUPE
transfers for new employees. Of course, when you do that you are
relying on the previous employers to have done the thorough checks, and
in our experience that is not alwaysthe case&#151;so much
so, that in the illegal migrant community that we come across now and
again, we sometimes find the sharing of identification, where some
unfortunate individuals might find that with that identity comes
previous convictions, which they were not aware of. We face a variety
of issues. Some are easy to overcome; some are not, so much so that on
occasion it can be easier&#151;although we do not do that&#151;not
to employ someone from another country. It is much less easy to check
on someone from outside the EEA. It can be quite fraught with a number
of
pitfalls.</div>

basis of the biometrics documents proposed, because it would be far
easier for any employer to do that very simple check. Obviously there
are issues around whether that can be enforced or not, but again that
is probably for the experts to iron out. But, in principle, that would
be a dream for any
employer.</div>

							<b class="B">Damian
Green</b> (Ashford) (Con): Your witness submission is
fascinating in getting to grips with the scale of the problem that the
Bill is meant to address. You say that you employ 6,000 staff, about
half of whom are foreign nationals. As a broad guess, how many of those
3,000 foreign nationals are illegals, who should not be working
here?</div>
					<a name="07030161000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<i class="I">
							<b class="B">
								Gordon
McLardy:
							</b>
						</i> As opposed to giving you a guess, I can tell
you what we did in 2005. We had a turnover of about 3,300 staff; of
those staff, just over 6 per cent. warranted further investigation; of
that 6 per cent., something like 3 per cent. were illegal workers. So
you are talking in the region of about 100 staff out of
6,000.</div>

others, is that broadly typical? As you say, you are presumably one of
the biggest
employers&#151;</div>

						<i class="I">
							<b class="B">
								Gordon
McLardy:
							</b>
						</i> That is typical of the ones where you get to
the point of checking documentation. We also do pre-employment checks.
We do employment drives and we turn up and check documentation there.
Those figures do not take into account the fact thaton some
recruitment drives 60 per cent. of the staff disappeared once we
started looking at documentation carefully. Depending of course on the
sector and work you are in, there is a high proportion out there with
illegal documentation.</div>

						</b> May I ask you to expand on one of the things that
you said, when you noted that there is no provision in the Bill for the
Government to require businesses to make identity checks on foreign
nationals who are using a biometric document? Do you see that as a big
weakness?</div>
					<a name="07030161000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<i class="I">
							<b class="B">
								Gordon
McLardy:
							</b>
						</i> I think so. If you are going toput
biometric documentation in place, it should be mandatory. Currently,
all our staff at NCP have internal ID cards. The documentation checks,
whether they are for a migrant worker or someone indigenous to the UK,
are exactly the same. People hold the documentation; they expect to
hold the ID card; they expect to have the checks. For us, unless you
make it mandatory, we would be failing in our duties to reduce the
documentation. You then have different levels of check
again.</div>

seems sound, but it is about whether we have the technology and the

						</i> Absolutely. Everything is possible, of
course, but I am sure that within the designingof the
biometrics these things will be looked at and designed out. Even if
they are not, you are still reducing the opportunities for illegal
workers. Even if you cannot completely eradicate forgeries, you are
still reducing the opportunities for them to come to the

Mole</b> (Ipswich) (Lab): Are there particular issues for your
industry on the different entitlements to work for people in the

that?</div>

goes back to the biometric documentation. From that you will get a
right to work or not, or a limited right to work and so on. The easier
it is, theless documentation to check&#151;at the moment
thereare additional checks that we have to do, and any

								Gordon

partnership between Government and employers. If we can get the borders
and the checks right and limit 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column74" />Column number: 74</div>
						and streamline migrants coming into the country, and
if everything possible has been done to do that, it is down to the
employers to play their part. We all have a part to play and my advice
to any employer is, &#147;You have that part to play.&#148; Forget
illegal workers&#151;it could be someone who has joined to steal or
whatever. The onus is still on the business to reduce the
opportunities. It must sit squarely with
businesses.</div>

						</i> When I wrote that documentation I had not
actually sat down with the chaps and looked at where they are moving
the trial to. The check in Sheffield will be used initially, I
understand, just to check someone who has submitted documentation and
is in the system somewhere. It is just to clarify whether that person
is legit. These are legal workers, or tendto be legal,
otherwise they would not be doing the checks&#151;illegal workers
would not even bother to go through that way. Of course, it is
initially about ensuring that you expand the opportunities for
employers to use that service and expand the service provided.
Initially it should not be a big problem but, if we move to increase
the checks available, there could be quite an overload. That could open
up opportunities, perhaps for private bureaux around the country to
offer that service to employers, which would be
welcome.</div>

						</i> Provided that we have the front end right
and the Government have done everything that they can to get the
documentation and checks right; provided that all those things are
right andthe tools are there for employers, a &#163;2,000
fine for a multi-billion-turnover business is nothing. It is not
effective. You have to pro rata it against the size of the business for
a fine to mean something. A fine of &#163;2,000 would mean something
to me, but to other employers it might not. The fine has to fit the
size of the business; otherwise, the larger operations can turn a blind
eye to it. The odd &#163;20,000 fine would be neither here nor there.
It is important that the fine fits the
crime.</div>

with the police is again largely down to education. I am not sure that
they have a great understanding of immigration issues. They might be
busy, depending on the force at the time and so on. So there is a need
for greater awareness in the police and certainly for greater resources
among enforcement officers. I believe that there is also a need for
account managers, or whatever you call them, within the enforcement
service in order to get closer to the industry, and different aspects
of it, so that you have someone who understands the industry and can
support it in cutting through some of the red tape. That would

&#163;4,000, &#163;5,000, &#163;6,000&#151;something like that.
There is also the time invested in staff so that they can understand
what is a genuine document and what is not. Time must be put into it,

clear business case for doing that. It will reduce turnover and we see

						</b> Throughout the Bill, there are measures to
strengthen the powers of the immigration service and its partners to
tackle the kind of exploitation of migrant workers that we often hear
about. To begin these questions, I would be interested in your
perspective on the extent of exploitation of migrant workers in this
country. Are there sufficient sanctions and powers to tackle that
exploitation
today?</div>

								Jack
Dromey:
							</b>
						</i> I think that there is an acute and growing
problem. It varies from region to region and sector to sector. It might
be helpful to give examples. I have three very good, or rather very
bad, examples.</div>
					<a name="07030161000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
first example is in the rural economy. It is welcome that the
Government, with all-party support, brought in the Gangmasters
(Licensing) Act 2004 and established the Gangmasters Licensing
Authority, but it was in the rural economy that we saw an outrageous
example of the worst kind of exploitation. What happened at Morecambe
bay was an awful symbol of that. It will take time to work that process
through; the next stage is effective enforcement of the Act. There is
no doubt, however, that right now there is a ramp-up in particular
areas of the country, because of the seasonal nature of production and
demand. There are still rogue gangmasters operating, who pay workers
below the national minimum wage and even then charge them for housing
and transport. Those workers work in unsafe
conditions.</div>
					<a name="07030161000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The
second example, which is a serious and growing problem in the food
industry more generally, is the growth of a two-tier labour market. The
numberof directly employed workers, who have better employment
conditions, is falling. They are still in the majority, although only
just in some factories, but the number of agency workers, who are
overwhelmingly migrants and the newly arrived, with poorer employment
conditions, is growing. That is bad news. It sees the exploitation of
the newly arrived and the undercutting of workers here for generations,
and it creates division that we have to contend with the whole time and
damages social cohesion. Therefore, equal treatment of all workers in
those circumstances is
crucial.</div>
					<a name="07030161000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">The third and
final example, here in London, is of building and cleaning. The work
force in Londonis overwhelmingly&#151;certainly in the
inner-London boroughs&#151;in building and cleaning. One could give
many examples, but just one from last year would suffice. It was a
company called Blue Diamond that had exploited the notion that
Bulgarians could come here who were self-employed in order to bring
hundreds of Bulgarian cleaners from remote villages to London. It paid
them the national minimum wage, but they then had to buy their own
safety equipment&#151;they had no safety training. Incidentally, I am
pleased to say that to the credit of the infrastructure company, that
contract was terminated.</div>
					<a name="07030161000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">The problem varies depending
upon industry and locality, but if one could summarise, it is bad news
for migrant workers who have arrived&#151;and our country and economy
need migration&#151;but it is also bad news for those who have been
here for generations. Both are threatened by a failure to
act.</div>

							<a name="07030161000273"></a>Mr.
Byrne:
						</b> There are a number of measures in the Bill that
make it easier for the immigration service to pin down and identify
businesses that may be breaking the rules. For example, there are
provisions to allow the immigration service to access Her
Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs data. We have already heard
evidence suggesting that where businesses are employing people
illegally, they are also breaking every other rule in the book. They
are not paying the national minimum wage or operating healthy and safe
conditions, and they are often not paying their taxes either. I am
interested to know whether that is your experience? Are businesses that
you see as exploitative also breaking other rules? Is there a case for
stronger sanctions against those businesses, whether they take the form
of seizure of property or cash, in order to deter that sort of
exploitative and abusive
relationship?</div>

						</i> We certainly find that that is the case. You
are right&#151;a bad employer is a bad employer. They are not
suddenly good at doing other things. In particular we focus on, as Jack
has, the minimum wage deductions, working time abuses and things like
that. We welcome the steps that the Government are already taking on
enforcement of the national minimum wage. It seems to us that it would
be worth a little bit of what I think you are outlining: the Al Capone
strategy of using other means to tackle generally bad behaviour. There
are other measures we would want to see in relation to temporary agency
working. Jack has mentioned self-employment and tightening up on what
constitutes self-employment and how you determine that. That would also
be useful, and I think that sort of joined-up approach would be quite
welcome.</div>

							<b class="B">
								Jack
Dromey:
							</b>
						</i> To be frank, we are very uneasy about the
emphasis of the approach. You tackle bad employers&#151;that is for
certain&#151;but let us have our eyes wide open to the consequences
of what is already happening and what is going to happen all the more
as a consequence of the obligation that you are placing on employers
through clause 23 in particular. We are running across more and more
examples of workers, who are normally racially profiled within
particular categories&#151;for example, in building and
cleaning&#151;who are being asked in at short notice to prove who
they are and whether or not they are here legally. The impact of that
is very significant on the workers concerned. It is, incidentally,
chilling as the majority are here legally.</div>
					<a name="07030161000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">The impact is also going to be
to force more and more workers out of employment into the worst areas
of the black economy characterised by super-exploitation. For example,
there are already 340,000 undocumented workers in London, according to
the Mayor. The problems associated with that number growing are very
significant and we might come back to that later on. I can understand
the desire, which we share, to tackle bad employers. That is why the
Gangmasters (Licensing) Act 2004 was such good news. You have to have
your eyes wide open to the consequences of what will happen in
workplace after workplace as a result of clause
23.</div>

						</i> It is also important to recognise at what
point employers seek additional information to clarify immigration
status. They are happy to do it at the outset of employment and are
happy to accept documentation at that point. Despite subsequent
guidance from the Home Office that they should not pursue it beyond
that point, we find that when workers put forward issues to do with
health and safety or quality control&#151;for example, when working
on the underground&#151;only at that point, when they seek to enforce
or promote some type of employment right, are they suddenly asked to
produce evidence of their entitlement. That is the type of abuse that
workers face. We consider that the proposals will strengthen the hands
of employers in that context without any adverse consequences on
employers by way of sanctions, in as much as the proposals provide for
sanctions. For example, there is no commensurate sanction to the
seizure of wages on the employer. That is a serious imbalance in the
proposal that needs to be looked at.</div>

trafficking and human smuggling. That is an area on which the TUC and
the Transport and General Workers Union have commented in the past. We
have heard that up to three quarters of illegal entrants into Britain
are in the hands of organised crime. The Bill proposes tougher
sanctions and stronger measures to track down those traffickers,
wherever on the planet they perpetrate that crime. I would be
interested in your perceptions and impressions about whether the law
needs to be tougher on trafficking and smuggling.</div>

								Owen
Tudor:

						</i> I think it does. Sean and I gave evidence to
the inquiry of the Joint Committee on Human Rights into trafficking,
which produced an excellent report a few months ago. Trafficking is
obviously an abhorrent crime and tough penalties are needed to deal
with it. Our concerns are often more about what we do with the victims
of crime, because our experiencewith
trafficking&#151;limited though it is, because we tend to deal with
the more organised sections of the economy&#151;is that one of the
key problems is identifying it and managing to find out who the
culprits are. Often, our concern about trafficking penalties is that
you need to ensure that the penalties will encourage the people who
have been trafficked to come forward to the authorities to give
evidence. Sadly, our experience is often that precisely the opposite
happens. The trafficked are unwilling to come forward because of their
fears about what will happen to them. This probably goes for all forms
of undocumented 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column83" />Column number: 83</div>
						work: we need to find penalties that penalise the
criminals rather than the victims. All too often,the
undocumented worker or trafficked person is the victim and
feels&#151;and sometimes is&#151;penalised.</div>

								Jack
Dromey:

						</i> We have had examples of exactly
that&#151;workers who have been trafficked into this country and are
members, who have escaped the clutches of the traffickers, but are
terrified to speak out. That is partly because they sometimes fear the
traffickers, who operate in their countries of origin and could, they
fear, threaten their families and communities, for example, but it is
also because of the consequences for those workers personally. That
goes to the very heart of what you do about workers of that kind and
how you bring them out of the twilight world that they are in. The main
thrust of the Bill&#151;and of public policy generally&#151;of
going after the traffickers is welcome and should be strongly
supported. These people are barbarians. The impact of their actions is
grotesque. To talk to their victims is, believe you me, to hear the
most harrowing stories, so the Government are right.</div>

								Omer
Ahmed:
							</b>
						</i> While we are looking at trafficking, and the
need to move away from the idea that those being trafficked are
beneficiaries and towards recognising that they are victims&#151;as
has just been mentioned&#151;it is also important to look at the
economic issues. Trafficking is not happening in an economic vacuum; it
is happening because there is demand. We need to look at what we are
doing to dampen down that demand, and in fact to eradicate it.
Something for which we have been strongly pushing for some
time&#151;and which we would very strongly ask the Committee to look
at&#151;is the consideration of the 500,000 or so legacy asylum
cases, involving people who are unable to take up employment or are
prevented from doing so, and who are effectively destitute. Bringing
those people into the employment market would, arguably, significantly
reduce the demand at a stroke. That needs to be looked at, because we
cannot say that we are operating in a free market economy but at the
same time ignore the demand side pressures that cause trafficking to
flourish. The traffickers will argue, &#147;We are providing a
commercial service.&#148; Abhorrent as it appears to all of us, that
is the basis of trafficking, so we must do whatever we can to dampen
down the demand
side.</div>

						</i> Fundamentally, yes. At its most absurd, there
is the svelte voice of reaction, Sir Andrew Green, who I understand did
not turn up to see you earlier this week. He said to me last year on
the &#147;Today&#148; programme that all you had to do was clamp
down on the employers and these workers would drift away. I am not
quite sure whether the notion was that they would drift away on the
boats in which some of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column84" />Column number: 84</div>them had come to our country. The simple reality is this: of course you
need to sort out the immigration and nationality system. It is right
that there should be the integrity and physical safety of our borders,
and it is right that there should be clear laws relating to fair,
managed migration. Of course it is right that you should be tough on
those who abuse our hospitality and commit serious crimes. We should
never deport somebody to their death, but as far as I am concerned, if
somebody commits murder or rape, they should be deported.</div>
					<a name="07030161000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">But what do you do about the
residual army of good men and women, many of whom have been here for
many years? I know hundreds and hundreds of them personally, because we
have thousands of members in that category. The Bill will potentially
add to the problem. I could give you example after example of people
who are pillars of the economy, pillars of the community and pillars of
their local churches, and who have put down roots, brought up kids,
sent them to school, got married and, often, bought homes. They live in
this awful twilight world. So we must sort the system out&#151;I
absolutely accept that. However, sooner or later politicians of all
parties, including the Conservative party, must end this myth that
somehow you can hunt down an army of half a million people&#151;and
growing&#151;and deport them. It is impractical, and to be frank it
is also immoral.</div>

employers about it. I remember speaking at a seminar last year. It was
a Chatham House rules event, however the chief executive of one of the
two biggest agencies in Britain made a very interesting contribution.
He said that he had real problems because no one quite knows who has
the right to work and who does not, and that employees of his agency
had been arrested as a consequence. That was a company that genuinely
wanted to operate regularly.</div>

recently met Ministers to express that anxiety. I am all in favour of
going after bad employers, but because of the way that the Bill is
constructed, we are concerned about the consequences and that the Bill
might be abused in the way that we indicated in the example about the
200 cleaners. They suddenly stood up for their rights, with a
satisfactory outcome, and they are all being told&#151;each one

<div class="Column"><a name="Column88" />Column number: 88</div>immigrant&#148;&#151;we are often talking about people who entered
the country entirely legally. The Bulgarians and Romanians are an
excellent case in point. Their presence in the country is entirely
legal because they are citizens of the European Union and are allowed
to be here. They may not be allowed to work here though, depending on
which sector they are in. That might become a little complex because
industrial reality sometimes does not fit simple industrial
classifications. </div>
					<a name="07030161000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">You
also have large numbers of people who are undocumented workers for part

Many people slip in and out of having the right documents because it
may be a matter of whether their work permit has expired, and so on. It
is very complex in that sense. An indication of who someone is and

						</b> Some of my questions may have been answered, so I
am just trying to gather my thoughts. I will start with the 200
cleaners whom you mentioned, Mr. Tudor. Before you arrived,
we listened to a guy from the NCP, who seemed to feel that the one
document&#151;the biometric immigration document&#151;would help
him to work out who is here legally and who illegally, and therefore
who can work legally. He felt that that would help, because there are
currently up to 60 documents that people can present. I take your point
that whether you are here legally is different from whether you can
work here legally, but surely the first step toward clarity in that
whole process is to find out who someone is. The guy from the NCP
talked about working with all the other agencies, when we know who
people are, to establish whether those people can work here legally. Do
you not see that the biometric immigration document would help in that
regard?</div>

Tudor:

						</i> I understand that point, but my understanding
of the steps that NCP currently takes to deal with potential
recruits&#151;I have heard its presentation in other
settings&#151;is that its concern, to be blunt, and I do not
criticise it for this, is more to make sure that its system is
absolutely watertight in terms of the law. Its system is directed not
at ensuring that it gives employment to people who would be good
employees, but at ensuring that it has fulfilled the requirements of
the law in making sure that it employs no one whom it should
not.</div>

						</i> It is good for the company, if the approach is
merely that it wants to ensure that it is not liable for having done
something wrong. We generally prefer employers to be operating in the
spirit of employment law, rather than just ensuring that they cannot be
criticised. I entirely understand their approach, because if I was in
their position, I would not want to be doing something that would land
me in court. It is not about whether they have a good work force or
whether the workers are treated right or not; it is just about making
sure that they fulfil the legal requirements. I am willing to accept
that biometric data will make it easier to fulfil the legal
requirements for which the Bill provides, but that does not answer the
question about whether this is a good thing or not.</div>

						</i> May I just add something to that? A biometric
card presented to an employer is only evidence that that person has
given a biometric card. It may contain information about what they are
entitled to and what they are not entitled to, but we still face a
problem. Employers are currently taking documents that, for want of a
better word, they clearly know do not belong to the person, and they
are happy to use them. There is no indication that the Bill will change
that.</div>
					<a name="07030161000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">Where someone
turns up with somebody else&#146;s biometric card, which says that X,
Y or Z has theright to employment, the employer uses that, and
enforcement measures are subsequently taken by the immigration service,
whereby it is determined that the card does not match up with the
person, the effect would still be almost entirely on the worker. There
are no balanced sanctions in respect of the employee. The proposals
would not make a huge difference to the way that the labour market
currently operates and would not put an end to the abuses.</div>
					<a name="07030161000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is also important to examine
the group of people to which the biometric data relate. They relate to
people from beyond the European Union. From our own experience, we know
that the majority of these people will be people from ethnic
minorities&#151;from Africa and Asia. A range of issues to do with
race, equality and discriminatory practices need to be addressed. Real
dangers may arise as a result of some of the powers that are suggested
in the Bill.</div>
					<a name="07030161000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">Equally,
the proposals do not set out the cost of obtaining such biometric data.
Where are we going with this? Are we saying that we now wish to create
a specific financial barrier to entry to the UK? I am now thinking of
some of the figures that were provided to the general public on the
costs of identity cards. Let us consider what it might cost somebody
travelling to the EU from Asia or Africa. We are seriously talking
about a new set of discriminatory barriers, because thiswill
effectively mean that people seeking to enterthe UK from
Africa and Asia will have to pay a disproportionately higher amount
than would normally be the case for those from more prosperous states.
That must be
considered.</div>

security issues, but we do not need to go into those at this stage. The
current situation is that people are presenting passports containing
somebody else&#146;s photograph to employers, who are accepting them.
There is nothing preventing the same process from being adopted with
biometric cards. In which case, the entitlement of a person to work
will only ever be raised at the enforcement stage, or at the stage at
which, as we have been hearing with respect to the cleaners, that
person seeks to assert a basic right of employment or a basic
worker&#146;s right in respect of health and safety, for example. At
that point, it may well turn out that, suddenly, the employer
recognises that the photo on the biometric card is not

understand the need to assist NCP in doing what it does more cheaply,
because it is doing good things and they ought to be assisted, but our
concern is that the problem of undocumented work and employers
employing people who are undocumented is not, generally speaking, about
good employers that are somehow fooled and unfortunate enough to end up
employing an undocumented worker. That is not our experience of
trafficking, for instance, and it is not generally our
experience.</div>
					<a name="07030161000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our
experience is that some people set out to employ undocumented workers
because it is cheaper than employing someone who is going to be able to
enforce their rights, and so on. Therefore, making it simpler for good
employers to do their job of checking who is available will not do much
to deal with the problem of those employers that decide that they are
going to ride a coach and horses through the situation in the first
place.</div>
					<a name="07030161000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is a
bizarre story, but I honestly swear it is true: we have come across
Portuguese workers in the east midlands, who have a perfect right to
work in this country with no restriction whatever, who are buying
forged Brazilian passports so they can demonstrate they are
undocumented workers. That is because certain groups of employers in
the east midlands specifically target employing undocumented workers,
but would not take them if they were Portuguese, because then they
would have rights. That is the sort of problem we are encountering and

are not trying to say that the law should not be changed and migration
should not be managed, but there has to be a reasoned view about the

question as well as a legal one. Is it physically possible to remove
all the people we are talking

						</i> It is absolutely right that we should raise
legitimate concerns such as those&#151;about the impact that the
legislation might have, the impact that existing legislation is having,
the problems that we have to contend with in the world of work and the
problem of the army of undocumented workers that will ultimately have
to be resolved. However, we do not want to send a message that because
we have raised those legitimate concerns we are opposed to everything
in the Bill. We are
not.</div>
					<a name="07030161000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is an
important public policy debate to be had on how to sort out the mess
that is the immigration and nationality system, how to have clarity on
who has the right to work and who does not, and how to clamp down on
bad employers. We do not disagree with the objectives of public policy
that lie behind the Bill; the question is how to construct legislation
that works.</div>

T.C. Davies</b> (Monmouth) (Con): You said earlier that there
are hundreds of thousands of people who work in low-paid jobs in
London. I think we all accept that, even if the figures are hard to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column93" />Column number: 93</div>understand. The jobs are mostly in the service industry&#151;cleaners,
people working in restaurants and shops, and domestic
servants.</div>
					<a name="07030161000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
principle behind the Bill is that it will be harder to come to this
country and work illegally. If that succeeds, which is a slightly
separate question from the general principle that we are discussing,
one of two things will happen. Either people will have to pay more for
those services&#151;they will have to pay more money to the
shopkeepers, waitresses, waiters and so on&#151;or people might start
to move out of London to obtain those services in a place where they
are more affordable. Is that not quite a good thing from the point of
view of those who are in low-paid jobs? Their wages are bound to rise
if the Bill
succeeds.</div>

however, if the Government are successful in reducing the number of
illegal workers who enter the country, the wages of low-paid workers
will rise, will they not? That is supply and

situations in the informal economy or the trafficked economy, then yes.
It is not necessarily a matter of rising wages&#151;there will be
less exploitation. It might simply be that the people who profit from
low wages will have to profit slightly
less.</div>

						</i> I repeat what I said to Kerry McCarthy. We
need to sort out the immigration and nationality system, and we need
clarity on who can 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column94" />Column number: 94</div>come and work. It is legitimate to safeguard the integrity of borders
and to have proper, managed migration. The debate can sometimes be
polarised, but we do not differ from some of the fundamentals of the
Government&#146;s approach on those principles.</div>
					<a name="07030161000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall not pick at everything
that has been said, but we have three concerns. First, we have to have
our eyes open to the consequences and think through what they mean for
the legislation that can be framed and how it can be implemented.
Secondly, we ultimately have to tackle what politicians of all parties
have been reluctant to tackle: what to do about people who have been in
the country for years and how to sort that situation out. Our view is
that sensible regularisation measures should be used. Thirdly, on your
point about exploitation, David, we need to address other things that
should be done to end it. There will not be equal treatment tomorrow of
agency workers and of the directly employed, although, funnily enough,
there is a Bill on equal treatment coming up tomorrow. If Parliament
supports it, dramatic progress will be made. I hope that you
do&#151;the Bill is
admirable.</div>

hope, all of us are concerned to protect the interests of the newly
arrived and of workers who have been in the country for generations,
let us also&#151;at the next stage&#151;tackle things that are not
in the Bill. I hope that they will be covered
tomorrow.</div>

for us to be warned to be aware of the hundreds of thousands of people
