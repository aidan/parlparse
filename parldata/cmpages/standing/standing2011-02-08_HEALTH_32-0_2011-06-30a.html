                  </strong> Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. The
termination time for the groups of amendments and clauses under
discussion today is 6 o’clock. I shall be minded to suspend the
Committee for about 20 minutes at 4 o’clock, unless
it becomes apparent by then that we are within 15 or 20 minutes of
completing the whole sitting, in which case we will sit right through.
However, I do not believe that it is right to ask the staff to sit for
more than three hours without a break. I hope that that will be
acceptable.<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000022">&#160;</a>

                  </span> Before
lunch, I was speaking to new clause 2 and amendment 227. I have
finished the main points that I wanted to make. Some of my hon. Friends
may wish to say more, particularly on the Secretary of State’s
duty to reduce inequalities under clause 3, but in the interests of
brevity, I refer whomever might be reading the report of this debate to
the comments that I made in previous debates on
equalities.<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000031">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Having
prayed in aid the previous debates, I have some additional points to
make. There is without doubt huge concern about the Secretary of
State’s duty in relation to the health service—indeed, it
is one of the focuses of concern. I believe that hon. Members on both
sides of the Committee have been contacted by an organisation that has
been collecting a massive number 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 130<a class="bkMark" name="Column130">&#160;</a>
                  </div>of signatures—now more than 400,000—to a petition. The
first thing to which it refers, as I believe hon. Members know because
they have all received a number of e-mails about this, is the concern
about the ongoing duty of the Secretary of State in relation to the
health service. In summary, if a change needs to be made to the
original Act—the National Health Service Act 2006—in
relation to the Secretary of State’s duties, we need a clear
reason why, and that reason needs to be one that we can explain to the
400,000 or so people who have expressed concern through the online
petition.<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000032">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">This
cannot be brushed under the carpet. It is a matter of trust. It is
hugely important and has ramifications throughout the Bill. As I have
already said, we regret hugely the fact that we are unable to debate
the entire Bill in the light of the ongoing duty of the Secretary of
State, but I have made the point and I do not intend to labour it; nor
do I think that I would be able to improve it by simple repetition. On
amendment 227 and the duty to reduce inequalities, let us make the
measure clear and straightforward and simply give the Secretary of
State a duty to reduce inequalities. If the Bill does what the
Government say it will, that should not be a
problem.<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000033">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">On
new clause 2, I have raised the appointment of the board by the
Secretary of State, which is not within  the Nolan rules. I
want confirmation of whether there are any Government amendments
relating to the appointment of members of the boards of all the other
bodies listed in the new clause, and whether they will be appointed
under the Nolan rules. Obviously, if they are, the question arises of
why they are appointed under the Nolan rules and the national
commissioning board is not. Perhaps the Minister of State could explain
that to
us.<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000034">&#160;</a>

provided instead that the Secretary of State<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000042">&#160;</a>

concerns about the clause, voiced in the original Committee, were that
the Secretary of State sought to reduce the accountability of his role
in the delivery of health services. That was vigorously denied. The
recommendations of the NHS Future Forum are
clear:<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000044">&#160;</a>

               <p class="hs_brev">“The

               </p>
               <p>The
clause establishes an NHS commissioning board, the commissioning groups
as well as passes responsibilities to local authorities for public
health. The importance of the clause is the way in which the Secretary
of State’s responsibilities would change. He would lose his
current duty to provide or secure the provision of services for the
purpose of the health service. Instead, the new duty on the Secretary
of State is the simple promotion of the comprehensive health service,
which is an important and fundamental difference of approach.

                  </strong> I will in a moment. When Professor Field came
before the Health Committee in his capacity as one of the leaders of
the Future Forum, he was asked about its role and independence. He was
asked whether the Future Forum had taken representations from the trade
unions and the staff involved in the health service as legitimate
stakeholders in the exercise and whether they had raised with him their
concerns about the fragmentation of the service caused by
implementation of the proposals and the threats to national bargaining
on pay and conditions. He replied that no such representations had been
received, yet the written evidence that this Committee received on
Tuesday from the trade union representatives Professor Field consulted
states that they had made that very point. To my mind and that of many
other people, hat calls into question the reliability of Professor
Field’s evidence. I do not know if he is a reliable witness on
that basis. He said one thing to the Select Committee and something 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 135<a class="bkMark" name="Column135">&#160;</a>
                  </div>completely different to the Bill Committee, which was directly
contradicted by a stakeholder group with whom he had had dealings. That

point.<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000075">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> Anyway, it was referred to in this Committee as
a way of saying that the Secretary of State should be in tune with
problems and issues in the health service.<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000081">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I accept
that, under current arrangements, it is only possible for the Secretary
of State to do that. My hon. Friend the Member for Islington South and
Finsbury made an excellent point this morning about the Secretary of
State for Defence not being responsible for equipping individual
soldiers with items of kit—army boots were given as an
example—but is ultimately responsible for ensuring that the Army
is properly equipped and able to deal with the tasks that it faces.
Similarly, I am not suggesting that the Secretary of State should be
hands-on and micro-manage, as Government Members often say, every
single issue. I accept that he cannot do that because, at the moment,
those functions are exercised through structures such as the strategic
health authorities and primary care trusts, which will not exist under
the new arrangements. It is therefore all the more important that the
duty is conferred upon an accountable individual. Despite the
delegation under the current arrangements, it is quite clear that the
SHAs and the PCTs remain under the duty of care of the Secretary of
State, who—this is the key point—remains accountable to
Parliament for the provision of
services.<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000082">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Despite
the Secretary of State’s denials to the Committee, the
Opposition have been clear from the very start that the duties outlined
in the Bill would no longer be delegated and that direct responsibility
would be taken away from the Secretary of State through the modified
clause 1. It is also clear that direct responsibility for securing the
provision of health services would be conferred on the bodies that I
referred to earlier—the NHS commissioning board and the local
commissioning 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 136<a class="bkMark" name="Column136">&#160;</a>
                  </div>groups—and that provision is set out explicitly in
clauses 5 and 6. We will deal with those
later, so I will not say any more about
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000083">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Government
new clause 1 changes the role of the Secretary of State, but it is
disingenuous to pretend that the original duty on the Secretary of
State has been fully applied. As I have said, these concerns have been
raised by several organisations and, indeed, by the Liberal Democrats
as one of the three key issues. The hon. Member for Southport mentioned
the number of e-mails that he has received, and I have received a
similar number, including some that also highlighted the duties that
are to be placed on the Secretary of State. New clause 1 reiterates

               <p class="tabbed">I
found the grouping of amendments slightly confusing this morning, Mr
Gale, but I now appreciate that we are dealing with similar themes. I
shall refer briefly to clause 5 because it covers some of the same
elements. That clause creates a new section 1D of the 2006 Act, whose
wording is similar to clause 1, giving the NHS commissioning board its
general duty. This group of amendments also affects clause 5, but new
section 1D(2) remains, meaning that the board will be concurrently
bound with the Secretary of State to the duty in section
1(1) of the 2006 Act, which is to promote comprehensive health
services—except for public health, which is going to local
government. However, where the duty on the Secretary of State is to

for the issue of consistency between clause 1 and some of the other
clauses where similar changes would make sense, clause 9, which we will
come to later, replaces the duty on the Secretary of State that we have

the Minister kindly pointed out this morning, we have changed the

                  </strong> I accept that, Mr Gale. Overall, the Government
amendments go some way towards restoring the duty on the Secretary of
State. I acknowledge that, but I regret that the Government were not
prepared to admit that initially when Opposition Members made exactly
the same arguments in the original Bill Committee. As I say, the
Government’s amendments go some way towards restoring the duty
on the Secretary of State, and apply it to the commissioning board with
regard to securing the provision of services, but only in so far as it
is exercising functions conferred by the Bill. Indeed, the Bill as
amended by clause 1 gives the commissioning board a duty to ensure that
services are provided through its functions in relation to the local
consortia, but specific services are left to local
determination.<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000095">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Despite the
Government’s amendments, the Bill as a whole still considerably
weakens the Secretary of State’s duties and places the most
significant weight of duty at the national level, with the NHS
commissioning board. If there is not an accountable individual—a
politician in the form of the Secretary of State—and those
duties are exercised by the national NHS commissioning board,
Opposition Members will have concerns about accountability issues. We
have already been told that we should refer to clinical commissioning
groups, rather than commissioning consortia. The legal framework places
the bulk of power with clinical commissioning groups, which will be
able to determine what services are provided on the NHS to a far
greater extent than local commissioners ever could under existing
arrangements.<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000096">&#160;</a>

Act remains unchanged since the founding National Health Service Act

Saddleworth that it includes all free services that form part of the

clinical commissioning groups and, in relation to public health, local

Is the reality not, as I hope the Minister will go on to explain, that
clause 1(1) and clause 1(3) are the same as in the 2006 Act, but clause
1(2) is fundamentally different? Therefore, is it not slightly
disingenuous of the Government to suggest that they are replicating the

               <p>That
was for two main reasons: first, because the Secretary of

delegated to SHAs and PCTs; and, secondly, because commissioning

commissioning board and clinical commissioning groups, acting subject

Members will, of course, be familiar with the fact that the mandate is
issued to the commissioning board by the Secretary of State. That was
wrongly interpreted by some as a reduction in Ministers’
responsibility. We have therefore amended the Bill to make it clear
that the Secretary of State will retain ultimate accountability for
securing the provision of services. In future, in relation to the NHS,
the Secretary of State, rather than delegating to NHS bodies the duty
to provide or arrange services directly, will exercise his duty through
his relationship with the NHS bodies. For example, he will set
the mandate for the NHS commissioning board, report annually on the
performance of the comprehensive health service, and hold the
arm’s length bodies, such as the NHS commissioning board and the
regulators, to account.<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000112">&#160;</a>

               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The Secretary
of State has the power, under proposed new section 13W in clause 19, to
intervene if the board fails to discharge its functions properly or at
all. In the first instance, he could direct the board on how it carries
out its functions. If it fails to comply with those directions, the
Secretary of State could either discharge the function himself, or make
arrangements for another body to do so on his behalf. Clearly, that
would be a last resort. The aim would always be to ensure that the NHS
commissioning board carries out its functions in the way that
Parliament intends. That would not give the Secretary of State a power
to provide services. The board will have two main
functions—first, a function to commission certain services and,
secondly, functions in relation to clinical commissioning groups, such
as allocating funding, which it must exercise so as to secure the
provision of services. The Secretary of State could not use his
intervention powers to exercise a function that the board does not
have. I hope that the Committee now understands that the Secretary of
State has all the necessary and appropriate functions in the Bill to
enable him to secure the provision of
services.<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000117">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I still do not understand the
Minister’s argument; let me make that clear. As section 1(2) of
the National Health Service Act 2006
states:<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000122">&#160;</a>
               </p>

Minister does not want that in the clause, so he has changed it, but I
do not understand why. Under the previous regime, if I understand what
the Minister has said, the Secretary of State had a duty to provide,
and did so by delegating powers to others. Is the Minister saying that
that will not happen now—that the Secretary of State will not
have a duty to provide, and will not do that by delegating powers to
others?<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000123">&#160;</a>

position, but I will go into slightly more detail, in the hope that
that will clarify the situation. As there is a misunderstanding about
the duty to provide services, I will talk hon. Members through
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000124">&#160;</a>

have the function of providing services. Commissioners have duties to
commission services from providers. The Secretary of State and the
national bodies have a duty to ensure that those activities take place
as they should. I am sure that Opposition Members do not realistically
intend the Secretary of State personally to provide health services,
but that is what reinstating the duty to provide would mean, as set out
in the relevant amendments. The critical thing is that mechanisms are
in place to ensure that services are commissioned and that providers
provide those services, and that there are mechanisms to circumvent
problems and ensure that services are provided. The Secretary of State,
in extreme cases, has the ultimate sanction to ensure that that
continues if there is a problem.<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000125">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Currently,
the Secretary of State’s duty to provide services can be
fulfilled with the benefit of two additional provisions, which are the
power in section 12 of the 2006 Act to commission services instead of
providing them directly, and the power in section 7 of that Act to
delegate functions to SHAs and PCTs. The Secretary of State takes
advantage of both those provisions, so that PCTs commission services
from providers on his behalf. That is the existing system, which no one
seems to object to.<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000126">&#160;</a>

health providers commissioned on behalf of the Secretary of

bunions for them. Other people did that on his behalf, but he was
ultimately responsible, and he had political accountability. We are no
further forward than when the Bill first appeared in the original Bill
Committee. We have the Secretary of State setting up architecture and
saying, “Right, I’m the Secretary of State, but
you’re the commissioners, so I’m giving you that job.

and the Department are clinging on to a change that people
fundamentally do not want. Some 400,000 people have signed a petition
urging the Government to drop the reforms. All that the Minister has
done is confirm that the changes made are simply cosmetic; the
fundamental point remains the same. Clause 1(2) addresses the power of
the Secretary of State, and if you will not change that, you are
clearly not bona fide on that point.<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000130">&#160;</a>

misunderstand it in public. The principle is this. We said before we

               <p class="tabbed">The hon. Lady
constantly repeated the mantra that the Secretary of State cannot be
held to account by Parliament. That is just not true. I shall explain
why in simple language. The Secretary of State is responsible for a
comprehensive health service. He produces a mandate, saying what he
expects for taxpayers’ money, through the commissioning board
and the other layers of commissioning. That mandate will be placed
before Parliament, which can then debate it—at Question Time and
in Adjournment debates, Opposition day debates and Government debates.
That is holding the Government to account. Similarly, the commissioning
board will produce an annual report that will be placed before
Parliament. For the same reasons, it too will be accountable.<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000136">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Even in a
modernised NHS, I do not think that there will be any changes. Members
will still be writing to Ministers about local health issues, about
constituents’ health problems and so on, and they will also
raise health matters at Question Time and in debates, asking about the
configuration of the service or whatever. I cannot see how there could
be a reduction in the accountability of Ministers and the Government to
Parliament in the area of health provision. It is a fact, and hon.
Members will have to live with that. They must accept that it is not
changing or being diminished from what happens now, with hon. Members
being able to hold the Government to account.<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000137">&#160;</a>

right to do so. We have listened and made changes that strengthen and
improve the Bill and that meet some of the genuine concerns of

               <p class="tabbed">As I
explained earlier, in the new legal framework that we propose, the
Secretary of State would no longer have general powers to provide or
commission services directly himself. Under the Bill, the duties and
powers to commission NHS services are transferred to the NHS
commissioning board and clinical commissioning groups, as I mentioned
earlier.<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000162">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">The Secretary
of State can provide or commission services himself, but only in
exercise of his public health functions. If we kept the duty to
provide, it would be a wholly inaccurate reflection of the framework
contained in the rest of the Bill, which confers the functions of
commissioning NHS services on the NHS board and clinical commissioning
groups. If the Secretary of State were to retain those powers in
parallel, that would enable him to cut across the board and clinical
commissioning groups, undermining the mandate that he issues and the
stability of the system, and opening the door to political
micro-management, as I said near the start of my
comments.<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000163">&#160;</a>

because I want to finish answering some of the points that the hon.
Lady made in the course of her rather long intervention. She said that,
at the moment, an individual would sue the Secretary of State. That is
not the case. If there is a problem, action is taken now against the
PCT in the case of commissioners, or against the trust in the case of
providers. Neither of them is the Secretary of State. The hon. Lady is
wrong. The situation is the same now; it will just apply to different
bodies. There is no sea change or difference in
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000170">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
will move on. Hon. Members have asked what removing the words
“to provide” means. The short answer is that although the
Secretary of State must ensure that the NHS services are provided by,
for example, exercising powers over the NHS commissioning board and
other bodies, he has no responsibility to provide those services
himself.<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000171">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We
should consider what a duty to provide means. A duty to provide
involves having the premises and the staff necessary to offer health
services directly. At present, the Secretary of State has a duty to
provide, but even under the current system, that does not reflect the
reality of a situation in which commissioning and provision rest with
NHS bodies, not the Secretary of State. Retaining a duty to provide
would not be an appropriate way forward for NHS services; it would be a
retrograde step and utterly inappropriate, given the network of NHS
commissioners and providers already set up to commission and provide
services.<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000172">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It
is worth noting that, subject to a few exceptions, the duty in section
1(2) of the 2006 Act to<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000173">&#160;</a>
               </p>

               </p>
               <p>and
the section 3 and 12 functions of providing or arranging the provision
of particular services, have for many years not been fulfilled by the
Secretary of State’s providing or commissioning services
directly. Those functions are delegated to SHAs and PCTs. Although
there is a small amount of direct provision of community services by
PCTs, that is due to cease, because PCTs are almost entirely
commissioning
bodies.<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000175">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">In
future, the split between commissioning and provision, which Labour
Members supported while in government, will be even clearer, so that

held by the Secretary of State but exercised by other bodies has led to
confusion, as the debate today has shown. The framework established by

new clause 2 introduces a new duty on the Secretary of State to keep

it clear in legislation that the Secretary of State is ultimately

               <p class="tabbed">I
now turn to Opposition amendment 227, which relates to the Secretary of
State’s duty to reduce inequalities. Helpfully, we established
during the previous and extensive debates on this issue that we all
supported the principle set out by clause 3, which is the need to
reduce health inequalities, and agreed that it should be at the heart
of Government decision making. Let me take the opportunity to remind
hon. Members that this will be the first time that there has ever been
a specific legal duty in relation to reducing inequalities in the
health service in primary legislation. That reinforces our
determination and commitment to reducing inequalities.<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000185">&#160;</a>
               </p>

and different ways in which we can work to address them. For example,

                  </strong> No, I will not. This social determinants approach
has been shared across Government and in our partnerships with others,
including the charitable and voluntary sector. It has informed the
development of other reviews, such as the Frank Field child poverty
review and the Graham Allen review on early intervention, as well as
Government strategies on social mobility, child poverty and, most
recently, the natural environment White Paper.<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000188">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We will
continue to work through the ministerial sub-committee on public health
and other bodies to underline the importance of the social determinants
approach in tackling health inequalities. However, we also know that
there is no easy answer or quick fix to reducing health inequalities.
It is not something that the Department can do alone. The causes of and
remedies for health inequalities lie across many areas of Government
policy and beyond. Health inequalities are a societal
problem.<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000189">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
amendment would give the Secretary of State sole responsibility for the
reduction of health inequalities, but that is not something that he can
do alone, and it is not solely within the gift of the Department for
Health. The duty in the unamended clause is more practical and
achievable. It is intended to give him a duty to do the things that he
can do on inequalities. The concern behind this amendment is that the
need to strengthen the inequalities duty on the Secretary of State is
misplaced. I will explain why the amendments do not do what hon.
Members wish to
achieve.<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000190">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
clause as it stands reflects the language set out in the Equality Act
2010, which applies to all public sector organisations, including the
Department for Health and NHS bodies. It places a legal obligation on
the Secretary of State to consider how he can reduce inequalities and
what more can be done to reduce inequalities whenever he is making any
decision in relation to the health service.<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000191">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The duty
applies when the Secretary of State is exercising functions in relation
to other bodies and not just when he is acting directly. That is
important because it embeds the need to consider inequalities across
all the Secretary of State’s functions relating to the health
services and it entrenches those principles in all departmental
policies.<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000192">&#160;</a>

               </h4>
               <p class="tabbed">By
contrast, the duty proposed by the amendment is narrower, as it will
capture only the actions that the Secretary of State can take directly.
It fails to recognise that in practice, much of the way in which the
Department of Health can influence health inequalities is through the
policies and objectives that it sets for other organisations. I am sure
that hon. Members would not wish to limit the Secretary of
State’s obligations in this
way.<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000193">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
amendment is not necessary. The clause as it stands is more practical.
The duty it places on the Secretary of State is more wide reaching and
will achieve exactly what the amendment aims to do. It is for those
reasons that I oppose the amendment. In summary, I invite members of
the Committee to join me in supporting Government amendments 55, 56,
new clause 1 and new clause 2 and in agreeing that the current clause 1
should not stand part of the Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000194">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> The clause is about quality of services. As I
understand it, the Government have made no attempt to amend it. There
was an Opposition attempt to amend it. Where it
says,<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000231">&#160;</a>

               <p class="hs_brev">“The

               <p>we
wished to replace the weasel words “with a view to

               <p class="tabbed">There has
been much talk about the Bill, which has been substantially and
substantively amended. One issue raised at Committee stage and debated
for months is how to measure quality of services, particularly in
relation to competition, price and so on. The Government say they want
competition on quality. It has been difficult with the Bill to
understand how they are going to measure quality of services. During
those substantial and substantive changes, has anything been added to
the Bill that will help with the measuring of quality of services? If
the clause is about the Secretary of State’s duty to improve the
quality of services, we would hope that some attempt had been made to
find a measure of improvement.<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000233">&#160;</a>

are talking about improvements to services, to ensure that they are
more effective and safe, and that the quality of the experience
undergone by patients is improved. Again, during the pause and
reflection that the Government had, did they find a way in which those
three elements could be measured?<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000235">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Are any
attempts being made to measure the effectiveness, the safety of
services or the quality of experiences undergone by patients? Or is it
true that there is such chaos in the health service at the moment that
it is impossible to measure those things? Within the architecture of
the substantial and substantive changes to the Bill, is there anything
that allows the Government to measure quality?<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000236">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">In the
absence of any Government measures of quality, there are others. The
King’s Fund carries out a quarterly monitoring of waiting times
in the NHS, and there is a three-year high. Waiting times in all areas
have slipped since the Government abolished a number of centrally
managed targets in June 2010. According to the King’s Fund
review of accident and emergency waiting times, the number of patients
waiting more than four hours is at its highest since 2004-05.<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000237">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">With regard
to treatment waiting times, 15% of in-patients are waiting longer than
18 weeks for treatment. Diagnostic tests waiting times have also gone
up. The 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 151<a class="bkMark" name="Column151">&#160;</a>
                  </div>number of people waiting more than six weeks for
diagnostic tests, including cancer patients, is double the number in
the last four months in a row.<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000238">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">There is some
measurement of quality; the quality of the experience undergone by the
patient is substantially affected by having to wait more than four
hours in  A and E, for example. Is there any measure going on
in Government and the Department of Health on the safety and the
effectiveness of services? Simply to say that the Secretary of
State<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000239">&#160;</a>

               </p>
               <p>is
not measuring them and finding out whether they are improving. If he
cannot provide a definition of quality and has no measure by which to
judge it, the clause is otiose. He must be able to measure the quality
and effectiveness of services and to see whether safety and the quality
of patient experience have increased. If the Government are not
proposing that within the substantive and substantial changes to the
Bill, frankly what is the clause really about? Is it, again, just
window dressing? That is our
concern.<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000240">&#160;</a>

had a very, very extensive debate on clause 2 the first time round. The

hon. Lady asked how we monitor things. It may come as a surprise to
her, but the driving force behind how we want raise standards and
achieve objectives within the NHS is through the outcomes framework.
She asked whether we monitor what is going on, and the answer is, of
course, yes. We constantly and consistently monitor such things as
waiting times, the number of people who have treatments and so on. She
mentioned safety, and we constantly look at safety through several
mechanisms, because safety must be at the heart of the health service.
We are doing a considerable amount, not least with the work on
protecting whistleblowers, to drive up safety standards and attitudes
towards
safety.<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000242">&#160;</a>

Average out-patient waiting times are down from 4.3 weeks in May 2010
to 3.7 weeks in April 2011. The average waiting time for those still
waiting to start treatment is similar; it was six weeks in April 2011
and 5.5 weeks in May 2010, and it is lower compared with the end of
last year. There will be changes from month to
month, but the overall trend is a stable situation with average waiting
times.<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000247">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">I may as well
extend my point a bit, because I notice that we have the benefit of
having a Welsh Member here. Wales is the only part
of the Union where there is a full-blooded Labour Government, so let us
have a look. In England, there is a pledge for a real-terms increase in
funding in every year of this Parliament. We have honoured that so far
and will continue to do so.<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000248">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">What do we
find in Wales? I will quote the favourite organisation of the hon.
Member for Islington South and Finsbury, the King’s Fund, which
says that the Welsh Administration—the hon. Member for
Pontypridd may be able to use this to find some defensive briefing when
he is faced by his constituents—is cutting NHS funding in Wales
by 8.3% in real terms over three years. If one looks at waiting times
in Wales, written answers from the Welsh Assembly Government last week
show that the percentage of patients who have been waiting more than 18
weeks when treated has risen from 20.9% to 26.4% in a year. That is
between May 2010 and April 2011. That does not show that the operation
of a Labour Government in power is particularly
helpful.<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000249">&#160;</a>

spending on the NHS is flat in Wales and is not being reduced at all
this year, the year after or the year after that. However, the overall
funds available to the Labour Government in Wales to spend on all
things is reduced by £1.8 billion over this Parliament as a
result of the cuts made to their budget.<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000250">&#160;</a>

fact is that real-terms spending in the health service in England has
increased this year, and will increase in every year of this
Parliament. I said this at the beginning, but he does not seem to

independent from the Department of Health. However, I cannot see any
amendment in the Bill that establishes Public Health England as a
separate arm’s-length body. There will also be the new
Monitor—believe me, I will not go into that now. Alongside those
organisations, there is already the National Quality Board, NICE, and

new system could make it more difficult to make urgent decisions on
reconfiguring local services, which is the point raised by the hon.

               <p class="tabbed">I would like
the Minister to answer these questions. First, if there is a proposal
for reconfiguring hospital services, who takes the final decision? I
have an example that relates to the independent reconfiguration panel.
I will not give a specific example—the Minister could get
himself in trouble, and even I am not that cruel at this stage on a
Thursday—but who makes the final decision if, say, a local
hospital’s maternity ward needs to close? Is it the clinical
commissioning group? Is it the health and well-being board? Is it the
clinical senate, the NHS commissioning board or the independent
reconfiguration panel? Can it ultimately be referred back to the
Secretary of
State?<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000415">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">It
is not only about the big political questions of changing hospital
services. Even now, services are commissioned in complicated ways. I
used to be a director of the Ambulance Service Network, and ambulance
services are a good example of how commissioning services is very
confusing at the moment. Clinical commissioning groups will commission
the urgent care bit of ambulance services and the NHS commissioning
board will commission the emergency element. Who will commission
regional services such as stroke and trauma? There are at least three
different bodies commissioning ambulance services, which is very
complicated. How do those things fit
together?<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000416">&#160;</a>

areas in which there are no price tariffs? Potentially, there will be
three different bodies commissioning ambulance services with no agreed
price tariff. Is that not a recipe for

now come to one of the consequences of the increased complexity in the
system: the cost. A plethora of new bodies are being introduced. We had
long debates in the previous Committee about how much the old
reorganisation cost. Independent academics who now advise the Health
Committee suggested between £2 billion and £3
billion. There have been exchanges on the Floor of the House about the
£850 million redundancy bill and whether the Government have
made any commitment that staff who have been made redundant will be
re-employed elsewhere. The Prime Minister yesterday could not give a
guarantee about that; indeed, he said that it was not his job to do so.
That raises the question of whether the purported savings that the
Government have announced will be delivered. Dr Clare Gerada from the

establishes the NHS commissioning board, which is taking on huge
additional roles and responsibilities as a result of the

already going to be commissioning national specialist services; it
would have been responsible for commissioning primary care, dentistry,
pharmacy and ophthalmology, as well as authorising clinical
commissioning groups and performance

of the Bill is a huge increase in the number of bodies, which will
increase costs. I will return to the point about the NHS commissioning
board, because I want to keep my comments relevant to the clause. We
know as a result of the Government’s response to Future Forum
that the NHS commissioning board will be responsible for commissioning
the whole spectrum of services until clinical commissioning groups are
ready, which is a huge responsibility. We know that the deadline for
setting up clinical commissioning groups is April 2013, so the
Government are proposing that one national body will be responsible for
commissioning all those services before that date.<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000425">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">The NHS
commissioning board will also be hosting clinical networks and clinical
senates. I would like the Minister, if he can, to tell the Committee
how many clinical networks there are now. He should know that, because
the NHS commissioning board will be hosting them. I would like him to
tell the Committee how many administrative staff they have and what the
associated costs are, because that will move to the board. The NHS
commissioning board will also host the new clinical senates, which the
Government have said will cover every area. I would appreciate it if
the Minister could tell us what an “area” is, and how
many there will be. We have seen suggestions of 30 clinical senates. I
would appreciate it if he told us how many senates and commissioning
groups there will be. If he cannot say, I respectfully urge him not to
say that the Government will be cutting costs, because he has no idea.

administrative costs will be and how many managers and other
administrative staff they will employ, or he does

               <p class="tabbed">I would like
the Minister, if he can, to tell us whether the NHS commissioning board
will have regional outposts. I tell him, or perhaps his civil servants,
that that needs to be addressed in the impact assessment. What are the
estimated costs of retaining the clusters of SHAs and PCTs? That was
not included in the costs in the Government’s previous impact
assessment. What will the NHS commissioning board, with its new roles
and responsibilities, cost? How many extra staff will it have? How many
clinical commissioning groups will there be and what administrative or
management staff will they have? I have the same questions about
clinical networks. They already exist, so he should be able to tell us
what their administrative costs are now. How many new clinical senates
will there be? What area will they cover? How many staff will they
have? Crucially, what are the opportunity costs of all those new
bodies?<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000441">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">From speaking
to various people in the service, I understand that GPs taking time out
from their day-to-day care of patients to do their commissioning work
means that locums must be brought in as cover. I have been told that
that was not included in the Government’s estimates, because
they have not asked primary care trusts. In their initial impact
assessment, did the Government take into account the costs of bringing
in locums to cover for GPs? How much will it cost to provide cover for
hospital doctors, nurses and other clinical staff who will advise on
the new clinical senates? The reason why I list all of that is because
I want to be helpful and suggest to the Government that we will
question them on those issues to determine the true cost of
reorganisation.<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000442">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">My
final point about clause 5 is the most important of all. It is not just
that there is a big mess and confusion surrounding the
Government’s plan, and it is not just that it will bring in a
blizzard of bureaucracy with extra costs; our primary concern is the
impact on patients. The reason why all of this matters is that this
huge distraction means that patient care is already going backwards in
some areas. We have had an exchange about waiting times, and the
Minister and the Government should be worried about long waits. They
should not be complacent and looking at the averages. They should be
concerned, because constituents have already contacted me about the
long waits that they face. The Government and the Department do not
have a grip on those waits. On the one hand, the Prime Minister says
that they back the pledge for no waits longer than 18 weeks, but waits
are going up. The Department says that it is not a target, but is it
monitoring the figures? Virtually abolishing waiting times was a huge
achievement of the Labour Government. I remember the pledge card from
1997. The target was to take 250,000 people off waiting lists. People
thought that we could not do it, but we did, and it is a precious
legacy that the Government should look
after.<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000443">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
second way that patient care is already suffering, which the public
almost do not understand or know about, is the time that we are missing
out on to reorganise services. Joe Korner of the Stroke Association
gave evidence to the Committee on Tuesday and made a passionate case
for how stroke care had been transformed in London. I mentioned this in
the previous Committee, and I will say it again: without some kind of
regional ability to plan strategically, we are missing out on saving
hundreds of lives by getting people to hyper-acute stroke units. On
trauma care, we have known what we 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 163<a class="bkMark" name="Column163">&#160;</a>
                  </div>need to change for years, and it requires a regional level. For goodness
sake, do not have a road accident on a Friday or Saturday night when
some hospitals do not have the very best consultants on call. We could
be making those changes, and we are not, so lives are being lost. The
board papers of SHAs or hospitals show that they are not doing that
stuff. They are focusing on the reorganisation, and it is a tragic
waste.<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000444">&#160;</a>

               </h4>
               <p class="tabbed">My
final point about the NHS board is one that I raised in the previous
Committee, and it has not had enough attention outside or inside this
place. The Bill includes a proposal for a national board to commission
primary care, pharmacy and dentistry. I do not believe that a national
body knows what GP practice is needed in New Parks in my constituency.
Neither will it know that a pharmacy is needed on the corner of
Stephenson drive because lots of older people live in that area. I
raise the matter, because those are the services that transform care
for patients, older people and those with long-term
conditions—80% of patient care is in primary care.<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000445">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">In its
briefing on the re-committed Bill, the NHS Confederation is rightly
concerned about whether the NHS commissioning board will be able to
performance-manage primary care from a distance and whether it will
have the appropriate expertise. Apart from the problem of one national
organisation managing more than 8,000 separate contracts, as well as
those for dentists, pharmacists and optometrists, the absence of formal
performance management responsibility might weaken the potential to
drive improvement in patient care. Hon. Members on both sides of the
Committee know the importance of improving primary community pharmacy
and dentistry services. It is critical to improve care for older people
and those with long-term, chronic conditions. The Minister will say
that the consortia will do it—that they will manage-up standards
in primary
care.<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000446">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">First,
there is a conflict of interest, because GPs might say,
“There’s a gap—a need—in that area. They
haven’t got enough good GP services there, but if we bring in a
new GP service, will that take away something from our
practice?” Secondly, during the evidence sessions, Jennifer
Dixon, Chris Ham and others said that there was a role for GPs to help
improve the work of their colleagues—for peer review. However,
we know GPs do not always say to their colleagues:
“You’re not doing great work there; you need to
improve.” That is a very difficult thing to do. I urge the
Government to think again about their plans, particularly on primary
care. <em>[</em>
                  <em>Interruption.</em>
                  <em>]</em> I say to the hon. Member for
Southport, I am trying, in my first speech in this Committee, to set
out the problems with the new clauses and amendments and the continuing
problems with the Bill. I hope that hon. Members understand
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000447">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I stress that
decisions about money are urgent. In my constituency, within two months
of the financial year, University Hospitals of Leicester is £6
million in the red. I understand that there are particular issues in
London. Within one month of the new financial year, Imperial College
and University College London hospitals are £10 million in the
red. In six months’ time the situation will be urgent, because
hospitals up and down the country will face serious problems. That is
what we should focus on. The Bill will not help us to meet that 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 164<a class="bkMark" name="Column164">&#160;</a>
                  </div>challenge, and patient care will suffer as a result. I urge hon. Members

constituents and on constituents across the
country.<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000448">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> The hon. Lady made a number of points of practical
concern, which we can discuss in a relatively apolitical way. They
raise the question of how to get adequate local input into good primary
service and commissioning. People are worried about how we relate peer
review to the process of whatever the national commissioning board gets
up to. Such concerns are legitimate, and I am sure that the Minister
will respond to them.<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000449">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I have one
simple point to make to the Minister, which follows the helpful
clarifications he gave in the previous debate. The Secretary of State
is not really doing provision as such but provision is being done by
the national commissioning board and commissioning consortia. The
Minister made the very good point that we do not want parallel regimes
where the Secretary of State overlays what people mandated to do that
in a structured way are already
doing.<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000450">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
also understood that the Secretary of State retains considerable powers
to step in, back-up powers when things go wrong and commissioning goes
awry, and the power of general competence to deal with whatever may
befall the arrangement. The beauty of this system, as he explained very
well, is that it makes the split between commissioners and providers
starker and clearer. Whatever one feels about that split, what he said
about it was correct. My question is this: suppose the need exists for
a new public provider such as a specialist hospital? One can think of
examples of less significance, but clearly it could be a case where a
new public provider might be needed.<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000451">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">In the past,
there would seem to be a fairly straightforward way of accomplishing
that. It would often be through the Secretary of State or someone to
whom he gave delegated powers who would use the capital programme of
the Department of Health and would create a new public provider. I
foresee a hypothetical situation where it would not be possible to
commission a social enterprise, there would be no social enterprise
willing to step in and provide for this need, or where the private
facility would only do it at an inordinate price that was simply not
affordable, or led to risks with which the Department of Health or the
commissioners were not comfortable. What is the mechanism for creating
a new public provider or, to put it the other way round, what happens
to the Department of Health’s capital programme? The capital
programme is currently attached to strategic health authorities and so
on.<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000452">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">This
is important because the capacity to do it is necessary to guarantee a
comprehensive service. Even if it is never exercised, that power should
be there. Clearly if the commissioners and the national commissioning
board have the power to create a new public provider, they would have
to behave in an even-handed way towards that new provider if it was in
competition with another provider. If they have that
capacity—somebody has to have that capacity and the NHS
commissioning board would seem to be the obvious body to have
it  in the new architecture—the absolute split between
commissioner and provider is no longer there. The normal scenario we
think of is the current environment 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 165<a class="bkMark" name="Column165">&#160;</a>
                  </div>of the NHS where there is a multiplicity of providers and some of them
are struggling to exist and always hoping for more
business. In London, there is surplus hospital capacity. In other
areas, that may not be the case; there may be a need for a new hospital
facility.<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000453">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Commissioners
ought to be able to do two things. They can choose between existing
providers or, in order to meet need, somebody—commissioners,
presumably—has to create a new provider. That does not seem to
be excluded in the Bill, but it is not apparent either. Clause 10
states:<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000454">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“Each

               </p>
               <p>I assume that if a
consortium considers it appropriate to create a public body delivering
a service, however small or however big, it can do
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000455">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> The hon. Gentleman is making a very interesting
contribution. Has he considered how the scenario he is painting would
be affected if a commissioner or the Secretary of State wished to add
to public provision of a health service in a given area? For example,
new section 12E relates to the Secretary of State’s
duty<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000456">&#160;</a>
               </p>

variation in provision of health services”.<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000800">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>The explanatory notes
say that the Secretary of State, under the new legislation, would for
the first time be precluded from introducing new provision, if that led
to a variation in the proportion of public or private provision in a
given area. The Secretary of State is now potentially going to be
legally obliged to consider change to the variation in provision in an
area, and might be unable to create, either through the board or
directly, a new hospital, for
example.<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000457">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> It is an interesting point. I am sure that when we
get to that clause, that is territory we will have to cover. My point
is very simple. We may find a situation in the NHS in future where the
most obvious and sensible thing to do is to create a new public
provider of sorts. The architecture of the legislation seems to
indicate that that would drive us in the direction of saying that that
is a commissioning body. There would have to be terms and conditions
under which it could clearly do that. I am not convinced that it is
excluded from the legislation as it stands. I have a question about how
we handle the capital programme in the Department of Health, which is
clearly the main agent for creating new public providers.<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000458">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">If I am right
that the capital programme will overshoot the date at which we are
meant to introduce the new system, it has to belong to someone and be
within their remit. Having stated that question, I would be grateful
for illumination, with an answer from the
Minister.<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000459">&#160;</a>

not in a position at the moment to answer those questions, because it
is a matter of producing a new impact assessment to reflect the

of the questions that the hon. Member for Leicester West asked is why

the question of who has the final say in decisions, commissioners, as
the hon. Lady knows, lead on reconfigurations in most instances and
work with providers. Local authorities will, through their overview and
scrutiny committees, still be able to take a view, and OSCs will still
be able to refer a reconfiguration to the commissioning board if they
do not agree with it. If the board and an OSC cannot reach agreement,
the OSC will be able to refer the matter to the Secretary of State and
ask that he refers it to the IRP, as he can at present. I hope that
reassures the hon. Lady. There will still be local democratic
accountability on
reconfigurations.<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000473">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Lady also asked about clinical clusters and clinical networks.
There is still work to be done on clinical senates. As she will
appreciate from reading the Future Forum report, clinical senates were
recommended in the clinical advice and leadership section of the
report. The Future Forum recognises that clinical senates are a new
idea in the context of the modernisation project. Paragraph 2.31 states
that<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000474">&#160;</a>

               <p>I
am not in a position to give the hon. Lady the ABC of how clinical
senates will work—how they will operate, and so on. There is
still work to be done, but it will emerge. She will not see anything
about the setting up of clinical senates in the Bill for the simple
reason that primary legislation is not needed for the role that
clinical senates will
have.<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000475">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Lady, if I heard her correctly, asked how many clinical networks
there are. In the nicest possible way, I think that that question
slightly misunderstands what they are now, because, as she genuinely
appreciates, they are a mixture of local and national networks. We want
that variety to continue, so there is no one-size-fits-all format. For
that reason, it is rather difficult for me to give her a definitive
answer that the amount of networks is x or y, because it does not work
out like that—and I am not altogether convinced by the relevance
of it either.<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000476">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">However, I
will contest a point with the hon. Lady; it was the reason for my
surprise when I gasped audibly at what she said with regard to Dr
Gerada, whom the hon. Lady was praying in aid. I do not know Dr Gerada
personally, but I am sure that she is a splendid person. However, I
gasped in horror because the hon. Lady had followed loyally, and almost
sheepishly, her right hon. Friend the Leader of the Opposition in
quoting a bogus figure to pray in aid her contention that there would

                  </div>points that the hon. Member for Leicester West and their leader have
already made. I am not going to go down that route because we could,

               <p class="tabbed">I turn to an
important point that the hon. Member for Southport raised, which
concerned whether the board could provide capital for a new service.
The answer is that funding for highly specialised services has to take
account of the fact that they are often very expensive to establish.
Currently, the advisory group on national specialised services takes
these issues into account when recommending whether a new service
should be offered. We envisage a similar role in the future in advising
on what services the board will be required to commission under clause
11. The board will take account of the full costs when agreeing the
contract.<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000494">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The hon.
Gentleman also asked, albeit in passing, whether the system of capital
funding from the Department of Health would continue in the modernised
NHS. I can confirm that that is the case, although it is, as it has
been for some years, a parallel system between capital funding in
certain circumstances for certain types of trust, and the development
in recent years—particularly among foundation trusts, because of
their greater independence—of using the PFI system. We are
looking at that with the Treasury at the moment to see what
improvements and changes we can make to get better value for money for
the taxpayer and the NHS.<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000495">&#160;</a>

although an impact assessment will be welcome, it is unfortunate that
that information will not be given to us at this stage of our scrutiny
of the Bill. What direction has the Minister given officials in drawing
together the impact assessment if he does not know, or is not willing
to tell us, how many bodies are being created? Surely there must have
been some definition of what those officials are assessing, or has the
Minister simply asked for an impact assessment for 100, 200 or 300? I
would like some clarification about the terms of that impact
assessment.<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000499">&#160;</a>

Lothian said, how can an impact assessment be done if it is not known
how many different bodies there will be? I want to state again that I

forward, because it will update the knowledge for those who are

worked up. How are clinical senates different from clinical networks? I
understand that some clinical networks are local and some are national,
and that some have been merged—for example, cancer, coronary
heart disease and others have come together in some networks in the
north-west—but is it appropriate that they are hosted by a
national commissioning board, and how is what they will do different
from what clinical senates will do? Bodies are not set up not knowing

would not have done what the Government have done, but I understand why
they are concerned about conflicts of interest in the context of
primary care. However, I state for the record what is happening in some
parts of the country. As <em>Pulse</em> magazine reported yesterday, NHS
Buckinghamshire has already handed The Practice plc, a private company
that runs 60 GP surgeries and has recently acquired the UK provider arm
of UnitedHealth, budgets to commission out-patient appointments and
prescribing for 11,000 patients in two practices—Lynton House in
High Wycombe and Prospect House in Great Missenden. It has also
devolved prescribing budgets to two other consortia within its
boundaries. There is potential for clear conflicts of interest, because
GPs may refer patients to a private provider arm from which they may
benefit. Possible conflicts of interest are already happening now, but
they should not exist.<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000516">&#160;</a>

now.<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000526">&#160;</a>

remind hon. Members, as they all are listening so intently, that
schedule 1 deals with how members of the NHS commissioning board,
including the chair, chief executive and executive and non-executive
members, are appointed. Committee members will remember that there was
some concern last time we met as a Committee 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 173<a class="bkMark" name="Column173">&#160;</a>
                  </div>that David Nicholson, the chief executive of the NHS, had been appointed
as the chief executive of the board. A freedom of information request,
which I think was submitted by the <em>Health Service Journal,</em> had
revealed that he had been appointed without any job description or
person specification. The suggestion at the time was that he was
appointed because the Chancellor of the Exchequer had been worried
about what was happening in the Department of Health and had decided,
on the advice of the former Secretary of State, the right hon. Member
for Charnwood (Mr Dorrell), that somebody such as Sir David should be
in charge of the board in order to get a grip on finances in the
NHS.<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000527">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Serious
concerns were raised not only by Opposition Members, but by several
external organisations. They were particularly concerned about the
appointment of the chair and the non-executive members of the NHS
commissioning board, because those roles, as schedule 1 clearly states,
will be appointed by the Secretary of State. We tabled an amendment
that stated that the appointment should be conducted through an open,
transparent and fair process. Great power and responsibility have been
given to the NHS commissioning board. David Nicholson told the Public
Accounts Committee that he is the one who will ultimately be
responsible to them for the entire commissioning budget. The board will
be responsible for ensuring that the Secretary of State’s
mandate is delivered on the ground, and we had a huge debate about that
today. However, the board members will be political appointees. They
will be chosen by the Secretary of State, and there is a real concern.

                  <em>Interruption.</em>
                  <em>]</em> The Minister is looking
quizzically at me, but schedule 1(2)(1)
states:<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000528">&#160;</a>

               <p class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">“The Board is to consist

five other members so

               <p>and,
as I understand it, the non-executive members will appoint the other
members. That is quite a lot of power to give to the Secretary of
State. A better approach by far would be to conduct the appointment of
the chair and non-executive members in accordance with the Nolan
principles.<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000529">&#160;</a>

only us: the NHS Confederation, which has some experience in trying to

With so much power, responsibility and authority, the people who will
run the board should be appointed in an open, transparent and fair

                  </strong> This has been a short debate, although I suspect
that that is probably because we discussed schedule 1 significantly in
our earlier proceedings. Having said that, the hon. Lady raised several
specific questions about the commissioning board, referring
particularly to its structure and the appointment of its executive and
non-executive members, quoting the rules outlined in paragraphs 1 and 3
of schedule
1.<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000534">&#160;</a>

do not recognise the hon. Lady’s interpretation of the
individuals who will presumably be appointed to the board. I reject the
whole idea that they will be political appointments. That has all the
connotations, which she would believe, that we would have people
stuffing an organisation to pursue one political party’s agenda.
I reject that totally because I have no doubt that the individuals who
will be appointed will be of the highest calibre and have the best
qualifications and training from their backgrounds to be able to carry
out an effective job to ensure the success of the NHS commissioning
board in the tasks that it has to
undertake.<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000535">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Lady went into more detail about her interpretation of the
appointments. The Secretary of State will indeed appoint the chair and
the non-executives, but that is perfectly normal, with lots of
precedents, for arm’s length bodies of Departments. It is
exactly the same as what happened with the appointment of the Care
Quality Commission, and I think I am right in saying that the CQC was
set up and the appointments made under the Labour Government. If it is
was all right then, and they were not stuffing the CQC with political
appointments, then I think it is all right now, and it will not be
about stuffing the board with political appointments. There has to be
some consistency. If it was perfectly all right and acceptable to the
previous Government to use those procedures, it is perfectly right and
acceptable now. She must also remember that appointments will, of
course, be made within the remit of the code of practice set out by the
Commissioner for Public Appointments. I am afraid that I share neither
her take on the situation nor her concerns.<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000536">&#160;</a>

for interview after her appointment, so that they could discuss how she

is a perfectly respectable and sensible thing for a Select Committee to
do. There are no powers in the House of Commons arrangements for a
Select Committee to interview candidates in advance or make
appointments, and, personally, I would reject the idea, because I do
not think that it is the best way forward. Once the board has been
appointed, I see no reason why the Health Committee cannot invite it to
give evidence. Frankly, I would be surprised if it did not call the
board members in to discuss how they saw their role and the role of the
board developing under their
stewardship.<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000541">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> Mr Gale, we are learning a lot today. My point
was that others may act in such a way. However, I was not suggesting
that the Secretary of State would pack the board full of political
appointees. I am saying that it is only right that a body as important
and powerful, and with as many responsibilities, as the NHS
commissioning board should follow the Nolan principles. I understand
why the Minister is trying to make the argument that somehow that body
is the same as  the CQC, but it is not. The CQC is a regulatory
body. The NHS commissioning board will be responsible for commissioning
a whole series of specialist services nationally. Before clinical
commissioning groups are set up and take on a formal role, according to
the Government’s response to the Future Forum, the commissioning
board will be commissioning those services.<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000552">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We would
never countenance—I would not now, although it might have
happened in the past—a primary care trust, which currently has
budgets to commission services on behalf of patients, having an
appointment that does not comply with the Nolan principles. The NHS
commissioning board is a fundamentally different body. If the BMA and
the NHS Confederation—they do not represent all NHS managers and
doctors, but they do represent a substantial proportion of those
groups—believe that they would have greater faith in the NHS
commissioning board if it followed those principles, which they
currently do not believe that it will follow, the Government are making
a mistake.<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000553">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Just in case
the Minister comes back to me on that—he looked quizzically when
I said that the NHS commissioning board will commission services on
behalf of patients before clinical commissioning groups are
ready—I refer him to page 6 of the Government response to the
NHS Future Forum report, which states that clinical commissioning
groups<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000554">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“will
not be authorised to take on any part of the commissioning budget in
their local area until they are ready and willing to do so…Where
a group is not yet ready, the NHS Commissioning Board will commission
on its
behalf”.<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000804">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>We
will come on to whether that is a good idea at another point but, if
that is the case, a PCT would never be appointed in a way that is not
open and
transparent.<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000555">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> The reason I looked quizzical was because, unless I
misunderstood the hon. Lady, what she seemed to be suggesting was that,
for a time, the national commissioning board would be doing all the
commissioning for all the clinical commissioning groups. That reason I
appeared to be quizzical is because what will happen, as reiterated by
her reading out that comment, is that all those clinical commissioning
groups who are ready and able to commission by April 2013 will do so.
We are talking about a sort of back-up measure, so that if some groups
are not yet in a position to commission, the commissioning board will
do it for them. Not all the commissioning groups will have their care
commissioned. It may be the case—who knows, because one cannot
anticipate with 100% certainty—that very few indeed will need
the help and assistance of the commissioning
board.<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000556">&#160;</a>

right that the members of the national commissioning board are

complies with the standards that we would expect of other bodies with
responsibility for public funding. It is probably more important for
this national board. For that reason, I still have serious concerns
about the

are going to become clinical commissioning groups, and every reference

the moment, we will continue to use the old terminology, in legal and

during the re-committal stage of this Committee. On Report, however, we
will introduce all the amendments needed to change all the references

                  </strong> I am grateful to the Minister for confirming
that. I want to raise three points in relation to the clause, which
will establish the new groups, and they are the main concerns about the
Bill, post-pause. The first is the important issue of the pace of
change. Some groups are moving at different speeds from others. On page
6 of the response to the NHS Future Forum report, among other
interesting things, the Government say that<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000586">&#160;</a>
               </p> 
               <div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 178<a class="bkMark" name="Column178">&#160;</a>
               </div>
               <p class="hs_brev">“commissioning
groups will all be established by April 2013—there will be no
two-tier system. They will not be authorised to take on any part of the
commissioning budget in their local area until they are ready and
willing to do
so”.<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000587">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>It
goes on to say
that<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000588">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“where
a commissioning group is ready and willing, it will be able to take on
commissioning responsibility
earlier.”<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000805">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>I
do not understand how that can be anything other than a two-tier
system, where one group gets the money to go ahead and make changes and
the other does not. I do not understand how what the Government have
proposed is not a two-tier system. As I made clear in my earlier
comments on clause 5, we are already seeing that happen in parts of the
country.<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000589">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Sometimes
there are concerns about what that means. For example, there is the
case of NHS Buckinghamshire, where the budget for commissioning
out-patients and prescribing has been handed over to The Practice plc
and private practice. People including Dr David Jenner from the NHS
Alliance and Dr James Kingsland, who are not usually critical of the
Government’s policy, have said that there would need to be
benchmarks for probity to ensure that patients were offered a choice
and not directed to clinics run by the companies from whom those
doctors would
benefit.<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000590">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
have three points. First, there will be a two-tier system. Some GPs
will have their hands on the money to make changes for patients, but
others will not. We might end up having a debate about the number of
GPs who signed up to the pathfinders. Dr Clare Gerada said in her
evidence that she had, although that was not because she was
particularly enthusiastic, but because she felt that that was where
things had to go so that they joined up. Others will be very
enthusiastic. Some GPs in my patch are enthusiastic about that bit of
the Bill, but they do not like the Monitor aspect. While there will be
a two-tier system, there actually already is in some parts of the
country—that is just a statement of fact. The concern is whether
that starts to lead to differential care for
patients.<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000591">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Secondly,
there are concerns about probity, proper accountability and measures to
prevent conflicts of interest. I would not mind the Minister writing to
me on the NHS Buckinghamshire case to set out how it was ensured that
there were not conflicts of interest when a private company of GPs came
in. They may well be referring patients to that clinic—I do not
know, and I am not saying that they are—but I just want to know
what safeguards are in
place.<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000592">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
third issue is one about which I am deeply concerned in my patch. I
mentioned Dr Teck Khong earlier. He is a leading GP board member on the
Leicester commissioning group. He was a parliamentary candidate in
Bradford North and he tried to become the Conservative candidate for
the Leicester South by-election, so his parliamentary aspirations are
still alive. A couple of weeks ago, in an article on Conservative Home,
he said that an explicit list of services should be excluded from state
provision, because we cannot cope with the costs we are looking at
now.<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000593">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I want the
Minister to comment on this, if he will let me finish my remarks.
People have been worried about the endgame plan. If GPs are in control
of running and buying services, they are also businessmen. They will
end up being, as Dr Clare Gerada and others have
said—<em>[</em>
                  <em>Interruption.</em>

faced with the patient sitting in front of them, will be thinking not

                  </strong> I am surprised by the hon. Member for York Outer,
because he usually listens carefully. I said that people are concerned.
Dr Clare Gerada said in her evidence that people feel that when they go
into the surgery, their GP will no longer look at them purely on the
basis of what they need as a patient because the GP will also be
thinking about balancing the books. Clare Gerada thinks that that is a
real danger. Hon. Members can read the evidence and see. She said that
she was worried about the impact on trust between patients and their
doctors. People will no longer believe that doctors are making the
right decision based on them because of a belief that GPs will be
thinking about their balance sheets.<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000597">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It is
important that clinicians are engaged in the costs of their decisions.
Dr Teck Khong says that the system is unsustainable unless we exclude
patients from parts of the NHS. I am not saying that Dr Khong is
representative, but I am really worried for patients in
Leicester.<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000598">&#160;</a>

all ways, but is not that the problem with the Opposition’s
whole approach to the Bill? On the one hand, they float all sorts of
ideas and scare stories but actually, as the hon. Member for East

trust their GPs not to think about how much they are going to pay, but
to give them the right care. It is patients who are at the heart of

               <p class="tabbed">The other
point is that the hon. Member for Leicester West cannot attack the

attacking somebody else who is also not here. I do not know Dr Teck
Khong. The hon. Lady is right about his involvement in Leicester, but I
think that we would all agree, as politicians, that we have members of
our parties who say things publicly that are in no way representative

the hon. Member for Broxtowe, as a Parliamentary Private Secretary,

West because she got a number of things muddled up.
I am not remotely interested, personally, in what is happening in
Leicester West or in the individuals she spoke about. However, the
difficulties that she expressed apropos the commissioning consortia
would have applied if the Government had gone for what would have been
my favoured option: clinicians on the boards of the PCTs. There would
have been exactly the same conflict of objectives, because an
individual clinician would have had to think about the needs of the
patient while thinking about how to control a budget, and that would
apply if the hon. Lady’s favoured solution to have greater
clinical involvement were implemented rather than the
Government’s.<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000629">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">That matter
is quite separate from a conflict of interests, which is when a GP
personally stands to gain financially from the arrangement in some way.
Obviously, protections must be provided in the registration in order to
do that. I was concerned that Assura Medical, which is a provider to
the NHS, was also forming partnerships with GPs and that some of those
partners ended up playing leading roles in commissioning
consortia—on pathfinders. Assura and the Department recognised
that that was inappropriate and not how things should be
done.<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000630">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">There are
dangers in clinicians not thinking of money at all and prescribing
willy-nilly the most expensive drugs and so on, regardless of whether
generic drugs are cheaper. There are also dangers in clinicians
thinking too much about money—thinking not of their
patients’ interests, but purely of managing the budget. I want
to make the general point, however, that if we think that clinicians
are incapable of handling this responsibility in a professional way
that is fair to their patients and to the commissioning community, we
simply should not get them involved. If they are going to be involved,
they must deal with balancing the
objectives.<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000631">&#160;</a>

fundamental difference between clinicians managing their budgets, as
they currently do—we accept that they absolutely need to do
so—and the new scenario? Under the Bill, the bonus that is
payable by the board to the consortium—the quality
premium—may be contingent on the value-for-money savings or
efficiency savings delivered by that consortium. Equally, as Jennifer
Dixon highlighted in her evidence, we do not know whether consortia
will be able to keep their surpluses at the end of the year as they did
in the pathfinders. Neither of those things is clear in the Bill, and
until they are clear, our concern is absolutely
legitimate.<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000632">&#160;</a>

criticisms made by the hon. Member for Leicester West relate to matters
that are intrinsic to any system with clinicians involved in

criticisms of what the Government are doing. In the Bill, they are
trying to ensure adequate protection against conflicts of interest, but
they recognise, as clinicians themselves do, that there is always a
dilemma when a doctor has a dual role and must think about a budget and
the interests of his patients. However, do we not assume that all

legislation that is not left open to such concerns and anxiety. When

Lady to misrepresent me. At no point have I said
that GPs are not capable. I have said that the Bill—this bad
Bill, and it was the Deputy Prime Minister who said, “Better no
Bill than a bad Bill”—opened the worry for patients.
Government Members must take responsibility for creating those
concerns. I am not talking down anyone in the medical profession, but
we know that some GPs out there might not be operating with the best
interests of their patients at heart.

in what they prioritise in the surgery for treating their patients.
That is a problem in the current system but, also, many bonuses are
based on financial incentives and how practices improve financial
management. How does that sit with what the hon. Member for Leicester

I do as a job, and what my colleagues do in Parliament, is ensure that
the Government’s policies are pursued, and the
Government’s policy is that the NHS should be free at the point
of use for all those eligible to use it. We do not, have not and will
not agree to the idea that one should draw up lists of medical
treatments that should be excluded. An individual may have that idea,
and he may contribute to the debate, but it is not an idea that finds
favour with the Government, although, in certain circumstances in which
there is almost unanimous agreement, the NHS does not provide certain
types of treatment.<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000653">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Member for Leicester West also mentioned a situation in
Buckinghamshire, and I can give her some information on that. First, I
remind her that provider arms are not allowed to be commissioners of
services. Secondly, unless I misheard the hon. Lady, she said that a
budget had been handed over to a practice PCT by Buckinghamshire NHS.
My information is that it has not had a budget handed over to it, but
it is advising on a sub-committee of the PCT on an indicative budget in
a traditional, practice-based commissioning arrangement. It has to get
PCT approval for any spend. I hope that that helps the hon. Lady.
However, if on reflection she wants to come back to me at a later
stage—I suspect she will not have the time to reflect on it
today—I would be more than happy to respond. If I can help her,
I
will.<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000657">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Moving
on, I listened with interest to the points that the hon. Lady made
about a two-tier system. It will come as no surprise to her that I do
not share her analysis of the situation. I do not think that a two-tier
system is arising or about to arise over the next two years or
so.<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000658">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">At the
moment, while pathfinders are working with PCTs, learning the way and
finessing their expertise and experience for the challenges and the
work that they will do after they get full control of commissioning for
their patients, there will be movements at different paces. That is
perfectly reasonable and does not automatically mean that there is a
two-tier system. I will pray in aid an organisation that I know finds
favour with the hon. Lady; no doubt she will respect the views of
Professor Chris
Ham.<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000659">&#160;</a>

               <p class="hs_brev">“Pace
needs to be judged according to the ability of the new clinical

			Column number: 186<a class="bkMark" name="Column186">&#160;</a>
                  </div>ready to go. Why would we hold them back? There are some excellent
examples around the country, but there are many others, often next
door, where that is not the case. So pace has to be judged in relation
to the ability of people to take on the responsibilities being put in

               </p>
               <p>I think
that is a very reasonable assessment not only of the situation but of
the way we should move forward. There always will be different levels
of movement forward; it will not be uniform across the country
throughout the pathfinders. It would be most unnatural if it
was.<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000661">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">I do not
think that the situation will develop into the sort of problem that the
hon. Lady mentioned. I should also add, as a kind of check against a
two-tier system developing, that clinical commissioning groups are
being helped at the moment by working with PCTs. They will also get
help and assistance from the NHS commissioning board in due course.
That, to me, is a block against a two-tier system
developing.<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000662">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Member for Leicester West also mentioned probity. I certainly do
not believe that GPs will be influenced by money. The core motivation
and driving force of a GP is to look after their patients and do what
is in their best interests. Doctors are a deeply committed group of
people, as are nurses and others who work in the NHS. It is unfair and
unrealistic to suggest that GPs will start putting bank accounts and
money ahead of the interests of their patients; they are too committed
and too professional to get wrapped up in that sort of thing. I do not
think that the hon. Lady should worry about that, because I do not
think that it is fair on
doctors.<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000663">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">I
will leave it at that, because I do not want to get into another
argument with the hon. Lady on an issue that has caused some
controversy in the Committee. I would also like to say, as a back-up to
that, that doctors already have codes of conduct in their royal
colleges about their behaviour and motivation—how they look
after patients and carry out their duties—and I am confident
that those are a brake on the sort of situation she describes
arising.<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000664">&#160;</a>

the perennial challenges of the need both to involve clinicians in
wider decisions and to make sure that they always put patients’
interests first. I was not confused about the three issues that I
raised—fears about two tiers, fears about conflicts of interests
and fears about rationing. I realise that they are different; I was
simply trying to cover them all.<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000666">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">At the heart
of the debate is our concern that something different is going on here.
My hon. Friend the Member for Oldham East and Saddleworth highlighted
some interesting evidence about QOF and the impact that that has had.
This is something different, because clinicians will be taking on the
commissioning of a wider range of services. It is not only about good
management of their own budgets; they are taking on a different role.

commissioning groups. This should leave no doubt in the minds of the
future commissioners about the scope of their responsibilities and,
more importantly ensure that there is no apprehension among the public
that there are gaps in the responsibilities of those with whom we
intend to entrust the co-ordination, planning and securing of the care
we receive from the NHS. In that sense, the changes are significant in
ensuring the coherence of the Bill and that we maintain the trust of
professionals and public alike in the NHS.<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000676">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">The
amendments are intended to clarify the responsibilities of clinical
commissioning groups in two important areas, which I would like to
consider in turn. First, amendments 57 and 58 make it clear that a

Gentleman thinks that he has caught me on the hop and he wants an
instant answer, I will give him one that immediately springs to mind:
students usually live in an area, but go away for part of the year to
university, college or whatever. I will come on to that in more detail
with some other groups later, but I hope that that
helps.<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000679">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">A
strong message from the NHS Future Forum was the importance of ensuring
that the new arrangements for commissioning recognise the need for a
system within which services are delivered with the objective of health
improvement across the whole population. There were concerns that that
would be undermined if it appeared that clinical commissioning groups
did not have a clear duty to the whole resident population. The forum
reported
that<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000680">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“the
responsibility for commissioning services for a defined geography and
population is, we believe, particularly important to ensure that people
are covered by health and other local services in an integrated way,
and for a Population Health perspective to be
effective.”<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000812">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>On
a similar theme, concerns have also been raised by important
stakeholder organisations such as the Royal College of General
Practitioners that the Bill as drafted did not make it clear that
clinical commissioning groups had responsibility not only for their
registered patients but for those who are not registered anywhere with
a GP, a category which often includes vulnerable and hard-to-reach
groups—I imagine the hon. Member for Pontypridd will want to
listen to this—such as homeless people, Travellers or refugees.
There was a strong view that the particular health needs of such groups
should not be overlooked, however inadvertently. The amendments, as
part of our wider drive to remove inequalities and improve outcomes,
make sure that that cannot
happen.<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000681">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">There
are likely to be instances where clinical commissioning groups are
specifically not to have responsibility for certain people who would
otherwise meet the criteria. That could include, for example, people
who are receiving primary medical services as temporary residents, such
as someone on holiday in an area covered by a clinical commissioning
group who was registered with another GP elsewhere in the country. The
regulation-making power in new subsection (1C) would allow such
exemptions to be made and give us the flexibility to divide categories
of patient among those who are not registered with a GP and for whom
the clinical commissioning group does not have responsibility, which
might include some categories of overseas visitors, who are usually
eligible to be charged for the hospital care that they
receive.<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000682">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Amendment 59
makes it clear that we intend to specify in regulations that a CCG also
has responsibility for ensuring that it commissions emergency services
to meet the reasonable requirements of anyone in the area that it
covers. That might include ambulance and accident 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 189<a class="bkMark" name="Column189">&#160;</a>
                  </div>and emergency services and other urgent and emergency care services such
as walk-in centres. It was always our intention to make that a
responsibility through secondary legislation, and that has not changed.
It would be far more inflexible and impractical were we to
specify  those responsibilities on the face of the Bill.
However, we are making it clear in the Bill that the regulations that
we intend to make under the powers must capture that responsibility, to
remove any doubt that clinical commissioning groups are responsible for
ensuring that everyone who needs emergency care has access to
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000683">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">That does
not, of course, affect any current rules on charging. The proposed
amendment would not prevent the NHS from subsequently charging overseas
visitors who receive emergency care if they are eligible to be charged.
I emphasise also that the amendments do not refer to access to primary
medical care, which will be commissioned by the NHS commissioning
board. To be clear, the amendments will not change the nature of
entitlement or access to primary medical care services.<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000684">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">On Tuesday,
Andrew Cozens, an adviser to the Local Government Group, highlighted
concerns that the proposed amendments miss wider responsibilities. The
example that he gave was of emergency mental health services or
services for homeless people. Homeless people in the area covered by a
clinical commissioning group are in fact covered by the amendments if
they are not registered with a GP practice. On Mr Cozens’ first
point, it would not be appropriate to list specific responsibilities in
detail or make specific provision for so-called Cinderella services. We
cannot feasibly or flexibly cover all potential services; in
particular, we cannot make prescriptions in primary legislation that
might cut across the autonomy of commissioners and their partners on
health and well-being boards to identify local demand and commission
accordingly. None the less, I accept the important point that
commissioning must be thorough in detecting local need, and the service
provided must be comprehensive to meet those needs. I do not doubt that
the framework that we are endeavouring to put in place does
so.<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000685">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We have tried
to strike a balance in the amendments between clarifying on the face of
the Bill the responsibilities of CCGs and retaining a degree of
flexibility to ensure through regulations that we have the scope to
adapt as necessary policy on urgent and emergency care and entitlement
charging, or to meet our EU obligations. For those reasons, I urge
Committee members to accept the
amendments.<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000686">&#160;</a>

points that he has made. I listened with interest to his answer to
Andrew Cozens, the witness from the Local Government Association. It is
yet another example of the great mistake that the Government are making
in rushing the Bill through the parliamentary process. Mr Cozens was
given an opportunity to discuss just one of his three concerns, and
that was it. I am 
<div class="columnNumber">

have only heard what the Minister has just said. I now have to go away
and read his comments, and we have to speak to Mr Cozens. We would like
to come back, but we will not be able to because of the timetable that
the Government are pushing on us.<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000688">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It is
unfortunate because we want to try to improve the Bill—if we
cannot defeat it—and we need the opportunity to be able to work
properly and constructively. Frankly, it is very difficult, but I know
the Minister’s response to that. It is a shame that the witness
did not have the opportunity to voice his other two concerns. The
Government may have risen to the challenge on Mr Cozens’
first concern, although I am not sure yet, and there could have been an
opportunity for them to rise to his other two challenges,
too.<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000689">&#160;</a>

is the amendment that deals with that? Where is the amendment that
deals with the important issue of coterminosity? At the very least, it
should be made clear that GP commissioning consortia must stick to
local authority boundaries, but where are the changes apart from warm
words? Where are the changes in the Bill that will make a difference in
coterminosity? We are concerned about that clearly important issue.
Everyone seems to be singing from the same page when it comes to the
importance of integrating health and social care, but that will not
have a chance of success if GPs have to look after an area that
includes two local authority areas. That would make life far too
difficult for everyone. Integration is hard enough without putting more

We had a long debate about the role of the Secretary of State, his

been said, many of the arguments have been taken around the block by
the Committee. I think he knows that many, if not all, of us believe
that there should have been changes to the primary care
trusts—but changes are one thing; abolition is something else.
There is an issue about PCTs not being sufficiently responsive or
democratic, and we heard what the Liberal Democrats’ policy was
before the last election, although it is not their policy now. How to
make primary care trusts more democratically accountable was an area of
live debate, but we should not simply get rid of them and put in their
place GP commissioning consortia that have no democratic
accountability. There is no such accountability in the make-up of the
consortia, and the contradictions in the Bill’s early clauses
push the Secretary of State’s control over them further away. It
is a matter of real
concern.<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000708">&#160;</a>

I find it ironic that I spent many years trying to persuade my PCT to
listen to what I was saying, because I was a democratically elected
representative of my area, and then, at my first meeting with it after
the present Government were elected, it asked me to help save it.
However, I do not know of any examples—if the hon. Gentleman has
any, I would be grateful to hear them—of GPs saying that they
needed to spend money on the care of individual patients and the PCT
not allowing that to

Inevitably, whether by accident or design, the proposal will bring
about variations in service. For example, in my own area, chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease is considered a priority, and probably
rightly so, but there is a variation in the provision that does not
exist in any other part of the region. Some may think that that is a
good thing and that it is by design, or they may think that it is a bad
thing, but it certainly leads to a variation in services. The situation
is a postcode

area in which they did not live. If that remains the case, the problem
that the hon. Member for Central Suffolk and North Ipswich raised could
be exacerbated 100 times, because if one GP commissioning consortium in
Aberdeen was providing fertility treatment, I am quite sure that
infertile couples up and down the country would all sign up for that

                  </strong> I understand why Government Members believe
that the straw-man accusation might surface again, but the issue is a
real concern. There are parallels with the passage of the Scotland Bill
and definitions of Scottish taxpayers. It is important that the
Government provide clarity before the Bill
progresses.<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000737">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I am grateful for that intervention. The
wording in the clause has implications. I do not want to be pedantic,
but one issue is funding. I am aware that the proposals fall far short
of changes anticipated by, for example, the Social Liberal Forum. In
its analysis of the proposals, it called
for<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000738">&#160;</a>

geographical populations and to be funded on the basis of relative need

now.”<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000819">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>You
can imagine, Mr Gale, that some categories of people and some
constituencies have many students—for example, in Manchester and
the big cities. If that is not factored into their capitation funding
allocation, the impact on the local economy will be significant.
<em>[Interruption.] </em>The Minister is looking quizzical, and perhaps
he will clarify the
position.<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000739">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">An
issue that is dear to the heart of some Labour Members and, I hope, on
the Government Benches—my hon. Friend the Member for Oldham East
and Saddleworth raised it—is the implication for addressing
health inequalities. Clearly, if a needs-based allocation does not
reflect the true population, there would be implications for the
clinical commissioning group’s ability to commission relevant
services.<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000740">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">There
are some inconsistencies. Some issues were raised, by accident or by
design, and there are questions to be asked. There should have been an
easier way of defining the population. I have identified a problem.
However, the consortia will have responsibility for emergency care for
a whole geographical population in an area. Again, that is an
inconsistency that I find difficult to reconcile. Why define for
emergency care, but not for all primary care? That seems
bizarre.<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000741">&#160;</a>

               </div>
               <p class="tabbed">The change is
substantial—and confusing, because patients may find their care
commissioned by different bodies as they move from the accident and
emergency department to a ward, or when they are discharged into the
community. It is understandable that that might happen if someone is
working away from home or is away on holiday and has an
accident.<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000742">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">As I
mentioned, it would be hard to allocate funding according to population
needs, because the population would not necessarily resemble the wider
demographic mix of the geographical area covered, and I suspect that
that may become worse over time. The approach does not fit with the
gist of the Future Forum’s recommendations. During our evidence
session, it was specific about what it wanted, and page 10 of its
workstream on patient involvement and public accountability
states:<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000743">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“We
heard many views about the importance of co-terminosity of
conmissioning consortia with the boundaries of local authorities and
health and wellbeing boards. The responsibility for commissioning
services for a defined geography and population is, we believe,
particularly important to ensure that people are covered by health and
other local services in an integrated way, and for a Population Health
perspective to be
effective.”<a class="bkMark" name="11063074000820">&#160;</a>
