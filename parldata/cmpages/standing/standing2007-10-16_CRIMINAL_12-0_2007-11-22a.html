							<b class="B">Mr.
David Heath</b> (Somerton and Frome) (LD): I welcome you back,
Mr. O&#146;Hara. I also welcome the Conservative
Opposition and Government Members. I have just a couple of questions on
clause 42, which relate to listed persons under subsection (6). I
appreciate that this list is capable of extension, but in the first
instance I want to ask whether the Minister considered the view that
the Police Complaints Authority should be part of the list. If she did,
why did she reject that view? It seems a very obvious body that should
be listed for this degree of co-operation and the potential to carry
out joint investigations, particularly in the context of our
consideration this morning. I am genuinely surprised that the Police
Complaints Authority is not listed. It looks to me as though it may be
an omission.</div>
					<a name="07112319000051"><div class="hs_Para">I shall
be more diffident in making my next suggestion. I am sure that I will
display my ignorance here, but I am not sure what the interface might
be for those in detention with the military police authorities and
whether the Provost Marshal should be listed, because there will be
circumstances in which civilians are apprehended through the military
police, or in which a prisoner who has been dealt with through a court
martial might be transferred to the civilian estate, or in which a
service person is before a civilian court. I can conceive of
circumstances in which the Provost Marshal or a complaints body that
might apply in the context of the military system&#151;I am not sure
that one exists at the moment, but one might exist of which I am not
aware&#151;should be a listed body, as
well.</div>
					<a name="07112319000052"><div class="hs_Para">I wonder who
would be the appropriate body in the case of a similar position in
Scotland. The Scottish public services ombudsman is listed, but nobody
is who has a direct remit in the investigation of matters within the
penal system in Scotland. I do not know enough 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column464" />Column number: 464</div>about Scots law and Scottish arrangements to know who that would
be&#151;whether the issue would be directly investigated by the
Advocate-General or under the Advocate-General&#146;s supervision, or
whether it would be a matter for a procurator fiscal. There may well be
occasions when a joint investigation or the sharing of data and,
potentially, a joint report, might be appropriate. I would be grateful
if the Minister commented on those
thoughts.</div>
					<a name="07112319000054"><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112319000712">The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Justice
(Maria Eagle):
						</b> May I join the hon. Gentleman in 
welcoming you back to the Chair, Mr. O&#146;Hara? We
missed you on
Tuesday.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112319000714">Maria
Eagle:
						</b> Exactly. We are glad that you missed us too,
Mr. O&#146;Hara, but Mr. Cook, who stepped into
the breech, did a magnificent job.</div>
					<a name="07112319000057"><div class="hs_Para">I shall try to deal with the
points made by the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome. The clause is
about provisions for co-operation and joint working between the
commissioner and the other main statutory public sector ombudsmen in
England and Wales, which is why it focuses on how they will work
together to ensure that there is no unhelpful overlap between
jurisdictions, as we discussed, and that we have smooth working
together rather than muddle. The co-operation functions described in
the clause reflect and reciprocate the ombudsmen&#146;s needs as they
themselves have expressed, and the measures do not create new powers or
duties for ombudsmen to consult one another. We hope that that is the
best way to ensure and enable smooth joint working, and that the
measure works in the way that we want it to.</div>
					<a name="07112319000058"><div class="hs_Para">We are hoping to include the
Independent Police Complaints Commission by order at commencement.
Obviously, there are ongoing discussions about the way in which that
commission should fit in. It is not technically an ombudsman in the
normal sense, but clearly it should fit into the framework. The IPCC
has now agreed that it ought to be
involved.</div>
					<a name="07112319000059"><div class="hs_Para">In Scotland,
the Lord Advocate and procurator fiscal are generally responsible for
investigating deaths, and the clause does not change that. On the
deaths remit, as it were&#151;it is a horrible phrase that becomes
worse the more often one hears it, but it is helpful
shorthand&#151;the commissioner will have a limited role in
investigating complaints in Scotland. Essentially and in practice, he
will investigate complaints from detainees in Dungavel immigration
removal centre. We believe that the arrangements will be suitable and
correct in terms of the listings in the clause.</div>
					<a name="07112319000060"><div class="hs_Para">I am not in a position to deal
in detail with the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point regarding the extent
to which it might be necessary to list the military authorities.
Obviously, they are not involved, as far as I understand, in the public
service ombudsmen&#146;s current remit. It is possible, subject to
discussions, that some future arrangement could be made that involved
them, but we are not at that point yet. Any such discussions would
doubtless in part deal with ensuring that the relevant official or
complaints arrangement was placed 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column465" />Column number: 465</div>on the statute at the relevant time. Such a situation is not envisaged
at present, but it is not ruled out for the
future.</div>

							<a name="07112319000715">Mr.
Heath:
						</b> I am grateful to the Minister and I do not wish to
pursue the matter further. I understand from what she said that the
IPCC was to be added to the Bill, rather than adding it by order in
future, which seems sensible, if only for the sake of efficiency. The
clause title mentions &#147;ombudsmen etc.&#148;, which I presume
was intended to accommodate exactly such
circumstances.</div>

A Secretary of State&#146;s judgment is always challengeable in the

such a decision is not intended to be out of the normal run of
challengeable decisions; it ought to be challengeable in all the normal

have to consider suggestions for additions to the list. Before making
any commitments, we must look at the matter in consultation with the
prisons and probation ombudsman, and consider whether the body in

controlling authorities. It would give those local authorities the
additional responsibilities of a controlling authority. That will come
into play in four areas of part 4.</div>

					<a name="07112319000104"><div class="hs_Para">Local authorities have control
over secure children&#146;s homes which provide accommodation for
children placed by local authorities on welfare grounds. However, those
placed by the Youth Justice Board fall outside this remit and that is
why the local authorities are not there at present. Because of the
links between secure children&#146;s homes, secure training centres
and youth offending institutions, there may be some occasions in which
it would be useful for the commissioner to make recommendations for
secure children&#146;s homes. That can be done without adding them to
the list of controlling authorities, as we do not believe that that is
necessary at this time.</div>
					<a name="07112319000105"><div class="hs_Para">The issue is about the purpose
of schedule 10, and the fact that there are other complaints
arrangements outside of this in relation to secure children&#146;s
homes. That is why they are not there&#151;they do not need to be.
However, it is not something that we want to be pedantic about. Should
the remit change to include complaints and secure children&#146;s
homes, it might be sensible to put local authorities into schedule 10,
but as the Bill stands it is not necessary. I hope that that will
satisfy the hon. and learned Gentleman, with respect to the

							<b class="B">Mr.
David Burrowes</b> (Enfield, Southgate) (Con): I welcome you
back to the Chair, Mr. O&#146;Hara. I refer to the
principle behind the extension of conditional cautioning to 16 and
17-year-olds, while understanding the logical distinction from what is
in place for 18-year-olds. No doubt we want to deal with particular
circumstances concerning young people and whether it is appropriate for
the regime that is in place for adults to apply to them.</div>
					<a name="07112319000119"><div class="hs_Para">Before we move to schedule 11,
I want to consider alternative ways in which to deal with the process
of youth conditional cautions. What evidence does the generic Minister
have for the supposed success of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column470" />Column number: 470</div>conditional cautioning? Is there real evidence to justify its extension?
It is often tempting to see what happens at the adult court and say,
&#147;Well, what is good for the adults should be
good for the youths.&#148; I should like to see on an evidence base
whether conditional cautioning has worked. Obviously,
&#147;Alternatives to prosecution&#148;, the clause heading, is the
point of conditional cautioning. No doubt all members of the Committee
are united in wanting alternatives to prosecution in appropriate cases
and to divert young offenders away from the criminal justice
system.</div>
					<a name="07112319000120"><div class="hs_Para">I am concerned
whether alternatives to prosecution under the clause are, in fact, an
alternative to justice. The worry that is borne out
by practice in many ways is whether justice is not properly delivered
in those many cases that are being extended by the Government in
respect of pre-court disposals and if that is seen in the realms of
conditional cautioning or fixed penalty notices. The trend of
particular concern to the Magistrates Association and practitioners is
that the appropriateness of such penalties should not be done down and
dealt with before matters reach
court.</div>
					<a name="07112319000121"><div class="hs_Para">No doubt the
Government&#146;s mantra is to bring more people to justice and they
are keen to ensure that targets are fulfilled and that disposals
happen. That might be a fast track to dispose of different offences,
albeit low-level offences, but is it a short cut that diverts away from
justice? I invite the Minister to explain the principles behind
conditional cautioning and to say whether it is appropriate to extend
it to the arena of 17 and
18-year-olds.</div>
					<a name="07112319000122"><div class="hs_Para">More
often than not conditional cautioning comes within the province of the
custody officer, albeit it with reference to the Crown Prosecution
Service, to decide on the appropriateness of conditional cautioning.
However, in practice, it is very much at the behest and call of the
custody officer and the police to decide within a range of areas how
they wish to impose certain conditions. I want to know whether the
conditions that are attached are always appropriate to the particular
penalty and
offender.</div>
					<a name="07112319000123"><div class="hs_Para">There is
also a concern about resources. It is one thing to have a regime of
conditional cautioning and to extend it to 16 and 17-year-olds, but
whether the resources will be in place properly to apply those
conditions is another matter. No doubt, we will talk about that and
concur to some extent when looking at areas of rehabilitation and
restoration programmes. The argument that will be made by the Minister
of State to justify conditional cautioning and the rationale behind
it&#151;to divert young offenders from the criminal justice system
and involve them in an early intervention in restorative and
rehabilitative programmes&#151;might hold little weight if the
funding and resources to go hand in hand with such a proposal are not
provided. In practice, one is left with conditions being tacked to
cautions, which have little to do with any real rehabilitation or
restoration, but which seek to circumvent the young offender&#146;s
liberty in certain areas. I ask the Minister to confirm the exact
principle and rationale behind clause 53, and to tell the Committee
about the evidence that justifies extending the practice to 16 and
17-year-olds, and whether the required resources are
available.</div>

							<a name="07112319000730">Mr.
Heath:
						</b> I want to echo some of the concerns expressed by
the hon. Member for Enfield, Southgate. All of us can see merit in
pre-court disposals and diversion away from prosecution&#151;I do not
think that there is any doubt about that&#151;but there is also
concern about how that works in practice, and whether the same
considerations are given when a conditional caution is applied, and the
degree to which it simply removes a level of responsibility from the
prosecutorial and penal systems in dealing effectively with
offenders.</div>
					<a name="07112319000125"><div class="hs_Para">I would
like to raise a separate issue, and I am genuinely interested in the
Minster&#146;s response. Why were the ages of 16 and 17 chosen as
being appropriate for the conditional caution, and not those who are
under-18 and younger than 16? On the face of it, the measure introduces
a new anomaly, and had I tabled an amendment at an earlier stage in the
proceedings, it might not have been starred and it might have been
selected for debate at a subsequent sitting, where we might have
explored the matter more fully.</div>
					<a name="07112319000126"><div class="hs_Para">The proposal creates a
potential new anomaly in that a 15-year-old with an identical series of
circumstances to a 16-year-old would not be eligible for a youth
conditional caution and therefore a prosecution would be required to
achieve the same objective. The arguments of diversion from prosecution
that apply to a 16-year-old would not apply to a 15-year-old. It is not
inconceivable, in fact it is almost certain that there will be
circumstances in which several youths are involved in an unlawful
activity and they will have to have different disposals according to
which side of their 16th birthday they are; one will lead to a
15-year-old appearing in court and the other will result in a
16-year-old being given a youth conditional caution.</div>
					<a name="07112319000127"><div class="hs_Para">I am interested to know why the
Government have taken the view that this should apply only to 16 and
17-year-olds. If the answer is that it is considered that only a 16 to
17-year-old would have sufficient maturity to understand a youth
conditional caution, that raises a different question, about the fact
that many 16-year-olds might not have that maturity, and about whether
the disposal is effective and appropriate in that case. Is it perhaps
an adult disposal, being used for young people; and is that
appropriate? What is the reason for the cut-off point at 16? What are
the arguments for it? Will the Minister explain why the Government have
taken the view that they have on the magical element of the 16th
birthday, which makes the disposal appropriate then, but not for a
younger
child?</div>
					<a name="07112319000128"><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112319000731">The
Minister of State, Ministry of Justice (Mr. David
Hanson):
						</b> I welcome you back to the Chair for the
afternoon sitting, Mr.O&#146;Hara.  I am
grateful to the hon. Members for Enfield, Southgate and for Somerton
and Frome for raising again the issues that they have raised today. I
hope that at the end of the discussion clause 53 will stand part of the
Bill.</div>
					<a name="07112319000129"><div class="hs_Para">The youth
conditional caution is, as I know the hon. Member for Enfield,
Southgate is aware, designed as a disposal to prevent young people from
going before the court for offences that are deemed not to be
sufficiently serious. We want to extend the range of out-of-court
options to avoid their going to court. The benefit for a young person
would be in having a matter dealt with 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column472" />Column number: 472</div>much more speedily than by a court referral; from my perspective the
approach would improve community confidence in the youth justice
system.</div>
					<a name="07112319000130"><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman will know about several recent cases in which effectively
minor offences have led to court appearances by young people. The youth
conditional caution is designed to try to avoid that scenario, by
providing a better way of dealing with several minor incidents, so that
young people who have exhausted existing out-of-court disposals and who
then commit low-level offences can be kept out of court. The principle
is to try to prevent young people from going to court.</div>
					<a name="07112319000131"><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Gentlemen have asked
three questions about the broad principle of youth conditional
cautions. First they asked whether and how we have evaluated the use of
the cautions for 18-year-olds. Secondly they asked about costs and
savings implications. Thirdly, they asked the valid question why, if a
16 or 17-year-old could be liable under the Bill for a youth
conditional caution, a 15-year-old could not also face that prospect. I
shall try to answer those three questions, rather than to go into
detail about youth conditional cautions, because I suspect that hon.
Members know the principle, and there is not much point in my going
over it.</div>
					<a name="07112319000132"><div class="hs_Para">We have
undertaken an evaluation&#151;the details of which have not yet been
published, so I hope that the hon. Gentleman will take what I say on
trust&#151;which we commissioned in 13 early implementation areas in
six criminal justice areas in England and Wales, to provide evidence to
inform our national roll-out. There was an evaluation from December
2004 to November 2005, and I hope to be able to publish its results
shortly. The evaluation shows a positive impact from youth conditional
cautions for 18-year-olds. I am looking forward to publication taking
place shortly. I am examining the results; but there is value in what
has been
done.</div>
					<a name="07112319000133"><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112319000732">Mr.
Burrowes:
						</b> I do take on trust the positive results from the
evaluation, although it would obviously have been helpful, and in many
ways ideal, if it had been published before the Government went ahead
with legislating on extending youth conditional cautioning. I wonder
whether the evaluation takes account of the concerns that arise about
victims and their often limited involvement in the conditional caution
process compared with a court disposal. There is some concern about
whether victims see justice happening, and whether they are involved in
compensation or other restorative approaches; they might have a better
chance of obtaining those forms of justice in a court disposal.
</div>
					<a name="07112319000134"><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112319000733">Mr.
Hanson:
						</b> I accept in part what the hon. Gentleman says. It
is important that victims should be central to the question of
involvement in the criminal justice system. I accept that an element in
the youth conditional cautions means that victims may not visibly be
part of that through the Court Service. However, we should make no
mistake about the fact that the youth conditional caution will, I hope,
still be an effective way of preventing further crime. The
purpose&#151;I know that, deep down, the hon. Gentleman shares my
view&#151;is to ensure that those who have previously committed
offences and who may have been 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column473" />Column number: 473</div>reprimanded or given a warning and who may shortly
reach the stage of being taken to court should be given some sort of
warning or caution as a pre-court disposal. The intention is to
intervene without taking the young people to court, which otherwise
could be a potential beginning to an escalation of their court careers
and their involvement in the criminal justice
system.</div>
					<a name="07112319000135"><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112319000734">Mr.
Burrowes:
						</b> Another method at the court&#146;s disposal
for young offenders is the referral order. It is unique to young people
and is not available to adults. It gives the courts the opportunity to
divert the young offender from the criminal justice system. The
advantage of the referral order is that the offender goes to court and,
in that publicly accountable way, justice is seen to be done by the
victim and the public&#151;and by the offenders themselves. The
referral order also has available a package that allows the direct
involvement of the young offender team and other agencies, allowing
them to provide the restorative and rehabilitative approach that would
be put in place by the youth conditional caution but not in the formal
way provided by the referral order.</div>
					<a name="07112319000136"><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112319000735">Mr.
Hanson:
						</b> The purpose of the conditional caution is to
prevent young people from going to court. That is the purpose of the
pre-court disposal. Our hope and wish is that that intervention will
prevent future court appearances. I accept the potential issues that
the hon. Gentleman has mentioned, but in the evaluations that have
taken place so far, anecdotal evidence suggests that about 70 per cent.
or 71 per cent. of victims are satisfied with how their cases were
dealt with. That evidence is anecdotal, but I hope to publish it
shortly. However, there is merit in examining the extension to 16 and
17-year-olds, provided for in clause 53, based on experience to date.
It is done for a purpose, which is to intervene before individuals come
to court. If their behaviour deteriorates and they fail the youth
conditional caution system, they will come before the court in due
course, and all the issues that the hon. Gentleman mentioned will come
about.</div>
					<a name="07112319000137"><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman asked about the costs of the youth conditional caution. If he
examines paragraph 726 of the explanatory notes, he will see that we
anticipate that it will result in a saving for the courts. On current
projections, it will be &#163;98,000 for the Court Service,
&#163;68,000 for the police and potentially more than &#163;300,000
for the youth offending team in 2008-09, 2009-10 and 2010-11. There
will be a financial saving, but I emphasise that it is not being done
for the purpose of saving resources. It is being done because we hope
that pre-court interventions will help young people to face up to their
behaviour, and not to embark on a long career in court.</div>
					<a name="07112319000138"><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for Somerton
and Frome made an extremely valid point. We have conditional cautions
for 18-year-olds, and the Bill will extend them to 16 and 17-year-olds.
It is valid to ask why we are not doing it for 10 to 16-year-olds. It
is a potential anomaly. I do not rule out considering that at some
point, but I want to take things at a pace that ensures that things are
done properly. I am happy to examine the question; there may be merit
in considering an age of criminal responsibility of 10. It would
involve consideration of a number of details in a wider consultation,
which I 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column474" />Column number: 474</div>may consider. We would need to examine not just the individual&#146;s
responsibility but also the important issue of parental responsibility.
For those children aged between 10 and 15, there may well be greater
parental involvement than there is for those who are aged 16 or 17, and
indeed for those who are 18, the age for the current operation of
cautions.</div>

						<b class="B">Harry Cohen:</b>
This is a probing amendment, to try to get some information from
the Minister. My source is Liberty, which has
expressed concern that cautions will be imposed on youth offenders with
the objective of imposing punishment. Liberty says that there is a
two-step system, which leads automatically to court if the young person
offends again within two years. That system is in place under the Crime
and Disorder Act 1998.</div>
					<a name="07112319000145"><div class="hs_Para">Liberty is worried that the
measure</div>
					<a name="07112319000618"><div class="hs_brev">&#147;acts as a
funnel, channelling young people into the criminal justice system and
removing the option of informal intervention as a way of tackling
low-level offending. The result is growing numbers of young people
embroiled in a criminal justice system which, once entered, is
difficult to
escape.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07112319000146"><div class="hs_Para">Liberty
and I acknowledge that, in clause 53, the Government are proposing to
give police and prosecutors an alternative to reprimand and final
warning, which will be done by extending the adult conditional caution
scheme to 16 and 17-year-olds. However, Liberty
says:</div>
					<a name="07112319000619"><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We fear
that, in practice, youth conditional cautions could operate as a short
cut to punishment for 16 and 17-year-olds. Cautions are supposed to be
an alternative to entering the criminal justice
process&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07112319000147"><div class="hs_Para">But, of course,
16 and 17-year-olds could become embroiled in the criminal justice
process under this route and the two-tier system to which referred
earlier. </div>
					<a name="07112319000148"><div class="hs_Para">Liberty goes
on to
say:</div>
					<a name="07112319000620"><div class="hs_brev">&#147;There is,
however, a real danger that conditional cautions will be used as a
short cut to punishment, intended for use in large numbers of
cases.&#148;</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column475" />Column number: 475</div>
					<a name="07112319000149"><div class="hs_Para">It would be interesting to hear what the
Minister thinks about the number of cases that will be caught up in
this process.</div>
					<a name="07112319000150"><div class="hs_Para">The
concern is that the conditional cautions will be used for punishment.
Under the Criminal Justice Act 2003, they could only impose conditions
described as relating to rehabilitation and reparations, so there has
been movement towards punishment. Is it the Minister&#146;s intention
that youth conditional cautions should be punitive? I want to refer to
the representations of the Magistrates Association to an earlier clause
on a related matter. It argued that it was</div>
					<a name="07112319000621"><div class="hs_brev">&#147;contrary to the principles of
justice for prosecutors and police to be able to impose punishment
without the involvement of the
judiciary.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07112319000151"><div class="hs_Para">That
represents a problem because we expect the courts to hand down
punishment, and not for the police and the prosecutors to do so without
reference to the court. The Magistrates Association argues
that</div>
					<a name="07112319000622"><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
democratic legal system ensures that an independent tribunal&#151;the
judiciary&#151;should sentence and impose punishment, thus preventing
bias from prosecutorial
authorities.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07112319000152"><div class="hs_Para">That is an
important point in relation to youth conditional cautions because they
put matters in the hands of the police and the prosecutors, instead of
the court. I would be interested to hear what the Minister has to say
on that
aspect</div>
					<a name="07112319000153"><div class="hs_Para">Liberty&#146;s
final point in its representations to me concerned an unfairness. It
says that</div>
					<a name="07112319000623"><div class="hs_brev">&#147;in theory, a
person does have a choice about whether to accept a
caution&#148;</div>
					<a name="07112319000154"><div class="hs_Para">but that in
reality that could be very different, particularly for young people.
They could have a fear of prosecution and so opt for the caution; they
could have limited understanding of the options available or limited
access to legal advice and so go for the caution when that might not be
what they should opt for.</div>
					<a name="07112319000155"><div class="hs_Para">The second area on which there
is a lack of clarity is the financial penalty that could be imposed
following a caution. Liberty says that that could be unfair, resulting
in a two-tier system of punishment. It is all right if a youngster or
their parents can afford the fine, but a youngster who cannot afford it
or does not have parents who can lend them the money would not be able
to accept a caution with a fine attached to it. I have tabled the
amendment because I think that it is worth getting an explanation from
the Minister on those
points.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112319000736">Mr.
Burrowes:
						</b> I am grateful for the opportunity to speak to
the amendments and for the way in which the hon. Member for Leyton and
Wanstead approached the debate. I want to restrict my comments to the
issue of punishment being part of the youth offending regime in terms
of youth conditional cautioning, rather than the issue of a penalty
being imposed, which we can perhaps deal with when we discuss the next
set of amendments.</div>
					<a name="07112319000157"><div class="hs_Para">The concern expressed by
Liberty, but also by the Standing Committee for Youth Justice relates
to the principle of punishment being part of the youth offending
regime. I do not wish to deal with that debate; I wish to focus on
whether punishment is appropriate for a pre-court disposal. The case
has already been made that there has been movement. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column476" />Column number: 476</div>Initially, adult conditional cautions were limited to the purposes of
rehabilitation or reparation, but the Police and Justice Act 2006
extended the scheme in order to allow punitive conditions. No doubt the
case made by the Government is to extend the youth conditional
cautioning to mirror the change within the Police and Justice Act 2006.
However, the Government&#146;s cross-departmental review of
delivering simple, speedy summary justice in July 2006
said:</div>
					<a name="07112319000624"><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We also
intend to legislate for a youth version of the Conditional Caution to
provide a robust intervention that requires the young person to take
responsibility for formal action to make amends and tackle underlying
problems in a supported
way.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07112319000158"><div class="hs_Para">No mention is made
of the punitive element that is put in place under the
Bill.</div>
					<a name="07112319000159"><div class="hs_Para">The
Government&#146;s review went
on:</div>
					<a name="07112319000625"><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We are
working with the Youth Justice Board and the Association of Chief
Police Officers to develop effective restorative interventions for
first misdemeanours where a formal criminal justice response that forms
part of an offender&#146;s criminal record and is declarable to
employers would be disproportionate. Getting a young person to
apologise face to face and make amends is an important part of their
learning. This is not about going soft on crime. A face to face apology
is often quite difficult for a young person to
do.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07112319000160"><div class="hs_Para">Drawing on
earlier arguments, the Government are making the case for extending
youth conditional cautions on the back of debates about the restoration
and rehabilitation areas of conditional cautioning. They are also
slipping in the punitive element to mirror adult conditional
cautioning. The most acute issue is that the schedule is a pre-court
disposal. It is not so much a matter of whether punishment should be an
explicit aim. That was dealt with perhaps not in the most grown up of
fashions, nevertheless press releases do not have to be issued this
week. We must consider whether punishment should be used and
administered pre-court. Most members of the public would expect it to
be administered in the proper setting of a court, and that it should
receive its appropriate disposal in that
manner.</div>
					<a name="07112319000161"><div class="hs_Para">The pre-court
disposal in the schedule and youth conditional cautioning would be
administered on the recommendation of a Crown Prosecution Service
lawyer and then by the police. There would be no involvement or
independent involvement of the estate arm. There may well not be legal
representation, and it would be left to the police and the Crown
Prosecution Service to deal with the different functions. They would be
dealing with investigation and prosecution, and they would be the
judge. All those three hats would be worn in the process of a pre-court
disposal.</div>
					<a name="07112319000162"><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment asks whether it is appropriate for punishment to be part of
youth conditional cautioning, given that it is before the court. That
matter seemed to be accepted earlier by the Government until it came to
be mirrored by the adult cautioning process. They then seemed to veer
back from their original intentions of conditional cautioning in their
review of delivering simple, speedy summary justice. We now see in the
Bill that they have mirrored the adult conditioning approach and have
sought to include a punitive element. That has caused many members of
the public, hon. Members and magistrates to worry that the
Government&#146;s wish to bring people to justice is focused
particularly at the pre-court disposal and, in their effort 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column477" />Column number: 477</div>to seek disposals, justice is very much denied. The fast track to
punishment does not necessarily lead to a fast track to justice. I
should be interested to know why the Government have changed their
approach and feel it necessary to include punishment as part of youth
conditional
cautioning.</div>
					<a name="07112319000163"><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112319000737">Mr.
Hanson:
						</b> I thank my hon. Friend the Member for
Leyton and Wanstead for eventually moving the
amendment, to which he added his name in a late fashion. The debate has
been useful. The principle of youth conditional cautions is to have, as
my hon. Friend and the hon. Member for Enfield, Southgate have said, a
pre-court disposal to ensure that we examine behaviour and look at
reparation, rehabilitation and
punishment.</div>
					<a name="07112319000672"><div class="hs_Timeline">2
pm</div>
					<a name="07112319000164"><div class="hs_Para">I
have to say to my hon. Friend that I do not
anticipate that all youth conditional cautions will include elements of
punishment as well as rehabilitation or reparation, but they could do.
There are two reasons why I do not want a situation in which the youth
conditional caution does not include a potential element of punishment.
First, it is important that the proposed pre-court disposal gives an
element of confidence to members of the community who, as the hon.
Member for Enfield, Southgate mentioned earlier, are the potential
victims of the person receiving the youth conditional caution. Within
that element of confidence there must also be the potential for an
element of punishment.</div>
					<a name="07112319000165"><div class="hs_Para">I will give
two practical examples. Suppose an individual steals
something from a shop. The goods are recovered, and a youth conditional
caution is considered an appropriate form of order against the
individual, because of the nature of their behaviour to date, and as a
way of having another pre-court disposal forum. The goods are recovered
and the individual is found guilty of shoplifting. The youth
conditional caution should contain a potential element of
punishment&#151;courses or reparation&#151;as well as
rehabilitation. Punishment might well be central to the
process.</div>
					<a name="07112319000166"><div class="hs_Para">I
will give another example. Suppose an individual
draws some graffiti on a wall of a building, and writes their name
across it. By the time they face the youth conditional caution, the
owner of the property has removed the graffiti. We therefore cannot
have reparation because the graffiti has been removed. We could have
rehabilitation, but there would also be an element of punishment if the
pre-court disposal ordered the individual to undertake the removal of
other graffiti in another part of town, as punishment for the actions
that gave them the youth conditional caution on that day. A number of
circumstances within that show that the element of punishment is not
draconian, but it is an option within the youth conditional caution to
give confidence to the community and to ensure that victims feel that
punishment is part of the response. However, it would not be used in
every case, and I hope that that reassures my hon. Friend from the
point of view of his amendment.</div>
					<a name="07112319000167"><div class="hs_Para">From my
perspective, the purpose of the youth conditional caution is, as we
discussed earlier, to ensure that we have an intervention that allows
the young person to face the consequences of their action. It will
allow them to undertake some form of rehabilitation, and hopefully, it
will allow them to make some reparation 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column478" />Column number: 478</div>to the victim. If necessary, it would also provide an element of
punishment for the young person, as part of the desired effect of the
youth conditional caution is to ensure that that person does not appear
in court at a later date for more serious
crimes.</div>
				
					<a name="07112319000168"><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112319000738">Mr.
Burrowes:
						</b> It is helpful to draw out some of those
examples. Is not the problem that there are limitations on how far
there can be a punitive element, and perhaps even a reparative or
restorative element, in the conditional cautioning process? Let us take
the case of graffiti on the wall and imagine that it could not be
removed or that some damage had been caused to the wall, so there was a
need to compensate the victim. Is it not the case that, whether it is
called compensation for the victim, or reparation or whatever, in
reality that compensation order could not be properly imposed or
administered pre-court? To be effective, it would need to be
administered in court by way of attachment to a reparation order or the
like. That is just one example of how, in certain circumstances, the
desires for reparation or punishment cannot be truly met. One needs to
be cautious about extolling the virtues of conditional cautions,
because they are inherently limited by their very
nature.</div>
					<a name="07112319000169"><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112319000739">Mr.
Hanson:
						</b> I hope that I do the hon.
Gentleman justice in saying that I think that he would, in principle,
support youth conditional cautions. I am paraphrasing, but I think that
he wants to see interventions that are effective, that help with
rehabilitation and reparation, and that are pre-court&#151;sometimes
we do not want to escalate the young person into the criminal justice
system. Hopefully, the youth conditional caution will be a major
intervention, to stop people coming back to court later.</div>
					<a name="07112319000170"><div class="hs_Para">I will certainly examine the
points that the hon. Gentleman has made. However, it seems to me that
the order contains an element of punishment, which has to be present to
generate community confidence. It has the potential to be an
intervention that will ensure that the young person does not return to
court later, because they will have seen that the youth conditional
caution is not just a soft option for them, but has its own elements of
rehabilitation, reparation and punishment. Consequently, the young
person will recognise that it is a serious intervention in their
offending behaviour, with the objective of keeping them out of
court.</div>
					<a name="07112319000171"><div class="hs_Para">I understand
that the offender could be required to compensate, but in this case
that would not be part of a court order. So I will reflect in detail on
the point that the hon. Gentleman has made, and if there is anything
that I need to add to what I have already said then I will write to
him.</div>
					<a name="07112319000172"><div class="hs_Para">These amendments
proposed by my hon. Friend the Member for Leyton and Wanstead are
helpful in that they have teased out the details. I do not intend all
youth conditional cautions to have an element of punishment, but I do
not wish to rule out the possibility of such an element. The
conditional caution will reflect the circumstances of the case and the
court will determine whether, for the sake of the individual and for
community confidence, an element of punishment should be included. I
hope that my hon. Friend will withdraw his
amendment.</div>

						</b> In moving the amendment, I hope to provide good
value by enabling us to talk about financial penalties.</div>
					<a name="07112319000180"><div class="hs_Para">The purpose
of the amendments is effectively to exclude from youth conditional
cautions the opportunity or power to impose a financial penalty. The
principle is one that we have outlined before in terms of achieving the
best value approach, and I do not wish to repeat that discussion.
Nevertheless, it is important to consider the appropriateness of a
pre-court disposal in the light of its being pre-court and therefore
not designed to mirror or to replicate what can be properly achieved
only by way of a court disposal.</div>
					<a name="07112319000181"><div class="hs_Para">The concern
underlying the amendments is that a financial penalty is a significant
penalty, particularly when one is dealing with young people, although
the figures show that the fines the courts impose on young offenders
are less than the fines for adults. There are also significant issues
of enforcement. When we try to transpose the imposition of a fine on
young offenders into the youth conditional cautions, one must consider
whether that caution is an appropriate vehicle for a fine.</div>
					<a name="07112319000182"><div class="hs_Para">There is also an issue of
practice. The practical side to a financial penalty is problematic for
courts&#151;the problems that magistrates courts have had in relation
to enforcement of fines are well known by members of this Committee and
by others&#151;and it is that much more difficult when one is dealing
with young offenders, who are dependent on their parents to pay the
fines. It can therefore be difficult to enforce any financial penalty.
Indeed, we shall be dealing in a later debate with the whole issue of
enforcement in relation to young people and the problems that have
arisen.</div>
					<a name="07112319000183"><div class="hs_Para">The purpose of
the amendments is to draw out from the Minister how he sees the
pre-court disposal process working out in practice and how the custody
officer and a Crown Prosecution Service lawyer would work 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column480" />Column number: 480</div>out the appropriate level of fine. In a magistrates or youth court
setting, will there be a means test? Will the suitability of the young
defendant be assessed to see whether he can pay a financial penalty?
Will that process take place with the condition of payment of a
financial penalty? For those reasons, I ask the Minister to consider
the amendments seriously and to say whether it is indeed appropriate to
have a financial penalty attached to
conditions.</div>
					<a name="07112319000184"><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112319000746">Mr.
Hanson:
						</b> As I said earlier when responding to amendments
Nos. 183 and 142, punishment should be an option available under the
youth conditional caution. My hon. Friend the Member for Leyton and
Wanstead asked whether a fine could be levied on an individual under
the youth conditional cautioning system. The amendments would remove
that option, but it is important that we consider that element of
punishment and decide whether a fine is appropriate in those
circumstances.</div>
					<a name="07112319000185"><div class="hs_Para">If we
reduce or remove the fine element as proposed, we would remove some of
the flexibility of the youth conditional caution. For some individuals
aged 16 or 17, the payment of a fine could both act as an effective
deterrent and punishment, and be something that allows the individual
to take in the offence and move on from it fairly quickly. It might be
equally important that the youth conditional caution is available for
some offences that, as I said earlier, do not merit reparation and do
not particularly merit rehabilitation because the offence may be
something for which the individual does not need broader
rehabilitation. However, it might be effective as a punishment of the
individual and a deterrent to be used in the pre-court disposal of the
youth conditional
caution.</div>
					<a name="07112319000186"><div class="hs_Para">Many 16 and
17-year-olds are at work and have a disposable income. That would be
taken into account when considering the fine element of the youth
conditional caution. Furthermore, many 16 and 17-year-olds might prefer
a fine to another disposal available under the order. I am trying to
maintain flexibility within the youth conditional caution that allows a
range of options to be available, including punishment. It is already
the case that a fine in the form of a fixed penalty notice can be
issued in a pre-court disposal. We are therefore not breaking any new
ground.</div>
					<a name="07112319000187"><div class="hs_Para">I expect
account to be taken of the offender&#146;s means. I certainly do not
want a fine to be imposed on an offender who is not in a position to
pay it. That would be a retrograde step and might even lead to an
escalation of the behaviour that led to the imposition of the
conditional caution. However, it is important to have such an option
available to the youth conditional caution process and, for that
reason, I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the
amendment.</div>

Burrowes:
						</b> I do not want press the amendment to a Division.
However, a valid concern was expressed by the Magistrates Association
in evidence to the Committee about a financial penalty being attached
to youth conditional cautions. It sees the problem in the context of
the enforcement of fines and the need for them to be subject to means.
The Minister described 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column481" />Column number: 481</div>the importance of flexibility, but the problem is the extent to which it
is within the province of the Secretary of State by order to prescribe
which offences could be subject to financial penalties.</div>
					<a name="07112319000189"><div class="hs_Para">That raises
an important point about the extent of the pre-court disposal, in which
the type of financial penalty that is deemed appropriate for a
particular offence is at the behest of the Secretary of State. It would
be administered by the police, rather being determined in a more
traditional way by magistrates, subject to guidelines and case law. The
concern is that we might be moving towards a form of summary justice
which does not involve normal avenues of the law. The measure is
one-sided: it is decided by the Secretary of State, who can order which
offences should have a financial penalty; and on the same side, the
agencies of the state and the police under the advice of the CPS, would
decide on the appropriateness of the penalty.</div>
					<a name="07112319000190"><div class="hs_Para">We will not have a meeting of
minds on this matter, but perhaps the Minister could respond to the
underlying concerns and help the Committee, and indeed those
practitioners who will have to deal with the issue, to understand the
reality of the situation in relation to financial penalties that do not
involve a court disposal, but a pre-court
disposal.</div>

						</b> I wanted to check the figures before I intervened.
However, I understand the performance on fine enforcement is now
generally extremely high&#151;from memory, the figure is over 90 per
cent.&#151;so if the youth conditional caution has a fine attached to
it there can be every expectation that that fine will be enforced.
Secondly, it is important to realise that if a financial penalty was
imposed and not paid, that could be a breach of the youth conditional
caution. That in itself could lead to a further fine or court
appearance, which acts as an incentive to the individual to pay the
fine and keep out of court.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112319000749">Mr.

						</b> I acknowledge that there has been an improvement
in the enforcement of fines, but I am not sure if the figure of 90 per
cent. applies to youth court enforcement and the level of success in
that area. The other problem with those figures is that they do not
include compensation orders and the amount of enforcement that takes
place in relation to that. The jury is still out on the success of
enforcement.</div>
					<a name="07112319000193"><div class="hs_Para">I do not
wish to continue further. Perhaps it would be useful if the Minister
reflected in particular on the order-making powers of the Secretary of
State, and the need for us to see at an early stage the type of
offences that the Secretary of State feels would warrant the attachment
of a financial penalty. However, I do not wish to press the amendment

					<a name="07112319000196"><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112319000750">Mr.
Heath:
						</b> I would like to raise three
curiosities relating to schedule 11 that have not been covered
previously. The first relates to new section 66A of the Crime and
Disorder Act 1998, inserted by paragraph 3 of the schedule. Under the
first part of that new section, the youth conditional caution cannot be
given to an 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column482" />Column number: 482</div>offender who has previously been convicted of an offence. That is at
variance with the adult conditional caution which can be acquired at
any stage in a person&#146;s career. There must be a reason why the
Government distinguish between the two, and I would be interested to
know what that may be. Incidentally, it introduces the same sort of
distinction as I referred to earlier between a 15-year-old and a
16-year-old, only in this case it would be a distinction between a
17-year-old and an 18-year-old. The 18-year-old with an identical
history could have an adult conditional caution but the 17-year-old
would be unable to have a youth conditional caution. I am interested to
know the reason for that anomaly.</div>
					<a name="07112319000197"><div class="hs_Para">The second issue relates to
proposed new section 66A(5), which sets the attendance condition for an
offender at 20 hours. That is a significant period, and rather longer
than might be the case in certain disposals within the court. It seems
a little topsy-turvy that a conditional caution could involve a longer
&#147;sentence&#148;&#151;that is, a longer condition in terms of
attendance&#151;than would have been imposed by a court in similar
circumstances. I wonder where the figure of 20 hours comes from and
whether there is a justification for that.</div>
					<a name="07112319000198"><div class="hs_Para">The last point that I would
like to raise relates to proposed new section 66F, which would make it
impossible to apply a conditional discharge. It does not seem entirely
sensible for the court not to have that discretion following the
application of a youth conditional caution, because there may be
circumstances where that is precisely the right disposal. We know that
there is already a provision following a final warning, but in this
instance it appears that there is merit in allowing the court at least
to consider a conditional discharge when that is the most appropriate
disposal. It may well not be; it may be that if somebody has gone
through the conditional caution and commits a further offence, they
have reached the end of the road and the court should apply a different
sanction, but I cannot see why it should not be allowed to consider a
conditional discharge. I invite the Minister to satisfy me, if he can,
on those three
points.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112319000751">Mr.
Burrowes:
						</b> Concern was voiced earlier in the debate about
the range of conditions that are imposed as part of conditional
cautions and whether there will be some regulation of the range that
can be imposed by the police and the CPS. There is also concern about
the number of conditional cautions that a young offender can have
before a court disposal becomes necessary, and whether young offenders
would be given any guidance on that. Perhaps most significantly, there
is no reference in the schedule and the related clauses to the role of
the youth offending team or whether the guidance will make explicit the
need for a youth offending team to implement properly the conditions as
part of the caution.</div>
					<a name="07112319000200"><div class="hs_Para">I make a final plea for the
Minister to respond on the type of offences where the Secretary of
State would prescribe it necessary to attach a financial penalty, given
that that is to be done by way of an order-making
power.</div>

							<a name="07112319000752">Mr.

						</b> First, I assure the hon. Member for Enfield,
Southgate that it will be essential for youth offending teams to be
involved because we are looking 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column483" />Column number: 483</div>at how we can prevent further misbehaviour by young offenders who have
been given a youth conditional caution. The youth offending team will
be central to that in terms of what they can do with both the young
offender and, potentially, with individuals in the extended
family.</div>
					<a name="07112319000202"><div class="hs_Para">On the points
that the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome raised, those matters are
not at variance with warnings under the Crime and Disorder Act. Youth
conditional cautions are not available for adults. The conditional
discharge issue that he mentioned reflects the position on warnings
under the Act. Young people who receive a youth conditional caution
should not be in a better position than a person who has received a
warning, as they will have already had one or two slaps on the wrist
and should not get another.</div>
					<a name="07112319000203"><div class="hs_Para">The figure of 20 hours that the
hon. Gentleman mentioned is a maximum. Fewer hours may be given, but it
is important that the figure is in line with other maximum hours on
activities that can be imposed under the Bill with conditional
discharge. I hope that that helps him. <i class="I">[Interruption.]</i> If the
hon. Gentleman wishes, I will look over what has been said and write to
him regarding any points that have not been addressed. The main points
are that the 20 hours figure is a maximum and that the conditional
discharge measures are reflected in the Crime and Disorder Act. The
figure is not at variance with those in the Act for warnings which are
not available for adults. I shall reflect on what has been said and, if
need be, I shall drop him a note to clarify

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112319000753">Mr.
Burrowes:
						</b> The broad rationale of the clause is clear and
one cannot object to the concern to avoid prejudice against people who
have received cautions, reprimands or warnings when they seek jobs and
have to disclose their spent cautions. The position regarding the
disclosure of spent convictions is set out in the Rehabilitation of
Offenders Act 1974. We accept that broad rationale, but I want to
highlight our concerns.</div>
					<a name="07112319000208"><div class="hs_Para">Cautions,
reprimands and warnings are not convictions, which is why they were
outside the ambit of the 1974 Act, and it is important that we do not
creep into considering those disposals to be on a par with convictions.
That chimes with the earlier debate on pre-court disposals and the
importance of distinguishing such disposals from a conviction. Plainly,
a caution, reprimand or warning is an admission of an offence in which
there is sufficient evidence to prosecute, but they are wholly
different from convictions and should be treated as such. We are
concerned that the good intention of trying to prevent prejudice
against people with spent 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column484" />Column number: 484</div>cautions does not develop into their being seen as equal to convictions.
It is important that we recognise the differences.</div>
					<a name="07112319000209"><div class="hs_Para">The rationale is based on the
disclosability of previous cautions. What evidence is there that there
is a problem regarding the disclosure of spent cautions? In their
consultation paper of 19 August 1999, the Government said
that</div>
					<a name="07112319000626"><div class="hs_brev">&#147;it is anomalous for
cautions, reprimands and final warnings to be disclosable in
circumstances where convictions are
not.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07112319000210"><div class="hs_Para">The evidence was
supposedly there then. Why, despite the number of
criminal justice Bills that have gone through Parliament, are we now in
a position that this clause has been added to the Bill? What additional
evidence that there is a need to legislate is there now that was not
there in 1999, when the supposed anomaly was highlighted?
Has there been a problem in the intervening time without legislation
that justifies the provision?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112319000754">Mr.
Heath:
						</b> Further to the comments made by the hon.
Member for Enfield, Southgate, may I ask the Minister
why this measure does not distinguish between the rehabilitation
provision for a youth conditional caution and the adult equivalent?
Throughout the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974, that distinction
is made. That Act distinguishes between what applies to children or
young people and what applies to adults. There is a different
rehabilitation period for fines, community rehabilitation orders,
community punishment orders, community punishment and rehabilitation
orders, curfew orders, drug treatment and testing orders and for most
custodial sentences. Indeed, even in part 1 of the Bill, there is a
shorter rehabilitation period for the youth rehabilitation order than
there is for the adult equivalent, so why is no distinction made in the
case of these cautions? I am sure that the Minister has a reason, but
it will have to be quite a good one to suggest that these measures must
be an exception from all the other provisions that are covered by the
1974 Act.</div>
					<a name="07112319000212"><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112319000755">Mr.
Hanson:
						</b> Clause 54 introduces schedule 12, which is
essentially the nub of the discussion that both hon. Gentlemen have
provoked. The schedule provides for the extension of the Rehabilitation
of Offenders Act 1974 to cover reprimands, warnings, cautions and
conditional cautions as well as convictions. The out of court disposals
that the Bill introduces are not currently within the scope of the 1974
Act and therefore they never become spent. What that means, in effect,
is that, in the event of clause 54 and schedule 12 not forming part of
the Bill, the youth conditional cautions in particular&#151;simple
cautions that may have been given, for example, several years ago for
relatively minor offences&#151;will have to be disclosed when the
Bill comes into effect. The purpose of the clause and the schedule is
to ensure that those disposals become
spent.</div>
					<a name="07112319000213"><div class="hs_Para">The 1999
consultation paper &#147;The Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 and
Cautions, Reprimands and Final Warnings&#148; proposed that those
three out of court disposals should be brought within the ambit of the
1974 Act and that they should be immediately spent, because, as we have
discussed, cautions are used primarily for less serious offences.
Therefore, the Bill provides that simple cautions, reprimands and final
warnings should become immediately spent.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column485" />Column number: 485</div>
					<a name="07112319000214"><div class="hs_Para">Since that consultation exercise
was undertaken, the Criminal Justice Act 2003 has introduced
conditional cautions for adults, as has been mentioned, and the Bill
proposes the introduction of youth conditional cautions for offenders
aged 16 or 17. I believe that both of those cautions need to be brought
into the scope of the 1974 Act.</div>
					<a name="07112319000215"><div class="hs_Para">Clause 54 and schedule 12 set
the rehabilitation period for conditional cautions and youth
conditional cautions at three months&#151;the midpoint between simple
cautions and the least serious court disposals. They also ensure that
such cautions remain on record while the conditions are outstanding. I
hope that hon. Members will welcome those facts, because I am sure that
they would not wish to see the maintenance of those youth conditional
cautions on offenders&#146; records in the
future.</div>
					<a name="07112319000216"><div class="hs_Para">Our
intention has been to legislate when parliamentary time allows, and the
introduction of youth conditional cautions now makes it all the more
important that we provide for those cautions to become spent. Clause 54
and schedule 12 will do so. I commend the clause to the
Committee.</div>

							<a name="07112319000756">Mr.
Burrowes:
						</b> The clause provides a good
opportunity to highlight previously expressed concern about the
amendment of unimplemented legislation. It is consistent of us to
welcome the extension of discretion, given that we have argued in
debating other clauses against its removal from magistrates courts, and
the clause is welcome. The Government have decided to remove an
unimplemented measure in the Criminal Justice Act 2003 that would have
limited magistrates&#146; discretion to send to the Crown Court cases
in which the defendant pleads guilty before a venue. The discretion
will now be extended back to the original position before the 2003
Act&#151;magistrates will have wider discretion to commit offenders
tried summarily to the Crown Court for
sentence.</div>
					<a name="07112319000223"><div class="hs_Para">The concern
is best summed up by the Magistrates Association, which welcomes the

considers</div>
					<a name="07112319000627"><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
legislative situation to be confusing. The Bill amends an unimplemented
part of an earlier Act, which in turn altered another Act which is
still in force&#151;the effect appears to be to retain the status

such confusion.&#148;</div>

Gentleman&#146;s point about the undesirability of the confusion that
can be caused by amending unimplemented legislation, but I do not think
that one should put it at the top of one&#146;s list of things to
chase after, as a Minister. However, I take on the chin the points made
by the Magistrates Association and others.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column486" />Column number: 486</div>
					<a name="07112319000226"><div class="hs_Para">Clause 56 introduces schedule
13, which changes schedule 3 to the 2003 Act, as the hon. Gentleman
explained. In mitigation, the original purpose in the 2003
Act&#151;it was before my time in the Department&#151;was that
custody plus, the 12-month sentencing power and the procedural reforms
in schedule 3 should be implemented at the same time. As the Committee
knows, custody plus is not being implemented at present, but there is
certainly a lot of support for it. A review last year found a consensus
on sentencing among criminal justice agents that replacing the
committal procedure with a sending procedure offers benefits. It makes
sense to consider bringing schedule 3 into force by itself, hence the
clause and schedule
13.</div>

I admit that when the Bill was introduced, two short subsections were

section 11 (3) of the Magistrates&#146; Courts Act 1980, which
prohibits magistrates courts from imposing a custodial sentence in an
offender&#146;s absence, and subsection (4), which restricts the
circumstances in which a court could impose disqualification. The

<div class="Column"><a name="Column487" />Column number: 487</div>always so when cases are initiated by information and summons. It does
not necessarily follow that a court would consider it appropriate to

the Bill are welcome, but they raise a question similar to one asked
earlier about the magistrates courts&#146; citation and concern about
legislation. The Committee will remember that during an evidence
session, magistrates said that they were not properly consulted, and
that practitioners such as themselves and others who deal with absent
clients and defendants day in, day out, could have given clear advice
to deal with the problems that the amendments will address. Any

							<a name="07112319000764">Harry
Cohen:
						</b> I tabled the new clause on behalf of the Zacchaeus
2000 Trust. Representations were made to me by Rev. Paul Nicolson, the
chairman of the trust. He makes a good case that relates to the
treatment by the courts of vulnerable people and, beyond that, by
bailiffs. There is a great hole in the current procedures that mean
that vulnerable people are treated extremely
badly.</div>
					<a name="07112319000245"><div class="hs_Para">Clause 57 will
amend section 11 of the Magistrates&#146; Courts Act 1980 with
respect to criminal trials that start in the absence of the person who
was summonsed. It reduces the discretion of justices to decide whether
to proceed in the absence of the accused. Vulnerable people are fined
in their absence and, for many reasons, fail to pay the fine. They
might be illiterate, ill, confused or a busy lone parent on benefit
with several children to look after all at once with no one else to
look after them if they go the court. There are myriad reasons why poor
people do not attend court. They rarely receive advice or legal support
in a fines court unless the magistrates are minded to imprison them.
They are in a vulnerable position in the courts, and that is not taken
properly into
account.</div>
					<a name="07112319000246"><div class="hs_Para">If the
magistrate has no defendant, he invariably imposes the largest fine
available to him, which is disproportionate to the means of the people
who I am describing, especially those on the lowest incomes. It is
incredibly difficult when that happens to get the case back to court.
The Zacchaeus 2000 Trust said that a case in which it was involved was
fraught with difficulty. Since March 2006, when the relevant part of
the Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act 2004 came into force, the
magistrates have no responsibility for enforcing a fine after the case
is heard and the level of the fine is set. The collection order is
given to the fines support officer who administers its enforcement. If
the defendants are in court, they invariably make an agreement to pay,
but if they are not, the matter ends up in the hands of the bailiff who
still has draconian powers and can break into houses without reference
to the court.</div>
					<a name="07112319000247"><div class="hs_Para">The
trust said that the 2004 Act gave bailiffs even more power. It
overturned the previous common law controls. It has found that the
bailiffs completely ignored the national standards for enforcement
agents, especially the relevant standards on page 9 of its 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column489" />Column number: 489</div>document, which outlines a procedure for returning such cases to
magistrates for reconsideration in the light of a means statement. It
is not in the bailiffs&#146; interest to get the case returned to the
court. They are not interested in that. They just want to push ahead
with enforcement.</div>
					<a name="07112319000248"><div class="hs_Para">The
Zacchaeus 2000 Trust was effectively told that once a case has been
handed to the bailiffs, it could not be withdrawn. Whatever the letter
of the law says&#151;even some of that is not very
adequate&#151;that is the real position that many vulnerable people
find themselves in. Despite the advice of the Ministry of Justice,
which says that such cases can be returned to the magistrates, that
does not seem to be the case in reality.</div>
					<a name="07112319000249"><div class="hs_Para">Lord Justice Simon Brown
interpreted the law in the case of R <i class="I">v.</i> Hereford and Worcester
magistrates court, ex parte MacRae 1999, which held that a distress
warrant cannot be withdrawn once it has been issued. That approach has
been further enshrined in other legal documents.</div>
					<a name="07112319000250"><div class="hs_Para">The amendment does two things.
First, it puts a common-sense procedure into statute, so that when a
vulnerable situation is encountered, the magistrate can provide a just
level of penalty for the case. Secondly, it tries to give some teeth to
the national standards for enforcement agents&#151;the point is made
on page 9&#151;which calls bailiffs to account when they are dealing
with vulnerable households and individuals.</div>
					<a name="07112319000251"><div class="hs_Para">One final point is that the
Home Office added a last minute amendment to the Domestic Crime, Crime
and Victims Act 2004, which allowed bailiffs to break into domestic
premises to enforce a fine. That comes into force in March 2006. When
it did that, it said that the measure would be used as a last resort,
but it is not difficult to imagine how, and under what circumstances,
it has been operating in practice.</div>
					<a name="07112319000252"><div class="hs_Para">When the Zacchaeus 2000 Trust
sought information, the Ministry of Justice refused to provide it. The
trust was sent 30 pages of guidance from magistrates, with 15 of those
blacked out. That is not right. I know from own constituency that a lot
of people suffer from heavy-handed action, and in those circumstances
it is reasonable for a pressure group such as the Zacchaeus 2000 Trust,
and those who wish to control the activities of bailiffs and hold them
to account, to be able to look at the papers and see how the law is
operating. It was good of the Rev. Paul Nicolson and the Zacchaeus 2000
Trust to bring the matter to our attention, and I am pleased to move
the amendment and to get a response from the Minister on the
matter.</div>
					<a name="07112319000253"><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112319000765">Mr.
Heath:
						</b> I am grateful to the hon. Member for Leyton and
Wanstead for introducing the new clause to which I have added my name
and that of my hon. Friend. It raises an important issue. I would also
like to deal briefly with the clause stand part and the general
circumstances in which the clause moves towards a presumption of a
trial in absentia, rather than the occasional disposal that the courts
already have available. The matter raises some
issues.</div>
					<a name="07112319000254"><div class="hs_Para">I hold no
brief whatsoever for those who delinquently absent themselves from
court. They must be made to realise that when they are summonsed to
appear in court, it is a serious matter and they must appear. There are
far too many court cases that are 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column490" />Column number: 490</div>delayed or adjourned due to the non-appearance of defendants or other
key players, and it is not in the interests of the administration of
justice for that to be the case. However, I still have concerns about
people such as those to whom the hon. Gentleman
referred&#151;vulnerable people who are wrestling with extremely
difficult problems who may not be intentionally delinquent but are
chaotic. We all know of these people from our surgeries, and we all
know the extent to which small problems can escalate into huge ones
simply by their not doing what is expected of them by the system. They
find themselves getting into deeper and deeper trouble, and eventually
turn up at our advice surgeries, but we find it difficult to
give them adequate advice because of the difficulties in which they
find themselves.</div>
					<a name="07112319000255"><div class="hs_Para">That
happens also in court. It happens with people who have chaotic
lifestyles of one sort of another, or who have difficulties in their
personal circumstances, which can occasionally result in them not
appearing in court. It gives me cause for concern that those factors
may not be recognised by the court. It is also gives their
representative lawyers a problem because of the competing
responsibilities of the solicitor to his or her client and to the court
as an officer of the supreme court. They therefore have the
responsibility of ensuring that the trials take place in an appropriate
way. I would prefer, if possible, to avoid such conflicts of
interests.</div>
					<a name="07112319000256"><div class="hs_Para">Having said
that, the problem mentioned by the hon. Gentleman is a real one. Much
concern has been expressed in recent years over the way in which
bailiffs carry out their duties. Despite everyone&#146;s best
intentions, and despite guidance, it often seems that they carry out
their duties aggressively and inconsiderately and in a way that shows
little regard for the circumstances of the person upon whom they are
levying the distress warrant. We should be concerned about that. We
should be concerned about precisely the sort of people referred to by
the hon. Member for Leyton and Wanstead earlier, which is the principle
concern of the Zacchaeus 2000 Trust in its work with such
people.</div>
					<a name="07112319000257"><div class="hs_Para">We want some
sort of process of referral back or repechage, not to enable people to
evade their responsibilities to the court but to ensure that the
procedure takes cognisance of their situation and acts accordingly. We
do not want an escalation of costs or penalties; it is in no
one&#146;s interests if all we do is make a poor person poorer still,
or take away essential items from a household that is already deprived.
It is not a bleeding-heart liberal issue; it is about common humanity,
and not dealing badly, as is sometimes the case, with people who are
not able to look after themselves or who cannot even see what actions
on their part would be in their best interests. That, sadly, is too
often the case.</div>
					<a name="07112319000258"><div class="hs_Para">I
support the new clause, and I look forward with interest to the
Minister&#146;s
response.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112319000766">Mr.
Burrowes:
						</b> I commend the hon. Member for Leyton and
Wanstead on the intentions behind the new clause.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column491" />Column number: 491</div>
					<a name="07112319000260"><div class="hs_Para">I commend the Zacchaeus 2000
Trust on its tenacity and persistence and for Paul Nicolson&#146;s
concern for the vulnerable. In many ways, we are talking about
legislation, but organisations such as the Zacchaeus 2000 Trust are at
the sharp end, dealing with vulnerable people in a noble way. I wish to
commend Mr. Nicolson on bringing to our attention his
concerns about young people, especially those who, for instance, face
bailiffs at the door. It is a worrying situation for many, as they do
not know how to deal with such situations. However, they seek some
justice, to the extent that they want their inability to pay fines to
be brought to bear.</div>
					<a name="07112319000261"><div class="hs_Para">I
would like the Minister to respond to the legislative and practical
concerns at the heart of new clause 23 about the effectiveness and
teeth of the national standards for enforcement agents. Page 9 of the
national standards refers to the need for enforcement agents to
recognise their</div>
					<a name="07112319000630"><div class="hs_brev">&#147;role in
ensuring that the vulnerable and socially excluded are protected and
that the recovery process includes procedures agreed between the
agent/agency and creditor about how such situations should be dealt
with&#148;,</div>
					<a name="07112319000262"><div class="hs_Para">and emphasises the
need for an appropriate use of discretion when dealing with vulnerable
people.</div>
					<a name="07112319000263"><div class="hs_Para">I understand
that the Zacchaeus 2000 Trust and Ministers have debated the definition
of vulnerable people, and that concern was expressed about the
difficulty of defining vulnerable people during the passage of previous
legislation. Further concern was expressed about the need to give teeth
to the national standards during the passage of the Consumer Credit Act
2006 and the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007. Section 12(2)
of the Consumers, Estates and Redress Act 2007 provides a definition of
a vulnerable person, to which reference is made in the national
standards.</div>
					<a name="07112319000264"><div class="hs_Para">Will the
Minister assure the Committee that there will be proper and robust
enforcement of the national standards? From my experience as a
practitioner, and particularly as a duty solicitor, I know that in such
situations, there are ways to get the warrant withdrawn and to ensure
that true account is taken of the young person&#146;s means. That
often means that the fine is remitted to a level that can be paid. No
one is suggesting that that young person should be let off the fine,
just that it should be appropriate to their circumstances, and
certainly we should be able to deal with those situations when taking
enforcement action against absent defendants. It would be preferable if
we could enforce those national standards properly without additional
legislation. Will the Minister give the necessary assurance?</div>
					<a name="07112319000265"><div class="hs_Para">Clause 57 creates a presumption
that if a defendant fails to attend a trial in a magistrates court
without good cause, the magistrates will use their powers to try them
in their absence and sentence them if convicted. However, magistrates
have that discretionary power already, which they often use
appropriately and subject to existing case law, such as R <i class="I">v.
</i>DPP, in which the High Court emphasised that the discretionary
power to commence a trial in the absence of a defendant should be
exercised with the utmost care and caution. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column492" />Column number: 492</div>Furthermore, magistrates have an eye on article 6 of the European
convention on human rights, which ensures a fair trial.</div>
					<a name="07112319000266"><div class="hs_Para">Advocates might seek to
persuade magistrates to exercise their discretion with care and not to
proceed in the absence of a defendant, but often they exercise their
discretion and proceed anyway. In fact, it is now common practice,
whenever a trial date is fixed, to remind the defendant that if he does
not attend, the magistrates will proceed in his absence. Why is it
necessary, therefore, for this Bill to seek to enforce what is
happening already? By building in a presumption when there is good
cause, are we not getting close to infringing article 6? Has the
Minister satisfied herself that the clause complies with the article?
When magistrates are using their discretion on a case by case basis,
taking into account the circumstances of the defendant and any case
history, they are often in the best position to decide whether to
proceed in the absence of the defendant, without the need to create a
statutory presumption in that
favour.</div>
					<a name="07112319000267"><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112319000767">Maria
Eagle:
						</b> I begin by congratulating my hon. Friend the Member
for Leyton and Wanstead on introducing the new clause, and I will seek
to reassure him. Perhaps I should warn the Committee that 3.30 is my
worst time of the day, but we still have that to come. I join my hon.
Friend in congratulating the Zacchaeus 2000 Trust and the work that it
does. I do not think that there is an hon. Member, and certainly not a
solicitor, who has not come across the kind of vulnerability that we
are discussing out there in the world, in our advice surgeries, in
court or in forums where we seek to assist members of the public. I do
not think that there is disagreement between any members of the
Committee about the need to ensure that there are relevant protections
for vulnerable people in such circumstances. The issue is whether this
new clause is the best way of achieving that.</div>
					<a name="07112319000268"><div class="hs_Para">New clause 23 would force
magistrates, fines officers or clerks to magistrates to suspend,
pending a means inquiry, warrant enforcement procedures, reconsider how
the fine is being enforced and potentially re-sentence an offender
where the offender, or some other person present at the property where
a magistrates court warrant is being executed, may be vulnerable, as
defined by page 9 of the national standards for enforcement agents,
which
states:</div>
					<a name="07112319000631"><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Those
who might be potentially vulnerable include: the elderly; people with a
disability; the seriously ill; the recently bereaved; single parent
families; pregnant women; unemployed people; and, those who have
obvious difficulty in understanding, speaking or reading
English.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07112319000269"><div class="hs_Para">Later I will
say something about the national standards, but I want to set out for
the Committee why I do not think that the new clause is necessary in
order to provide that level of protection, although I do not comment on
individual cases that my hon. Friend may have been referring to and
which have been the subject of some correspondence.</div>
					<a name="07112319000270"><div class="hs_Para">There is a well-developed body
of law&#151;statute law, case law, practice directions and so
on&#151;in the magistrates courts that ensure that every
defendant&#146;s right is upheld, and that is certainly the
intention. Section 11 of the Magistrates&#146; Courts Act 1980 says
that the court may proceed in the absence of the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column493" />Column number: 493</div>accused. Guidance on proceeding in the absence of the defendant has been
given in the criminal consolidated practice direction of 2002. It
directs that the decision to proceed in the absence of the accused must
be exercised judicially, with proper regard to the principle that a
defendant is entitled to a fair trial; that must include a fair
opportunity to be present and/or be legally represented. However, the
principle that the defendant should have a fair opportunity to be
present does not amount to an unlimited opportunity. If it were to do
that, the defendant could indefinitely postpone the proceedings by not
turning up at the relevant time. The intention of the clause, on the
basis of an extremely long list of vulnerability, is to require the
court to reconsider, sometimes at length, what it is doing in any
particular case.</div>
					<a name="07112319000271"><div class="hs_Para">I do
not accept that that level of prescription is necessary. The court
always retains the right to take a judicial decision on how to proceed.
This can range, in appropriate cases, from withdrawing a warrant to
re-hearing the entire case. Cases can be returned to the court and
considered by the magistrates again if the situation warrants it, and
there may be individual circumstances in which that is the right way
forward. Enforcement officers can already be prevented from continuing
with the execution of a distress warrant by the withdrawal of the
warrant. The court&#146;s power to do that is discretionary and it
can be found in section 142(1) of the Magistrates&#146; Courts Act
1980, which
states:</div>
					<a name="07112319000632"><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
magistrates&#146; court may vary or rescind a sentence or other order
imposed or made by it when dealing with an offender if it appears to
the court to be in the interests of justice to do so; and it is hereby
declared that this power extends to replacing a sentence or order which
for any reason appears to be invalid by another which the court has
power to impose or
make.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07112319000272"><div class="hs_Para">That provides an
extremely wide discretion for the court to deal with individual
circumstances of the kind described by my hon. Friend and referred to
by Opposition
Members.</div>
					<a name="07112319000273"><div class="hs_Para">New clause 23
may give rise to a situation in which some people are able to benefit
from repeatedly not attending court. An offender could halt all
enforcement procedures by refusing to attend court. I know that that is
not my hon. Friend&#146;s or anyone else&#146;s intention. They
seek to protect those who are vulnerable, but I am arguing that
sufficient protections are in place. If the circumstances are not all
known at the time at which the original order is made, it is possible
for the court to revisit it in view of receiving correct
information.</div>
					<a name="07112319000274"><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Somerton and Frome in particular referred to the activities
of bailiffs. I remind the Committee that the Ministry of Justice is
consulting on the regulation of bailiffs, in conjunction with the Home
Office, to ensure that there is a regime which prevents the abuses that
sometimes take place, about which many members of the Committee will
have heard from their constituents, and which can be the real cause of
some of difficulties which have been referred to today. Responses to
the consultation are currently being considered, and, in due course, we
will release the outcome of that process and, hopefully, we will be
able to bring in a better regulatory regime for the activities of
bailiffs.</div>
					<a name="07112319000275"><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Enfield, Southgate raised the question of the ECHR
implications of the clause. I can 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column494" />Column number: 494</div>reassure the hon. Gentleman that my right hon. Friend the Minister of
State has certified the implications, in respect of the entire Bill. He
certainly would not have done so had he been of the view that those
matters were not
compliant.</div>
					<a name="07112319000276"><div class="hs_Para">In relation
to the clause stand part debate, it is quite right that the magistrates
currently have a discretion, which is used widely in some parts of the
country. However, it is not used uniformly and, in other areas, courts
have seemed especially reluctant to proceed in absence. That is why
putting a presumption in the legislation, with the appropriate
safeguards that I have set out, ought to level out that sort of uneven
activity.</div>
					<a name="07112319000277"><div class="hs_Para">My hon.
Friends might be further persuaded if I were to say that this is a
manifesto commitment. That might not help Opposition Members, but they
ought at least to acknowledge the fact that it is perfectly reasonable
for a Government to try to implement its manifesto
commitments.</div>
					<a name="07112319000278"><div class="hs_Para">With that
clinching argument, I support the clause but I ask my hon. Friend not
to press new clause
23.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112319000768">Harry
Cohen:
						</b> I am grateful for that clarification. I was not
sure whether it was I or the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome who
said that it is important that people should attend court, but I want
to make clear that that is my view. The courts should facilitate
attendance if the individuals are vulnerable, and they are still a long
way from doing so.</div>
					<a name="07112319000280"><div class="hs_Para">I
was also grateful for the Minister&#146;s assurance that such cases
can be returned to the court. I hope that that message will go out
clearly to the courts and that that will then happen in actuality. I
also hope that the courts, having that discretion, exercise it to
recall the warrant in cases involving vulnerable people. The

hope to see a good outcome from
that.</div>

Burrowes:
						</b> The clause is significant, dealing as it does
with matters of principle and application relating to how we view the
magistrates court and whether we wish it to have the independence and
provide the quality of justice that all parties involved in the justice
system&#151;be it the defendant, the prosecutor or the
victim&#151;would regard as important.</div>
					<a name="07112319000286"><div class="hs_Para">I would like
to begin by dealing with those who do not support the clause. First,
the Magistrates Association said in evidence to this Committee that it
strongly opposes the proposal, regarding it as a downgrading of the
magistrates court. The association understands that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column495" />Column number: 495</div>the Crown Prosecution Service does not favour the proposal, either. It
would be interesting to hear from the Minister whether that is the
case.</div>
					<a name="07112319000287"><div class="hs_Para">The concern is
that there will be an extension of the ability of non-legally qualified
staff to conduct trials in magistrates courts; proceedings in
magistrates courts in relation to certain offences that were previously
excluded from their remit, including serious cases triable on
indictment where the accused has elected to be tried by jury or where
the court has found that they should be tried by jury; applications for
preventative civil orders, and certain proceedings assigned to the
Director of Public Prosecutions by the Attorney-General under the
Prosecution of Offences Act
1985.</div>
					<a name="07112319000288"><div class="hs_Para">In essence, the
clause proposes that &#147;not guilty&#148; trials, including
trials for serious offences punishable by imprisonment, such as
assaults, public order, thefts, including shoplifting, and driving
offences, where defendants have chosen to be heard in front of the
magistrates court rather than the Crown court, should be conducted by
non-legally qualified Crown Prosecution Service staff. The effect of
this proposal will be to extend significantly the role of designated
caseworkers beyond the area in which they are currently
involved.</div>
					<a name="07112319000289"><div class="hs_Para">I concede
that there has already been an extension of the role of caseworkers.
The Narey report in 1997 recommended that</div>
					<a name="07112319000633"><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Non-lawyers employed by
the CPS should be able to present uncontested cases in magistrates
courts&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07112319000290"><div class="hs_Para">That
recommendation was followed through and we now see regularly in
magistrates courts caseworkers conducting straightforward, simple pleas
and other less serious matters. However, the clause seeks to extend
widely the ambit of those caseworkers. The concern is that that will
inevitably lead to a reduction in the legal input in criminal
proceedings. Trials of some serious offences could well be heard by lay
magistrates without a legally qualified representative for either the
defence or the prosecution.</div>
					<a name="07112319000291"><div class="hs_Para">The concern is that, given that
designated caseworkers are not necessarily solicitors, barristers or
legal executives, they are not subject to professional codes of
conduct, nor are they required to fulfil the important duties to the
court that those legal professionals fulfil. In addition, as officers
of the court, those professionals have that vital independence that the
designated caseworkers do not.</div>
					<a name="07112319000292"><div class="hs_Para">This is not a call for closed
shops for solicitors, barristers or legal executives themselves, and it
should not be seen in that light. It should be seen as an important
defence of the principle of high-quality justice in magistrates courts.
The caseworker&#146;s role was recognised as limited and restricted
by the Crown Prosecution Service in its annual report, and in debates
in this and another place during the passage of the Crime and Disorder
Act 1998. Then, Lord Meston reminded
peers:</div>
					<a name="07112319000634"><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Royal Commission report which led to the introduction of the Crown
Prosecution Service proposed that it should be set up in such a way as
to recognise the importance of independent legal expertise in the
decision to prosecute and to make the conduct of the prosecution the
responsibility of someone who is legally qualified.&#148;</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column496" />Column number: 496</div>
					<a name="07112319000293"><div class="hs_Para">He continued, and made the point
clearly:</div>
					<a name="07112319000635"><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
decision whether to commence or to continue criminal proceedings
involves considerable responsibility, with implications for defendants,
victims and the courts. Uncontested criminal proceedings in the
magistrates&#146; courts are not necessarily trivial or
straightforward...the liberty of the individual can be at
risk&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07112319000294"><div class="hs_Para">That is the
concern about the clause. We are dealing with the liberty of the
individual and with cases that victims want properly prosecuted, and
the concern is that justice is being short-changed.</div>
					<a name="07112319000295"><div class="hs_Para">The criticism, quite rightly,
is that the clause reveals a desire to get justice on the cheap. Where
is the evidence that we need the extension? It seems to be based on
financial reasons. The Government said that they intend to
achieve</div>
					<a name="07112319000636"><div class="hs_brev">&#147;maximum
flexibility to allow optimisation of staff deployment across the
courts&#148;,</div>
					<a name="07112319000296"><div class="hs_Para">and</div>
					<a name="07112319000297"><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to improve the case-building
process with lawyers focused on sensitive, complex
casework&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07112319000298"><div class="hs_Para">That is
management-speak. The Government talk about employment issues and the
organisation of staff deployment; there is nothing about justice, or
the importance of independent expertise when dealing with cases that
involve the liberty of the individual, or properly prosecuting
important cases for victims.</div>
					<a name="07112319000299"><div class="hs_Para">The measure seems to be a
cost-cutting exercise that will inevitably result in a loss of
confidence in the criminal justice system. There will be a greater risk
of error, which in this context could mean a poorly contested or
prosecuted case, to the detriment of victims and wider society. That
would have a profound impact. I say cost-cutting exercise but there is
no evidence of cost savings. It would be interesting to hear from the
Minister whether any such evidence exists, because the results of a
poorly prosecuted case could mean longer and more expensive trials in
which there is no legal expertise to deal with matters appropriately
and expeditiously. It might also lead to more appeals and increased
court and knock-on costs.</div>
					<a name="07112319000300"><div class="hs_Para">The concern is also about the
principle of equality of arms in the court process. The principle is
applied in the European convention on human rights, article 6, on fair
trials. Inherent in that is equality of arms when dealing with criminal
justice issues. The clause may result in inequality of arms, however,
with a defendant represented by a fully qualified barrister or
solicitor of great experience and expertise, while the Crown&#146;s
case, representing the victim but on behalf of the Crown, is
represented by a designated caseworker.</div>
					<a name="07112319000301"><div class="hs_Para">There are many fine designated
caseworkers. I know and see them in Enfield
magistrates court, and they do a fine job in Narey courts, proceeding
with less serious cases. However, when they have to decide whether to
continue with a prosecution, when there is complexity, or when there
are issues about bail, they must defer to a Crown Prosecution Service
lawyer who will reach a decision using their
expertise, their duties to the court and their training, which has been
gained not over weeks, but over years, to ensure that justice is
properly served.</div>
					<a name="07112319000302"><div class="hs_Para">I do not wish to bang the drum
on behalf of the Bar Council, the Law Society or the Institute of Legal
Executives. I do wish to bang the drum for the victim 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column497" />Column number: 497</div>sitting at the back of a court or a member of the public watching a
court process. If they see someone who is no doubt doing the best that
they can but find out that that person does not have the same
qualification or experience, and is at a different level of expertise
from the lawyer representing the defence, even if there is no
determination about the legal niceties of equality of arms, surely they
will feel that justice is not being done and that justice is going
cheap. The Minister needs to tell us why the provision is necessary,
referring not just to cost savings but to why it is needed as a matter
of principle, considering the liberty of the individual and the proper
prosecution of cases on behalf of the victim and
society.</div>
					<a name="07112319000303"><div class="hs_Para">Where
was the support in the consultation with interested organisations? The
Magistrates Association does not support it, and nor do the Law
Society, the Bar Council, ILEX or the Crown Prosecution Service. It is
important to find out. In <i class="I">The Times</i> on 16 July, it was noted
that the Director of Public Prosecutions
had</div>
					<a name="07112319000637"><div class="hs_brev">&#147;insisted that he
could not imagine any situation in which the case workers would be
entrusted to handle cases where a defendant might go to
jail.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07112319000304"><div class="hs_Para">That will now be a
reality. Has the DPP&#146;s view changed, and, if so,
why?</div>
					<a name="07112319000305"><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07112319000770">
							<b class="B">Mr.
Charles Walker</b> (Broxbourne) (Con): I, too, am concerned
about the downgrading of the legal and judicial system. There are many
good Crown Prosecution Service lawyers out there who do a fantastic job
on behalf of their clients, but I am afraid that there are also some
fairly poor ones who do not provide adequate representation in a court
of law. When they fail to do so, they deny victims the justice that
they deserve; they deny the families of someone who has been killed in
a road accident, for example, the closure that they deserve. I am
concerned about anything that will create greater imbalance.</div>
					<a name="07112319000306"><div class="hs_Para">Given that
there is already a weakness among some CPS lawyers, having people who
are not even legally trained representing families in magistrates
courts will present a host of problems. One of the main problems will
be that if there has been a road traffic accident, for example, there
will invariably be an imbalance in representation. The victim, or the
family of someone killed in an accident, will invariably be the
economically weaker party. They will be represented by the CPS or one
of these paralegals, whereas the driver of the lorry or car will be
represented by their insurance company, which will not want to pay out
on any conviction. It is incumbent on all politicians to ensure that we
do not have justice on the cheap and that we ensure that the victims of
tragedy and crime get the best representation that we can possibly
provide. The clause may deny them that representation and thereby deny
them the justice that they invariably
deserve.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112319000771">Mr.
Heath:
						</b> I do not want to repeat everything that has been
said adequately and fully by the hon. Members for Enfield, Southgate
and for Broxbourne, but I wish to express sympathy with their views. I
see the provision not as a trade union or closed shop matter, but as
something that affects the interests of justice in our courts
system.</div>
					<a name="07112319000308"><div class="hs_Para">It is
important that we ensure that all sides of a case&#151;both the
prosecution and the defence&#151;are properly represented in court.
There is at least a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column498" />Column number: 498</div>suspicion&#151;I would say a real doubt&#151;about whether that can
be the case if relatively unqualified people represent the prosecution
in an opposed case. Completely different questions apply in an
uncontested case, but in a contested case it is innately wrong that we
should put ourselves in such a position simply out of economic
expediency, which can be the only argument in favour of the
measure.</div>

						</b> I am well aware of the strong feelings that the
clause has excited, not just in the parties and in members of the
Committee but in those outside who made representations, not least the
legal profession, but also others. We heard evidence from the
Magistrates Association. I understand the concern that has been
expressed.</div>
					<a name="07112319000310"><div class="hs_Para">It may be
helpful if I set out what clause 58 does and does not
do, then deal with some of the points that have been raised. It amends
the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985 to remove certain statutory
exceptions that limit the types of cases and hearings in which Crown
Prosecution Service designated caseworkers may be the advocate. The
purpose of extending the designated caseworker remit is to enable them
to conduct a wider range of proceedings before the magistrates
courts&#151;including, as hon. Members said, in summary
trials.</div>
					<a name="07112319000311"><div class="hs_Para">There is no
doubt that a balance has to be struck between efficiency and
effectiveness in dealing with straightforward advocacy in the
magistrates courts and fully protecting the rights of victims who are
often represented by CPS lawyers and designated caseworkers&#151;a
point raised by hon. Members&#151;and ensuring that the CPS does as
effective a job as it can and obtains proper value for
taxpayers&#146; money. There is always a balance to be struck in such
matters, and there may be a slight disagreement about where that
balance ought to be struck.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112319000773">Mr.

						</b> In some cases prosecuted by the CPS, the family of
the victim may feel that the lawyer has not prosecuted the case
effectively or professionally. What options are open to the family to
raise their concerns with the Home Office or the
CPS?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112319000774">Maria

of the legal profession would say that often, particularly when a case
is lost, that clients are not happy with the advocacy in contested
trials, whether of a barrister, a solicitor or&#151;if the clause is
accepted&#151;a designated caseworker. However, the hon. Gentleman
will be aware that there is no such thing as a negligence claim in
respect of court advocacy. Qualified legal staff have professional
rules and obligations. That brings me back to the important point
raised by the hon. Member for Enfield, Southgate about
regulation.</div>
					<a name="07112319000314"><div class="hs_Para">Other
than making complaints, it is not possible to take negligence action
against an advocate for not putting a case well enough. Many of us who
have practised in the law have come across clients
who would have done that if it had been possible, because they were not
satisfied with what the barrister or solicitor had done, or with the
way in which the case was presented 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column499" />Column number: 499</div>or prepared. Of course, judicial proceedings are for the judge, and at
the end of the day they have to be accepted or
appealed.</div>

					<a name="07112319000317"><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Enfield, Southgate said that the CPS
and the DDP do not support change. I have a letter from the DDP dated 4
October to Sally Dickinson, the secretary of the Magistrates

said:</div>
					<a name="07112319000638"><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In
relation to Clause 58 of the Bill, you outline your opposition to the
proposal and state, &#145;We understand that the CPS does not favour
this&#146;. This assertion is not correct. The CPS and the previous
Attorney General have sought this legislative change and have worked
closely with the Ministry of Justice and Parliamentary Counsel in the
drafting of the clause. I hope that I have now clarified the point and
would ask that you amend your published response to reflect the CPS
position.&#148;</div>

clarification on behalf of the Magistrates Association. In some ways
that is a surprise. One would have imagined it to be toeing the line in
supporting the Bill. When the DPP wrote to <i class="I">The Times </i>to insist
that he could not imagine a situation in which caseworkers could be

							<a name="07112319000782">Maria

						</b> It certainly is so in respect of the current
proposal, where we are looking at contested trials within the
magistrates court jurisdiction, which includes penalties of up to six
months&#146; imprisonment. That certainly follows. It might help the
Committee if I just say a little about the intention in all of this.
The Committee may then agree or disagree on whether it is a good idea,
but it might illuminate the discussion if I set that
out.</div>
				
					<a name="07112319000325"><div class="hs_Para">The
intention of the Crown Prosecution Service is to adopt a gradualist
approach in deploying designated caseworkers to prosecute summary
trials. Indeed, the DPP will, through the exercise of his powers under
section 7A of the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985,
impose internal restrictions that will govern the nature of the trials
that designated caseworkers may be asked to undertake. I can also
assure the Committee that only those designated caseworkers who have
undergone an externally assessed training course will be permitted to
appear before the magistrates courts and prosecute
trials.</div>
					<a name="07112319000326"><div class="hs_Para">The clause
will also enable designated caseworkers to appear before the
magistrates court and have conduct of proceedings that relate to
offences that are indictable only. Such proceedings would include those
under section 6(2) of the Magistrates&#146; Courts Act 1980, which
are often referred to colloquially before the courts as &#147;paper
committals&#148; and are uncontested proceedings. The Committee may
appreciate that these are now, in essence, more an administrative
function but at present it is seen as a limitation that undermines the
effective and efficient deployment of designated
caseworkers.</div>
					<a name="07112319000327"><div class="hs_Para">Similarly,
the clause will enable designated caseworkers to appear before the
court for the administrative exercise of &#147;sending&#148; a
defendant for trial to the Crown court. These provisions under section
51 of the Crime and Disorder Act 1988 are, again, uncontested and
administrative in nature, and in the majority of instances this is not
an effective use of a Crown prosecutor. The clause would also build on
the experience of designated caseworkers who currently undertake bail
applications on summary and either-way offences by extending their
powers to include offences that are indictable only.</div>
					<a name="07112319000328"><div class="hs_Para">This amendment is necessary to
enable designated caseworkers to appear in committal proceedings and
&#147;sending&#148; proceedings where consideration of bail is a
prerequisite. The clause will also enable a designated caseworker to
undertake hearings that are referred to as &#147;preventative civil
orders&#148;. As the hon. Gentleman hon. Member for Enfield,
Southgate said, there are many ancillary civil orders that may now be
made by criminal courts, and not always where there is a criminal
conviction. These hearings take place either after the verdict of the
court has been announced, were the verdict to be &#147;not
guilty&#148;, or, when there is a conviction once sentence has been
passed. These hearings, such as those for antisocial behaviour orders
or those for restraining orders, are not classed as criminal
proceedings. They are, in fact, civil proceedings and at present a
designated caseworker may appear before magistrates courts only in
criminal
proceedings.</div>
					<a name="07112319000329"><div class="hs_Para">That is
the extent of the clause. There is also the relatively rare case in
which the clause will permit a designated caseworker to appear in
proceedings where there is a notice of transfer issue under either
section 4 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column501" />Column number: 501</div>of the Criminal Justice Act 1987 or section 53 of the Criminal Justice
Act 1991. These matters are ordinarily now a rarity before the courts,
but the clause would extend the power of designated caseworkers to
appear in respect of those matters, too. I wanted to get on the record
what the clause is
proposing.</div>

							<a name="07112319000809">Mr.
Burrowes:
						</b> I do not want to take up the Committee&#146;s
time for too long with the issue of legal aid. I should declare an
interest as a legal aid practitioner. I have three matters to address.
The intention behind the clauses is one to sign up to&#151;ensuring
that representation orders are put in place early, at the time of
investigation and before a formal charge has been
made.</div>
					<a name="07112319000365"><div class="hs_Para">My first question to the
Minister is whether clause 59 is concerned with saving costs by
ensuring that representation orders do not involve double-counting. At
the moment, claims are made for police station work and for work
undertaken in the courts. Where a case comes within a representation
order ambit, it then falls on a standard fee scale, which by
implication limits the costs concerning police station and court work.
Is that right, or is the clause concerned with ensuring that
representation orders are granted early to allow the administration of
justice to proceed
promptly?</div>
					<a name="07112319000366"><div class="hs_Para">My second
point relates to clause 60. I welcome it, as representation orders are
often blocked because information about passportable benefits does not
proceed quickly to the courts. I seek an assurance that the necessary
technology and administration exist for courts in England and Wales to
implement clause
60.</div>
					<a name="07112319000367"><div class="hs_Para">My third point
relates to clause 61 and the pilot programme. This Government are, in
many ways, addicted to pilots&#151;they occur in various areas, and
evaluations are eventually published. Although it is welcome that
before proceeding with changes to criminal defence funding, the
Government wish to test them with pilots, is it not more appropriate to
listen to practitioners about legal aid matters? One such area is means
testing. If the Government had listened carefully to
practitioners&#146; concerns about the problems that might flow from
an over-bureaucratic means-testing regime, there would not have been
the difficulties that ultimately needed to be dealt with by way of
additional directions and regulations to amend the legislation. I do
not object to pilots in any way, but they are not always needed if
there is proper consultation, such as with practitioners in the
criminal defence service.</div>
					<a name="07112319000368"><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112319000810">Maria
Eagle:
						</b> I hope that I can reassure the hon. Gentleman. The
purpose of clause 59 is primarily to speed cases up by granting
representation at an earlier stage in appropriate instances. Things can
move faster if a delay to enable the defence to obtain legal aid is
avoided.</div>
					<a name="07112319000369"><div class="hs_Para">Thought
needs to be given to the specific conditions that govern provisional
representation orders, including the possible triggers, the type of
work, the appropriate level of representation, the authority to
undertake such work, and the correct fee structure. Those matters have
not yet been decided on. An order might be particularly helpful in
certain types of case such as fraud cases, in which considerable work
has to be undertaken before charges can be brought. It might speed
cases through the court process, and that, rather than sneaking people
into existing fee structures, is the aim of the clause. It will
increase the defence&#146;s capacity to deal with the case by
ensuring earlier
representation.</div>
					<a name="07112319000370"><div class="hs_Para">The
information gateways are about trying to improve the existing
arrangements to ensure that the application process can highlight those
on passported 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column504" />Column number: 504</div>benefits swiftly and speedily. The intention is the same: to try to
speed court processes. There have been instances in which delay has
resulted from, for example, someone being remanded in custody without
knowing their national insurance number. Many people can remember their
national insurance number, but not everyone. That can cause delay that
would be avoided if the gateways work as we envisage. The gateways are
not rocket science. We are not inventing some entirely new way of doing
things, so they should be workable. Obviously, the relevant data
protection safeguards would be needed.</div>
					<a name="07112319000371"><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for Enfield,
Southgate said that the Government are addicted to pilots. That is
because we believe in evidence-based policy making rather than
prejudice-based policy making, or in hoping that what one thinks will
work will actually work in practice. It is after 3.30 in the afternoon
now, so I am waking up
again!</div>
					<a name="07112319000372"><div class="hs_Para">Clause 61 deals
simply with a slight problem in the existing power that allows for
pilots. We want to make it a bit clearer that pilots can be localised
rather than having to relate to the entire system. Pilots are about
learning the lessons more effectively by trying out policy change
first, instead of implementing it across the entire piece, crossing
one&#146;s fingers and hoping that it will work because one thinks
that it will. I hope that that reassures the hon. Gentleman and that he
is therefore content for the three clauses to stand part of the
Bill.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112319000811">Harry
Cohen:
						</b> The clause deals with compensation, and I should
like to make a few points on it. It will reduce the limitation period
for compensation for miscarriages of justice to two years and impose an
upper cost limit. I have some concerns about those measures.</div>
					<a name="07112319000378"><div class="hs_Para">A Ministry of Justice press
release equated compensation for the victims of miscarriages of justice
to compensation for victims of crime, as though they
were comparable or set against one another. However, in reality, there
are significant differences between the two. A victim of crime should
receive proper compensation, but the person who did it should bear the
cost. The state bears the cost, through the Criminal Injuries
Compensation Authority, but civil action can be taken against
perpetrators of crime, who may end up paying damages. The state deals
with miscarriages of justice, which is completely different. By the
way, the assertion in the press release was that if we reduce the
amount given to the victims of miscarriages of justice, we could
increase the amount given to victims of crime, which is not the case.
Without actually saying so, the press release implied that the victims
of miscarriages of justice are unworthy and that they are almost the
criminals.</div>

					<a name="07112319000380"><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112319000813">Harry
Cohen:
						</b> Yes. Whether that has resulted in the reduction of
the time limit to two years, or the opposite, it is not the right
approach in my opinion. Some victims of miscarriages of justice have
suffered terrible consequences&#151;some have had their lives ruined
or even foreshortened, so it is not right to compare them to the
victims of crime.</div>
					<a name="07112319000381"><div class="hs_Para">A
more appropriate comparison, which was made by
Liberty, would be with civil court processes for
damages claims. Those processes have a six-year period in which they
permit the bringing of civil actions, and it would be appropriate for
that to apply to the victims of miscarriages of justice. That view is
shared by Liberty.</div>
					<a name="07112319000382"><div class="hs_Para">I
am also concerned about the upper limit that will be imposed. In some
cases, especially the ones in which people&#146;s lives are badly
affected, there is a case for ensuring that the compensation reflects
the entirety of the damage caused. The actual amount could be quite a
low proportion of that, which would be a matter of concern. I wanted to
take the opportunity provided by a clause stand part debate to signal
my concerns about the
measures.</div>
				
					<a name="07112319000383"><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112319000814">Mr.
Heath:
						</b> The hon. Member for Leyton and Wanstead is
absolutely right to draw attention to his concerns about the clause. It
is preposterous to suggest that reducing the availability of
compensation for the victims of miscarriages of justice somehow
rebalances the scales between the victim and the perpetrators, which is
how the Government often like to portray it. We are not talking about
perpetrators when we talk about the victims of the miscarriages of
justice&#151;we are talking about victims of the state. Such people
are victims of the worst possible manifestation of state action short
of judicial execution; which is to say that they are deprived by the
state of their liberty without cause,
wrongly.</div>
					<a name="07112319000680"><div class="hs_Timeline">4
pm</div>
					<a name="07112319000384"><div class="hs_Para">It is entirely
inappropriate for there to be&#151;either in the Government&#146;s
mind or as presented to the public&#151;any linkage between the
unfortunate victims of crime and the unfortunate victims of a
miscarriage of justice through the courts. As the hon. Gentleman says,
absolutely correctly, no linkage exists in reality. We are not talking
about a common fund. The money does not come out of a fixed pot so that
in order to reduce the compensation available for miscarriages of
justice, the position of victims of crime must be enhanced&#151;that
is simply not the case.</div>
					<a name="07112319000385"><div class="hs_Para">I greatly deprecate the
reductions in the criminal injuries compensation fund. It is wrong that
we are so parsimonious in that respect. For heaven&#146;s sake, let
us not say that as a result of that we must also fail to compensate
people for depriving them of their liberty, which is what the
Government intend to do in this respect.</div>
					<a name="07112319000386"><div class="hs_Para">The courts have proper
discretion in the area, and that should not be limited in the way that
the Government suggest. What I said, sotto voce and from a sedentary
position when the hon. Gentleman was talking, is that there seems to be
an underlying view in the Government&#146;s proposals that someone
who is a victim of a miscarriage of justice is really a guilty party.
That person may have got out of prison, but they still 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column506" />Column number: 506</div>&#147;really did it, didn&#146;t they&#148;, and therefore they
are not worthy of proper compensation for the actions that the state
took in depriving them of their liberty. I do not accept that argument
for a moment. If somebody is innocent, they are
innocent&#151;&#151;both in the eyes of the law and in the eyes of
the Executive. The arrangements for their compensation should not be
attenuated to take account of some notional prejudice within the
system.</div>
					<a name="07112319000387"><div class="hs_Para">My argument
is simple. I do not think that we should have this artificial
limitation, as it would not reflect the genuine injustice that has been
perpetrated. If there is a deficiency in the criminal injuries
compensation scheme&#151;and I believe that there is&#151;we must
look at that. That is where we should concentrate proper resources, so
as to make it more effective in dealing with the victims of crime who
should undoubtedly be better compensated than they are currently in the
absence of proper reparation from the perpetrator.</div>
					<a name="07112319000388"><div class="hs_Para">Finally, I agree with the hon.
Gentleman that the right person to compensate a victim of crime is,
where possible, the criminal. However, we must accept that there are
instances in which that is not possible, and that is the role of the
state.</div>
					<a name="07112319000389"><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112319000815">Mr.
Burrowes:
						</b> I endorse the remarks of the hon. Members for
Leyton and Wanstead and for Somerton and Frome. My concern is to avoid
getting into a press-release type of debate&#151;that the clause is
all about rebalancing the criminal justice system agenda; plainly it is
not. That does not make sense. We are all concerned about the victim,
and we should all be concerned about justice. Justice shows its face in
various areas. We want justice for the victim and we want to ensure
that those who are found guilty are properly prosecuted and sentenced
appropriately.</div>
					<a name="07112319000390"><div class="hs_Para">None
of us supports miscarriages of justice. They do no good to the person
who is a victim of one, and furthermore, the victim of the offence
itself will not be assured that justice has been served by that
miscarriage of justice. It is wrong to use the clause to seek to equate
and bring into line those who have been the victims of miscarriages of
justice with other victims. For the Government to introduce this
legislation on the basis of bringing compensation for the wrongly
convicted into line with that for victims of crime, is the wrong
approach. We need some assurance from the Minister that that is not the
rationale behind the clause, but I doubt that we will be
convinced.</div>
					<a name="07112319000391"><div class="hs_Para">Presently,
there is no time limit for making an application for compensation in
respect of a miscarriage of justice, so applications can come before
the Secretary of State many years after the convictions have been
quashed. Why is that inappropriate, and why should there be a two-year
limit? Why has that period been chosen? Why has the Government set the
limit of &#163;500,000? Is it really about wanting to bring it into
line with claims made by victims of crime? Surely, that is not an
appropriate rationale. Surely, the position is that those who are the
victims of a miscarriage of justice should be looked at in their own
right. They will not be able to take any civil action, and that is why
there is good sense in the original, existing scheme, whereby the
assessment of damages for a miscarriage of justice is governed by the
assessment of damages for civil wrongs. The position was that
assessments sought to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column507" />Column number: 507</div>put the applicant back to the financial position in which they would
have been had the miscarriage of justice not occurred. That is the good
sense of the original and existing
provisions.</div>
					<a name="07112319000392"><div class="hs_Para">The
Government have sought to create an artificial barrier with regard to
the time limit and the amount to be paid out to try to justify that
&#147;rebalancing of justice&#148; exercise. That is wholly wrong.
The only agency that is in a position to right that wrong is the state,
which should certainly accept the responsibility to put the individuals
concerned back in their original position in reasonable terms. The cap
that has been put in place is wholly arbitrary, and there is no
justification for it. Indeed, the state has no justification for
escaping its responsibility to compensate the victims of the mistake.
Only the state is in a position to correct it, and that needs to be
done wholly and reasonably without any artificial
levels.</div>
					<a name="07112319000393"><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112319000816">Maria
Eagle:
						</b> Is the hon. Gentleman suggesting that we are
seeking to escape that obligation? We are not seeking to abolish the
statutory scheme, but to place limits with regard to time and overall
payout.</div>
					<a name="07112319000394"><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112319000817">Mr.
Burrowes:
						</b> I am saying that the state is evading its full
responsibility by not compensating the victims of
that mistake. It is seeking to impose this level of
&#163;500,000 across the board, regardless of the circumstances that
have allowed an individual to become the victim of a miscarriage of
justice, and evade the need to put them back into their previous
position. The clause challenges the Government about their whole view
of justice and the principle of justice. It is for the Government to
justify how they can rationalise those levels on their
responsibilities.</div>
					<a name="07112319000395"><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112319000818">Maria
Eagle:
						</b> Clause 62 makes important
amendments to section 133 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988, which
provides compensation for miscarriages of justice. As my hon. Friend
the Member for Leyton and Wanstead said, it introduces a time limit for
making an application and clarifies the position on eligibility for
compensation when a conviction has been quashed but a retrial is
pending. It changes the way that compensation is assessed and
introduces limits on the overall amounts of compensation payable and
the amount payable for lost earnings.</div>
					<a name="07112319000396"><div class="hs_Para">I do not for a moment argue
that those who suffer a miscarriage of justice are anything other than
victims, but a victim of a miscarriage of justice receives, on average,
50 times more compensation than a victim of a violent crime, and we do
not believe that that is right. Substantial compensation for
miscarriages of justice will still be payable in appropriate cases in
accordance with our international obligations. We are not seeking to
evade our obligations, but to place reasonable limits on the time and
the amount that can be paid out.</div>
					<a name="07112319000397"><div class="hs_Para">Section 133 of the 1988 Act
fulfils our international obligations to pay compensation. The
Secretary of State decides on eligibility and an independent assessor
then decides the amount to be paid as part of the statutory scheme. In
relation to that, the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome was slightly
wrong when he 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column508" />Column number: 508</div>said that the court should have discretion; it is a statutory scheme,
but an assessor makes the decision, rather than the court. Section 133
sets out some of the things that the assessor must take into account
when making an award. It is not exhaustive and has not been changes for
more than 10 years.</div>
					<a name="07112319000398"><div class="hs_Para">Hon. Members might remember
back to 19 April 2006, when the then Home Secretary, my right hon.
Friend the Member for Norwich, South (Mr. Clarke) announced
a number of immediate non-legislative changes to the compensation
schemes and signalled his intention to legislate in the terms set out
in the
clause.</div>
					<a name="07112319000399"><div class="hs_Para">Currently,
there is no time limit on making an application for compensation. That
brings the same problems as any assessment process that does not have
limitations. It means that sometimes applications are made many years
after a conviction has been reversed. That, in turn, has all the usual
problems associated with delay: papers and other important documents
might not be available, thus making it difficult to make proper and
fair decisions, beyond reasonable doubt, about whether there has been a
miscarriage of
justice.</div>
					<a name="07112319000400"><div class="hs_Para">The
clause introduces a two-year time limit for making an
application for compensation. The two-year period will run from the
date that the conviction is quashed or a pardon granted. It will not
run from the date of conviction, so there is no reason why it would put
the individual at any disadvantage that cannot be overcome. In
exceptional circumstances, an application made outside the two-year
limit may be regarded as having been made in time. Exceptional
circumstances in this context might include the physical or mental
incapacity of the applicant. Ignorance of the existence of the
compensation scheme would not be regarded as an exceptional
circumstance. The period of two years has been chosen because that is
the period for making a claim to the Criminal Injuries Compensation

limit.</div>

							<a name="07112319000819">Mr.
Burrowes:
						</b> I am grateful for that information on the reason
for the two-year limit, but it is not convincing. At present, there is
no time limit and the assessment of damages is done on the same terms
as a civil action. The fact remains that the victim of a miscarriage of
justice does not have recourse to civil action. In terms of time
limits, those for civil action would extend beyond two years. The
argument for a two-year limit is not
convincing.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112319000820">Maria
Eagle:
						</b> It is perfectly open for any individual who has
been the victim of a miscarriage of justice to bring civil claims if
they wish, but the statutory scheme is
separate.</div>
					<a name="07112319000403"><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112319000821">Mr.
Garnier:
						</b> Does the two-year limit start from the date of
the miscarriage or the date of the release of the individual from
prison?</div>
					<a name="07112319000404"><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112319000822">Maria
Eagle:
						</b> I thought that I said that, but I may have been
talking to myself. The two-year time limit runs from the date that the
conviction is quashed or a pardon granted, rather than from the date of
conviction. In that respect, we believe that it is a reasonable time
limit. It equates to the time that one has to make a claim to the
Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority if one is a victim of
crime.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column509" />Column number: 509</div>
					<a name="07112319000405"><div class="hs_Para">In approximately a third of the
cases in which a court of appeal quashes a conviction, a retrial is
ordered. At present, it is technically possible for an application for
compensation to be made pending a retrial. It is doubtful whether the
compensation would ever be payable because, pending a retrial, it would
not be possible to say that a miscarriage of justice had been
established beyond reasonable doubt. For the avoidance of doubt, the
clause will make it clear that an application for compensation can be
considered only when the issue of a retrial has been resolved. That
seems a sensible arrangement. The date on which the acquittal at
retrial occurs or on which the prosecution is formally not proceeded
with is the date when the time limit for making the application will
begin to run.</div>
					<a name="07112319000406"><div class="hs_Para">On
assessing the compensation, under the current provisions, the assessor
can take account of other properly secured and unquashed convictions
and reduce the non-pecuniary element of the award if he thinks it
appropriate. By the way, we hope that our assessor, Lord Brennan, is
recovering very well from his mishap the other day. Apparently, he has
asked for some work to be sent to him, so he is clearly not going to be
stopped by what happened. We all wish him well, although it sounds like
he is fighting fit
anyway.</div>
					<a name="07112319000407"><div class="hs_Para">The Bill will
enable the assessor to make deductions in respect of other convictions
or contributory conduct from the whole award, not just the pecuniary
element. Such cases where the award might be reduced include where the
applicant has unspent convictions or was drunk and provoked a fight
that subsequently led to an unsafe conviction. That is in line with the
way in which victims of crime have deductions made from compensation
awards in such
circumstances.</div>

					<a name="07112319000408"><div class="hs_Para">I want to deal
with the point made by Committee members about whether it is right to
limit awards of compensation in terms of time or overall pay-out by
referring to several cases that have been processed. I will not mention
any names and I do not want Committee members to think that I am
suggesting that all those who are properly compensated for miscarriages
of justice fall into the category of cases that I am about to set out.
It is absolutely clear that in some circumstances it is completely
right for people to be compensated up to the highest possible level
after convictions, but in some cases it is clearly wrong that people
can receive the level of compensation that has been
received.</div>
					<a name="07112319000409"><div class="hs_Para">Let us
consider, for example, a man convicted of a series of sexual offences
against children. Convictions for offences in relation to one of those
children were quashed on appeal, but all the other convictions stood.
He was awarded &#163;27,000, whereas the tariff award for a victim of

smuggling offences for which he was fined and ordered to pay
costs&#151;there was no term of imprisonment&#151;was 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column510" />Column number: 510</div>awarded more than &#163;2 million. Under the current scheme, a victim
of crime could receive no more than &#163;500,000, no matter what the
circumstances or the extent of the suffering that resulted from that
crime. There is the case of a man convicted of fraud offences whose
conviction was quashed after he had served seven months in prison.
Interim payments of more than &#163;500,000 have already been paid.

						</b> I am sorry that I disturbed the hon.
Lady&#146;s paeans of prose. Those are very interesting figures, but
they do not mean very much because we do not know anything about the
background to the cases. Let us take the case of the man who had been
wrongfully convicted of one of a number of sexual offences. We do not
know whether the compensation was for a lengthy period in prison in
relation to that offence. The other seven or eight or whatever it was
offences might have led to cautions or some other non-custodial
disposal.</div>
					<a name="07112319000415"><div class="hs_Para">In relation
to the customs offence, I think that the figure was something like
&#163;1 million for the wrongful conviction. We do not know what
damage was done to the man or woman&#146;s reputation or what loss
they suffered as a consequence of being arrested and convicted. They
could have lost their job. They might have been a hedge fund
millionaire doing quite nicely down the road when their career was
blighted for ever.</div>
					<a name="07112319000416"><div class="hs_Para">In
relation to the man convicted of sexual offences, we should bear it in
mind that it would have been perfectly possible not to compensate him
at all if all that he was seeking compensation for was loss of
reputation, because he does not have a reputation for being anything
other than a sex offender. The acquittal for one does not really
absolve him of the reputation for the others. There are all sorts of
practical solutions to deal with the hon. Lady&#146;s point without
doing what the Government

scheme&#151;but it is perfectly reasonable to balance those
requirements against what happens to victims of crime. All our

that. However, someone has recently been arrested for the murder of a
young girl many years 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column511" />Column number: 511</div>ago&#151;Lesley Molseed. A few years ago, gentleman called Stefan
Kiszko who matched the profile was fitted up by the police. He was a
simple chap and awkward. He spent 16 years in prison being violently
beaten for a crime that he did not commit. After 16 years, he was
released. Indeed, I understand that the Molseed family had started
campaigning for his release because they realised that the conviction
was unsafe. I do not understand how we can set an arbitrary limit of
&#163;500,000. Today, the money would not begin to compensate a man
for spending 16 years in prison, wrongly convicted of killing a child,
with the brutality that such a person would experience in prison and
the difficulties that he would experience after
release.</div>

one individual&#151;have taken advantage of the scheme as it is. I do
not suggest that they should not seek to do so, but the point is that
we not believe that the scheme is properly balanced, and that is what

the hon. Gentleman knows what I mean&#151;of how deserving an
individual is. However, it is perfectly legitimate, and within the
requirements of clause 133 and under our national obligations, to limit
compensation for victims of miscarriages of justice. We argue that it
is a proper limit, and that any comparisons that we make about how the

						</b> The amendment relates to a series of clauses that
increase the criminalisation of extreme pornography. I believe that the
general test in matters sexual should be consent. That does not apply
in every 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column513" />Column number: 513</div>case; where harm is done, an argument can be made that that overrides
consent. It should be the general rule, however.</div>
					<a name="07112319000456"><div class="hs_Para">I have no objection to the
clause in so far as it concerns acts that have actually taken place,
such as if extreme violence has in fact caused suffering, pain or
death. My difficulty is with the words &#147;appears to&#148;,
which appear throughout the clause, and which create too wide a gap.
They would criminalise people that should not be criminalised, and
would create injustice in a number of ways.</div>
					<a name="07112319000457"><div class="hs_Para">Let us be clear that the acts
that are the subject of the clause are unpleasant&#151;or appear to
be. I am sure that Committee members would not like them and that
neither would the overwhelming majority of members of the public.
However, there is a distinction between practices that are unpleasant
to a majority of people and those that are or should be made illegal.
That is why child pornography is illegal, and properly so, as well as
because consent is impossible in relation to it.</div>
					<a name="07112319000458"><div class="hs_Para">The clauses in this part of the
Bill, however, concern practices that in some cases are actually quite
well established between adults&#151;albeit they might be practised
in secret or in private. In preparing this speech, I had a choice about
whether to go into detail on some of the acts themselves, which the
Committee members might have liked on the basis that it would allow
them to analyse things. I think that the Committee will be delighted to
know that I decided not to do that. The other option was to cite
various quotations, and that is what I shall do.</div>
					<a name="07112319000459"><div class="hs_Para">The first quote is from our
esteemed friend the former Prime Minister. On 5 September 2006, he said
that:</div>
					<a name="07112319000639"><div class="hs_brev">&#147;there are areas in
which the State, or the community, no longer has a role or, if it does
have one, it is a role that is completely different. It is not for the
State to tell people that they cannot choose a different lifestyle, for
example in issues to do with
sexuality.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07112319000460"><div class="hs_Para">I think that
that is a very good quotation from my friend the former Prime Minister,
and we should take it on board.</div>
					<a name="07112319000461"><div class="hs_Para">Even more relevant is a
quotation from Mary Warnock, who has a lot of prestige as a great moral
thinker in this country, and a great record. In a recent article<i class="I">
</i>in <i class="I">The Observer</i>, she
wrote:</div>
					<a name="07112319000640"><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Men and
boys have enjoyed pornographic images for years, heterosexual and
homosexual, but that they feed their fantasies does not imply they will
turn them into reality. They may or may not, depending on, for example,
their wider social attitude towards women (or other men), their grasp
of reality, the strength of their moral convictions and their depth of
civilisation and dignity...Modern technology is capable of
creating a convincing account of something that never happened.
Enjoying an obscene story may be deplorable and show a sinister
imagination, even one that is deranged, but it ought not to constitute
a legal offence...The law must reflect this moral repugnance. But
it must also apply fairly, drawing distinctions between those who have
committed crimes and those who have been merely attracted towards them.
A man must show guilty intent before he can be convicted and there is a
difference between intention and
fantasy.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07112319000462"><div class="hs_Para">Her last point
was:</div>
					<a name="07112319000641"><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We should
not use the force of law against a man&#146;s thoughts, but only
against his
actions.&#148;</div>

					<a name="07112319000642"><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In
summary, the issues that arise from the proposal are as follows. The
proposal has the potential effect of criminalising a much larger number
of people than intended. Hundreds of thousands, if not millions,
currently engage in non-abusive consenting sexual activity in the UK.
It appears likely to particularly affect the lesbian, gay and bisexual
community.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07112319000464"><div class="hs_Para">Deborah Hyde goes on to
say:</div>
					<a name="07112319000643"><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
proposal will hamper efforts by responsible
organisations to educate people about safe and consensual
BDSM&#151;bondage, discipline, domination and submission and
sadomasochism&#151;practices. This could result in real harm. That is
people being injured or dying through accidents. Some will doubtless
find such material abhorrent or offensive. However, sending people to
prison on grounds of taste is not consistent with the values of a free
and fair society. Including people who look at or engage in non-abusive
consenting activities on the sexual offenders&#146; registers will
dilute its effectiveness.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07112319000465"><div class="hs_Para">She
adds:</div>
					<a name="07112319000644"><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
definition of extreme pornography is vague and, therefore, can only be
determined once brought to trial, so people will not know if they are
breaking the law at the point at which they view material. This makes
for unclear law and, therefore, bad law. The evidence to date does not
support the conclusion that such material encourages violent behaviour,
as the Government have noted. In fact, there is evidence that access to
pornography leads to falls in levels of violent
behaviour.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07112319000466"><div class="hs_Para">That
is obviously very controversial. She continues:</div>
					<a name="07112319000645"><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The breadth of the
proposal will make illegal the possession of a wide range of currently
legally published material, material that is not clearly illegal under
the Obscene Publications Act, criminalising large numbers of people who
have bought such material legally. The Government admit that the
proposal breaches articles 8 and 10 of the European Convention on Human
Rights. Their justifications are unlikely to meet the
convention&#146;s requirement for such
interference.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07112319000467"><div class="hs_Para">Deborah
Hyde goes
on:</div>
					<a name="07112319000468"><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Does this
material encourage violent or abusive behaviour? No. The Government
admitted in their consultation paper that the evidence does not support
this claim.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07112319000469"><div class="hs_Para">She then
adds:</div>
					<a name="07112319000470"><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It is
also worth noting that producers seem, in general, to employ actors on
a regular basis who reappear unharmed despite the serious injuries that
they have appeared to suffer previously, again demonstrating that no
real harm has taken place. There is a critical difference here from the
production of paedophile material, which cannot by definition involve
consent and is therefore always abusive. Isn&#146;t the material
already illegal to publish under the Obscene Publications
Act?&#148;</div>
					<a name="07112319000471"><div class="hs_Para">That is a point
the Minister made in our pre-hearing. Deborah Hyde said:</div>
					<a name="07112319000646"><div class="hs_brev">&#147;No. This is very
misleading. The OPA&#146;s conviction threshold is far more
demanding. The prosecution must show that material would deprave and
corrupt someone who saw it, whereas proposed legislation only requires
proof that the material depicts certain actions and is intended to
arouse. The lower threshold means the proposal would likely catch
material that would not be found illegal under the
OPA.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07112319000684"><div class="hs_Timeline">4.45
pm</div>
					<a name="07112319000472"><div class="hs_Para">Deborah Hyde
then asks what is the definition of extreme pornography and
notes:</div>
					<div class="hs_brev">&#147;It is unclear or subjective or
both.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07112319000473"><div class="hs_Para">Deborah Hyde asks
whether the Bill will affect only a small number, and states:</div>
					<a name="07112319000474"><div class="hs_brev">&#147;An estimated 10 per
cent. of the adult population have this orientation, up to 4 million
people. Various surveys have found 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column515" />Column number: 515</div>that a much higher percentage of people have at some time engaged in
some form of BDSM activity.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07112319000475"><div class="hs_Para">I do not know whether that is true, but
that is one category of people who will be
affected.</div>
					<a name="07112319000476"><div class="hs_Para">Goth
community material features depictions of death, vampirism and so on
that could easily be counted as pornographic under the proposed
definitions. People who own low-budget thrillers and horror films could
be included.</div>
					<a name="07112319000477"><div class="hs_Para">Deborah
Hyde states:</div>
					<a name="07112319000647"><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
legislation will particularly undermine the BDSM community which allows
individuals with similar interests to get together and offers advice
and education on consent and safe practice. Proper supervision and
education is crucial to preventing tragic accidents such as that which
befell Stephen Milligan, MP. Does it matter if more people are caught
by this proposal? Yes, it is a serious concern because it would swamp
the sexual offenders register and result in more convictions and more
police time
used.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07112319000478"><div class="hs_Para">Deborah
Hyde states:</div>
					<a name="07112319000479"><div class="hs_brev">&#147;On the
Government&#146;s own consultation, the Government cited 220
individuals against, 90 in favour; 18 organisations against, 53 in
favour, of which 21 were police forces.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07112319000480"><div class="hs_Para">So the majority actually were
against.</div>
					<a name="07112319000481"><div class="hs_Para">Deborah Hyde
states:</div>
					<a name="07112319000648"><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Much
has been made of the 50,000 who signed the petition organised by Martin
Salter and the Jane Longhurst
Trust.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07112319000482"><div class="hs_Para">But the scope of
that petition was much narrower than the current proposals. She says
that</div>
					<a name="07112319000649"><div class="hs_brev">&#147;signatories were
invited to oppose &#145;extreme internet sites promoting violence
against women in the name of sexual gratification&#146;. Anyone would
object to material &#145;promoting&#146; violence against women (as
would this
document).&#148;</div>
					<a name="07112319000483"><div class="hs_Para">But
comments in much of the press as well as responses to the proposal on
forums such as the BBC discussion boards suggest that most people do
not support the much broader prescriptions in the proposed legislation.
She concludes that sending people to prison on grounds of taste is not
consistent with the values of a free and fair
society.</div>
					<a name="07112319000484"><div class="hs_Para">I quoted
Liberty extensively earlier. It
states:</div>
					<a name="07112319000650"><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
regulation of pornographic images is an extremely emotive issue for
many people. Views range from those who believe possession of
pornography involving non consensual coercion should not be an offence
to those who consider that all pornography should be forbidden. Liberty
subscribes to neither of
these&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07112319000485"><div class="hs_Para">That is the bind
that the Minister finds herself in as well. There are all sorts of
views right across the
range.</div>
					<a name="07112319000486"><div class="hs_Para">Liberty goes on
to state:</div>
					<a name="07112319000651"><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
agree that legitimate and proportionate legal restrictions on
pornography, including criminal offences of possession, can be
justified in a democratic society... certain forms of pornography
should be a criminal
offence&#148;,</div>
					<a name="07112319000487"><div class="hs_Para">and, again,
child pornography is obviously
included.</div>
					<a name="07112319000488"><div class="hs_Para">Liberty
states:</div>
					<a name="07112319000652"><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
fact that many people find pornography morally offensive, damaging or
worthless is not a good reason in itself to outlaw possession. Extreme
caution should be exercised when new criminal laws are imposed with the
intention of imposing a subjective opinion of what is morally
acceptable.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07112319000489"><div class="hs_Para">Again, it
signals the point about what appears to be real creating
problems.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column516" />Column number: 516</div>
					<a name="07112319000490"><div class="hs_Para">Liberty states:</div>
					<a name="07112319000653"><div class="hs_brev">&#147;some pornography involves willing
participants suffering &#145;real&#146; injury through BDSM acts.
While there is a requirement that the injury be
&#145;serious&#146;, this is not defined. If
&#145;serious&#146; is equated with the level of injury covered by
the offence of Grievous Bodily Harm...it would cover non permanent
cuts and other relatively minor injuries. The fact that the offence
would also cover images that &#145;appear to be real&#146; makes it
even more problematic...the offence would appear to catch footage
which is no more &#145;real&#146; than the depiction of a violent
sexual assault or murder in a classified
film.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07112319000491"><div class="hs_Para">The next
person I want to quote is Yaman Akdeniz, who is a senior lecturer of
law at the school of law at the University Leeds. He complains about
the consultation, and that the Government inserted the clause just four
days after that consultation. He supports my amendment, and
says:</div>
					<a name="07112319000492"><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Just to
give a short example, it is not acceptable that one person could be
imprisoned for up to two years for having in possession a sexually
explicit image of someone looking dead, realistically pictured, but not
really dead. In such a scenario involving pseudo-necrophilia there is
no harm in the production or consumption of such
content&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07112319000493"><div class="hs_Para">He says that
the Government do not have such a compelling interest in criminalising
such content as they do in the case of child pornography. He states
that the Government&#146;s</div>
					<a name="07112319000654"><div class="hs_brev">&#147;decision to criminalise the
possession of extreme violent pornography is based solely on moral and
political grounds rather than on public safety. Private morality has
not been seen as a proper field for Government meddling since the time
of the Woolfenden report and that position was reiterated by the
Williams report in 1979. Aside from the reasons given in those reports,
the Government should respect the growing diversity in society and the
fact that there are wide differences in moral outlook and practices. So
long as they do not cause proven harm to others, the Government should
not
interfere.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07112319000494"><div class="hs_Para">I
could quote a legal opinion from a respected QC, Rabinder Singh, a
member of the Matrix chambers. I will not quote it because of the time,
but it covers many of the same points, and more, and it shows that
there will be a legal challenge if the Government push ahead with the
Bill.</div>
					<a name="07112319000495"><div class="hs_Para">I shall give one
last quote, which is on the same piece of paper as the quote from Tony
Blair, but this one is anonymous. I do not usually give anonymous
quotes, but it summarises the matter quite well. It comes from <i class="I">The
Guardian&#146;s </i>website, and
states:</div>
					<a name="07112319000655"><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Any
porn that involves harming or coercing anyone in its creation should be
illegal - but it already
is.</div>
					<a name="07112319000656"><div class="hs_brev">This is about
criminalising images in which no-one has been coerced or harmed in
their creation. We have the ludicrous situation where creating the
image could be entirely legal but viewing it gets you treated like a
paedophile.</div>
					<a name="07112319000657"><div class="hs_brev">I suspect
a lot of people are happy to see it banned not because it does any harm
(there's no evidence that it does) but because they think it's just a
bit horrible. Pretty much the same argument used to keep homosexuality
illegal for most of the 20th century, in
fact.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07112319000496"><div class="hs_Para">I think
I have made the
case.</div>
					<a name="07112319000497"><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112319000852">Mr.
Walker:
						</b> Thank you, Mr. O&#146;Hara, for
calling me to speak on this important part of the
Bill.</div>
					<a name="07112319000498"><div class="hs_Para">I am aware that
the clause was inserted after a campaign by Mrs. Liz
Longhurst, whose daughter was tragically and violently killed by a
deranged lunatic. I  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column517" />Column number: 517</div>am also aware that her Member of Parliament, the hon. Member for
Reading, West (Martin Salter) has been closely involved in the
campaign, and that 50,000 signatures were secured in support of the
clause. However, we are not in Parliament to legislate on the basis of
one tragic case, difficult as that is. On the whole that does not make
for good legislation but, as a parent, I am hugely sympathetic with the
Longhurst family in their
loss.</div>
					<a name="07112319000499"><div class="hs_Para">I have a number
of questions for the Minister, and I know that the clause is difficult
to navigate. If the Minister cannot answer my first question now, he
could do so when winding up. Why is extreme pornographic violence worse
than any other extreme violence? The Bill says that extreme
pornographic violence is</div>
					<a name="07112319000658"><div class="hs_brev">&#147;serious injury to a
person&#146;s anus, breasts or
genitals&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07112319000500"><div class="hs_Para">Why is that
more serious than vivid images of people having their eyes gouged out,
or their faces burned off by a blow torch in films on general release?
Those injuries are just as appalling and disgraceful as any injury to
the parts of the body which were previously mentioned.</div>
					<a name="07112319000501"><div class="hs_Para">The clause will create the
strange scenario in which it does not cover films on general release.
If one had a copy of a film on general release which contained extreme
acts of violence, one would not fall victim to breaking the law;
however, if one downloaded clips of that film on general release and
had them on one&#146;s PC, one could fall foul of the legislation and
be eligible for a significant period of detention in prison. That is a
contradiction.</div>
					<a name="07112319000502"><div class="hs_Para">I
raised those concerns on Second Reading, particularly in relation to a
film called &#147;Hostel 2&#148;. The director, a guy called Eli
Roth, took great exception to my observations and said that I was
trying to ban his film. Of course, I was not. I was just trying to
demonstrate the contradictions between his film, which is on general
release and shows periods of extreme torture, being granted an 18
certificate, and someone who had stills of that film on their computer,
which were deemed to be for pornographic purposes, who could spend five
years in prison. In defence of his film, Mr. Roth says that
I had it wrong, and that it showed only 30 or 40 minutes of extreme
violence&#151;just 30 or 40 minutes in an hour and a half.</div>
					<a name="07112319000503"><div class="hs_Para">I shall not continue a war of
words with Mr. Roth, because Tory MPs tend to come off
second best when they take on people in the media and the film world.
We are portrayed as fuddy-duddies, and that may apply even to Labour
Members. If Mr. Roth wants to make films about women being
graphically tortured, and if he wants to make films that break the
taboo of children being murdered, which his film does, that is fine by
me. I am sure that he can live with his conscience, and that he spends
his money how he wants. But I think that civilised, decent, honourable,
caring and compassionate people like us have the right to raise our
concerns without being shouted down.</div>
					<a name="07112319000504"><div class="hs_Para">There is a far too casual
approach in society to violence. We in this place should legitimately
debate violence and our approach to it, and perhaps return to the
discussion in a separate Bill entitled, &#147;Possession of Extreme
Violent Images&#148;. Let us be honest: in the media over the past
year, there have been several horrific cases of murder in which a
person has been 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column518" />Column number: 518</div>detained against their will by gangs or groups of people and brutally
tortured in ways that Mr. Roth&#146;s films depict very
graphically. There are huge similarities between the two. They were not
sexually tortured, but they were tortured in a vile and violent
way.</div>
					<a name="07112319000505"><div class="hs_Para">Therefore, as
Members, we should consider the issue in the round. I do not think that
pornographic torture is any better or worse than the extreme torture
that I have described, so I hope that we can reflect on this aspect of
the Bill, organise cross-party discussions about how we can introduce a
Bill that would set new parameters of acceptability in society, and
start to roll back the appalling levels of violence that we so often
see depicted in films and on
television.</div>
				
					<a name="07112319000506"><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112319000853">Mr.
Heath:
						</b> This is an extremely difficult aspect of the Bill,
not simply because of the subject matter, but because of the difficulty
of getting the law right. There are conflicting pressures on
legislators and the Executive, but there is also a great deal of
difficulty in constructing law that is effective against a real
mischief, but not effective against those who are entitled to the
liberty to conduct their life as they see fit, without the interference
of others.</div>
					<a name="07112319000685"><div class="hs_Timeline">5 pm</div>
					<a name="07112319000507"><div class="hs_Para">I am surprised that we are
returning to this subject so soon after the Sexual Offences Act 2003,
which was intended to consolidate previous legislation in this area.
That substantial Act dealt with and modernised several areas of law,
and our colleagues who considered the Bill&#151;indeed it was
considered by the entire House&#151;would have been aware of these
issues and must have felt that the Bill&#146;s measures were
sufficient.</div>
					<a name="07112319000508"><div class="hs_Para">As is
always the Liberal position on these matters, I have to ask whether
there is an argument for banning something that is currently legal,
however distasteful or inappropriate some might think it. If so, what
is that argument? I am finding it difficult to discern the argument for
the measures, which go beyond legislating against people coercing
individuals into an activity against their will. Clearly, that should
be and is an offence, particularly when children are involved. None of
us wants to see a case in which a child is coerced to do such things.
Neither do we want to see it with adults, and that is already
illegal.</div>
					<a name="07112319000509"><div class="hs_Para">If the
Government want to persuade us that the legislation is necessary, they
must establish a degree of causation between what is to be banned and
another illegal activity. The petition that has been mentioned was
constructed on the basis that there is a causal relationship between
such material and violence against women. Of course, anyone would be
against it if that level of causation could be shown, but the evidence
is extremely thin. If that causation exists, however, it must, as the
hon. Member for Broxbourne said, apply to other violent images; it
cannot be only violent images that are intended to produce sexual
arousal that are causative agents of violent acts. If the Government
were being consistent and believed that that causal link existed, they
would extend the provision beyond what they propose, but it is
difficult to establish that
causation.</div>
					<a name="07112319000510"><div class="hs_Para">It is also
difficult to establish that the measures will not have the consequence
of making illegal activities and images that are currently legal. That
might seem an 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column519" />Column number: 519</div>obvious point&#151;after all, why would one make a new offence if it
merely restated current offences&#151;but if that is the case, there
is a genuine concern among a significant number of people. I have no
idea what percentage of the population is interested in
sado-masochistic behaviour, bondage, submission and domination, but a
constituent of mine came to talk to me about this issue this summer
when I was on my village tour. He came up to me at an obscure little
village in my constituency, which I shall not name, and told me about
the company that he runs from a lock-up garage in the village, which
specialises in producing material for this kind of interest. It was
quite a surprise to me; I had no idea that that might be the case, but
he said that he had a lot of local customers, so there is obviously a
market.</div>
					<a name="07112319000511"><div class="hs_Para">That brings
me back to whether we are making something illegal for no sound reason
related to the causing of other offences, particularly violent
offences, and thereby depriving somebody of the liberty to do something
that we as a group and others outside may not like but which does not
constitute any problem for the rest of the community. My worry is that
we are.</div>
					<a name="07112319000512"><div class="hs_Para">Having said
that about the principle, there are also problems with the detail of
the clause and how it will work. I have mentioned the limitation to
violence in a sexual context rather than a general one, which is
puzzling. What is the argument for providing that images should be made
illegal but narrative should not, and that one cannot look at a picture
but can read a story portraying the same thing in a much more graphic
way&#151;literally, in this instance&#151;than a picture could? A
story will describe in the imagination of the consumer exactly what is
happening but will not be illegal or considered an obscene
publication.</div>
					<a name="07112319000513"><div class="hs_Para">Why are
we using the term &#147;pornographic&#148; in the clause rather
than basing the language on existing legislation? Why are we
introducing a new definition for the courts to decide on? A vagueness
runs through the entire clause, which is difficult to construe legally.
Much of it will have to be determined by a case being put before a
court. That, too, is a problem for those who may wonder, &#147;Is
what I am doing illegal? Are these pictures that I have in my
possession illegal? Should I destroy them as a consequence? Do they
have a sufficient level of realism for me to be concerned, or can
anybody see that they are staged?&#148; The problem is that, even if
they are not very real, they could fall foul of the clause. Even if we
know perfectly well that no coercion was involved, and a couple engaged
in activities of their own volition and by mutual consent, which they
filmed themselves doing and watched later, they will find
themselves falling foul of it. That cannot be the intention,
even if we accept the arguments for the clause. There are so many areas
of vagueness that will need further construction in the courts that we
should be wary of accepting the clause in its present
form.</div>
					<a name="07112319000514"><div class="hs_Para">We shall come to
defences later, and I do not wish to stray from the amendments, but we
must be careful not to create anything that approximates to an absolute
offence. Intent is important, and an individual&#146;s reasonable
belief that what he or she is looking at does not fall foul of the law
should be at the forefront of considerations.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column520" />Column number: 520</div>
					<a name="07112319000515"><div class="hs_Para">I understand why the Minister
has included the provisions, and I understand the perfectly proper
pressure from some, considering that there are egregious internet sites
and other places that promote violence against individuals. That
worries me, whether or not it is done in a sexual context. Promoting
violence against another individual is not what freedom of speech is
intended to allow. However, the wording of the clause swings the
pendulum too far the other way and will produce unexpected effects,
putting people in a position of offending that they had never intended
to be in, when they are not causing a problem to any other member of
the community. There are big issues of the context of material and we
ought to address those, too. I hope that the Minister will be able to
deal with some of those matters today. However, the architecture of the
provision as it stands simply cannot pass the tests that I am applying
to it to make it an effective piece of legislation dealing with a real
mischief, rather than a provision based on a view that something must
be done about something that we do not like, but we are not quite sure
what it is or what should be
done.</div>

a chance to contribute. I will be
brief.</div>
					<a name="07112319000517"><div class="hs_Para">I do not
support the amendments; I support the clause as originally drafted. I
want to make a couple of comments following up the remarks of the hon.
Member for Broxbourne, because the points that he made are important.
The clause deals with extreme pornographic images&#151;and
understandably so. However, there is a much wider concern in society
about the level of violence and the use of images to record violence,
with those pictures passed around for all kinds of purposes. One thinks
of happy-slapping pictures and pictures sent by e-mail and phone. There
is a general concern in society that that is
horrendous.</div>
					<a name="07112319000518"><div class="hs_Para">In an
extraordinary case in Northampton, a gang of girls attacked another
girl in a fast-food outlet. That was filmed and texted right round the
world very quickly and there was outrage at what had happened. That
picks up, as hon. Members have said, on an abhorrence at the level of
violence in our
society.</div>
					<a name="07112319000519"><div class="hs_Para">It is
appropriate that we talk about this matter in domestic violence week.
There is particular concern about attacks mostly on women, but also
between people in a relationship of trust, where it is perhaps least
expected. Although it is hard to legislate in this area, legislation
has to try to keep pace with public opinion and public opinion is
moving on violence and pictures of
violence.</div>
					<a name="07112319000520"><div class="hs_Para">One has only
to look at the debate on images of violence in a shop, which, if I
heard Radio 4 properly this morning, the Advertising Standards
Authority has taken action over because it found that one of the images
was unacceptable for public use in an advert. I cannot recall such a
debate having taking place previously about a picture showing a man
hitting a woman. It is interesting that people are talking about images
of violence and what is acceptable. There have been repeated attempts
to look at outlawing happy-slapping in some way. That is an indication
that public opinion is moving and, at some stage, we might have to look
at that.</div>
					<a name="07112319000521"><div class="hs_Para">Perhaps my
hon. Friend the Minister might deal with some of the issues that the
hon. Member for Broxbourne outlined.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112319000855">Mr.
Garnier:
						</b> I thank hon. Members for their remarks this
evening. There is evidently some difficulty, because what we are
discussing, in terms of the amendment and the clause, ought not to be
matters of personal opinion, but should be about how to alter the
criminal law to afford protection to the people who are depicted or who
may be victimised as a consequence of the making of a
film.</div>
					<a name="07112319000523"><div class="hs_Para">Part 6 is
interesting because it deals with extreme pornographic images,
prostitution, the protection of nuclear facilities and penalties for
breach of data protection, so it demonstrates the meccano-like nature
of the Bill, if ever it needed to be demonstrated. I will not argue
with any of the previous contributors about whether one should be free
or not free to look at extreme pornographic images. We have had rather
a dry discussion about whether clause 64 does the job that the
Government&#151;I assume&#151;think it will
do.</div>
					<a name="07112319000524"><div class="hs_Para">The first thing we
must bear in mind is that the offence is not the production or the
watching of extreme pornographic images, but their possession. That is
the offence set out in clause 64(1). Let us compare that with clause
64(3) where &#147;pornographic&#148; is defined. It
reads:</div>
					<a name="07112319000659"><div class="hs_brev">&#147;An
image is &#145;pornographic&#146; if it appears to have been
produced solely or principally for the purpose of sexual
arousal.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07112319000525"><div class="hs_Para">We will come on
to discuss in a minute the difficulties over the use of the expression
&#147;appears to have&#148; or &#147;appears to be&#148; which
is found throughout the clause. An image could have been produced in
identical form, but for different purposes. If I were to possess an
extreme pornographic image which had been produced solely or
principally for the purposes of sexual arousal, I would apparently be
guilty, but if I produced exactly the same image, but it was not
produced solely or principally for the purpose of sexual arousal, I
would not be guilty of an offence. That is the first
problem.</div>
					<a name="07112319000526"><div class="hs_Para">The second
problem is encapsulated by the points made by the hon. Member for
Leyton and Wanstead and is the subjective nature of the offence. To
whom must it have appeared to have been produced solely or principally
for the purposes of sexual arousal? Is it for the policemen or the vice
squad who do the raid to decide that, even though they are hardened
police officers who specialise in working in this area of criminal
activity and are completely immune to it? I believe that there is
department in New Scotland Yard where there are officers who spend
eight hour shifts looking at this sort of stuff. One would have a
different test if it was to be considered in the eyes of the
man on the Clapham omnibus to have been produced solely or principally
for the purposes of sexual arousal. There seems to be a problem that
needs to be sorted out in addition to the difference between possession
and production.</div>
					<a name="07112319000527"><div class="hs_Para">A
little later in the clause one gets to the point that my hon. Friend
the Member for Broxbourne raised in relation to the still and the
moving film. Whereas one might be caught by the clause, the other
probably is not. It strikes me, as one unpicks the clause, that it is
riven with uncertainties, which will make its enforcement difficult. It
will make its understanding by members of the public difficult and it
will bring the law into disrepute to some extent.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column522" />Column number: 522</div>
					<a name="07112319000528"><div class="hs_Para">I will not
have an argument now about whether article 10 of the European
convention on human rights is brought into play. I am sure that the
Secretary of State spent many hours considering the terms of clause 64
and article 10. I have to assume that because he has rubber stamped it
on the front of the Bill the provisions are compatible with the
convention rights. I am not so sure about that, but there we are. He
says it is and that is all we have to concern ourselves with for the
moment.</div>
					<a name="07112319000529"><div class="hs_Para">Finally, I
just want to attempt to give the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome
some comfort. Proceedings for an offence under this section may not be
instituted without the consent of the DPP. I hope that a sensible DPP,
faced with a charge under this clause as currently drafted, would say,
&#147;No.&#148; But we cannot guarantee
that.</div>

opinion.</div>
					<a name="07112319000534"><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Leyton and Wanstead has drawn our
attention to the criticisms of the subjectivity of the offences in
clause 64. However, if he does not mind, I shall not go through each of
his amendments&#151;I trust that the arguments relate all of
them.</div>
					<a name="07112319000535"><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112319000860">Maria
Eagle:
						</b> This is an interesting, if increasingly tetchy
debate. I hope that I can deal with some of the points raised. I shall
have to say something about clause 64 as a whole, despite the fact that
we are discussing the amendments tabled by my hon. Friend the Member
for Leyton and
Wanstead.</div>
					<a name="07112319000536"><div class="hs_Para">As the hon.
and learned Member for Harborough pointed out, clause 64 creates a new
offence of possession of extreme pornographic images. That is not an
attempt to change the law or to extend or reduce the scope of the
Obscene Publications Act 1959, but to create a new offence of
possession, which is a serious step to take, as has been pointed out by
a number of hon. Members&#151;it was the basis of the point made by
my hon. Friend the Member for Leyton and Wanstead.
</div>
					<a name="07112319000537"><div class="hs_Para">I
realise that criminalising such things is a serious
matter. However, we have taken that step after a long period of public
consultation and discussion and in response to concerns about the
increasing availability of the most disturbing types of violent and
abusive pornographic material, particularly on the internet. My hon.
Friend the Member for Northampton, North and the hon. Member for
Broxbourne raised issues relating to extreme violence. However, at the
moment, we are dealing with pornographic violence and abuse. I hear
what hon. Members have said and, as my hon. Friend 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column523" />Column number: 523</div>the Member for Leyton and Wanstead said, this debate is ongoing and
perhaps increasing interest is being shown in it. No doubt that will
continue; however, in the context of this Bill, I cannot say much more
about it.</div>
					<a name="07112319000538"><div class="hs_Para">We believe that hardly any of
the material being discussed is hosted in this country. Although the
publishers could be prosecuted under the 1959 Act, it originates abroad
and, therefore, those responsible are under another jurisdiction.
However, a gap has opened up because of the huge technological
developments over the last few years and in our ability to control such
material. My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister recently announced a
review looking at, among other things, how parents can protect their
children from exposure to potentially harmful material on the internet.
That is why we felt it necessary to take the serious step of
criminalising possession of such images.
</div>
					<a name="07112319000539"><div class="hs_Para">I accept that that is
a departure from the 1959 Act, which criminalises publication, but not
possession. However, we are trying to deal with a technological change
that means that publication takes place abroad&#151;beyond our
jurisdiction. Possession and downloading such images now equate to what
would have been publication many years ago without this
technology.</div>
					<a name="07112319000540"><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112319000861">Mr.
Walker:
						</b> On the point about such material originating
overseas, what can we do, if anything, to penalise companies that host
it on their websites, or search engines that allow people to access
them?</div>
					<a name="07112319000541"><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112319000862">Maria
Eagle:
						</b> There is a lot of activity going on, especially in
relation to material that is obviously illegal in this country under
the 1959 Act. However, there are always grey areas, which we cannot
solve. There is a range of arrangements with internet service providers
and website hosts to deal with material that clearly would fall foul of
domestic law, and there is a lot of co-operation in that regard. Most
internet service providers do not wish to be responsible for hosting
illegal material, but wish to be responsible purveyors of services to
the general public and to co-operate fully. They are, of course,
concerned about our effectively targeting them rather than the
producers or
publishers.</div>
					<a name="07112319000542"><div class="hs_Para">A balance
should be struck, but a lot of work goes on to try to ensure that
illegal material is not available. Much of that material comes in from
abroad and once it is taken down, it can be put up again fairly
quickly, partly because of the nature of the internet, which is almost
impossible to police with the degree of strictness that would be
necessary completely to prevent such material appearing and then
reappearing somewhere else if it is taken down. I am sure that many
hon. Members have had experience of organisations such as Redwatch. My
hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department will
know well how difficult it is to deal with unacceptable, illegal
material on the internet that incites violence, as he has been tackling
the issue.</div>
					<a name="07112319000543"><div class="hs_Para">The
provision is not aimed at extending the Obscene Publications Act 1959
in any way or at extending our basic law beyond creating the possession
offence, but it is necessary to create that as an offence because the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column524" />Column number: 524</div>technological changes are such that the 1959 Act cannot cope with the
current reality. We do not seek to change the law in respect of what is
obscene or pornographic, but we seek to enforce the current law. It is
important that hon. Members remember
that.</div>
					<a name="07112319000544"><div class="hs_Para">Introducing a
measure that has implications for personal freedoms will always raise
arguments about where the line should be drawn. We have set a high
threshold for the offence, focusing on material that we believe is
already illegal to publish. That is the point that I wish to make. It
does not mean that all other material that does not fall into those
categories is acceptable; people will have their own views about that,
but we seek to enforce current law in the context of new
technology.</div>
					<a name="07112319000545"><div class="hs_Para">In order
for the offence to be made out, the material will have to appear to
have been produced solely or principally for the purpose of sexual
arousal. Where an image forms part of a series of images, the question
whether it is pornographic will be determined by reference to the image
itself and the context in which it appears, so an image that is part of
a narrative, such as a mainstream or documentary film, may not be
pornographic if viewed as part of a series of images which do not
appear to be produced for the purpose of sexual
arousal.</div>
					<a name="07112319000546"><div class="hs_Para">

							<a name="07112319000863">Mr.

						</b> The hon. Lady is very kindly reading out the text

whether she can justify the use of the subjective clauses&#151;I use
the word in the grammatical rather than the statute sense&#151;such
as &#147;it appears to have been&#148;. We really need to know the
answer to that. With respect, we can see what the Bill says, we just

context of setting out the offence and explaining why we have come to
the view that we have. I have now probably forgotten what he was asking

					<a name="07112319000551"><div class="hs_Para">To move to the
substance of the amendments, whether the scenes
depicted in such images are real or not is an important matter. The
amendments would limit the scope of the offence to images that could be
proven to be real depictions of events that actually took place. Given
that most of such material is hosted and produced abroad, it would be
extremely difficult to prove that from this country. Indeed, the
amendments would probably make the offence so difficult to prove that
it would not be worth having it on the statute
book.</div>
					<a name="07112319000552"><div class="hs_Para">We are trying to deal with the
harm caused by the possession of extreme and abusive pornographic
images. Perhaps the point made by the hon. Member for Somerton and
Frome about causation and whether there is any harm is also important,
although I am not saying that everybody would accept it. There is
certainly controversy about causation&#151;whether there is any and
whether it can be proven. The Government held a rapid evidence
assessment across the piece addressing the issue on the basis of the
research that has been done. It supported</div>
					<a name="07112319000660"><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the existence of some harmful
effects from extreme pornography on some who access
it&#148;,</div>

					<a name="07112319000661"><div class="hs_brev">&#147;increased
risk of developing pro-rape attitudes, beliefs and behaviours and
committing sexual offences...Although this was also true of some
pornography which did not meet the extreme pornography
threshold&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07112319000554"><div class="hs_Para">Obviously,
there are grey areas. It is always difficult, as I think everybody
accepts, to be precise about where lines are drawn, but the
REA</div>
					<a name="07112319000662"><div class="hs_brev">&#147;showed that the
effects of extreme pornography were more serious...Men who are
predisposed to aggression, or have a history of sexual and other
aggression, were more susceptible to the influence of extreme
pornographic
material.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07112319000555"><div class="hs_Para">That is the
harm that the clause seeks to tackle. There is controversy about the
extent to which causation exists. It is difficult to draw lines. The
offence is one of possession, which we have not had before, but it
addresses some of the
concerns.</div>
					<a name="07112319000556"><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112319000868">Mr.
Walker:

am straying from the point slightly, but would the Government consider
having a proper look at what link exists between violent

focuses on the images and the effect that they may have on those who
view them. That is where the controversy about evidence and causation
come in, but we believe, based on what we know, that there is some link
and some evidence of harm in some people. Concern arises whether the
incident depicted in such an image is a real crime or behaviour, or is
convincingly staged, and whether it is consensual. The Obscene
Publications Act, which the offence is intended to underpin&#151;it
will bring up to date our capacity to enforce the existing law in the
face of changing technology&#151;is not limited in scope to material
depicting real events or non-consensual activity.</div>

extremely difficult. I shall not argue that we have necessarily got it
right. I am perfectly happy to reflect on any concerns that Members of
the Committee have raised and to see whether we can improve the wording
of the clause. Nevertheless, after a lot of effort, work and
consultation, we believe that these matters are of sufficient concern
to warrant legislation. On that basis, and on the basis of the
explanations that I have given in respect of the amendments that my

extremely difficult brief, one that she cannot satisfy, and that it is
difficult to frame legislation in this area that is right and proper

views that it is unlikely that everyone will see any such legislation

concerned about the threshold that the Minister referred to. How is a
person to know what that threshold is? I do not think that there is
clarity about the threshold. It will affect adults, even adults whose
behaviour is consensual. I understand her point about the words,
&#147;appears to&#148;. As these images are hosted abroad, removing
those words could almost render the clause ineffective. The way to deal
with that problem is to put pressure on the internet service providers.
Greater emphasis should have been placed on doing that than on creating
legislation that could be much more of a catch-all. However, I welcome
the Minister&#146;s commitment to look at the clause again in the

to urge the Minister to do something really quite radical, either on

am back on my feet again very quickly. In a way, this is much the same
debate, but my amendment sets out issues that should not be caught up
under the clause. It was also suggested by Backlash, but I shall not
repeat its arguments. I have received a paper from Equity, which
stated:</div>
					<a name="07112319000663"><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Equity&#146;s
remit on this issue is limited to areas where the proposed changes may
impact on the work of our members in the entertainment
industry.</div>
					<a name="07112319000664"><div class="hs_brev">Specifically
we are concerned that the current wording of clauses 64 and 65 could
have the impact of criminalising the possession of extracts of
mainstream certified films featuring our
members.</div>
					<a name="07112319000665"><div class="hs_brev">This is due
to the combination of a subjective judgement of whether the images
&#145;appears to&#146; have been produced for sexual
arousal...whether it &#145;appears to&#146; be an extreme
image...and that extracts from classified films are not
excluded...As members of the Standing Committee on the Bill have
already been informed, even clips from mainstream films such as
<i class="I">Casino Royale</i> could become illegal if possessed and distributed
in isolation. Therefore, while not wishing to dilute the intention of
this proposal, Equity would be keen to ensure that the work of our
members was not criminalised in this
way.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07112319000573"><div class="hs_Para">I shall
not repeat the other arguments that have been expressed.
Equity&#146;s point is that people performing legitimately should not
be
criminalised.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112319000876">Harry
Cohen:
						</b> Well, we have had such a debate before, and there
is a host of inconsistencies not least in the dreadful Longhurst case
when the man was murderously deranged. He could easily have picked up
committing such acts from watching classified horror 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column528" />Column number: 528</div>films, which are 10 a penny all over the place. In a way, that is the
point that the hon. Gentleman is making. Yet it is not covered by the
Bill, so there is a problem. Moreover, such films are legitimate
entertainment for the majority of people, more than 99 per cent. of
whom would not copy any of the acts that they had seen performed. There
are inconsistencies in the way in which issues have been dealt with
under the Bill, but we have had that debate. I do not want to reiterate
it. Such a point was well made by Liberty, too, in some of its
representations. It said that some classified films and images could be
caught.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112319000877">Maria
Eagle:
						</b> The purpose of the amendment tabled by my hon.
Friend the Member for Leyton and Wanstead is to exclude from the scope
of the possession offence extreme pornographic images that depict
participants who have all consented to the production of the image;
extreme pornographic images, the production of which is fictional or
staged; and extreme pornographic images that have been produced for
educational
purposes.</div>
					<a name="07112319000577"><div class="hs_Para">On the face
of it, particularly in view of my hon. Friend&#146;s earlier
amendments, I understand what he is proposing. However, his amendment
is problematic. As for fictional or staged acts under paragraph (b) of
the amendment, there is considerable overlap with the amendments to
clause 64 that we have already dealt with. The effect of the amendment
would be to exclude from the offence an image that did not depict a
real event. As I have explained, whether the events depicted are real
is not, in the context of the offence that we have established under
clause 64, the most important issue. That also applies to the
amendments.</div>
					<a name="07112319000688"><div class="hs_Timeline">5.45
pm</div>
					<a name="07112319000578"><div class="hs_Para">As for consent,
to which reference is made under paragraphs (a) and (b) of the
amendment, but most pertinent under paragraph (a), when the events
will, by implication, be real, where an image reaches the thresholds to
which I have referred in respect of its pornographic, extreme and
convincing nature, we consider that it is right that it is caught by
the offence, notwithstanding any consent on the part of the
participants. Again, the offence is about the impact of the images, not
the circumstances of their production. The impact of an image is not
affected by whether the participants consented or whether the events
depicted are real. The capacity for transmission of an image is not
affected by whether it is real or whether there was consent. It is for
those reasons that the Government do not consider that those things
should be elements of the offence. The proposals concern material that
we believe would already be illegal to publish and distribute in the UK
under the Obscene Publications Act. That Act is not limited, as I said,
to material that depicts real events or non-consensual
activities.</div>
					<a name="07112319000579"><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph (c)
of the amendment concerns educational material. Some groups produce
material for educational purposes so that information about sexual
activities that carry a risk of harm can be given in such a way as to
enable those activities to be carried out safely. But the proposals
cover images that meet the thresholds in terms of their pornographic
extreme and convincing nature. It ought to be possible to produce
educational material without breeching those thresholds. The thresholds

<div class="Column"><a name="Column529" />Column number: 529</div>are high, although I appreciate that the offence that we are creating is
an offence of possession. I appreciate the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
concerns, but I do not believe that we can accept the
amendment.</div>
				
					<a name="07112319000580"><div class="hs_Para">A point was made about how an
image can fall foul of the offence in one context but
not, say, if it appears in the middle of a film. Because of how we are
defining the measure, the purposes for which the image is produced are
significant. An image that is principally produced for sexual arousal
would clearly and squarely fall within the offence. The scene in
&#147;Casino Royale&#148;, which I have had described to
me&#151;<i class="I">[</i>
						<i class="I">Interruption.</i>
						<i class="I">]</i> I should get out more;
almost everybody else has seen it. There is no way, in the context of
that movie, that the scene was produced principally or solely for the
purpose of sexual arousal. I say that on the basis of the definitions
that we currently have. I am not saying that I do not understand why
those who criticise the definitions in the Bill will stand up and say,
&#147;How can it be? How can it be caught in this context and not in
another&#151;that&#146;s not sensible?&#148;, but the offence is
to do with context. On that basis, I hope that my hon. Friend will
withdraw the amendment, and I commend clause 65 to the
Committee.</div>

do&#151;that she would not consider a further defence: that the
person in question reasonably believed that no one portrayed in the
image was made to act against his or her will? That was the nature of
the amendment tabled by me and the hon. Member for Leyton and Wanstead,
which unfortunately, was tabled too late to be selected for debate. We
nevertheless feel that it is worth asking the Minister to

Liberty has made the point that the burden of proof is unfairly on the

Liberty argues that the burden of proof should be placed on the
prosecution as far as possible, as is the case in the normal run of
things for all sorts of offences. When my hon. Friend the Minister
looks at this matter again, will she consider that
point?</div>

Garnier:
						</b> Before the hon. Gentleman intervened, I was going
to ask the Minister what the Government meant by having a legitimate
reason. Surely&#151;this feeds into the point that the he
made&#151;it is for the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column530" />Column number: 530</div>prosecution to prove that the possessor of the image had no legitimate
reason to possess it. That is the guts of the offence&#151;the
unlawful possession of an extreme pornographic
image.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112319000882">Maria
Eagle:
						</b> I will answer the latter point first. The hon. and
learned Gentleman thought up one answer already when
he referred to police officers in rooms looking at this material in the
course of their job, with quite legitimate reasons to do so. That would
be one example, and there may be others, but certainly there will be
some people who need to look at this material for the purposes of law
enforcement. There may be others who work for ISPs who operate filter
systems that block this material coming from servers into their ISP,
who also would have legitimate reasons for being in possession of such
material. It is that kind of possession that we are seeking to deal
with in the clause.</div>
					<a name="07112319000589"><div class="hs_Para">The clause sets out defences
for a person charged with the offence of possession. It is not the
intention of the Government to penalise people who may stumble across
the material when using the internet or who have it sent to them
without their consent, or to penalise those who need to possess it for
a legitimate reason. The defences mirror arrangements that already
exist for those charged in respect of the possession of indecent
photographs of children under the Criminal Justice Act 1988.</div>
					<a name="07112319000590"><div class="hs_Para">On the points made by my hon.
Friend the Member for Leyton and Wanstead and the hon. Member for
Somerton and Frome&#151;the relevant amendments tabled in their names
were not called&#151;I think that they both know the answer to those
points, because we dealt with them in considering previous clauses.
Providing the defence that the image was made by consenting couples or
groups does not deal with the fact that we are trying to catch the harm
caused by the images themselves and their impact on those who view
them, rather than the impact on the participants, whether they
participated because they wished to or because they were forced to. On
that basis, I hope that the Committee will accept clause
66.</div>

the well-known case of Stephane Perrin, he was sentenced to 30 months

reserved for crimes such as manslaughter, violent assault and drug

make illegal the possession of a limited range of extreme pornographic
material illegal. The maximum custodial sentence in that case is three
years&#146; imprisonment. The Government are determined to act
against publishers and distributors of such material where we can. That
is a more serious offence than possession, so there needs to be a
consistency in sentencing. I hope that that explanation satisfies my
