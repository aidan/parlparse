<P>
<B>Mr. Graham Allen </B>(Nottingham, North): I beg to move,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>That the Committee, at its rising on Tuesday 20th June, do adjourn till Thursday 22nd June at One o'clock.<P>

<P>
The sittings motion has been tabled merely to accommodate Treasury parliamentary questions in the House on Thursday. For the convenience of members of the Committee, we shall meet from 1 o'clock until 3.30 pm, adjourn for a break and return at 4.30 pm.

<P>
<B>Mr. Oliver Letwin </B>(West Dorset): I do not take deep issue with the amendment, but it should not have been on the selection list for discussion this morning, nor should the subsequent amendments. We should have been debating the details of the all-important changes to double taxation relief that we shall discuss later in our proceedings in the schedule stand part debate. However, such matters have been remitted to a later date. That is wholly unfair and we hope that, when we reach the stand part debate, the Paymaster General will give us a clear exposition of what is in the Government's mind, so that we can approach the matter with vigour.
<P>
Apart from one or two minor points, we do not have great objections to the amendments. Indeed, on the whole we welcome them. We want to proceed at a brisk pace to allow the Committee to have maximum time for a structured but detailed debate on schedule 30 itself.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick St. Aubyn </B>(Guildford): I support my hon. Friend. Along with many Back-Bench members of the Committee, I have barely had a chance to study the Government amendments to the schedule. The Government have said that they will have to revise the schedule on Report, so why are they trying to steamroller through the amendments today? Would it not have been better to defer consideration of the schedule until they had got their act together, before the matter was discussed on Report?
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory </B>(Wells): I support my hon. Friends, and their call for the issue to be withdrawn for further consultation and discussion, so that more time can be taken to put together a proper package. We have recently been expected to digest many technical amendments. We know from earlier efforts by the Government to legislate in such a complex area that they have got it wrong. They have not understood it, but they have blundered ahead in the face of outside criticism. They could well be doing the same with the amendments, which have not been properly exposed to the accountancy profession. It is not in good order for the Committee to proceed with detailed consideration of a complex matter. We hope to discuss the principle of the changes when we debate whether the schedule be included in the Bill, if you will allow us, Mr. Cook. However, before the Government amendments are debated or accepted, it would be in order for the Government to apologise for their treatment of the business community.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin) and I raised the issue during the week that followed the Budget on 21 March, and were told that there had been consultation on the package of reforms. It turned out that the Inland Revenue had consulted on a different set of proposals. The business world thought that it had reached an accommodation with the Inland Revenue, but the Treasury overturned that and brought in a separate and radical set of proposals governing the control of foreign companies and double taxation relief. We then heard that the proposals had been made in the Treasury by a political adviser who clearly had more enthusiasm than sense.
<P>
The Treasury made that ignorance worse by compounding it with a refusal to admit that a mistake had been made. Ignorance turned into arrogance. The Confederation of British Industry, the Institute of Directors and the major accountancy firms said that the Government were making a mistake. On Second Reading, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury went so far as to say:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The changes have been widely welcomed.—[Official Report, 17 April 2000; Vol. 348, c.719.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That was flatly untrue. He was asked by whom, and the only group that he could come up with was Labour Back Benchers. That is not Government consultation; it is government by decree. Finally, the Government have admitted that they made a mistake.
<P>
As well as apologising generally, they ought to apologise for insulting Mr. Peter Wyman, a distinguished accountant who will be president of my professional body, the Institute of Chartered Accountants. The Chief Secretary sought to dismiss his concerns and gratuitously suggested that he was a former tax adviser to Neil Hamilton. The truth is that Mr. Wyman voluntarily gave his time in the deregulation task force set up by the previous Government. It would be a courtesy if the Paymaster General apologised on behalf of her right hon. Friend and the Government for the way in which they handled the entire matter, before we came to technical consideration of the matters before the Committee.
<P>
<B>The Paymaster General (Dawn Primarolo):</B> It sounds as though it is going to be a long day. I sincerely hope that all hon. Gentlemen who speak in Committee today will remember to declare their interests, so that we are aware at all times where their interests lie.
<P>
I shall respond to the points made by the hon. Member for West Dorset about the drafting change in amendment No. 369. I concur with his view about the need for a substantive debate—[Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I sense a change in atmosphere today, for which I am not ready. If the sotto voce asides transmitted across the Room continue, I shall be less than pleased. We must pay attention to the points at hand. I have been tolerant so far, but the discussion has been well removed from the amendment. I am anxious to remove any resentment that may have arisen over the weekend. Let us cut out the nonsense and get on with the business in hand.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> The hon. Member for West Dorset asked you to look favourably on a schedule stand part debate, Mr. Cook. I concur with his views, as I know that Opposition Members want to make several points about a particular aspect of the schedule.
<P>
I should like to put the debate back in focus. Two years ago, on Budget day, the Chancellor announced an Inland Revenue review of double taxation relief for companies. As a result of that review, companies made representations about several aspects. All the amendments relate to those representations. I shall put aside the use of offshore mixer companies, as that will form a substantive part of the discussion of the hon. Member for West Dorset in the schedule stand part debate.
<P>
The amendments deal with several issues. With the exception of offshore mixing, the schedule deals with precisely the issues with which companies said during the consultation—which went very well—that they wanted us to deal. Consultation has continued since the publication of the Bill, and the amendments represent the helpful and constructive comments made about the technical detail of the wording of the schedule—excluding offshore mixing, which is slightly more contentious.
<P>
Amendment No. 369 simply corrects a cross-reference from the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 to the proposed provision. I am grateful to those who suggested this straightforward correction to a highly complex schedule. I do not believe that any further explanation is necessary, and I hope that the Committee will agree to the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howard Flight </B>(Arundel and South Downs): How the Paymaster General describes amendment No. 369—as correcting a drafting error—is not how the board of Inland Revenue briefing note describes it. Is she muddling it with amendment No. 370, or is the briefing note on Government amendment No. 369 misworded?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I cannot answer that question. Amendment No. 369 relates to schedule 19 to the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988, some of the provisions of which are being retained. The amendment corrects a cross-reference from that Act to the proposed provision. As the hon. Gentleman will find, Government amendment No. 370 is also a drafting correction, which may be how confusion has arisen.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Does the amendment introduce a change? The note states that it extends credit relief for foreign tax to all businesses outside the United Kingdom with branches or agencies in the UK.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> It will not change the meaning of the provision to which the hon. Gentleman refers. It merely corrects a drafting error. I shall try to take this as slowly as I can so that I can keep up with the complexity. I know that the hon. Gentlemen have several questions. However, the amendment does not change the meaning but merely corrects a cross-reference; the paragraph is as it was intended to be.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I do not want to dwell long on the amendments. It is clearly right that, when tax treaties do not provide for reliefs that we want companies to be able to go on claiming, there should be some provision for unilateral relief. I believe that that is the welcome effect of the amendments. However, the amendment does not cure the entire problem and a further amendment may be needed on Report. If not, the problem may be discussed again next year or the one after, because it will not occur immediately but over a period of time. Tax rules do not change in the United Kingdom alone. Other jurisdictions, alas, also have democracies, Parliaments and Governments.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> Alas?
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I did not mean that it was unfortunate that other countries had democracies, for which we should be grateful, but that as a consequence they change their tax rules. A body of highly conscientious United Kingdom officials, following industry representations, track down the effects of those changes on our companies. That process results—often some years later—in revisions to tax treaties. A tax treaty takes a long time to revise and conclude, so it may not catch up with the changes in other jurisdictions, with the result that it may be necessary to allow for unilateral relief. I am not saying that there should be a blanket provision to that effect, but it may be necessary in particular cases.
<P>
The amendment has no mechanism for dealing with that; it deals with the unfortunate effects of the discrepancy between past tax treaties and those for which we aim. However, it does not deal with subsequent adjustments in other tax jurisdictions that have not been addressed in subsequent treaties. That is my first point. It provides a reason not for rejecting the amendment, but for the Treasury to consider some robust technical means of dealing with the problem. That consideration may take some time, as the problem will not occur immediately.
<P>
My second point goes deeper, so deep that it is not easy for anyone—even for me—to grasp its full practical effects.
<P>
<B>Mr. Barry Gardiner </B>(Brent, North): The hon. Gentleman is too shallow.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Perhaps, as the hon. Gentleman says from a sedentary position, I am too shallow.
<P>
There is an ancient principle that you, Mr. Cook, and we in the Committee and the House as a whole are here to defend above all, which is that Parliament raises taxes and gives the Executive money. There was an ancient dispute, well known to all of us, that centred on the question whether the Royal prerogative could be used to raise taxes. That dispute led to poor old Mr. Prynne losing his ears. The Paymaster General is covering her ears, which I would certainly not want her to lose—far be it from me.
<P>
Strangely, and unintentionally, the provision under discussion is a reassertion of the principle that the royal prerogative can be used as a taxing power. I am sure that that was not part of the Treasury's purpose, although, if one thinks through the logic, that is how it works. By concluding a new tax treaty, including certain provisions, the Government, using their prerogative power, which they use when they conclude treaties, will affect the rights of individuals in the UK to claim—or, in some cases, not claim—unilateral relief or any relief. By changing treaties using prerogative power, the Government will in effect be raising taxes on people on whom those taxes were not previously raised. I do not assert that that is the Government's intention, but that will be the effect. Although that may be unobnoxious in itself—depending on the ways in which it cashes out in practice over the years—it is obnoxious in principle. We would not want it to be a precedent that will be used for other purposes. I think that that is common ground among hon. Members on both sides of the Committee, and, more generally, on both sides of the House.
<P>
In pursuing the real-life technical problem of future jurisdiction changes in other countries, with which tax treaties will need to catch up—although that will not happen fast enough to avoid the need for unilateral relief in some circumstances—I hope that the Treasury will also bear in mind the need to construct a mechanism that does not have the effect that, by changing tax treaties, the Government can exercise their prerogative power to raise UK taxes rather than reduce them. The basic principle of double tax treaties is that they should relieve UK tax, which is why it has always been unobjectionable for the prerogative power to be used in that respect. The provisions under discussion alter that logic, and we hope that the Treasury will attend to that matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I should perhaps declare an interest—
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Will my hon. Friend give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I give way to my hon. Friend.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for allowing me this opportunity. The Paymaster General may or may not say other things that are right in the Committee today, but she has said one thing that was right—that hon. Members should declare their interests. I declare, for the ``manyeth'' time, that mine are in the Register of Members' Interests.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> My question is about the application of universal relief provisions that are relevant to the amendment. A constituent who is an accountant wrote to me to make the point, of which I was not aware, that when a UK citizen invests in securities in another EU economy, he suffers a tax on the dividend in that other country—Germany, France or wherever—on which he does not obtain relief against his UK income tax liability. All that he or she can do is seek to reclaim the tax from the other country, which, for 99 per cent. of people, will be difficult. In the light of the changes in the amendment, do the Government envisage standardisation? Given their warm views on the integration of continental Europe, it is astonishing that such a tax situation should prevail. It is a disincentive to invest on a pan-European basis, because, in practice, UK citizens who do so will suffer double tax on their dividends.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> Broader points have been made about double taxation relief. The hon. Member for West Dorset asked what happened when tax authorities changed the rules relating to double taxation agreements. He asked also about the royal prerogative and the accountability of our double taxation treaties. The hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs (Mr. Flight) referred to broader matters concerning double taxation, the prevention of which is the purpose of the treaties.
<P>
Paragraph 5 enacts three provisions. First, it makes it clear that the United Kingdom will not give relief on foreign tax if the taxpayer can claim in the other country that he does not have to pay it, either because of a provision under a double taxation agreement or because that is the law in the other country. Secondly, if a taxpayer can claim credit for foreign tax under a treaty, he cannot claim credit unilaterally under domestic law. Thirdly—this was the first point made by the hon. Member for West Dorset—if a treaty contains an express provision that credit for foreign tax is not allowed in particular circumstances, relief for that tax may not be claimed unilaterally. Paragraph 5 applies only if an express provision in the treaty denies relief, not if the treaty is silent on the issue. It bears no relevance to when the laws of another country change because only a new treaty or suspension of the treaty can change the agreement. However, I shall have to seek guidance from my officials on the last point.
<P>
The hon. Member for West Dorset referred to accountability for the tax treaty. Before they are enacted, tax treaties are debated by a House of Commons Committee under the system of delegated powers. The hon. Gentleman and I have already discussed some treaties. The arrangements are scrutinised before they are made part of a double taxation treaty. The amendment makes it clear that the provisions would have effect in relation to claims for credit relief made on or after 21 March 2000.
<P>
I have already answered the question asked by the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs, in that it is up to the taxpayer to claim a repayment. The Inland Revenue talks regularly to other countries about improving that procedure. If the hon. Gentleman was referring to a particular case in which a constituent identified difficulties, perhaps he will write to me about it. I shall be more than happy to ask the Inland Revenue to take it up. We must ensure that taxpayers have access to the relief to which they are entitled in the country in which it is supposed to be given. I understand the hon. Gentleman's wider point, especially as we increase the number of double taxation treaties. They are of great importance to this country, especially to businesses based here that want to invest in other countries. I hope that the Committee agrees with the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I shall deal in reverse order with the two responses of the Paymaster General. I accept that there is a Commons mechanism for discussion of revisions to existing treaties or new treaties in the tax domain. It so happens that the Paymaster General and I have discussed such matters. However, there is no specific provision for them to be debated on the Floor of the House and, more important, nor is there any provision to bring to the attention of those who are debating such matters whether the treaty, interacting as it may do with existing tax law, will have the effect, bizarrely, of raising taxes as opposed to reducing them.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
If we parliamentarians were all-knowing and on our guard at all times, we would spot such things without their having to be brought to our attention. The problem to which I am alluding could probably be solved if the Paymaster General reflected on the proposition that sometimes guidance should be issued that would be parallel to regulatory impact assessments. That would always alert us if a tax treaty had the potential effect, under its interaction with United Kingdom law, of raising rather than reducing UK tax for a specified class of taxpayers, which would trigger a full-scale debate. Under such arrangements, the property power would be appropriately reined in.
<P>
Perhaps in anticipation of the lively debates that will take place later in Committee, I may have been more inarticulate than usual when describing the character of the problem because the Paymaster General did not respond to it. However, I shall try again. The mischief that the amendment would remedy is well described in the Inland Revenue's notes, which state:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>For example, in agreements with Egypt—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and various other countries—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>UK petroleum companies are expressly excluded from claiming relief for taxes paid in those countries under the agreements . . . But in all those situations the companies concerned can claim credit relief under UK domestic law and the Government does not want to alter that situation.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
So far, so good. Indeed, it is marvellous. It is right that we should allow companies to claim unilateral relief under those circumstances.
<P>
What is the genesis of the mischief? When the treaties were originally signed, it was envisaged that the companies concerned would end up, one way or another, being able to claim tax relief. That is why the Government want to return to the point at which they will be allowed to claim the tax relief. Let us imagine a situation in which the Government sign a new treaty and expressly provide for something or other not to be reclaimable under the treaty. A change then comes about in a foreign jurisdiction whereby a previous Government had acted in a way that meant that that new tax provision cannot be the subject of relief. It should be possible for the UK company to obtain unilateral relief. There is no mechanism in the amendment for that to occur. First, I hope that I am not confused; secondly, I hope that I have now clarified the problem. I do not expect the Paymaster General to respond to me immediately, but I hope that she will reflect on whether the succession of events that may flow from future double tax treaties may engender the problem that I have described.

<P>

<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> When the right hon. Member for Fylde (Mr. Jack) was the Financial Secretary to the Treasury, I was shadowing him in opposition. At the time, he kindly offered, before the discussion of the double taxation treaty, to set up a meeting between me and officials—without members of the Government being present—at which I could raise particular issues. I was grateful for that provision. There is agreement on both sides of the House that double taxation treaties are enormously important. There is a general agreement between the parties on all but a few of these issues.
<P>
I continued that arrangement after the general election in 1997. I have always been happy to offer Opposition Front Bench spokesmen the opportunity to meet officials and discuss matters privately before we debate double taxation treaties. I will reflect on what the hon. Member for West Dorset said about guidance, but I remind him that that offer has been made. It is important that both Government and Opposition support that network, and the issue would be better dealt with through such a meeting than through more guidance and papers.
<P>
I believe that I have answered the hon. Gentleman's second point. The areas are not contentious on the whole, but I will consider them again with my officials and deal with any issue that arises. Business people want those provisions clarified and simplified as we deal with the amendments, and there is no reason for the Government not to provide such clarification and simplification. I hope that the Committee will accept the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I thank the Paymaster General for her helpful response. I would like to dig a little further because she is better placed than anyone to know about tax rules regarded as unfair within the European Union. Are a French investor and a United Kingdom investor in a German company in the same position? The French investor must go to German authorities to reclaim the tax that they have stopped; would that apply to us, or are there different rules? If the French investor can automatically get a tax credit against his French tax, the European Union may, at some point down the line, knock on our door and tell us that we are practising unfair tax competition by discouraging British investors from investing in Germany and France.
<P>
The net effect is that an unfair competitive advantage is given to collective investment schemes. No United Kingdom resident will want to be bothered with the hassle of claiming back German tax on dividends. If he wants to invest, he will do so through a collective scheme that will do that for him. Therefore, despite the help that is given, on which I appreciate that the practical situation is anti-single market, I would like to know how the position of our investors compares with that of investors in France and Germany.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I am tempted to be a little mischievous with the hon. Gentleman. He is surely not suggesting that there should be harmonisation of tax base and common rules for tax across the European Union?
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight indicated dissent.</B><P>
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> No, I did not think that he was, as he has strong feelings on the matter. To my knowledge, which is not extensive given the number of tax systems in the European Union, a French investor would have to reclaim from the German authorities, using the same procedure as a United Kingdom taxpayer. However, the treaties may differ because they have been achieved by bilateral negotiations, which I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would rather retain than have one rule for reclaiming tax across the EU. I will not go further, because I am sure that the hon. Gentleman is not actually suggesting harmonisation of base.

<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I do not want to pre-empt my hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset but, given that significant parts of the schedule will not take effect until 31 March 2001, we have a good opportunity to ask again why there is a rush to make the amendments this morning. Why should the whole schedule not be kicked into touch to give more time for proper consultation, so that we can be more confident that the Government understand what they are doing?
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> My hon. Friend has indeed gazumped some of my arguments, but made them much more clearly and eloquently than I could have done, so I shall not try your patience by repeating them, Mr. Cook.
<P>
Although the nine-month delay is welcome, it is a peculiar length of time to have chosen. In the spirit of genuine inquiry, I ask why nine months? I understand why there is a delay, and why there was to be one under circumstances in which the Government were doing something objectionable. As I shall expose in due course when we debate whether the schedule is to be included in the Bill, I fear that the reasons for the delay are still partially present. However, I do not understand why it should be a nine-month delay.
<P>
If there is a good explanation, that will be fine. If not, it would be interesting to know why there is not a one-year delay. The point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Guildford would be strongly relevant if there were a one-year delay, as it would be possible to consult on a restructured schedule 30, including the amendments that we have considered and those that we shall consider later this morning. Then industry and the Government would know where they were, which I fear is more than the Government currently know. Everyone could agree on the shape of schedule 30, and it could return to us a year from now in the next Finance Bill. I assume that that will not be possible under the nine-month extension, although I may not understand some of the inwardnesses. Why has the nine-month period been chosen?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I could say that it is because it is a natural period. That would not be true, but it seems as good as other explanations.
<P>
I shall deal first with the comments made by the hon. Member for Guildford. I understand that he and his colleagues do not like the proposals for offshore mixing in schedule 30, but there are other provisions in the schedule as well. Many of them are welcomed by business. To say that the whole schedule should be held up due to that issue is not at all helpful. The main disagreement on the schedule is about whether offshore mixing should be curtailed.
<P>
The amendments cover many aspects that business wants implemented without delay. It is not contradictory to say that some elements of business have objected to the proposed removal of offshore mixing, and had that not been in the schedule, they would not be complaining about the rest of the schedule. We shall return to offshore mixing in the schedule stand part debate.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The hon. Member for Guildford asked why 31 March has been proposed. We always intended businesses to have such a window of opportunity when we originally proposed 1 July this year. Some businesses said that they would not be able to comply even though they wanted to, because of restrictions and complexities in their structuring, and that they needed longer in order to have the window of opportunity provided in the Bill. It therefore seemed consistent to move the date to the end of the financial year.
<P>
The hon. Member for Guildford is right. We could have moved the date to September or December, which might have allowed enough time, but it seemed tidier and more reasonable to move the proposed date to 31 March next year. The amendments make that change, which the Government announced in May. I ask the Committee to endorse the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I think that I understand the Paymaster General's explanation, and I hope that I believe it. However, a doubt lingers in my mind in the sense that it is convenient that the date proposed will just prevent paragraph 10 of schedule 30 from being revisited in the next Finance Bill. That would be the natural way to proceed, to use the hon. Lady's phrase, in the sense that we understand that the Government intend to introduce on Report—rather late in the process—substantial and substantive amendments. Necessarily, between now and Report it will not be possible to consult widely and formally on those amendments—the mistake that was made previously.
<P>
If the paragraph were removed and reintroduced in a subsequent Finance Bill following careful consultation on the basis of drafted provisions, we could avoid a repetition of the problem. We may avoid it anyway; that remains to be seen, but there is a risk, and it would be far more natural to extend the application to beyond the time that the next Finance Bill will be introduced, in order to allow revision before effectiveness if it turns out that, following wide and detailed consultation, the provisions introduced on Report for this Finance Bill are not sufficient to cure the problem.
<P>
Although I accept that 31 March has a certain neatness, being the year end, I am not sure that it is sufficiently neat to justify not extending the provision to the point at which the Finance Bill could have been passed, which I assume would be 1 July 2001. As the Paymaster General said, a window of opportunity had already been provided. Clearly, therefore, the Government already accept that, whatever the final shape of paragraph 10, it is not critical to the Treasury's cash flow that the provision should be implemented quickly. If it is not critical that the provision be implemented quickly, why not allow it to be revised before it is implemented, should that prove necessary? The gap between 31 March 2001 and 1 July 2001 cannot be so critical from the Treasury's point of view as to make a serious difference to the nation's finances.
<P>
I ask the Paymaster General to reflect again on the matter. I give prior notice, for what it is worth, that if no such change is made, we would probably intend to introduce such an amendment on Report, which we may or may not press, depending on how complete the solution to the underlying problem of paragraph 10 turns out to be on Report.

<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I assure the hon. Gentleman that there was nothing in the Government's mind when we set the revised date except what I have explained. It was certainly not our idea to try to avoid a debate next year.
<P>
The CBI urged last week that paragraph 10 be finalised in this year's Bill, which echoes the fact that there is agreement on many provisions in the schedule. That is why we continue with these amendments, which have arisen from the comments of business. We certainly have no Machiavellian reason so that there can be no discussion on the subject next year. I am sure that the ingenuity of the Opposition will ensure that we shall discuss the subject when they think it appropriate, if we have not provided for such a debate ourselves. The amendment is not contentious, so I hope that the Committee will accept it.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Amendment proposed: No. 397, in page 508, line 31, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`UK insurance companies trading overseas:
repeal of section 802

11A.—(1) Section 802 of the Taxes Act 1988 shall cease to have effect.
<P>
(2) This paragraph has effect in relation to accounting periods beginning on or after 1st April 2000.'.—[Dawn Primarolo.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss Government amendments Nos. 398, 399, 400, 401, 402 and 403.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I am going to say something slightly unusual, but it will at least have the merit of being honest. I do not know what is in the amendments; I do not understand them in the least. We received a series of amendments yesterday. Most of them deal with matters central to the operation of schedule 30 and are relatively technical and also fairly straightforward. With the assistance of members of the accountancy profession, I was able to make sense of some of the amendments yesterday. I am grateful to the Paymaster General for ensuring that helpful and pellucid notes were issued with them.
<P>
These amendments may be worthy. I understand that they are about the effect on insurance companies, and they clearly emanate from representations made to the Treasury by such companies. Nevertheless, I regret to say that they are wholly opaque to anyone not deeply versed in the subject of taxing insurance companies. I do not bring up that matter as a reason for not tabling such amendments at some point, but the idea that the Committee is now in a position to debate the details is frankly risible, unless there are geniuses around.
<P>
How should we proceed? The Paymaster General, having proposed the amendment, no doubt wants it to be accepted into the Bill. We are clearly powerless to prevent that. By talking to the industry and its advisers, we shall now spend the time that is needed to understand the effects in detail. If we convince ourselves that the measures deal with the relevant mischiefs, we shall remain entirely silent hereafter. If we convince ourselves that there are problems, we shall raise the matter on Report.
<P>
It would have been good if the Government had given us a little more than 24 hours to consider the amendments. I do not want to emphasise that point, as it sounds like someone lazy, ignorant and stupid complaining about being lazy, ignorant and stupid. One has to live with one's own deficiencies, but I hope that we shall be able to tackle the matters seriously if there are problems.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> My hon. Friend is being unkind to himself. I am staggered that the Paymaster General thinks that it is appropriate to introduce 21 pages of amendments and explanatory notes merely by proposing them formally. I would at least expect her to stand up and explain why such a massive group of amendments is needed and what she is asking the Committee to agree. The reason why my hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset has not grasped the issue is not slothfulness.
<P>
On clause 106, I have a letter from the Association of British Insurers, which warns about radical changes to the tax treatment of insurance companies that will be introduced by regulation after a consultation period. Clearly, there has been no consultation period in respect of the amendments. Perhaps the Paymaster General is battle-scarred by her attempts to hold a consultation on clause 106 and by the vitriolic response that her proposals have drawn from the insurance industry, which we shall debate in due course. She should have made a better fist of it than merely proposing the amendments formally.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I do not like to disagree with my hon. Friend the Member for Guildford, but I understand that this series of amendments was produced in response to discussions with the industry. It is strange that they were not in the Bill in the first place—one would have hoped that the Government would be organised enough not to drop them in the night before they were debated. I do not have direct personal experience of insurance industry taxation, so I am relying on the comments of the ABI, which, overall, seems not too unhappy. However, it makes certain points that strike me as fair and reasonable.
<P>
The explanatory notes on amendment No. 397 state that the section concerned has been little used, which is cited as a reason to clear it out. However, I understand that the changes are material to the few who use it, the section, and one group is likely to suffer additional tax of £1 million a year as a result. The fact that the territory covered relates to only a minority of businesses is not a good argument for saying, ``Hard luck, you lot!'' Certainly, the industry does not regard the amendment as fair.
<P>
Amendment No. 398 seems, broadly, to be to the satisfaction of the industry. However, it is not too keen on amendment No. 399. It disagrees with the implication in the Inland Revenue's explanation that the proposed new section merely gives effect to the generally accepted interpretation of the application of section 797. We are told that the Revenue has seen counsel's opinion obtained by the ABI, which endorses the approach taken by a number of life offices whereby double taxation credit relief should be claimed against tax due on the total profits of the life insurance business, and not apportioned between categories of such business. Again, an excessively broad-brush approach could fall unfairly, depending on the mixture of businesses of different insurance companies.
<P>
The intention behind amendment No. 400 seems to be to put insurance companies and banks on a parallel basis in relation to double taxation relief for their international activities. An important difference between the existing rules for banks and those proposed for insurance companies has been overlooked. It relates to the definition of relevant expenses to be deducted. In essence, banks receive all the interest, whereas insurance companies are clearly not geared operations in the same way as banks. For an insurance company, the definition is in terms of the amount of the policyholder's claims, and no element is allowed for return on capital, which a bank can include in its relevant expenses.
<P>
Basically, insurance companies have been done down a bit and must deduct a larger sum in a marginally relevant situation and obtain less relief. We want to know the basis of such a proposal. The industry certainly considers that such matters should be dealt with.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I have not had the advantage of having read the industry's response to the amendments and I applaud my hon. Friend on his initiative and speed at having done so. However, the industry says that the proposals under clause 106 are considerably harsher than those applicable to other UK companies.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I must point out to all members of the Committee that we are not discussing clause 106. I have been tolerant, but I cannot allow such references to continue to be made.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I was merely asking whether the industry felt that it was being treated more harshly under the amendments than other parts of British industry.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Unlike matters that we may discuss later, this is not territory in which huge issues are at stake. However, some issues give rise to perceived unfairness and ``broadbrushery'', as I outlined to the Minister. Given the relative position of British insurance companies and the arrangements for them under our double taxation treaties vis-à-vis, for example, French or German insurance companies, I do not know whether they would be placed at a competitive disadvantage under the amendments. The issues raised by the industry seem to be fair and reasonable and I hope that the Government will consider them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> Given that the Government have had three months since the Budget to decide what to do about the insurance industry and double taxation, I, too, am puzzled why they have only recently tabled the amendments. That makes it difficult for the Committee to debate them. We have received only a partially considered response from one sector of the industry and we know from the history of the double taxation relief that the Government persistently get it wrong. Moreover, when they do get it wrong, they do not admit it. It was pointed out to the Government immediately after the Budget that their approach to mixer companies was damaging and misguided, but they dismissed all the critics and ploughed ahead. We now know that they conducted a series of retreats, delayed the matter for nine months and are producing other amendments that we shall debate later.
<P>
The same might be true about the insurance industry, so we do not know whether the amendments would take the trick. Indeed, there is some evidence that they would not. On Budget day, the Inland Revenue was told:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>it is intended to put in statutory form the existing Inland Revenue approach.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We hear that that has not been done in all cases, in particular in amendment No. 400. I stress the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs. The Inland Revenue seems to be applying its approach not only to life insurance companies to which it has applied in the past, but to general insurance companies—non-life offices. Will the Paymaster General confirm that the treatment will apply to the non-life as well as to the life insurance companies? I do not know how she squared that with the assertion that the Inland Revenue was only putting existing practice into statute form. That approach, as it affects life insurance companies, has been adopted only since 1996. It is controversial and challenged by sectors of the industry that believe that litigation against present treatment is possible. Perhaps the Paymaster General can confirm that, too.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs has drawn attention to the issue of how the industry has been treated in comparison with banks, so I will not repeat what he said. That treatment underlines the fact that the Government have a cavalier approach. They tell us that the changes are minor and that they are only putting into law existing treatment. I tend to believe the Association of British Insurers when it says that that is not the case, rather than the Government, given their track record. A little humility might be in order and, if there is doubt, the Paymaster General could agree to give further consideration to the industry's comments and return to the matter later in the Bill's passage.
<P>
The commentary to Government amendment No. 397 states that section 802 of the Taxes Act 1988 has been little used. That is disputed in part by the industry, which says that, although relatively few insurance companies have made use of it, the sums concerned for those that do are material. One insurance group will face an additional tax bill of £1 million a year. I remind the Committee that Revenue calculations about the effect of those changes were precisely what got the Government into trouble immediately after Budget day. The accountancy profession stated, on behalf of its clients and the industry in general, that the proposed change to foreign companies and double taxation relief would cost the industry much more than the Government had estimated. The industry has proved to be right and the Treasury and the Government wrong, and the same may be true in this case. The Government may have underestimated the impact of the amendments, so I would like the Paymaster General to give the source of her information that the section has been little used. She might also suggest what sums are at stake.

<P>

<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> It is true that the tax planning industry has had a lot to say about the schedule. That is unsurprising, given what the schedule will do in its entirety, and how it will affect the timing of the paying of tax.
<P>
The amendments in this large group will do three things. First, they will amend the rules that limit relief for life insurance companies that have overseas branches. That is a clarification of what is already meant to happen. Secondly, they respond to requests for clarity over detailed rules for foreign tax. That sector has a highly complicated, rarefied atmosphere. Thirdly, they deal with the rules for expenses, based on the principle that delivers the same provision for banks, which was introduced in 1982 by the previous Government and beefed up in 1987. Again, that is a reaction to the request for clarity in the law with regard to some case law.
<P>
The amendments introduce the part of the reformed regime for double taxation relief that applies to insurance companies. They give effect to the changes described in paragraphs 1.43 and 1.44 of ``Double Taxation Relief for Companies: Outcome of the Review'', which was issued on Budget day. They follow substantial consultation with the insurance industry and, where appropriate, reflect its representations. The drafts were shown to the ABI in April and consultation has continued since, so let us push aside the irrelevant suggestion that some Opposition Members are trying to peddle about there not being proper consultation.
<P>
I would not describe the hon. Member for West Dorset as lazy, ignorant or stupid. I might describe him in other ways—he is a little long-winded sometimes, and his jokes are not always as funny as they could be—but never in those terms. I accept that the subject is complex and that the Opposition may want to return to it.
<P>
Several questions were asked, including why the provisions were not introduced in the original Bill. I have covered that point; they follow the outcome of the consultation document. We wanted to consult on the draft clauses, and to give the industry enough time to reflect on the required changes.
<P>
The hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs made several points about amendment No. 397, which refers to section 802 of the Taxes Act 1988. The section deals with a situation in which a United Kingdom company has an overseas insurance branch that receives dividends from other overseas companies. It provides a measure of relief to the UK company for tax suffered by the overseas paying company on the profits out of which the dividend is paid. There are few cases in which section 802 provides a relief not available under other provisions, and fewer than half a dozen companies currently claim the relief. The new relief in proposed new section 804E would have rendered section 802 virtually redundant. There would be no justification for relief that section 802 would have continued to give, but that proposed new section 804E would not give.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman asked about the complex proposed new section 804B in amendment No. 399. The rules are being introduced to make the calculation of credit relief in the affected areas clear and certain. The lack of specific statutory rules for making such calculations in the past has led insurance companies to take a wide variety of different views on what the answer should be. Some companies have made claims based on an extreme view that all foreign tax paid on income exempt from tax under UK legislation can be set against corporation tax on taxable income.
<P>
The Inland Revenue will continue to argue that the present law requires a limitation along the lines of the rules now being introduced, but it is desirable to have the clarity and certainty that the new rules will bring. It is unfortunate that clarity often comes at the expense of brevity on matters as complex as the taxation of insurance companies.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman's final point related to amendment No. 400 and the issues that the ABI raised about banks. The rules for banks and insurance companies are intended to achieve the same result—to define the UK measure of foreign income so that credit relief for foreign tax can be restricted to the corporation tax payable on that measure. The difference between banking and insurance business inevitably means that different rules are required to arrive at an approximate and appropriate measure.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
A key feature of the business of life insurance companies is that much of their income and many of their gains are earned not on their own behalf but on behalf of policyholders. In computing a trading profit, as in the case of pension business for example, consequent payments and obligations to policyholders are deducted so that the corresponding income and gains do not contribute to the UK corporation tax bill.
<P>
In such circumstances, it would be inappropriate to include income and gains earned for policyholders in the measure of profits that qualify for double taxation relief. Quite simply, that income and those gains have not been included in profits and have not been doubly taxed.
<P>
The ABI has suggested that the way in which the new rules take premiums into account gives a wrong result, but its alternative suggestion would not seem to make any difference to the outcome. The Government believe that the method on which we have settled is fair to the insurance business.
<P>
I hope that, having dealt with those points about the involvement of the insurance industry, hon. Gentlemen will be content at this stage, although I have taken note of the point that they may want to return to the matter later. I ask the Committee to accept the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I was hoping that, in the course of that helpful explanation, the Paymaster General would explain the revenue impact of the group of amendments, and, having defined how the insurance industry should account for its profits and what deductions it can make, what impact that will have on the amount of revenue that the Treasury collects from the industry.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I thank the Paymaster General for her responses. Will the reliefs tax permitted under section 804E of the Taxes Act 1988 be the same as those that have been permitted under section 802? I understood her to say that they are not nearly as generous. For companies for which section 802 was relevant, section 804E will be relevant. What degree of materiality of worse tax treatment will result, and assuming that it will, why?
<P>
Secondly, on amendment No. 399, I am not clear where the Government stand, in that the issue is whether credit relief should be claimed against total profits or apportioned. In case I did not express myself clearly the first time, the industry and counsel's opinion is that it should relate to total profits. Do the Government intend through amendment No. 399 to break the relief down for apportionment between categories? If so, that seems to add a further complication.
<P>
Finally, in comparison with banks, a similarity exists in that banks gear up on other people's money by lending it out, while insurance companies gear up on taking other people's money and making money out of the policies that they sell. I cannot see the logic of allowing banks to receive tax relief on returns on capital but not insurance companies.
<P>
I shall make another major point, as I do not know when else to make it. The insurance industry has been under attack because of charges. Even on insurance products that may be a little expensive, typically, charges are of the order of 2½ per cent. or 2¾ per cent., and perhaps up to 3 per cent, while the banking industry has a cost margin of 5 per cent. or 6 per cent. The financial intermediation of the banking industry is hugely expensive in relation to other forms of intermediation, yet no one apart from Mr. Cruickshank on the Government's side seems the slightest bit anxious. The insurance industry's products are more complicated than those of the banking industry, so I cannot see the justification for giving the insurance industry a less favourable deal than the banking industry.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> On the question asked by the hon. Member for Guildford on the likely impact, the amendments introduce the rules that are currently applied. A challenge has been made, to which his right hon. Friend the Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory) referred, in relation to amendment No. 399 and the arrangements for proposed new section 804B. The right hon. Gentleman referred to counsel's opinion obtained by the industry. I repeat that the Inland Revenue has always argued, and will continue to argue, that the current law requires a limitation along the lines of the rules being introduced. In that respect, it is a question of double taxation treaties.
<P>
The hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs asked two other questions. Proposed new section 804E means that no relief would be due under section 802, which, as it is no longer required, is being repealed. On amendment No. 399, the new rules apportion tax in the same way as income, which we regard as fair. With regard to the hon. Gentleman's points on whether insurance companies and banks should be treated in the same way, that is precisely the point of the changes. The insurance company rules have the same overall effect as the bank rules; they are no less generous to insurance companies than to banks.
<P>
The other points were on issues that have already been the subject of extensive debate with the insurance industry. On that basis, I hope that the Committee will accept the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I hoped to catch the Paymaster General's eye. On the latter point, does she mean that the overall package works out no less favourably? She did not answer the specific question of why banks benefit in terms of the cost of capital of an effectively allowable expense and insurance companies do not.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I did answer the hon. Gentleman's question. The rules are intended to give broadly the same effect, and, in principle, recognise the difference in the industry. The intention is to apply the rules that have always been applied by the Inland Revenue, and introduce them in legislation. The idea that we are being more unfavourable to insurance companies is wrong. When the hon. Gentleman speaks to the ABI, that will be confirmed.

<P>

<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I am left in some confusion. The Paymaster General says that the provisions are already enshrined in Inland Revenue practice. With respect to my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs on one or two points, there is therefore no revenue impact. Will the Paymaster General therefore explain what mischief the Government are trying to cure? Is the Inland Revenue worried that an insurance company will refer the matter to the tax commissioners, and, through the courts, dispute Inland Revenue practice and claim that it is wrong? If that is what the hon. Lady is trying to prevent, will she explain why it is preferable for the Committee to decide, on 24 hours' notice, that the Inland Revenue is right, than to leave it to the tax commissioners and the law courts to determine, with their greater knowledge in future, that the Inland Revenue is wrong?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I explained earlier that the industry sought clarification from the Revenue about the operation of the provisions. The issue was raised in the consultation period. The amendments seek to clarify the practice, based on requests from the industry. When the hon Gentleman asked me about the cost, I said that it was negligible because the application is clear. Is he saying that some people may challenge interpretations of legislation on any subject through the commissioners? If so, he is right, as that happens quite a lot, but that is not an issue with regard to this matter.
<P>
The industry asked for the provision. We consulted with it extensively, and it asked questions that we answered. Some of its points have been made again by the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs. The situation is as straightforward as that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I think that we are getting nearer to a straight answer on the question of cost, but we are not there yet. The hon. Lady says that existing practices will be broadly carried forward, and that the cost is negligible. I gave an example of an insurance group that estimates that its tax will rise by £1 million a year. Will she give a specific estimate of the additional revenue that will be raised by the amendments? We have shown examples in which the industry thinks that its tax bill will rise, and in which the existing approach will now apply to a different group of companies. A specific figure, whether small or unimportant, would be helpful. We would do better in Committee if she could give specific answers.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I cannot believe that the right hon. Gentleman does not have better points to make than that. The figure is considerably less than the figure that the chairman of a certain company will receive as a bonus this year for takeover activity, as was announced in the newspapers today. It is negligible in terms of how the Treasury and Inland Revenue account for costs or policy implications. I said that the overall cost of changes for the insurance company was negligible, and that is the case.
<P>
If the right hon. Gentleman wants the figure in actual pounds, it is less than £3 million [Interruption.] If he is going to waste the time of the Committee talking about small figures when other benefits are being given to the companies elsewhere in the Bill by changes in legislation, I think that he has lost his focus on what is taking place.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I am afraid that I am still concerned by the speed at which the amendments are being introduced, and the fact that the industry has told us that it is worried about the Government's appearing not to have taken some of its comments into account. I would like the Paymaster General to assure us that she is clear in her mind that she wants the process of calculating the income from foreign dividends to be put on a statutory basis. Has the industry asked her to do that, rather than to issue clarification through Inland Revenue press releases or guidance notes?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> The answer to that question, which I have already answered, is yes.
<P>

It is a welcome amendment, as it is clearly rational for a group of companies taxed in a foreign jurisdiction as a single entity to be regarded as such for the purposes of double tax relief. It is evident that the provision should have been drafted in that way from the first, and it is good that the change has been made. We have no objection at all to it.

<P>
(11) Where the credit allowed for any tax payable under the laws of a territory outside the United Kingdom is, by virtue of subsection (2) above, less than it would be if the relevant income were not treated as reduced in accordance with that subsection, section 795(2)(a) shall not prevent a deduction being made for the difference in computing the profits of the category of business concerned.

<B>The Chairman:</B> We now come to amendment No. 378.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Cook. As there are a lot of amendments, will you give me some guidance? Amendments Nos. 402 and 403 were grouped with the lead amendment No. 397. Will we vote on them at another point in our proceedings?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Amendments Nos. 402 and 403 are to schedule 40, so we will deal with those when we reach that point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Cook. I think that we have passed the group that was led by Government amendment No. 375 and, unless I have missed it, we did not vote on amendments Nos. 376 and 377.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Indeed we did. I almost forgot to group amendment No. 377 with No. 376, but at the last minute I remembered to do so.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss Government amendments Nos. 380, 382 and 383.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I do not want to tarry long on the amendments. The extension of carry back is welcome. I have not had time to consult about whether three years is a sufficient period to satisfy the concerns that have been raised with us and the Government about the earlier version. Will the Paymaster General say whether three years was put to her by the industry and the professions, or whether the Government proposed it? If it was the latter, why is it held to be sufficient? I do not think that we would quarrel with it, but it would be good to know from where the proposal came.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> When we consulted on the amendments, the original suggestion was one year. After representations, the Government decided that that was a little on the tight side. It was also proposed that the carry forward should be indefinite, six years or three years. We thought an indefinite carry back would mean that companies' tax affairs would never be regarded as settled, which is clearly undesirable. The six-year carry back would follow the rules for advance corporation tax. However, given that ACT has been abolished there is no reason to follow a dying precedent. We decided to settle on a reasonable period of three years, one year longer than the original carry-back period for ACT, when the Conservative party introduced it in 1972, which is how we arrived at that figure. I have explained why an indefinite period was ruled out; six years was considered inappropriate because it is a dying precedent; and we, therefore, settled on three years, which we think is appropriate.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 379, in page 509, line 50, leave out `or' and insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(aa) if the income in question is a dividend, in the same accounting period, or'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 381 and 384 to 393.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> The amendment preserves a feature of the legislation as it was originally drafted in relation to the carry back and carry forward of foreign tax, which I am sure that business will welcome. If unrelieved foreign tax relating to a dividend can be carried backwards or forwards for use when other dividends from the same source are received in a different year, it makes sense to allow it also to be used if a dividend from the same source is received in the same year.
<P>
Originally, that was achieved by allowing the tax to be carried back one year and then to be carried forward again from that preceding year to the current year. That was when the one-year carry back was in place, but that was not visible under the legislation. The possibility was lost when the carry-back legislation was redrafted following the Government's decision that the carry-back period should be extended to three years. In the interests of certainty, the legislation should be clear on such an important point.
<P>
The legislation now states specifically that one option for using unrelieved foreign tax, if the income is a dividend, is in the same accounting period. Other changes have to be made to the legislation to spell out that there are three ways of using unrelieved foreign tax, not two—carry back, carry forward and, if the income is a dividend, in the same accounting period. Instead of the option of using unrelieved foreign tax partly in one way and partly in the other way, it will now be an option to use it partly in one way and partly in each or either of the other ways.
<P>
The other amendments to the new section 806B deal also with the knock-on effects of there being three, rather than two, ways in which to use unrelieved foreign tax. The amendments are extensive to ensure that the change to three years instead of one year applies throughout the legislation to make it clear that business will have three options. I hope that the Committee will accept the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Despite the necessarily tortuous prose, I understand the Paymaster General's explanation. There should be the ability to offset in-year and I hope that the amendment would achieve that. An amateur investigation suggests that it would, although I have asked a lawyer to look into the matter for me, because a minor problem has occurred to me. However, if the amendment would achieve the effect outlined by the Paymaster General, we shall support it. If the investigation suggests that it would not, I shall table an amendment on Report.

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I do not want to delay the Committee unnecessarily, but I must admit to certain confusion. Am I right that the amendment would match the three-year period? If I am, I shall be more than content with it. Although I cannot quite accept how it will work, I am more than willing to accept the Paymaster General's assurance and remit it to further investigation with the experts. If the amendment would not match the three-year period, I shall have a problem. On the hopeful assumption that it would, I rest content.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I am unable to assist the hon. Gentleman. The amendment would not match the three-year period. It extends the period for claiming that unrelieved foreign tax should be used in the various ways for which the legislation provides. Originally, under the legislation, a claim to use unrelieved foreign tax had to be made within two years following the end of the accounting period in which it arose. However, there is a separate time limit for claiming relief for foreign tax in the first place. So there are two claims: first, to have relief for foreign tax in the usual way and, secondly, to be able to use in one way or another any of the foreign tax that is unrelieved.
<P>
The time limit for claiming relief for foreign tax is currently six years from the end of the accounting period in which the income or gain in question is taxed. That is being amended by paragraph 13 of the schedule to six years from the end of the accounting period in which the income or the gain in question is taxed, or, if later, one year after the end of the accounting period in which foreign tax is paid.
<P>
It was pointed out to us in representations on the Bill during consultation that a company that took full advantage of the time limit could find that it would be too late to claim any use of foreign tax that turned out to be unrelieved. The Government have therefore decided to bring the two time limits into line. The amendment achieves that by making the time limit for claiming relief for foreign tax the time limit for claiming to use any tax that is initially unrelieved, too. That is the alignment of periods that the amendments will effect.

<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> The only honest thing to say is that I did not understand that. However, I shall read Hansard with interest and will try to understand what is proposed. I hope that it turns out that we are entirely content with the amendment, but if we are not, we can revisit the matter on Report.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Amendment proposed: No. 395, in page 512, line 44, leave out `1st July 2000' and insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`31st March 2001'.—[Dawn Primarolo.]<P>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss amendment No. 396.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I should be grateful if the Paymaster General would explain the rationale behind the amendments. Reading the schedule as originally drafted, on page 512, it was envisaged that the new system would come into effect in respect of income after 1 April this year and for dividends paid after 1 July this year. That would allow a three-month period during which dividends for previous years could be paid under the old system, as I understand it. Why does it make sense to move the date on which the new rules will apply to the dividends, but not to move the date on which they will apply to the income and the accounting period?
<P>
Obviously, companies will welcome the opportunity provided under paragraph 14 to carry forward or back unrelieved foreign tax. That is one of the positive elements of the schedule, and I do not want to stand in the way of their doing so. However, if the Government's rationale for specifying two different dates for income and dividend payments was to allow a three-month period for dealing with previous years, what is the rationale for moving one of the dates but not the other?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> As the hon. Gentleman said, the amendments change from 1 July 2000 to 31 March 2001 the start date for allowing unrelieved foreign tax on dividends that do not constitute trading income to be carried backwards or forwards to another period. Under the Bill as drafted, the new relief would apply to foreign tax paid on dividends arising on or after 1 July 2000, and it would not be possible to carry foreign tax on dividends backwards to be credited against UK tax payable on dividends that arise before 30 June 2000.
<P>
It is necessary to change those dates following the change for the introduction of the restriction on the use of mixer companies. Otherwise, companies could, between now and the end of March, bring dividends into the UK with amounts of underlying tax that were not subject to the restriction and carry that underlying tax forward to periods after March, when the restriction would be in place. That could have a substantial Exchequer cost and would prevent the new rules on mixer companies from applying as intended.
<P>
The restriction on mixer companies will apply to dividends paid to the UK on or after 31 March 2001. The amendments will provide the same start date for carrying foreign tax on dividends backwards and forwards. I understand that that covers some contentious ground, to which the hon. Gentleman will shortly refer in the schedule stand part debate. However, that is the consequence of the amendments and I urge the Committee to accept them.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I am grateful to the Paymaster General for demonstrating the muddle that the Government are in. The innocuous-seeming amendments prove how convoluted the schedule is becoming—an issue that we are about to debate.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Amendment made: No. 396, in page 512, line 49, leave out `30th June 2000' and insert

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`30th March 2001'.—[Dawn Primarolo.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Question proposed, That this schedule, as amended, be the Thirtieth schedule to the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I make no apologies for the fact that I am about to live up in abundance to the accusation of being long-winded. I fear that there is much to be said about schedule 30, and much has already been said about matters relating to it. In due course, I want to talk about its crux, which will be a tale of great fascination and huge importance. Before that, I want to talk about seriously difficult parts of the schedule that have not been amended by the Government, but need to be.
<P>
I do not know whether amendments have not been forthcoming on the provisions because industry, for some reason that is not apparent to me, failed to make adequate representations about them. Perhaps representations were made but the Government decided not to attend to them, notwithstanding the fact that they attended to other representations that resulted in the amendments that we have discussed. Either way, some remedial action is needed. I want to talk about the provisions sufficiently slowly, and with sufficient detail and care, to convey to the Paymaster General the nature of the problem, so that she can tackle it before Report. It is already clear that there will be some fundamental amendments on another point on Report, so the Government cannot claim that there is no scope to amend provisions at that time.
<P>
The first problem relates to paragraphs 1, 2 and 3, which are on page 503. The background is, bizarrely, a hangover from our imperial past. It may be as surprising to others as it was to me to know that, in relation to some of our former colonies, we operate an imaginative arrangement in which someone can claim double tax relief on tax that he has not paid and that never fell to be paid. That regime is not available in countries unlucky enough not to have been among our former colonies.
<P>
I do not understand how that system arose, and have not consulted history books sufficiently to know the answer, but we have inherited it. More to the point, our companies have used the mechanism for many years in the legitimate pursuit of their trade. Let us take the example of a power station in Singapore and suppose that the underlying corporate tax rate there is 30 per cent. It there is a relief—in Singapore it is called a pioneer relief—available for new projects in the ex-colony, although the power project will pay only the post-relief tax, which in this example may be 5 per cent., the full underlying tax rate of 30 per cent. could be claimed against UK tax. I think that that is the current situation.
<P>
That is a bonus, and I am sure that the senior officials of the Inland Revenue have been licking their chops for years now in the hope of getting a good bite at this on the grounds that it did not make any sense. I am sure that the Paymaster General did the elegant variant of licking her chops when she came across it. She was anxious to do something to remedy this bizarre feature of the scene, but the problem is that for a long time now our companies have relied on this provision when making long-term investments. When one invests in a power project it takes years before the returns are fully achieved. In assessing whether to take part in a power project, a UK firm such as one of our great generating firms is bound to undertake the computer modelling that predicts the rate of return on such a project. Although those returns are looked at on a pre-tax basis, they are also generated on a post-„tax basis. A determinant of the post tax return of the projects is whether they continue to be eligible for this tax bonus. No doubt that is why paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 do not remove this bizarre feature of the scene. They do not stop companies claiming for more tax than has been paid in relation to some kinds of subsidiaries in some kinds of ex-colonies; they do something more subtle. They constrain the ability of the companies in question to claim more relief than would be available if they looked at the tax that had been paid to the case in which the subsidiary in question is directly held by a UK company.
<P>
We are talking about the difference between a UK generating company that owns the shares of a Singapore power project directly and another case in which a UK generating company owns a Dutch BV—a Dutch company—which in turn owns a range of power projects around the far east. The intermediate Dutch holding company technique is widely used for such investments and paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 taken together will make it impossible to use the tax-sparing arrangements to reclaim more tax than was paid in the case in which the Singapore power project is held indirectly via a Dutch BV.
<P>
A serious problem arises if the change that is suggested in paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 comes about. It is of exactly the same character as that which, I speculate, prevented the Paymaster General and the Inland Revenue officials, notwithstanding much licking of chops, from ending the practice of tax sparing completely. Companies in the UK, such as generating companies, have structured their affairs on the basis of holding a number of projects for other subsidiaries in various corners in the world, including ex-colonies, through Dutch BVs. In assessing whether to invest in those projects, they have relied on the ability to structure their affairs in such a way. That has not been illegitimate evasion but perfectly legitimate tax planning, which is built in to calculations of the returns on the projects concerned. In fact, it may be built in to a particular UK company's industrial strategy in a particular region. For example, it may have been a reason why one of our generating companies or oil companies chose to invest in a particular project in, say, Indonesia—which, if I remember correctly, is not covered by tax-sparing arrangements, and is not an ex-„colony—and was able to hold that project as a subsidiary of the same Dutch BV, of which, for example, a Singapore project was a subsidiary. The purpose of the UK company would have been to use the tax advantage of tax sparing to ensure that proceeds could flow from the Singapore project up to the Dutch BV and down to the Indonesian subsidiary without adverse tax consequences back home.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I can well understand that the Paymaster General is as perplexed as me as to the reason why tax-sparing arrangements were introduced. However, the logic that persuaded her not to end the practice altogether should also persuade her not to end tax sparing retrospectively when the subsidiary in question is held indirectly through a Dutch BV, for example. We are dealing with the legitimate expectations of UK companies that were engaging in perfectly standard tax planning. A retrospective change will retrospectively invalidate the return calculations on which the projects will have been based, which, it seems to me, is iniquitous. The remedy is clear. Paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 need to be amended—the technical task of drafting the necessary amendments defeats me, but that is what the Treasury is good at—to ensure that they apply to future circumstances, not past ones. It would be perfectly legitimate, from here on out, to prevent companies in the UK from forming subsidiaries such as Dutch BVs, holding new subsidiaries or power projects in a multitude of countries and claiming tax sparing on some but not others. That would be a perfectly legitimate future change to our tax law, were it to exempt cases in which it had been done in the past, and in which people have legitimately, as a matter of industrial activity, calculated returns on the basis of that tax planning.
<P>
I stress that we are dealing with a legitimate set of tax practices, not Bermuda cash boxes and the like. We are dealing with instances of people trying to achieve industrial structures that make sense in order to invest in a wide range of projects in a wide range of places. If there is a particular tax avoidance pattern that the Treasury is trying to attack retrospectively, the two cases could be separated—some cases, which were never more than wheezes, could be attackable even quasi-retrospectively, while others, in which people were genuinely trying to engage in the development of international trading business, could be exempted, except in future cases.

<P>

<B>Mr. Flight:</B> In terms of the motive, is it merely a legacy of colonial preference? Alternatively, is there a more current ingredient in terms of an efficient incentive to assist developing economies? For example, the one thing that India needs is power stations. If it were rendered tax-attractive for British companies to build them, that would be a contemporary motivation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> My hon. Friend is right that there is a logic to the measure in the case of less developed countries in relation to which our companies benefit from tax sparing. However, I believe that Singapore is one of the countries referred to. The Government of Singapore would be grossly insulted by its categorisation as a less developed country, as it is actually richer than ours—it certainly has a highly developed economy. Arguably, along with Switzerland, it has one of the two most successful economies in the world. Interestingly, both those countries lie outside any of the major trade blocs. Thereby hangs another tale, and a lesson for Government Members.
<P>
I cannot see that there is a developmental justification for sparing in the case of Singapore and other such countries. There would be a case for restricting and widening tax sparing—restricting it to less developed countries and widening it to those that are not ex-colonies. The Secretary of State for International Development might be interested in that idea. If that were done, I could see the point of the measure; at the moment I see little point in it. However, it is locked into treaty and is no doubt an inheritance that will take many years to correct. That means of addressing the problem has, or is likely to have, an unfair effect on some United Kingdom companies that is wrong and needs reversing.
<P>
My next incidental remark relates to the character of schedules 30 and 31. Schedule 31 will be debated with even more vigour than this one, alas, if we are to judge by what we have been told about the Government's attitude to it. Both schedules, at least as originally conceived, are intended as a means of cleaning up the Act. In fact, however, they constitute a massive attack on the competitiveness of the United Kingdom as the site in which companies locate their headquarters and intermediate headquarters. That is the main issue that we will debate when we discuss paragraph 10.
<P>
Paragraph 6 is a symptom of the same disease, because it imposes on UK headquarter companies the remarkable obligation to be at least as clever as the Inland Revenue at minimising overseas tax. The paragraph states that in order to be able to use some overseas tax as a credit against UK tax, the headquarter company located in the UK needs to have taken
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>all reasonable steps . . . to minimise the amount of tax payable in
<P>
</UL></FONT>the overseas territory.
<P>
Anyone used to commercial contracts in any field knows that the ``all reasonable steps'' test is very severe. The courts will normally take the view that ``all reasonable steps'' include seeking the best possible and most expensive professional advice and going to a considerable amount of trouble to discover what is what.
<P>
Here we are talking about the need for UK companies, if they are to claim a piece of foreign tax as a credit against a piece of UK tax, to hire armies of professional advisers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Tax planners.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Exactly, tax planners, as my hon. Friend says from a sedentary position—the famous tax planners that the Paymaster General so often alludes to. The UK company needs to hire a band of tax planners to find out how far it can do to the foreign country what the Paymaster General so much resents UK companies doing in the UK. That is feasible: companies can do that. They can hire, at great expense, experts to tell them how far they can reduce tax in a foreign jurisdiction.
<P>
Part of the problem of allowing or encouraging tax planning—I have not heard the Paymaster General make this argument, but perhaps she will at some point; she certainly should—is that it tends to distort industrial decision making and commercial practice, as my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs and I are all too well aware. Very often it is not rational to engage in the ultimate tax value: if one tales one's eye off the commercial ball, one ends up minimising revenue—a jolly silly procedure.
<P>
Nevertheless, I admit that it is possible to take ``all reasonable steps'' to minimise tax. Those steps may include doing things that are not industrially sensible, but if one is to claim the UK tax, one will have to do them in the foreign country, whether they are industrially sensible or not. The schedule does not say ``Take all industrially sensible steps'', but ``Take all reasonable steps.'' I suspect that that will be interpreted by the courts to mean ``Take every step you can that involves doing all the normal and reasonable things, such as hiring expensive advisers and doing all the tax planning that you can.''
<P>
A dreadful fact is involved here that takes me back to the beginning of this part of my remarks. Who will judge in the first instance, before the matter reaches the courts or the commissioners, whether the company has taken all reasonable steps? It will be the Inland Revenue. The Inland Revenue is a body of great experts. We have much to be grateful for. If the Inland Revenue did not know what it was doing, we would all be in a much worse position than we are. It hires some very clever people. How it retains them I have never managed to work out, but it does.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I believe that the pleasure of sitting in the Room listening to the Committee debating the Finance Bill encourages people to feel that it is rewarding to work for the Inland Revenue.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Among the many speculative and wildly improbable estimations, that is the most implausible of all. I cannot imagine why a rational individual, who must be able to earn multiples of what he earns in the Inland Revenue, should sit there earning a pittance, and working day and night for the taxpayer, but people do it. It is a wonderful thing.
<P>
The Inland Revenue properly has access to large resources not available to the private sector. It can correspond, as one Government to another, with other Governments. Indeed, I suspect that its officials regularly attend seminars and discussions with other Governments about taxation matters.
<P>
For all those reasons, one would expect the Inland Revenue to be extraordinarily well-informed about the things that can be done by UK companies to minimise tax in foreign jurisdictions. I am not saying that it will necessarily be better informed than the best informed of the greatest accountancy firms. I suspect that it is a roughly equal battle of titans: sometimes the Inland Revenue will be ahead and sometimes the accountancy firms. However, a small or medium-sized UK company with an overseas subsidiary, which is hiring a relatively downbeat local firm to search out tax minimisation devices, is likely to find itself from time to time not having minimised its tax nearly as well as the Inland Revenue could have done. The Inland Revenue will then come to the not unreasonable conclusion that not all reasonable steps have been taken, on the ground that it can see steps that have not been taken that could reasonably have been taken. A court might rule that it was not reasonable to demand that a small or medium-sized company should hire the world's best accountants. However, the weight of rulings about the phrase, ``all reasonable steps'' in relation to most kinds of commercial contract does not suggest that the courts will interpret it in that way. I am not even sure that the phrase is intended to have that effect—if that had been the intention, the provisions would have been more constrained.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Committee members are concerned about the fact that it is unjust for that imposition to be placed on our firms. However, a bigger concern is about the cumulative effect that this proposal, the schedule and schedule 31 will have on major multinational companies that are considering whether to headquarter in the UK and are asking themselves about double tax relief. If this provision is enacted, their professional advisers will tell them that there is an onerous provision in the UK, which does not apply in other regimes in which exemption is the practice—the Netherlands springs to mind—namely, that if they are to claim double tax relief in the UK, they have to be sure that they have done everything that they can reasonably do to find out whether they have minimised tax in what may be dozens of different and complicated tax jurisdictions. That will go a long way towards vitiating and invalidating the great benefit that arises from the fact that we have one of the best networks of double tax relief treaties in the world. It is precious little use having the benefit of the network of tax treaties if one has to spend millions of pounds hiring the greatest experts in the world to find out how to minimise tax in Tanzania. I inform the Paymaster General, from personal experience, that finding out what taxes are in Tanzania—let along trying to minimise them—is very—
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> My hon. Friend has rightly said that the tax treaties are an enormous advantage to this country, but do they not have an end date, at which point they have to be renegotiated? If Britain got a reputation, on behalf of its companies, for being highly tax aggressive in the countries to which multinationals go, how easy will it be to continue with those tax treaties when they come up for renegotiation?
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> My hon. Friend makes a very good point, which I had not previously thought of. I agree with him that if multinationals continue to locate here, notwithstanding the huge attack that the Government are mounting in schedules 30 and 31, and follow the rules in paragraph 6, some years later we may discover that some jurisdictions are not too happy about having double tax relief treaties with the UK. If they signed such treaties with the Netherlands, the companies that would benefit from exemption would not bother officiously to minimise the tax, but if they were dealing with a UK-headquartered company, armies of the cleverest accountants would descend on them to establish how to minimise tax in their regimes.
<P>
Incidentally, whether or not my hon. Friend's prophesy is fulfilled—in other words, whether or not multinational companies end up being headquartered here—it is clear that if any measure would tend to militate against the noble effort of the Secretary of State for International Development to foster simplicity and transparency in the tax relief for lesser developed countries, this provision is it. The Ugandan finance Minister might wake up one morning and discover that the efforts of the Paymaster General and her colleagues meant that an army of accountants from PricewaterhouseCoopers and Arthur Andersen had descended on him. They might find 3 million new ways to avoid tax in Uganda—I am sure that there are many ways to do that that no one has bothered to explore. His response would be to go to the World Bank, borrow some money to hire the other accountancy firms that have not been engaged in the process—or even to hire the same ones—and reconstruct huge elaborations of the tax regime to prevent this eventuality. The Paymaster General would then have created the unfortunate side effect of providing an incentive for additional complexity in the tax regimes of far-flung countries that the Secretary of State for International Development is trying desperately to make simpler.
<P>
The best thing to do would be to scrap paragraph 6 of the schedule wholesale and start afresh. If some unidentified—to me—mischief is being addressed here, and people in the UK are genuinely not doing the work that they should be to find out how to achieve reasonable tax planning in other countries, we must examine how that problem could be solved. The paragraph does far too much; it is an enormous blunderbuss that will shoot all sorts of innocent people, and it should be removed altogether.
<P>
You might have thought, Mr. Cook, that I could now turn to paragraph 10 and discuss the main problem, but unfortunately we have not finished yet. Paragraph 8 forms another part of the attack on the UK as a destination of choice for multinationals seeking a location for their headquarters. I find it difficult to explain what paragraph 8 is about, and what the problem is, so I hope that the Paymaster General and other members of the Committee will bear with me as I try to explain the character of its effect and of the problem.
<P>
At present—I think that I am right in saying that it is since the 1960s—under the ruling in a case involving Bowater, the amount of tax credit that one receives in relation to dividends remitted from one of one's overseas subsidiaries is proportional to the ratio of that dividend to the underlying profit of the subsidiary. To put that into easy numbers, if I, as a UK-headquartered company, had an overseas subsidiary with a profit before tax of £100 and a dividend-to-payout ratio of two, so that I was delivering a dividend of £50 back home, and if my overall tax bill in that country were £30, the amount of tax that I could relieve in relation to that dividend would be one half—50/100—of the £30 chargeable against the total profit. In this example, that would be £15. There would be nothing wrong with that.
<P>
However, paragraph 8 contains a redefinition of the profit before tax. Line 44 on page 506 describes ``profits available for distribution''. I shall try to explain how the effect of the redefinition will be significantly to reduce the amount of credit available in relation to the dividend.
<P>
In paragraph 8(2), new subsection (6)(b)—the first two lines on page 507—states that the definition of the profits available for distribution—in my example, the £100 figure—should make
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>no provision for reserves, bad debts or contingencies other than such as is required to be made under that law.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
``That law'' means the law of the foreign jurisdiction.
<P>
Let us turn to an example—I shall not cite that of Zimbabwe, because it is a bad and controversial one—which I should stress is invented. Although I have no precise knowledge of tax laws in Uganda, it will have a set of such laws. Perhaps Ugandan law specifies what provision must be made for reserves, bad debts or contingencies in the tax accounts of Ugandan firms, but on the basis of my professional knowledge of adjacent countries, I suspect that it does not. Certainly, many countries do not make such provisions in detail.
<P>
In countries where the law is not specific—an interesting example is the UK—auditors tell the company what is a reasonable provision for
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>reserves, bad debts or contingencies.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Or, more accurately, auditors discuss with the board possible reasonable provisions. My right hon. Friend the Member for Wells, who has considerable experience in such matters, will know that, on the whole, after a little negotiation and argy-bargy, boards will largely accept their auditors' view of a fair provision for contingencies such as unfunded pension liabilities. That is a perfectly ordinary and proper commercial proceeding. Over-provision and under-provision would lead auditors to qualify the accounts, so in general, companies follow their auditors' advice about what is a proper provision. That is particularly true of countries with undeveloped company law in which almost nothing is specified, and where virtually all matters are decided by auditors.
<P>
Let us consider the problem of a UK-headquartered multinational that has a subsidiary in a country where the law on such points is unspecific. The subsidiary makes a perfectly proper provision or reserve against bad debts or contingencies, which auditors specifically endorse—indeed, perhaps implicitly demand—but the law does not demand. In such a case, for UK double tax purposes, the multinational would have to count its profits as significantly higher than its stated profits, because it would have to subtract reserves or provisions made in that year that were mandated not by local law, but by its own auditors. Having subtracted the reserves or provisions and hence increased its profit before tax—my £100 figure, say, rising to £200—it would reduce the proportion of the profit before tax represented by the dividends remitted to the UK, if the dividend pay-out ratio on its genuine accounting profits were to remain constant. In doing so, it would diminish its ability to claim UK tax back for tax paid in the foreign jurisdiction.
<P>
I apologise, Mr. Cook, for that lengthy explanation of an intricate point.

<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Is not this issue particularly pertinent to developing economies? Taken collectively, the risk of non-payment in various business areas is high, so part of the assessment—particularly where the business is a capital investment—must build into the financial investment model the likelihood of non-payment.
<P>
If paragraph 8 has that effect, it will blow out of the window the financial basis of many operations in developing economies.
