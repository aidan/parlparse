<H4><center>New Clause 6</center></H4>
<H4><center>Avoidance of certain contractual terms relating to health records</center></H4>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>". (1)Any term or condition of a contract is void in so far as it purports to require an individual to supply any other person with a record to which this section applies, or with a copy of such a record or a part of such a record.

Brought up, and read the First time.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department (Mr. Geoffrey Hoon):</B> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<P>
Good morning, Mr. Stevenson. I welcome you back to the Committee.
<P>
New clause 6 is part of the set of amendments that relate to the Gaskin judgment, which the Committee debated some time ago. With the exception of records that relate to the deceased, the Gaskin package provides that all those records to which the Access to Health Records Act 1990 currently applies should be brought within the scope of the Bill. Section 9 of the 1990 Act makes void any terms or conditions of contract that purport to require individuals using their access rights under that Act to gain access to their health records to supply other people with those records. The new clause duplicates that provision and brings it within the terms of the Bill.
<P>
Provision of that kind was originally made in amendments Nos. 170 and 173. However, we realised after those amendments had been tabled that they did not work quite as we had intended, and we have accordingly withdrawn them. They have been replaced by new clause 6 and amendments Nos. 263 and 279.

<B>Mr. John Greenway (Ryedale):</B> I, too, welcome you back to the Committee, Mr. Stevenson. You will be aware that we have made substantial progress since you were last with us.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I shall soon put an end to that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> The Committee is hopefully now on the home straight.
<P>
We broadly support the new clause. Its provisions are not dissimilar to the subject access provisions the new clause 5 that we debated at some length on Tuesday. However, there is one point that I should like to raise. A health record might be important under a contract or potential contract between the data subject and the data controller. However, it is usual to cover that by means of a declaration that gives express consent to allow access to the health records of a data subject's general practitioner or to his medical and hospital records. For example, that express consent would be given on an application for life assurance. I cannot see that this measure would outlaw the long-established procedures whereby people give their consent that a life assurance company, for example, may gain access to their medical records. Will the Minister write to me clarifying that? Subject to his assurance on that, we shall be happy to support the new clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. I shall look at the matter in more detail and write to him in due course. 
<P>

<H4><center>New Clause 8</center></H4>

<P>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>". (1) This section applies to

<H4><center>New Clause 9</center></H4>
<H4><center>Political canvassing</center></H4>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>".The records of canvassing of political opinions however obtained are exempt from the provisions of this Bill.". [Mr. Greenway.]
<P>
</UL></FONT>Brought up, and read the First time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<P>
Alert members of the Committee will observe that the name of my right hon. Friend the Member for Sutton Coldfield (Sir N. Fowler) appears on the amendment paper for the first time. While welcoming that, I should dispel any concern that the new clause was tabled in view of the change in the leadership of the shadow Home Office earlier this week. I make that introductory comment because, as I suspect that the Minister knows, my right hon. Friend the Member for North-West Cambridgeshire (Sir B. Mawhinney) and the Home Secretary have had discussions over several months about whether the Bill's provisions affect political canvassing and the records of it. The Minister was a shadow spokesman at the Department of Trade and Industry when the original draft directive was laid and will recall that there was some argument about that in one of the European Standing Committees.
<P>
Arguably, political opinions are sensitive data under clause 2. Under schedule 3, paragraph 1, sensitive data cannot be processed without the data subject's explicit consent unless one of several conditions is satisfied. Paragraph 2 deals with employment, so we make no progress there. Paragraph 3 talks about
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the vital interests of the data subject",</UL></FONT>
<P>
but we draw a blank about the data controller, the political party. Paragraph 4 deals with the legitimate activities of a non-profit body that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"exists for political, philosophical, religious or trade-union purposes".</UL></FONT>
<P>
That looks more encouraging, except that the data subject must be either a member of such an organisation or someone in regular contact with it. Five-yearly canvassing of voters to find out whether they will continue to support you in Stoke-on-Trent, Mr. Stevenson, would not be covered. Equally, we draw a blank with the exemptions in paragraphs 5, 6 and 8 paragraph 7 has been deleted.
<P>
Paragraph 9 is slightly more promising and we will return to it later. It refers to personal data
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"processed in circumstances specified in an order made by the Secretary of State for the purposes of this paragraph."</UL></FONT>
<P>
That might be a possibility. Are the Government considering the idea of an order-making power to cover the processing of canvassing records?
<P>
The new clause or something similar would remove all doubt. I do not suggest for a moment that the wording that we propose is necessarily correct. I want the Minister to describe what the Government consider to be the correct approach. Does the Bill permit the processing of canvassed political opinions without the explicit consent of the data subject? If so, how does it do so? If not, what do the Government intend to do about the matter? Would not it be better for the Bill, rather than an order, to make the matter clear? If so, what is wrong with the new clause?
<P>
I have said that we do not want to prolong the argument. We can return to the matter on Report if it cannot be dealt with satisfactorily this morning. My understanding is that the Home Secretary is not clear about it. It would be in the interests of hon. Members and of the democratic process if the long-established traditions of canvassing opinion on the doorstep, by telephone or any other means available in the future were not outlawed by the Bill. The inclusion of political opinion in clause 2, which follows article 9 of the directive, is to cover more serious matters. It cannot be intended to make life difficult for people engaged in the proper democratic process.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robert Syms </B>(Poole): I support my hon. Friend the Member for Ryedale (Mr. Greenway): this important matter needs to be thrashed out now. What is "consent"? Is it given when a person is asked for an opinion on the doorstep or by means of a telephone call?
<P>
Nowadays, records are kept on the constituency office computer and sometimes one mails directly constituents party members and presumed supporters with draw tickets and so on. On occasions, that causes difficulty even with people whose votes one has secured. The problem must be sorted out so as to avoid problems in the political process.
<P>
What is sensitive information when it comes to employment? It is right and proper that political[Mr. Robert Syms]
opinions should be included in an employees's employment file only with that person's permission. However, the information may not be sensitive in terms of the body politic it is meat and drink to politicians to try to assess the political opinions of 65,000 or 70,000 electors.
<P>
An anxiety raised earlier in the debate about the Bill had to do with whether local authorities could sell electoral registers to political parties. The question of canvassing is vital for all parties. At present, one can buy from a local council's registration officers a list of people who have voted in an election. Is that sensitive political information, even though there is no indication of how votes were cast?
<P>
Such information is useful in local elections. One discovers that all the people who promised their vote did not turn out. As a county councillor I kept a marked register, in which I underlined the name of everyone who had turned out to vote. I purchased that information from the returning offier. Many people would telephone and say, "I voted for you and I want you to deal with a problem with my hedge." Being a helpful person, I would do my best, but I would also check whether those people had voted. Probably 50 per cent. of the time, they had not. That gave me a personal sense of satisfaction.
<P>
This important matter needs to be sorted out. Later today, on the Floor of the House, we shall debate the registration of political parties and consider party funding. It would seem rather silly if at this stage, in order to protect certain people's rights, we make it impossible for those of us in democratic politics to ascertain and mark down how people are going to vote if we know and to keep those records without running into difficulties with those constituents who want to make life difficult for us. I should be interested to hear the Minister's response to that.
<P>
<B>Dr. Nick Palmer </B>(Broxtowe): As I said to Ministers earlier, the amendment does not cover all the cases that arise. I had never been canvassed until recently, but I have a letter from Sir Cecil Parkinson which says that as a long-standing member of the Conservative party, I should vote in local elections, otherwise the seat might fall. As that information was not obtained by canvassing, it must have been obtained by some other, equally reliable, means.
<P>
<B>Mr. Richard Allan </B>(Sheffield, Hallam): There is some concern about a new clause that entirely exempts political canvassing from the Bill's scope. Canvassing is certainly within the scope of the 1984 Act; we would be taking a step outside that.
<P>
Like the hon. Members for Ryedale and for Poole (Mr. Syms), I do not want the Bill to prevent canvassing in future, but people should have the same entitlement as they would with any other data to see what data is held on them and to have it corrected if it is inaccurate. A provision that entirely exempts such data concerns me. I hope that the Minister will say that we can accommodate this in the Bill, as we did in the 1984 Act.

<P>

<B>Mr. Brian White </B>(Milton Keynes, North-East): Is the hon. Gentleman aware that the Data Protection Registrar said this year to some local authorities that it was wrong to give the electoral register to political parties via electronic means? It was her view that the 1984 Act prevented that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I had heard about that, but it is a slightly different point, as it relates to the responsibility of electoral registration officers and why they collect their data in the six months within which they give it out. I was referring to us as politicians. I suspect that most hon. Members in this Room will have registered with the Data Protection Register to hold the canvassing data that we already have. We have to do that as data controllers of the data that we hold on our constituents. It would be appropriate for the provision in the 1984 Act whereby we register for permission to hold the data, which our constituents have the right to see and have corrected to be carried forward into this Act.
<P>
The blanket exemption is useful to raise the debate, but in reality it would go far further than we would be happy with.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I recognise that this is a matter of considerable sensitivity.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The hon. Gentleman has a smile on his face.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I am looking forward to the spontaneous support that I shall receive from all my hon. Friends in a few moments.
<P>
As I said, this is an issue of considerable sensitivity for all Committee members. It raises the question of the extent to which data on individuals' political opinions, obtained in the course of canvassing, come within the scope of the Bill.
<P>
The hon. Member for Poole gave us some insight into the difficulties that his party has had in recent months when he said that he had written to people whom he assumed to be Conservative party supporters. Clearly, the difficulty was that his assumptions were not entirely accurate, although his presence in the Committee indicates that he got it partly right, even if his colleagues elsewhere may not have done so.
<P>
It is clear that the scale of the problem is much greater for Labour Members than it is for Opposition Members, but I recognise the issues that the hon. Member for Ryedale properly raised. He asked the interesting and perhaps slightly rhetorical question whether canvassing is allowed under the Bill. It is allowed, but recording the results is the problem.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> There is no point canvassing unless we record the results.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I come from a part of the world where it is extraordinarily difficult to persuade party members to record the results, because they tend to find the exercise tedious. However, I appreciate that there are difficulties for Conservative Members. We shall have to consider the issue carefully.
<P>
The Government cannot accept the new clause because it would put us squarely in breach of the directive. The point that the hon. Member for Poole raised about those who turn out highlights the difficulties that we have in relation to the directive, which deals with political opinions. Clearly, whether people turn out to vote is not relevant to their political opinion, but the directive deals fairly and squarely with recording political opinions. That is the problem, and accepting the new clause would put us in breach of the directive.
<P>
Article 8.1 of the directive makes it clear that data about individuals' political opinions are sensitive personal data. The Bill reflects that in clause 2(b), which says that data about individuals' political opinion come within the definition of "sensitive" and therefore involve a different regime. The consequence of that is that, in order for such data to be processed, one of the tests in schedule 3 of the Bill would have to be satisfied, as well as one of the tests in schedule 2. Any proposal such as that in the new clause would have to overcome the hurdle that the directive requires sensitive data to be treated in a different way.
<P>
The first condition in schedule 3 is that personal data are processed with the explicit consent of the data subject. My brief states that, in some circumstances, it will be possible to ensure that political opinions data collected in the course of canvassing are processed with the explicit consent of the individuals concerned.
<P>
One suggestion is that canvassers of political opinion should ask for consent and that that could be recorded in a computer. I am sure that that exercise would go down well and that Conservative canvassers, like Labour ones, would find it productive. I could certainly urge the hon. Member for Ryedale to instruct Conservative party members to tell those whom they canvass that they intend to record the results in a computer. I am sure that explicit consent would be provided. I recognise that that would not assist in many cases, but consent is one possibility.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> The normal method of canvassing is to turn up on a doorstep with a clipboard. One puts a big, easily visible tick against the name of the person who opens the door if one manages to secure that person's vote. Does that qualify as consent, or must one ask a second, explicit question? That is a crucial question for all hon. Members.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> Well 
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> This is a nightmare.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I am urging that approach on other parties. My judgment is that explicit consent would be required. In any event, we are really talking about the transmission of the data into other contexts. Although a clipboard record would count for the purposes of the Bill, there is no doubt that the information gathered would be recorded in other ways. Even a manual record would be caught by the Bill, and most political parties now would record the information by automatic means.
<P>
I cannot see that a person implicitly consents to the recording of political opinions simply because a Liberal Democrat canvasser happens to have a clipboard. I assure the Committee that getting party members in Ashfield to have even a clipboard would be progress.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Taylor </B>(Esher and Walton): I am puzzled on one point. What recourse does the canvasser have against misrepresentation by the person whom he canvasses? In parts of my constituency, my canvass returns showed that I got 90 per cent. of the vote.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> If nothing else, the debate gives us all a tremendous insight into what went wrong with the Conservative campaign at the general election.
<P>
The question arises as to whether any of the other conditions in schedule 3 are relevant. I shall not go through all the various conditions: suffice it to say that in some circumstances it may be possible to rely on some of the other conditions, but they are far from comprehensive.
<P>
The realistic way forward is the option of an order under paragraph 9 of schedule 3 specifying the specfic circumstances in which political opinion data may be processed. Article 8.4 of the directive, on which the order-making power in paragraph 9 relies, provides that member states may set additional conditions for the processing of sensitive data, provided that the processing is in the substantial public interest and that reasonable safeguards apply.
<P>
Recital 36 of the directive helpfully clarifies that processing of political opinion data by political parties in the course of electoral activities may be permitted for reasons of substantial public interest, provided that safeguards apply. In their July 1997 White Paper setting out their proposals for the Bill, the Government identified a possible need for an order under what is now paragraph 9 of schedule 3.
<P>
We are still working out how that can be achieved, and precisely what the content of such an order might be. We will take the matter forward as part of the large volume of work necessary to prepare appropriate subordinate legislation. I make it clear to the Committee that the government view the matter as being of considerable importance and that we expect to take it forward in consultation with other political parties. It requires careful consideration. We want to make progress, but we recognise, as I hope other Committee members do, the constraints that the directive places upon us.
<P>
In those circumstances and with that assurance I hope that the hon. Member for Ryedale will agree that this is the best and most appropriate way in which to deal with the issue. I hope that he will agree to withdraw the motion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I suggested that the order-making power under paragraph 9 was a possible way forward. I am grateful for the Minister's affirmative response and for his assurance that that is the Government's intention. I do not wish to prolong the debate, but I suspect that hon. Members will wish to debate the matter further on the Floor of the House as it will concern many of us.
<P>
I should like to pose one rhetorical question to the Minister. I may have missed something, and he may be able to answer straight away, but can one assume that the Bill will receive Royal Assent before the summer recess?
<P>
<B>Mr. Greg Pope </B>(Hyndburn) indicated assent.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I am grateful for the silent one's acknowledgement, not least because I should like to get Report over with so that we can get on to other things.
<P>
Unless and until the order-making power under paragraph 9 is brought into effect, the problem that we have all recognised will exist. While no national elections will occur until May and June of next year, there will be by-elections. The transitional arrangements may for some reason mean that this element of the legislation is delayed. Either the provisions have legislative force or they do not until a specific date. If they do, the order-making power should be quickly agreed and put in place. Otherwise, we could be in for an even more debilitating experience at the European elections next June. I say debilitating because of what was said in the House about the European Parliamentary Elections Bill. Unless the matter is quickly resolved, we will have a double dog's breakfast. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 137, in page 43, line 23, leave out from "information" to "in" in line 24.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss Goverment amendment No. 138.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> Both amendments affect paragraph 9 of part II of schedule 1. I shall deal first with amendment No. 137.
<P>
Paragraph 9 provides interpretation of the sixth data protection principle. It is the key to the commissioner powers to enforce data controllers' observance of the rights that are conferred on data subjects by part II of the Bill.
<P>
Sub-paragraph (a) is concerned with clause 7, which deals with subject access. It says that a person contravenes the sixth principle so far as clause 7 is concerned if and only if he fails to supply information that has been duly requested in accordance with that clause.
<P>
A person can fail to supply information in contravention of clause 7 in either of two ways. In the first place, he can fail to comply properly with a subject access request. Amendment No. 137 makes it clear that that can cover a failure to provide all the information to which the data subject is entitled and a failure to do so in accordance with all the requirements of the clause as to time limits, form and so on.
<P>
In the second place, the data controller can fail to comply with the requirement that would be introduced by new clause 4, which the Committee has now agreed, to give the data subject certain information about his rights and the remedies that are available to him. That duty would not depend on a request having been made. Amendment No. 137 makes it clear that a failure to give that information will also amount to a contravention of the sixth data protection principle.
<P>
I now come on to amendment No. 138.
<P>
The Committee will recall that it agreed to delete subsection (2) of clause 10, which imposed a duty on data controllers to respond in writing to written notices from individuals who object to the use of their data for direct marketing purposes. 
<P>
Amendment No. 138 is consequential on the deletion of clause 10(2). It deletes a reference in paragraph 9 of part II of schedule 1 to notices that are given under clause 10(2).
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
 <P>
Amendment made: No. 138, in page 43, line 28, leave out from "section" to "or" in line 30. [Mr. Hoon.]
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 289, in page 43, line 39, leave out from "(a)" to "unauthorised" and insert "the risks represented by".
<P>
The amendment suggests that we leave out the words
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the harm that might result"</UL></FONT>
<P>
from line 39 of page 43 and replace them with the words "the risks represented by". This is another drafting amendment that the Data Protection Registrar suggested.
<P>
Article 17.1 of the directive refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"a level of security appropriate to the risks represented by the processing".</UL></FONT>
<P>
Harm is not the same as risk, which has a wider meaning and adds flexibility. Assessing risk means taking account not only of the harm that might result but threat and vulnerability.
<P>
The directive anticipated the risk-based approach and it is difficult to understand why the Government have moved away from it to the harm approach. A risk-based approach is widely accepted by practitioners as the correct approach to information security. Indeed, it is a requirement of the scheme for formal certification to BS7799 on information security management, which the Department of Trade and Industry launched earlier this year. The risk is assessed and the security controls appropriate to managing it are then applied. That process is widely used in the insurance, credit reference and credit record industries. The reference to harm in the Bill is not only a significant departure from the directive, but also departs from best practice and from Government guidance on information security. We therefore agree with the Data Protection Registrar that the amendment would enable the Bill to implement more correctly the intention of article 17.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> It is necessary to go a little further than the hon. Member for Ryedale has and consider not only the amendment but the implications for those who will operate the Bill. Against that background, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will give some thought to the practical implications of the amendment.
<P>
Paragraph 10 of part II of schedule 1 is the interpretation provision for the seventh data protection principle, which deals with processing security. It is currently expressed by reference to the harm that might result if inadequate security measures allowed unauthorised or unlawful processing to take place.
<P>
As the hon. Member for Ryedale said, the amendment would substitute for the concept of the possibility of harm arising that of unauthorised or unlawful processing representing risks. He said that he borrowed those words from article 17 of the directive. Committee members will know indeed, they have agreed that in a number of areas in the Bill, it is not appropriate to follow slavishly the precise wording of the directive. This is one of those areas. The Government think it better to develop our own wording. Not only will our words achieve exactly the effect required by the directive, but they are clearer and of greater practical benefit to those who will have to implement the principles.
<P>
We could have a long semantic debate on the impact of risk, but I hope that the hon. Member for Ryedale accepts the general principle of law that it is usually necessary to prove a degree of damage. The words "damage" and "harm" can be taken together. There are not many actions before the courts that are based simply on the prospect of there being a problem.
<P>
We want to ensure that in the event of unauthorised processing, there are consequences, which need to be made clear before there is any breach of the principle. That seems a more practical way of processing than using the vague word "risk", which invites the question, "What risk?" The answer would appear to be that there is some risk of harm. It is better to ensure that the Bill requires proof of harm or damage as a result of unauthorised processing.
<P>
That is why we believe that the Bill is clearer and more focused than the hon. Gentleman's proposal. It will provide a better guide for those who have to administer it and is entirely consistent with the effect that the directive requires. I hope that in the circumstances, having particular regard to the needs of the businesses that will have to deal with this provision, that hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I am grateful to the Minister. We had several debates about this on Tuesday, but it is important that we explore the drafting suggestions made by the Data Protection Registrar. In essence, what the Minister said this is a serious point is that the Government take a view about what would be the best means of implementing the directive. I will not argue with his judgment of whether the wording meets the directive's requirement, that is a matter for the Government, but there may be a world of difference between what the legislation will require of business and what business will choose to do about processing security.
<P>
My gut feeling is that the majority of businesses will adopt a risk-based approach. The Minister suggests that the Government are satisfied that the use of the word "harm" is adequate for the directive's purposes and I concede that it is potentially a more certain test.
<P>
It was important to explore the matter and on the basis of what the Minister said, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That this schedule, as amended, be the First schedule to the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Taylor:</B> In Tuesday's debate, I raised the problem of international co-operation under the eighth principle of schedule 1. I asked the Parliamentary Under-Secretary to write to me before Report, if the Minister was a co-signatory to that letter I should have even more confidence in the reply.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I am sure that my hon. Friend will respond as he promised to do.
<P>
Schedule 1, as amended, agreed to.
<H4><center>Schedule 2</center></H4>
<H4><center>Conditions relevant for purposes of the first principle: processing of any personal data</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 193, in page 45, line 15, leave out from "disclosed" to end of line 17 and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"except where such interests are overridden by the interests of fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject.".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This is one of a series of discussions, which I hope will be relatively brief, on the important subject of the anti-fraud activities of commercial organisations such as banks, credit companies and finance and insurance companies. I hope to persuade the Minister that the schedule's wording could be strengthened in three or four places to make the position clearer.
<P>
Schedule 6(2) attempts to balance the legitimate interests of data controllers with the important objective of not prejudicing the rights, freedoms or legitimate interests of data subjects. We discussed the importance of anti-fraud risk assessment activities earlier. A note from the British Bankers Association presents the following scenario: if a bank keeps a record of having given notice of some suspicious customer activity to the police, it could, arguably, be permitted under paragraph (3) on the basis that there is a legal obligation under the money laundering legislation. If it is not covered by one of the specific criteria, the questions arises whether it would be covered by paragraph 6(1) on the basis that the balance between the legitimate interests of the data controller and the legitimate interests of the data subject tips in the controller's favour because of the general public interest. It could be argued that crime prevention is in the public interest, and we will come to the prevention and detection of crime in the debate on a subsequent amendment. Because this is sensitive data, other problems arise.
<P>
One way to ensure that the balance is properly struck is to examine the schedule's wording. We suggest that the amendment contains a better balance. Generally, rights and freedoms are described in the Bill as having to be "fundamental", but that word is not included in paragraph 6, which refers to "unwarranted" processing. Who is to say what is "unwarranted"? Would not it be better to say that individual rights and freedoms must override the data controller's interests? That question was raised in another place by my noble Friend Viscount Chelmsford and by Lord Norton. A letter dated 10 February from Lord Williams of Mostyn states that my noble Friend Viscount Chelmsford referred to the "sixth criterion" as a way of permitting anti-fraud activity. It adds that the sixth criterion should be "of wide application". We can only speculate what that[Mr. Greenway]
means. However, it suggests the need to be flexible and to get right the balance of interests. It is easier to argue on behalf of a data subject that processing is unwarranted; it might be more difficult to argue that his interests override those of the data controller.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The amendment would require a data subject to establish that his fundamental rights and freedoms override the legitimate interests of the data controller. In terms of anti-fraud activity, I am sure that the Committee can agree that those interests are legitimate. The amendment would achieve the wide application that Lord Mostyn wanted. I should be grateful for the Minister's opinion on the preferred wording in the Bill.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> One again, the amendment would substitute wording based more closely on the directive, in this case article 7(f). The directive's intention is that the legitimate interests of the data should be weighed against the interests or the fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject.
<P>
The wording in paragraph 6 of schedule 2 reflects the directive's intention since it incorporates the two elements the data subject's interests and his or her rights or freedoms. We believe that the formulation that we have incorporated in paragraph 6 is preferable to that adapted from the directive, as it is clearer and more capable of objective assessment.
<P>
The directive refers to the controller's interests being "overridden" by those of the data subject. We think that it would be difficult for both controllers and data subjects in the first instance, and the commissioner and the courts later, to decide whether one person's interests or rights and freedoms override the legitimate interests of another person. How can that decision be made simply on the words of the directive as they stand? Some mechanism for achieving the necessary balance needs to be introduced. We bear in mind here that article 5 of the directive requires us to "determine more precisely" how things work.
<P>
We believe that a clearer test is whether the particular processing is unwarranted by reason of prejudice to the interests or rights and freedoms of the data subject. In short, therefore, we think that our wording achieves exactly the effect that the directive intends, but that it does it in a clearer and more helpful way.
<P>
We are supported in that by representatives of the business community, who are more than content with the likely operation of schedule 6(2).
<P>
I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept our wording, which is more practical, and will withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I shall certainly seek the leave of the Committee to withdraw the amendment, but I think that the Minister and I must agree to differ on this matter. No doubt we shall exchange views again at a later stage outside the Committee. I have been led to believe that the business community would prefer our wording. The Minister's officials have clearly found it difficult to formulate a wording that is suitable to everyone.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> At a meeting yesterday representatives of the Confederation of British Industry said that they were more than happy with the formulation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I was not aware of that meeting. Perhaps the organisations that have put a different point of view to me should raise with the CBI the extent to which their interests were protected in the discussions. However, I shall not labour the point.
<P>
One of paragraph 6's weaknesses is that it does not include the word "fundamental", in the sense that the
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"rights and freedoms or legitimate interests of the data subject"
<P>
must be fundamental. If that word is not included, there is a danger of arguments about the rights and freedoms or legitimate interests of the data subject. Will the Minister consider the addition of the word "fundamental", as suggested by the amendment?
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I am happy to consider that. Will the hon. Gentleman state the difference between fundamental freedoms and other kinds of freedoms?
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I am glad that the Minister raised that point. We have argued during earlier sittings about what is fundamental and what is not. We arrived at the answer that the word "fundamental" means of extreme importance. In terms of the issue that we are discussing, someone might say, "I wish the data controller to stop processing information about my insurance claims or my failure to meet instalments on a finance agreement because that information is being shared with others". Does he have a fundamental right to say that? Is the company's action a breach of a fundamental right, or of a fundamental legitimate interest? If the word "fundamental" is not used, it could be said that the data subject's interests have been breached, because it would be against his interests that such processing was taking place.
<P>
We are engaging in semantics. I simply want the Minister to acknowledge that the paragraph will be regarded by the business community as being of great importance. The Government say that the business community can rely on the paragraph. The wording should therefore be of sufficient strength for that reliance to have the desired effect. That is what Lord Williams suggested in his letter to Lord Norton. I should like to withdraw the amendment, but should be grateful for a final comment from the Minister before I do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> For the avoidance of doubt, this is a balancing exercise. The paragraph seeks to reconcile opposing and potentially conflicting interests. That is what the directive requires of us. We propose a particular way of reconciling those ultimately conflicting interests and we prefer our wording, which is considered acceptable by those who are likely to be affected by it.
<P>
I appreciate that there are different ways to achieve the delicate balance, but the Government's approach is more persuasive than that of the amendment. In those circumstances and in the absence of powerful arguments to the contrary, we shall rest with the wording as drafted.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Schedule 2 agreed to.
<H4><center>Schedule 3</center></H4>
<H4><center>Conditions relevant for purposes of the first principle: processing of sensitive personal data</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 290, in page 45, line 23, after "has", insert "previously".
<P>
I suspect the Minister will say that this matter was also discussed yesterday by the CBI. He may say that about two or three later amendments.
<P>
Schedule 3 refers to sensitive data, which requires explicit consent for processing. In our discussion on an earlier amendment on anti-fraud measures, I read an extract from a note sent by the British Bankers Association. It went on to state,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"because the information is sensitive data, as defined in clause 2 of the Bill 
<P>
`personal data consisting of information as to . . .
<P>
(g) the commission or alleged commission by him'" </UL></FONT>
<P>
the data subject 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"of any offence, or
<P>
(h) any proceedings for any offence committed or alleged to have been committed by him, the disposal of such proceedings or the sentence of any court in such proceedings' it would also have to meet one of the Schedule 3 conditions."</UL></FONT>
<P>
We discussed the matter earlier in a debate on an amendment to delete those two subsections. I did not press the amendment to a Division, as I want to return to the issue later. I hope that my preamble will be helpful when we consider later amendments.
<P>
Some organisations are concerned about whether, in the context of sensitive data, consent previously given might subsequently be withdrawn, to the detriment of commercial organisations such as credit and finance companies. A letter, which I understand has been made available to members of the Committee, from the Credit Industry Fraud Avoidance System states that the current notification clauses used by member organisations on application forms and associated documents for credit clearly specify that the information provided might be used for fraud prevention purposes.
<P>
Thus the signing of the application form would clearly meet the requirement for explicit consent. The CIFAS would like to feel that no explicit consent would be required. The key issue for that organisation is whether consent could be revoked. That could be especially relevant if, for example, someone who was intent on defrauding a finance company, realising that the company would be processing data which might seek to expose that criminal activity, wrote to the company saying, "My consent is now withdrawn." The idea, which is entirely mine, is that that could be clarified by the addition of the word "previously". That would make it clear that explicit consent, previously given, would meet the requirements of the processing of such data. There may be other ways to help the finance and insurance industries, but they do not deal with the key point about whether the consent could be withdrawn, thus invalidating the anti-fraud processing. I look forward to the Minister's response.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> In the light of the initial comments by the hon. Member for Ryedale about the CBI, I am tempted to probe the Conservative party's attitude to business, but I realise that I might be out of order. There is a suspicion that the Conservatives do not treat the views of the business community as seriously as do the Government.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Taylor:</B> I make it clear that I have close relationships with the Association of British Chambers of Commerce and with the CBI. It just happens that the Government and the Conservative party agree on certain matters.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The Minister is right: we should get back to the amendment.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I take that mild hint, Mr. Stevenson, and return to schedule 3.
<P>
Schedule 3 is concerned with the processing of sensitive data: that is, information that falls into any of the categories set out in clause 2. If such data are to be processed, one of the conditions set out in schedule 3 must be satisfied, together with one of the conditions in schedule 2.
<P>
Paragraph 1 of schedule 3 allows the processing of sensitive data where the data subject has given his explicit consent to the processing. The amendment would add a requirement for that consent to have been given "previously". I take it that that means it must be given before the processing may start.
<P>
The amendment, and the comments by the hon. Member for Ryedale, raise the question of the nature and effectiveness of consent. That is not primarily a data protection issue, although it is an issue that falls to be determined in various places in the Bill. The Government are content for the issue of whether consent has been validly given to be determined by the courts int he normal way. The matter arises in other legal contexts and the courts are well used to handling it. It is better for the courts to decide according to ordinary principles of law than for the Bill to contain specific consent provisions.
<P>
I hope that the hon. Member for Ryedale can accept that explanation and withdraw the amendment.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> Is it feasible for a data subject to attempt to withdraw consent? Will it be helpful for credit and finance companies to be faced with significant legal proceedings if they choose to continue processing after a data subject attempts to withdraw consent? That frightens the life out of them, and I understand why.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B>  I appreciate the problem, but the hon. Gentleman is rehearsing a proposition that I have advanced already. The matter would have to be resolved by the courts, but consent that is withdrawn before it is acted on cannot be explicit consent. Consent can be explicit only for as long as the person giving it allows. I am sorry if that sounds as like a statement of the obvious, but the matter seems clear within the ordinary meaning of the expression "explicit consent".
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> The Minister confirms the credit industry's worst fear. I am not speaking about the withdrawal of consent before processing has started, but[Mr. Greenway]
about people who sign a form stating that they entirely agree that anti-fraud work will be done on their records. That is the explicit consent that is on the application form. If six months, a year or two years into a five-year finance agreement, a person deliberately chooses not to pay the money, the credit company could examine the circumstances. It could consider an easy way of blocking the activity, taking account of connections with other companies with which the person has done precisely the same thing. The company could expose the fraud perpetrated on it and others. The data subject could then write to the companies, telling them that they no longer have the consent that he gave them on the application form of which he would have been sent a copy and from which he would know what to do. The data subject would inform the company that he wished to withdraw his consent.
<P>
The company would have a choice. Anti-fraud measures would have to cease, or it would have to leave the data subject to take it to court because it did not stop the processing. That is a gamble that such companies may wish to take, and that is unsatisfactory.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> The hon. Gentleman is confusing a number of issues. He referred to contractual circumstances that could apply to a hire purchase agreement. Terms and conditions of operation would be written into such an agreement. If someone refused to pay, the person against whom the debt was owed would have the usual range of available contractual remedies. Data protection would be irrelevant at that point. The consent would apply under the contract and not as part of the general principles.
<P>
It is important to recognise that we are discussing the processing of sensitive data. A special regime is built into the directive and is incorporated in the Bill. It provides special safeguards, one of which is explicit consent. If the hon. Gentleman does not try to confuse the issue by referring to matters governed under the law of contract or governed in any other respect, the Committee will accept that the expression "explicit consent", both in ordinary English and as part of the law, is best left to the courts to resolve.
<P>
Amendment negatived.

<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> The amendment arises from concerns that were expressed to Liberal Democrats by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds and by the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. They may be shared by other organisations. Their specific concern is that they hold data about wildlife offenders that is often sensitive and personal. Such data are used to assist statutory authorities, such as the police, in the prosecution of wildlife offenders. A number of similar organisations will hold data, to assist the police and other statutory bodies, which fall outside the remit of those bodies' general work. The police, for example, do not have the resources to hold data on egg collectors.
<P>
I tabled the amendment because of the concerns of wildlife organisations, but I stress that it will also apply to organisations that are concerned with the prevention of cruelty to children and to financial fraud organisations and so on. The amendment would help to make it explicit that holding such data was appropriate where it was

That phrase is important. We are talking not about people holding sensitive data on an ad hoc basis because they feel like it, but about bodies with a formal link to organisations such as the police that would be able to hold data under the terms of the Bill.
<P>
We hope that the Government can give a positive answer to amendment No. 184. The only alternative is an order under paragraph 9. The organisations to which I have referred have had discussions with the Home Office about a commitment to make such an order. We hope that the Government are considering the matter favourably, even if they are not prepared to accept the amendment. The amendment would make matters more explicit. It would be preferable simply to relying on the orders, given that it could cover a clearly defined category of organisations.
<P>
Amendment No. 183 is intended to be helpful and would spell out the ways in which exemptions could be made for certain organisations. Otherwise, we are left with paragraph 9 as the only way to give specific exemptions. We have already discussed that in relation to political parties. An alternative to the order should be provided in the statutory code of practice to which we referred in amendment No. 183. That would be a useful way forward. A statutory code of practice for the handling of canvassing data could, for example, be discussed in the House and built into election law. That would be better than relying on the secondary powers of an order by the Secretary of State. That approach could equally apply to issues such as the holding of financial data. Codes of practice could be built into Bills to specify exemptions from the usual requirements of this Bill.
<P>
Both amendments would help the Government to make more explicit the exemptions that they will want to make rather than relying wholly on paragraph 9, which is less satisfactory than specific requirements in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> We have tabled several amendments in the group. Amendment No. 291 is similar to amendment No. 184, which was tabled by the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Allan). We have, however, left out the phrase.
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"to assist the statutory authorities",<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
although we believe that to be important. In essence, we are asking why we should limit the provision to the police. Why not allow all organisations that process material for the prevention and detection of crime to enjoy some exemption under schedule 3?
<P>
I shall deal first with the police element. This is the last time that I shall pray in aid the Data Protection Registrar, but she has suggested that data controllers satisfy one of the conditions in schedules 2 and 3 to legitimise the processing of sensitive data. It does not clear from the list of conditions in schedule 3 how the police could justify their processing of sensitive data. They are not involved in the administration of justice, and their functions are not always statutory because much policing arises from the common law. It is not clear that everyone involved in policing exercises a Crown function. It might, therefore, be appropriate to make an addition to the Bill to cover those circumstances, and amendment No. 291 is one suggestion. An inclusion in an order under paragraph 9 would, however, be equally appropriate.
<P>
For the convenience of the Committee, I shall leave amendment No. 292 aside for a moment and move on to amendment No. 277, which relates to paragraph 9. It would be helpful and would give some comfort to credit organisations and finance companies if the Bill were amended to require the Secretary of State to make suitable safeguards under the order-making power in paragraph 9. I do not want to suggest that those affected are not prepared to take some assurance from the Minister today that the Government have in mind such an order-making power indeed, it would be extremely welcome if, as a result of tabling the amendment, we received such an assurance.
<P>
The Minister will know that the CBI which he prayed in aid earlier sent a letter to all hon. Members conveying its concern that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the circumstances under which records of criminal convictions can be held are not extensive enough."</UL></FONT>
<P>
It went on:
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><P>
"We believe that certain businesses should be allowed to hold these data where they have specific responsibilities to protect the public and property or where there is a justifiable business need. We have outlined to the Home Office our reasons for believing that such data should be processed in these situations, not covered expressly in Schedule 3 to the Bill. We have put forward an argument for an order to be made under paragraph 9 of Schedule 3. We await a decision from the Home Office on this issue."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Thus, the CBI thinks that an order is the appropriate means of doing that. The British Bankers Association and the credit industry fraud avoidance programme, to which I referred earlier, argued similarly.
<P>
We are simply asking the Minister to assure us that in recognition of the concerns of those organisations, the Government intend to provide for an order to deal with those concerns under the order-making power in paragraph 9. That would also meet the concerns of the police and the other statutory authorities about which the hon. Member for Hallam talked.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Amendment No. 292, although grouped with the other amendments, relates to schedule 4 and the problem of transferring data to countries outside the European economic area. My hon. Friend the Member for Esher and Walton (Mr. Taylor) has raised the matter on several occasions, not least earlier today.
<P>
Under the eighth principle we must ensure security, but there is a problem with the requirement for data protection provisions in those countries to meet the European Union's general objective. The eighth principle provides for an exemption: it does not apply where the transfer is necessary for
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"reasons of substantial public interest".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
What circumstances would meet the test in paragraph 2(a)? What circumstances would not meet the test in paragraph 2(b)? Would the prevention or detection of crime meet the test of substantial public interest?
<P>
I shall not labour the point because of the shortage of time, but I have a document that I am happy to pass on to the Minister if I do not convince him that some order-making power in schedule 9 would be appropriate. Baroness Turner of Camden looked into the matter at some length in another place on behalf of the Chartered Institute of Loss Adjusters. The frequent references by hon. Members to the difficulty of transferring data to countries outside the European economic area should convince the Minister that something must be done about it. We want the Minister to acknowledge that the Government are aware of our anxieties and that, in essence, they intend to use the order-making powers in the Bill to ensure that our concerns are allayed.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> The hon. Member for Ryedale said that he would not labour the point, but I have already told the Committee that the Government take a sympathetic view of the problems raised by the hon. Gentleman and by the hon. Member for Hallam. We debated the matter in respect of the needs of banks, city institutions and other organisations and I mentioned specifically the position of organisations such as the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds and their need to process sensitive data concerning individual criminal offences and criminal proceedings for the purposes of crime prevention and detection. We have stated our willingness to approach the problem with sympathy. Schedule 3(9) allows the Secretary of State, by order, to specify circumstances additional to those mentioned in the schedule in which sensitive data may be processed. We have already said that we will consider the need for an order under the paragraph, which is the purpose of the amendment. However, I emphasise that we believe that the proposal as drafted is a better way to proceed than the amendment's approach. It is essential that any provision that we make allowing the processing of sensitive data should be consistent with the directive. Article 8 sets out expressly a number of circumstances in which sensitive data may be processed. Those conditions are set out in schedule 3.
<P>
Article 8 goes on to state that member states may specify further circumstances in which sensitive data may be processed, but subject to two conditions: that the processing is in the substantial public interest and that there are appropriate safeguards. Slightly different[Mr. Hoon]
considerations apply to the processing of data about criminal convictions and criminal proceedings, but the directive still requires that there should be safeguards.
<P>
The difficulty about having general provisions, as the amendments propose, is that they are so wide. There would be a risk of their permitting processing that was not consistent with the directive and which would thereby undermine the protection elsewhere in the Bill. I hope that those who tabled the amendments will think about that; such a wide approach would not be desirable. An order under paragraph 9, however, gives us the necessary flexibility to focus on where the need lies and to specify the circumstances in which the processing may be carried out. In that way we can be confident that we are dealing with the problem specifically, as consistent with the directive. A further advantage of an order under paragraph 9 is that we will be able to consult the organisations and interests that are affected, to produce a satisfying result, rather than risking undermining the Bill's provisions.
<P>
Amendment No. 277 would permit the Secretary of State to make an order allowing the processing of personal data relating to actual or alleged criminal offences and criminal proceedings to be processed in accordance with such safeguards as is specified in the order.
<P>
The amendment follows our brief debate in clause 2 about the processing of sensitive data. As I said earlier, the Government will consider sympathetically the need for an order under paragraph 9 to deal with the anxieties of city institutions and others and I am happy to repeat that assurance. The Bill as drafted contains a mechanism that will achieve the hon. Gentleman's objective and the amendment would not bring any additional benefits.
<P>
I come now to amendment No. 183. Paragraphs 1 to 8 of schedule 3, and now paragraph 8A in amendment No. 262 on the subject of ethnic monitoring, which the Committee will shortly be asked formally to agree to, and the schedule, set out specific circumstances in which sensitive data may be processed. Paragraph 9 allows the Secretary of State to specify additional circumstances by order. The amendment would allow the processing of sensitive data in accordance with a statutory code of practice governing the processing of sensitive data as an alternative to specification by the Secretary of State.
<P>
The primary difficulty that I see with that approach is that it is not altogether clear that it would satisfy the requirements of the directive. Article 8.4 of the directive allows member states to specify further circumstances in which sensitive data may be processed only where the processing serves the substantial public interest. The amendment does not differentiate codes of practice relating to matters of substantial public interest from other matters that are not in the substantial public interest.
<P>
Article 8.4 of the directive also requires there to be safeguards. There is no provision relating to safeguards in the amendment. The absence of these two important criteria is a significant weakness in the amendment's approach.
<P>
The Government believe that a better way is to rely on the provision already in the Bill. I am convinced that the wording of paragraph 9 of schedule 3 is sufficiently flexible to allow an order made under it to specify that sensitive data may be processed in accordance with specific codes of practice. The order could then be more specific about the particular types of processing, so as to ensure both that the codes related to matters of important public interest and that there were proper safeguards.
<P>
As orders made under paragraph 9 of schedule 3 are subject to affirmative resolution procedure, this would also have the added advantage of allowing Parliament the opportunity to debate the proposals.
<P>
I come now to amendment No. 292 which takes us on to schedule 4.
<P>
The eighth data protection principle prohibits the transfer of personal data to countries outside the European economic area which do not have an adequate level of data protection. That follows the rule firmly established in article 25 of the data protection directive.
<P>
Article 26 of the directive goes on to specify circumstances in which such transfers may be made by way of derogation from the general rule. Those circumstances are the ones set out in schedule 4 to the Bill. The amendment would add to that list transfers necessary for the prevention or detection of crime.
<P>
Article 26 of the directive makes no express reference to the prevention or detection of crime. I wonder, therefore, on which of the provisions mentioned in that article the hon. Member for Ryedale is relying in tabling the amendment. If he has in mind article 26.1(d), which refers to the transfer being necessary or legally required on important public interest grounds, I wonder why he feels that the amendment is necessary. Paragraph 4 of schedule 3 gives effect to that provision of the directive. It allows transfers where they are necessary for reasons of substantial public interest.
<P>
The position, therefore, boils down to this: if prevention or detection of crime equates to the substantial public interest, transfers for that purpose are already permitted by paragraph 4 of schedule 4. If not, there is little basis in the directive for permitting such transfers.
<P>
We believe that paragraph 4 of schedule 4 is both consistent with the directive and gives the necessary degree of flexbility to meet the hon. Gentleman's concerns.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I am grateful, especially for the Minister's final comments, although I did not speak as clearly to amendment No. 292 as I should have liked, given the amount of jumping from schedule to schedule and page to page that was required.
<P>
However, my intention was to tease out of the Minister the Government's view about whether substantial public interest includes transfers necessary for the protection or detection of crime. Does the Minister agree that such transfers could be made by commercial organisations, and that the exemption is not limited to public bodies? The police often transfer information about money laundering and drug trafficking from the National Criminal Intelligence headquarters to the centre in El Paso which I have visited with the Select Committee on Home Affairs and the Bill must cover that. What worries commercial organisations is that the provision might catch information on anti-fraud activity that they may have to transfer to the United States in particular. I understand from what the Minister said that they will be covered. There will be great rejoicing if that is the case.
<P>
I am grateful to the Minister for giving a clear answer and the assurance that we sought on the order-making power under paragraph 9.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Member for Ryedale for suggesting that the Home Affairs Select Committee should follow data round the world to check that it is being processed correctly. I must inform him that so far, that Committee has made trips to Newcastle, Manchester and Middlesbrough. El Paso has not been on the agenda.
<P>
The debate and the Minister's assurances were useful. It was good to hear his expressions of sympathy for the organisations that approached us with concerns. We are being asked to place a huge amount of trust in the Government. We must trust that their sympathy will translate into action and that they will bring about orders to satisfy those concerns. However, members of the Committee are a trusting bunch, so I intend to withdraw the amendment on the understanding that the order will be made appropriately.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I am glad that Opposition Members intend to withdraw the amendment and I am grateful they they accept the Government's undertaking to make orders as appropriate.
<P>
The hon. Member for Ryedale talked about the transfer of data by commercial organisations to prevent crime. That will obviously depend on the circumstances and the nature of the crime that they are trying to prevent. Preventing minor crime may not always be in the substantial public interest. The example that springs to mind is literary something might well be a crime in the United Kingdom, but it might not be in the substantial public interest to communicate data of that kind to countries that do not have proper safeguards.
<P>
The purpose of this part of the directive is to ensure that the transfer of data to countries without adequate safeguards is not used to bring that data back into the European economic area. Given the speed with which data can be transferred around the world, there could be a significant loophole in the regime that has been established in the European economic area. Closing that is the underlying purpose of that part of the directive. However, where there is a substantial public interest for example, to prevent copyright breach I assume that it should be possible for that kind of data to be communicated to prevent what would undoubtedly be a substantial harm to the public interest.

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"are exempt from the data subject provisions in any case to the extent to which the application of these provisions would be likely to prejudice any negotiations at any time with the data subject".</UL></FONT>
<P>
This is the final matter that we want to raise on fraud, and the arguments will be familiar to the Minister. Paragraph 6, whch concerns miscellaneous exemptions, provides an exemption under which
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Personal data which consist of records of the intentions of the data controller in relation to any negotiations with the data subject are exempt from the subject information provisions... to the extent to which the application of those provisions would be likely to prejudice the negotiations."<P></UL></FONT>

<P>
The Finance and Leasing Association is concerned that it is standard practice for possible intentions to be marked on files. We talked earlier about someone not making payments under a finance agreement for several months. The Minister was right to say that the company would use the conditions in the agreement to recover its position and would send chasing letters. I have had the problem explained to me in detail, but I shall try to be brief for the convenience of the Committee. It is common for the file to be marked, "Two more chasing letters. No reply. Write off." That came as a surprise, but being an honest soul, I decided that it would be wrong for me as a Member of Parliament to take advantage of that information. One can see, however, that there would be an opportunity in the mind of the disreputable. If we are not careful, they could use the subject access provisions to find out a finance company's possible, rather than its actual intentions. That might seem a narrow point, but the Finance and Leasing Association is sufficiently concerned to have suggested a different wording to me in a letter of 14 May, which is the wording that I have used in amendment No. 293.
<P>
In the situation that I have described, the companies would not believe that they had entered into negotiations. They would simply be using the standard practice, which had existed in the industry for many years, of someone senior considering a matter and noting on the file what action the company should have taken. I am told that it would be a criminal's charter if it became common place for individuals who had not met their payments on time and who clearly had fraudulent intent to start writing to companies and exercising their rights under the data subject access provisions to find out what the company might be thinking of doing.
<P>
I can see from the Minister's reaction that he recognises the difficulty. We are asking two questions. Can the wording be improved to give the industry the comfort that it requires? The wording that we have suggested may not be the appropriate wording. Alternatively, can the Minister give the industry the comfort that it is looking for by telling us that the Bill's wording is adequate? The companies are, however, not convinced of that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I am sure that the Committee is grateful to the hon. Member for Ryedale for mentioning the issue. I hope to give him the reassurance that he seeks. Paragraph 6 states that the exemption applies to "any negotiations". I draw the hon. Gentleman's attention to that phrase, which applies to negotiations in relation to which the personal data
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"consist of records of the intentions of the data controller".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept that it is not necessary for the negotiations to be currently in train at the time in question for a party to benefit from the exemption. The essence of our intentions for negotiations is that they should be forward looking, and that they are, therefore, to a greater or lesser extent, contingent.
<P>
The hon. Member for Ryedale has given one example; perhaps I could give him another. At the time of agreeing an insurance policy with a customer, and insurance company might well record on his file the maximum at which it would be prepared to settle if a claim were made in future. That record would comprise the company's intention towards the data subject in the event of future negotiations.
<P>
The exemption in paragraph 6 would cover such circumstances. The data subject could ask for subject access to his or her records the day after the insurance policy had been agreed. That would clearly frustrate any prospective negotiations, were an indication of the data controller's intentions to be disclosed to the data subject. It would not matter that the negotiations had not yet started. It is sufficient for the prospect to exist of negotiation at some future time.
<P>
I hope that that explanation is sufficient to reassure the hon. Member for Ryedale, and that he will therefore ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I am grateful to the Minister. He has acknowledged that the concern is genuine. He has offered the second choice that I put to him, by saying that the Government believe that the concerns are met by the paragraph as drafted. I am sure that the people concerned will take comfort. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<B>Mr. Ian Taylor:</B> I endorse the point made by the hon. Member for Milton Keynes, North-East. The matter is of considerable concern. I have a copy of a letter of 18 May addressed to the Home Office Minister from the British Retail Consortium's director-general. It reinforces the hon. Gentleman's points. If any person giving the confidential reference on a sole trader or partner cannot be assured that his name will be kept confidential, such references may not be provided. If that happens, it will be very difficult for the company or small trader to obtain credit.
<P>
Those concerns are serious, and they are shared by a large number of companies and sole traders in Britain. Will the Minister reassure the Committee that the matter is being considered, so that some change, in the form of a Government amendment, will be proposed on Report?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Members for Milton Keynes, North-East and for Esher and Walton for raising the issue, of which I am aware. The hon.

<H4><center>Powers of entry and inspection</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 295, in page 58, line 26, after "Schedule", insert "in respect of contravention of the data protection principles except the seventh data protection principle".
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 296, in page 58, line 32, after "data", insert "or for the unlawful obtaining or procuring of personal data". and Government amendment No. 265.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> These are drafting amendments that have been suggested by the Data Protection Registrar. Schedule 9 provides substantial powers of entry and inspection in terms of the investigation and prosecution of offences. The amendment suggests that a judge shall not issue a warrant under the schedule
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"in respect of contravention of the data protection principles except the seventh data protection principle"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
regarding any personal data that is processed for the special purposes. The data controller is otherwise potentially exempt from the provisions that are listed in clause 31(2): he could block an application by the commission in respect of suspected contraventions through which he is not exempt or potentially exempt under clause 31(2) that is, the duty to notify changes or breaches of the seventh principle.
[Mr. Greenway]
<P>
Paragraph 1(3) restricts inspection and seizure to documents or other material that are evidence of processing, or an intention to process, personal data. That would appear to prevent an officer from seizing documents or other material that evidenced, for example, unlawful obtaining or procuring, which would be in contravention of clause 54. Thinking back to my old police days, it occurred to me that such a lack of flexibility would be a nightmare for enforcement authorities.
<P>
The Minister may be satisfied that those concerns have been satisfactorily addressed. However, I thought that the Data Protection Registrar's view should be drawn to the Committee's attention.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> Schedule 9 allows the commissioner to seek a warrant from a circuit judge to allow her to enter and search premises on which she has reasonable grounds for suspecting a contravention of the data protection principles or the commission of an offence under the Bill.
<P>
Paragraph 1(2) provides that a warrant may not be issued in respect of personal data being processed for the special purposes unless a determination by the commissioner under clause 44 has taken effect.
<P>
Clause 44 gives a power to the commissioner to issue a determination where it appears to her that personal data are not being processed only for the special purposes, or that they are not being processed with a view to the publication of previously unpublished special purposes material.
<P>
As I understand it, the amendment would allow a warrant to be issued in respect of personal data processed for the special purposes without a determination under clause 44 having effect, where the suspected contravention is of the seventh data protection principle, which relates to security.
<P>
I understand why the hon. Member for Ryedale wants to distinguish the seventh principle from the other data protection principles. It is, I think, that the data protection directive states that in giving effect to article 9 of the directive, which allows member states to provide exemptions for the media, they must not lay down exemptions from the measures to ensure security of processing. Of course, we have followed that in setting out the scope of the media exemptions in clause 31(2).
<P>
However, that provision is not about the scope of the media exemption. It is part of a package of procedural measures, along with clause 31(4) and clause 45, designed to ensure that substantive enforcement matters in respect of processing for the special purposes are not addressed until after publication. It is not related to the type of contravention in question. It does not prevent the commissioner from seeking a warrant in respect of personal data being processed for the special purposes. It merely defers her ability to seek a warrant.
<P>
The effect of this provision is that she may not issue a warrant for as long as the special purposes processing meets the criteria that would justify a continued stay on proceedings under clause 31(4). I hope that the Committee will accept that that is consistent.
<P>
If the commissioner were able to seek a warrant in circumstances where those conditions were fully satisfied, that would be a gap in the arrangements for special purposes processing that the Bill creates. The Government do not believe that that would be desirable.
<P>
The question is whether an exception to the general rule should be made for alleged contraventions of the security principle, thereby allowing the commissioner to seek a warrant in special purposes cases earlier than she would have been able to otherwise. The Government's view is that this is neither necessary nor appropriate. It is important, for reasons which this Committee has now aired very fully, that the media are not exposed to the chilling effect of prepublication litigation for any data protection reason. That is the balance between privacy and freedom of expression which this Bill strikes.
<P>
As I say, the Bill does not remove the possibility of enforcement, it merely defers it. When the conditions justifying the stay on proceedings cease to be satisfied, the commissioner will be able to make a determination. When that determination takes effect she will be able to seek a warrant. That is the way that the arrangements work. They are part of a delicate mechanism. We see no need to make an exception for breach of the security principle, and the directive does not require us to do so.
<P>
I turn to amendment No. 296, which concerns the scope of the arrangements for issuing warrants in schedule 9. The hon. Member for Ryedale wondered whether they were sufficiently broad to enable the commissioner to do all that she might need to in investigating alleged offences of unlawful obtaining or disclosing of personal data under clause 54. The Government believe that schedule 9 allows her to be given, under warrant, the powers that she needs.
<P>
I shall be brief in dealing with Government amendment No. 265. This is a drafting amendment to improve the clarity of paragraph 1(3) of schedule 9. It makes it clear that the evidence referred to in sub-paragraph (3) is the evidence of the contravention of the data protection principles, or of the commission of an offence under the Bill, which is referred to in sub-paragraph (1).

<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I am grateful for the Minister's reply. He has explained why the Government believe that it would be appropriate to block an application from the commissioner in respect of suspected contraventions under clause 31(2). He has also said that the powers that the commissioner needs under schedule 9 are adequate.

We are not lawyers and so cannot argue. However, it was right for us to air those matters. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

I also want to take this opportunity to thank all members of the Committee for their help and assistance in reaching what is very nearly the conclusion of our work.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I entirely endorse the Minister's comments. This has been a happy and constructive Committee. We are grateful for your assistance and chairmanship, Mr. Stevenson. Mr. Barry Jones also chaired one of our sittings, which was an enjoyable occasion. In particular, we are deeply indebted to Mr. Welsh, who has chaired most of our proceedings. I, too, would be grateful if you conveyed my thanks to him for the charming and efficient way in which he chaired the Committee. It will be obvious to hon. Members that I am rather glad that we have reached the end of this lengthy and testing process. I hope that they feel that we have given this important Bill the scrutiny that it deserves and that our work will, on Report, guide hon. Members to important issues of public interest on which they may wish to deliberate further.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before I call the relevant question, I thank hon. Members for their kind words, most of which were rightly directed at my co-Chairman, Mr. Welsh. He has done a sterling job in my absence. I should tell the Committee that it is not only the Select Committee on Home Affairs that goes tripping to outlandish places to find out what is going on. I am grateful to my co-Chairman and to the Committee for its patience and forbearance, which has meant that its work has been done diligently, effectively and efficiently.
