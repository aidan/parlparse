<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> The amendments deal with district policing partnerships. Those partnerships will consist of elected councillors from the various district councils, and independent members. In a district partnership that has eight councillors, there will be seven independent members; in a partnership with nine councillors, there will be eight independent members, and so on. It is our view that the independent members should be appointed by the Policing Board, rather than by the council. The amendments seek to bring that about.
<P>
Amendment No. 170 would amend paragraph 4, removing the requirement of the board to appoint independent members nominated by the council. Instead, they would be appointed in accordance with new paragraph 5(l). Amendment No. 174 sets out the details of that new sub-paragraph, which would place a requirement on the board to appoint independent members. The board would seek applications from each district council area, and appoint from those applicants. The appointments should be representative of the council area in terms of religion, gender, age and cultural background, as far as was practical.
<P>
It would be wrong for the council to have full control of the appointment of all the members of the district policing partnership. After the nominations have been made from among the councillors, it should be up to the board to complete the membership by appointing nominees whom it has selected from applicants in the council area. Amendments Nos. 175 and 177 are consequential on amendment No. 174.
<P>
These are sensible amendments. They would remove any chance of a council giving the post of independent member to someone whom it might wish to be in the partnership, and would leave that task to the independent body--the Policing Board.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lembit ípik </B>(Montgomeryshire): I want to speak to amendments Nos. 103 and 104 and seek the Minister's response.
<P>
Amendment No. 103 would ensure that where the board determines by a vote of 60 per cent. of those present and voting that the nominations made by a council are not representative of the community within that council area, the board may itself make appointments to the district policing partnership. In essence, that was suggested as a safeguard to prevent councils from putting forward a list of nominees that were entirely from one section of the community, or even one party.
<P>
Amendment No. 104 relates to a slightly different aspect of schedule 3. It would ensure that the district policing partnerships have to comply with the code of practice, which is important. The arguments for that have already been made.
<P>
The amendments are intended to be helpful, and I hope that the Minister will view them in that light.
<P>
<B>Mr. Seamus Mallon </B>(Newry and Armagh): Amendment No. 67 would oblige the Secretary of State, before he draws up the code of practice, to consult Northern Ireland's Equality Commission. Clearly, the code of practice will be a major safeguard for ensuring that the appointment process for independent members of the district policing partnerships is fair and ensures, as far as is practicable, that the appointments are representative of the district council area--on the grounds not only of religion, but of political opinion, sex and race.
<P>
The Equality Commission has gone publicly on record to state its concern that it be consulted about the code of practice. I share that concern, which is why I tabled the amendment, and I hope that the Government will be able to look kindly on what I regard as a reasonable request.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ken Maginnis </B>(Fermanagh and South Tyrone): The entire section of the Bill that deals with district police partnerships gives Ulster Unionist Members considerable difficulty. I remind members of the Committee that Chris Patten and his commission decided--or said they had decided--that the Police Service of Northern Ireland, which is currently the Royal Ulster Constabulary, would remain a unitary force. That is essential, in a comparatively small community of 1.7 million people, if we are to have cohesion right across Northern Ireland.
<P>
Unfortunately, the Patten commission left to the discretion of the Government, the Secretary of State or the Chief Constable--I am not sure which, but I suspect that it is the Chief Constable--the structuring of the police in terms of what falls into place below the command element. It is clear from the Chief Constable's fundamental review that he has always intended to remove the divisional structure of the police. That means that the real operational power and authority will rest on local areas of command--there is a new technical name, which I forget--which, by and large, will be coterminous with district councils.
<P>
<B>Mr. William Thompson </B>(West Tyrone): District command areas.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> My hon. Friend tells me that they are called district command areas--I may forget that phrase. In so far as those areas are coterminous with a clearly defined political area, they will need some protection to ensure that they do not become identified with the political complexion of the area. We must avoid imposing a disjointed and inconsistent form of policing on Northern Ireland.
<P>
We could compare South Armagh with Rathcoole. South Armagh is predominantly, but not wholly, nationalist--there is a huge Sinn Fein-IRA influence there. I am concerned not about the fact that Rathcoole is predominantly Protestant but that there is a huge loyalist paramilitary influence there. A superintendent would experience different pressures if he moved from Rathcoole to South Armagh, and I want to ameliorate those pressures. We tabled several relevant amendments, some of which are before us and some of which we shall consider later, when we discuss subsequent provisions in the schedule and clauses 13 to 21.
<P>
We would, to some extent, have greater control over such pressures and variations if somewhere between the 26 district command areas there was a stratum that reflected the current regional arrangements. There are currently three regions in Northern Ireland: one that deals with Belfast, one that deals with the north--that is, County Antrim, County Londonderry and County Fermanagh, although Fermanagh is in the south-west; it was not an Irishman who was responsible for that--and the southern region, which includes Down, Armagh and most but not all of Tyrone. With such a stratum--there is no guarantee that it will remain--there would be a degree of cohesion between adjacent district command areas. A district commander who came under pressure, perhaps from a specific group, could use that formal structure to liase with neighbouring divisional commanders. My understanding is that such an arrangement is unlikely to be put in place. However, I may be able to say more about that later. I do not want to go into the question of special branch and other activities necessitating the work of detectives to be analysed, but there is a problem there. I shall simply draw attention to it and leave it, because I do not want to stray too far from the amendments.
<P>
<H5>2.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Although we were promised a unitary police force, because of the inadequacies of Patten, we have instead what has been described as the cantonisation of policing in Northern Ireland, and that will place intolerable pressures on the police, whoever they may be.
<P>
There has historically been a seed bed for discontent and confrontation at district council level. That is not something of today, but something of yesteryear, and it led to the crises of 1969 to 1972 involving confrontation at district council level between people with hugely differing points of view. I am not talking about the straightforward and upfront differences that there would be between the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh (Mr. Mallon), who is a constitutional republican, and myself as a constitutional Unionist. I am talking about all the extremes across the ambit of Northern Ireland politics.
<P>
Efforts will be made, not as a result of, but assisted by the fact that district policing partnerships will generally meet in public. I am not disputing that there is openness in the proposed DPPs, but where the baser instincts come into play at a local level, people will play to an audience, and the audiences--members of the public who are drawn in--will seek to put pressure on and monitor those representing their area on the DPPs.
<P>
It is no secret that I am particularly worried about republican paramilitaries. I am worried about all paramilitaries, but there is no comparison between the number of elected personnel that will be involved and the influence that they will have. To illustrate my point, let me take a district council with a preponderance of Sinn Fein members. They will not only have the majority on the district policing partnership, but the majority on the non-political element of the DPP under the present arrangement for selecting independent members. Therefore, there will undoubtedly be constant conflict.
<P>
Perhaps I can illustrate this in terms that everyone here will understand. Hon. Members will have heard of the Drumcree confrontation. I can tell the Committee without fear of contradiction, that it is not a majority of Orangemen that is keeping the confrontation going; nor, on the other side, is it a majority of Drumcree residents. Most Orangemen want to go to their church, observe the tenets of the Protestant faith and get on with their lives. It is the same for the residents of Drumcree, although Mr. Brendan McKenna might not agree. Mr. McKenna exercises huge authority through the organisation to which he belongs, although he now claims that he does not belong to it. Such people--a minority of both traditions--can keep the confrontation going, year in and year out. If Mr. Patten really meant what he said about taking politics out of policing, he must acknowledge that his proposal to create district policing partnerships will achieve exactly the opposite.
<P>
Politics was, by and large, removed from policing 30 years ago, by the Hunt report. The Police Authority was established then, and has been comparatively successful as a means of ensuring that no politician has had authority in this area. As a Member of Parliament, I could not be a member of the Police Authority. Over the years, the selection process for those who hold political office has meant that we have had the best type of public representative on the authority. Patten has done away with that by trying to accommodate the most virulent political elements on the Policing Board. Moreover, in his plans for the DPPs and their role in policing operations, he has created what I shall call the Drumcree syndrome in those district command areas. There is no doubt that that will be the outcome, and we shall reap the tragedy in the years to come, if we accept the concept of district policing partnerships.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> This is not a weighty point. The hon. Gentleman implied that there was no political presence on the Police Authority since the Hunt report. I must remind him that members of the Alliance party are--and have been--members of the authority. Then again, perhaps, he does not confuse the Alliance party with the political process.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> The hon. Gentleman is being overtly mischievous and endeavouring to wind me up. The reality is that there are politicians in the Police Authority, and not just members of the Alliance party. To some extent, I share his views on that party.
<P>
<B>Mr. ípik:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> No, I do not want to go any further down that road.
<P>
By and large, the nominees who were selected from people elected at district council level proved to be the most responsible elements in that stratum of government. I remind the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh that, at out first sitting, I expressed regret that members of the Social Democratic and Labour party had not taken their places in the Police Authority.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> I did indeed note what the hon. Gentleman said in his opening address. Under pressure from the then Minister, Richard Needham, and a new Chief Constable, I said, "You have a valid point of view. Now please appoint me to the Police Authority, and I promise that I will serve on it." I have not heard another word about the matter to this day. I place that on record, so that there will be no further arguments about it. I offered my services, but like many others in the north of Ireland at that time, I was not of the appointable class.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I do not for a moment doubt what the hon. Gentleman says, and he would have been a valuable asset to the Police Authority. However, because he and I are hon. Members of this place, we were both precluded from serving. Two valuable assets were therefore lost to the Police Authority.
<P>
We have tabled the amendments in the light of the Patten recommendation that the Government will implement. Let us for God's sake prevent the confrontation and disruption that will become the order of the day if we allow district councillors total authority over district command areas. We must reflect people's desire to serve society. We must choose the seven, eight or nine independent members of district policing partnerships in the same way that members of the Police Authority were chosen in the past. The community and police liaison committees in Northern Ireland were established quietly and without fuss. They gave the best community-aware elements in both traditions the opportunity to come together quietly and liaise with local police for the benefit of local communities. Some remarkably high-profile people from both traditions served on community police liaison committees and the development of such bodies would have been an asset as the two traditions tried to work together. Patten virtually ignored the CPLCs.
<P>
For the benefit of Committee members who are not familiar with day-to-day affairs in Northern Ireland, I shall describe an incident that occurred in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for West Tyrone (Mr. Thompson) a short while ago. Members of a CPLC, including Monsignor Denis Faul, who is a well-known Catholic cleric in Northern Ireland, were meeting colleagues, social workers, police and others. They were quietly and unobtrusively working for the benefit of society when the hotel room in which they were meeting was suddenly rushed by a group of Sinn Feiners, led by an Assembly member, councillor Barry McElduff. Those are the very elements that will replace the responsible Monsignor Denis Faul and others. That is what Patten has given us and it illustrates better than anything I can say the nonsense of doing away with CPLCs.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tony McWalter </B>(Hemel Hempstead): Does the hon. Gentleman agree that Monsignor Denis Faul, among others, is a strong supporter of the Patten report?
<P>
<H5>3 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I have been friendly with Monsignor Denis Faul for more than 30 years. He supports the elements in the Patten report that he believes will benefit society as a whole and those in his own tradition. He is loyal to his own tradition and makes no secret of his republicanism. The hon. Gentleman should remember the picture that I have painted of Monsignor Faul, so that he understands Monsignor Faul's views when he has to choose between the elements of Patten that fulfil his aspirations and those that would create a disruptive influence. People in Carrickmore, where Monsignor Denis Faul is parish priest, made their views clear. Although there was massive intimidation and an unofficial referendum among members of Monsignor Faul's parish of around 4,000 adults, fewer than 500 people signed the petition to have him removed.
<P>
I am glad that the hon. Gentleman pressed me because it is not among Unionists and the people with whom I am politically associated, but among ordinary, decent members of the nationalist community that we must look to see the difficulties that will be imposed on them by Patten and the Government if we go ahead with district police partnerships in the proposed form. If anything can be done to lessen the influence of the Barry McElduffs and other disruptive influences, it should be done now. One possibility is to allow people to volunteer and to seek to be nominated as independent members of DPPs. That is what our amendment seeks to achieve.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> The hon. Gentleman has touched on something important here, but he draws the wrong conclusion. I know Denis Faul well. He and I were at school together and that is not today or yesterday. What happened in Carrickmoor, and what has happened throughout the north of Ireland and many times in the area where I live and which I represent is that those within the nationalist republican community who will not be led by the Barry McElduffs have stood up to the stormtroopers. They have stood up to them for 30 years. We will not be taking our standards from stormtroopers of any organisation or tinpot Hitlers like Barry McElduff. That has happened. We resisted the violence for 30 years and we are not taking it now.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I can only say that the reassurance that the hon. Gentleman gives on behalf of his tradition does not surprise me. I have seen again how, when the opportunity has presented itself, such as the petition to get rid of Monsignor Faul, people have stood up. On that occasion they had the support of their church. But let me remind the hon. Gentleman that in the wake of that event a local government by-election was held in which Barry McElduff was the candidate. His vote was enormous. We know the organisation and the sort of tactics that are employed by Sinn Fein. We have seen court cases in west Belfast brought by people like Joe Hendron who have been hugely abused by Sinn Fein in terms of the electoral process. None the less, Barry McElduff was elected with a huge majority and a bigger vote than Sinn Fein had had in a previous election.
<P>
Although the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh and I have similar objectives on how the community should be involved constructively in a partnership with the police, we will not be able to achieve that through Patten's district police partnerships. That is the point that I want to make. We must try to get people with a broader perspective. I am not sure that the police board will achieve that broader perspective, but it will provide a better opportunity than leaving the choice of independent members in the hands of the Barry McElduffs. Those independent members will be lobby fodder. They will be manipulated. Labour Members smile when I mention lobby fodder. I was not for a moment thinking about Labour Back Benchers, but I am glad that my point has been taken on board.
<P>
I support my hon. Friend the Member for West Tyrone on the issue. I should like district policing partnerships to be abandoned for ever. I do not want to hear them mentioned again. I doubt that I shall achieve that, but if I cannot, I should like some curb or control on those who will abuse that system of liaison between the general public and the police.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dominic Grieve </B>(Beaconsfield): I do not entirely agree with the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone (Mr. Maginnis) about the principle of district policing partnerships, as I shall discuss in a moment. However, I confess that I am sympathetic towards the anxieties that he expressed about what may happen in practice.
<P>
As I said on Second Reading, I have some passing experience of dealing with a vaguely equivalent matter, although I do not suggest that it is entirely equivalent to what a DPP is supposed to be. For a period in the 1980s, I served on the Lambeth police community consultative group, which was designed to provide a community interface with the police to improve levels of policing and reduce misunderstandings in an area that had many problems. Indeed, my period as vice-chairman of the committee coincided with one of the riots that took place in Brixton--not the first, but the second.
<P>
Matters were rather different there, in the sense that one of the features of the group was that members of the local council had boycotted it and would not take up their places on it. One of its curious features was that as a result it was full of independent people, nominated by local organisations without the usual political input. It is perhaps noteworthy that there came a time later in the group's life when the politicians suddenly recognised its worth and started to serve on it. However, at the time, the council was not prepared to take up its places because of its belief that the initiative was a sinister plot on the part of the powers that be to suppress the local community. It was not an edifying episode, but it is interesting that the problems worked themselves out.
<P>
I found that experience interesting and useful, and it confirmed my view that there is immense value in having such organisations and building on them. I therefore disagree with the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone when he says that he does not want district policing partnerships. Given the right framework and the right will, there is immense scope for improving police- community relations through such a mechanism.
<P>
To that extent, the Government's decision as part of the Belfast agreement and following the Patten report to implement such partnerships does not in itself cause me grave anxiety. However, as I pointed out on Second Reading, if those who participate want simply to use such organisations as a blunt instrument with which to beat the police, there is a risk of what I described as cantonisation. I shall develop that point in a moment.

<br>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I should like to make it clear that, as I hope that the hon. Gentleman will have picked up from the fact that I endorsed CPLCs, I do not oppose liaison between the police and the community but merely do not want to hear DPPs as conceived by Patten mentioned again.
<P>
<H5>3.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I understand the hon. Gentleman's point. It may be an cration to say that there may be a problem of cantonisation. The truth is that a deal of power will remain with the Chief Constable in relation both to the board and to district policing partnerships. It would not be correct to regard either of those bodies as mechanisms by which the proper exercise of police discretion in enforcing law and order will be jeopardised. Nevertheless, a situation in which meetings of district policing partnerships develop into sterile discourse--as happened at some council meetings when I was a member of an inner London local authority--with confrontational attitudes being banded about is clearly not what the Minister or the Secretary of State have in mind. That is not the object of DPPs.
<P>
We have to accept that, at the moment, public life in Northern Ireland in terms of participation in political processes is far from perfect--it is not perfect anywhere--but the willingness to co-operate and to engage in relevant dialogue is undoubtedly in short supply in some places. How do we best go about ensuring that the DPPs function in the manner in which the Government intend? With that in mind, I should be grateful if the Minister could deal with the method of appointment of independent members that is touched on in the amendments, as I have some anxieties about it.
<P>
Clearly, there are some local councils in which politics are either massively polarised--the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone cited a couple--or, notwithstanding the various electoral systems and devices in Northern Ireland, one party that represents what are extreme views is in a position to dictate who participates. As a result, the so-called independent members will be nothing of the sort. There is nothing less independent than placemen appointed from an organisation that is monolithic in its political complexion. If that happens, minority communities may be disenfranchised and not represented on the DPP. We must avoid the serious risk of cantonisation and confrontation. Most people would understand an independent member under the Bill to be exactly that. I sympathise with the hon. Gentleman's anxieties that, in areas where there is no political balance because the politics are one-sided, it is doubtful that that will be achieved by an act of altruism by those who have their own agenda within the DPP.
<P>
How does the Minister see the method of appointment working in practice? It is not uncommon to have a system of independent appointments, which are, as the hon. Gentleman suggested, drawn by nomination from the local community. I can also foresee a potential problem when the board is presented with a series of names of individuals and takes the view that there is no independence and no other names have been put forward. What will happen in such circumstances? I may have misunderstood it, but there do not seem to be any measures in the Bill to deal with a logjam. Will the board simply have to accept one of the names that has been put forward?
<P>
An independent element is vital if the boards are to work properly. In my experience, it was the independent members of the police community consultative group on which I served--members of the local community who were not involved in politics--who tended to be the most active and sensible in wanting to promote good community relations. Often, they were the people who had most to lose. If one were a shopkeeper in a place where shops were burnt out in riots, one's desire to see the better promotion of community relations would spring partly from the self-interested desire to keep one's livelihood and not to have to move out of the area. Similar considerations will apply in parts of Northern Ireland as well.
<P>
I hope that the Minister can provide some reassurance, as there is a danger that the independent element, which was clearly designed to provide a balance against the politicians, may turn out to do nothing of the kind. If it does, we shall do a disservice to the electorate in parts of Northern Ireland.
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office (Mr. Adam Ingram):</B> We touched on the effect of amendments Nos. 170, 174, 175 and 177 when we debated amendment No. 171. Some of the key issues were tackled in that debate. The fundamental issue at stake on the amendments, and the principle reason why I ask the Committee to resist them, is that they seek to cut councils out of the arrangements for appointments. That is their underlying principle. It is not what Patten envisaged or recommended, and it is not the Government's policy.
<P>
I understand the concerns that were raised; some of them were referred to during the previous sitting as they dealt with many of the safeguards. The hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone raised issues in relation to policing structures. Strictly speaking, those should be dealt with under clause 19, although he referred to the relationship between the district policing structure and the district council. He argued that the new DPPs would lead to intolerable pressures on the police. I do not accept that. There may be uncomfortable exchanges and dealings between the bodies, but it would be a step too far to say that they will lead to intolerable pressures.
<P>
There will still be a unitary police service organised on the basis of the district commands. Each district command will relate to a single DPP. Importantly, DPPs are consultative bodies. They do not have powers to direct, but are about a two-way consultative process. They will not be able to dictate to the police, and the police's operational dependence will be protected and not compromised by such a relationship. It also seems right and proper that there should be local consultation on policing issues. That is the underlying reason for the DPPS.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> Does the Minister realise that pressure will come from, for example, the Barry McElduffs of local government, and that such people have colleagues at board level? The superintendent in district command will go to the board seeking promotions. Unless he is compliant and malleable in terms of his actions in district command, he will be in huge difficulties when he seeks promotion to assistant chief constable.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I do not know whether that would be the case. I do not think that senior police officers would be malleable in that sense. I am surprised that the hon. Gentleman has such a poor view of the senior officers in the existing police service, or those who will be in the new one, which will have the same high principles of integrity. Like the old service, it will respond to its own command structure, but also to the needs of the wider community. If he is saying that people reach that senior promoted position and then become pushovers, that is not my experience. That is why so much training and effort is put into assisting the police in understanding the new relationships that they are obliged to take on board in consulting the wider community. That would belie what the hon. Gentleman was saying about the weakness, as he perceives it, of senior police officers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> There is a perception in Northern Ireland that if a policeman is malleable, he generally will have more chance of getting to the top than one who is not.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I do not know what that is based on. It reminds me of a previous exchange in the Committee, when I said that the hon. Gentleman makes assertions but never backs them up. That is maligning police officers. I am surprised to hear it coming from the hon. Gentleman and the party that he represents. I now find myself defending the good name of the Royal Ulster Constabulary against Ulster Unionist Members. They speak for themselves in their criticism of the RUC, but I do not think that the criticism is fair.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> I now find myself in the difficult position of defending the RUC against such implications.
<P>
I do not know where all the malleable, weak-kneed, white-livered people in the north of Ireland have been--those who will be moulded by the Barry McElduffs of this world. Let us not create the future on the basis of what Barry McElduff would do; he is small and insignificant, and his brain is not much bigger. Such people will not create new policing in a new Northern Ireland. Let us give the police respect. Whatever one might say about them--I have had plenty to say over the years--they are not weak-kneed in the sense that they will be dependent on Barry McElduff or anyone else on the DPP for their promotions.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I should remind hon. Members that the amendment is reasonably narrow. Hon. Members should be careful not to stray more than a little from it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I shall keep strictly in order, Mr. Malins, in responding to the interventions. I shall not comment on Barry McElduff. He does not bother me in the slightest. I am more concerned about what my hon. Friend the Member for Newry and Armagh said about where the future lies. It will not rest on what one individual or group of individuals seek to do. It must and will be bigger than that.
<P>
On the relationship between the district command structure and the DPP, it is worth putting on the record the Chief Constable's view on the matter. He agreed with the Patten report's recommendation of one district command for each district council, and said that the concept of district command units with devolved executive authority and boundaries matching district councils should be fully supported. That is the view of a senior police officer in Northern Ireland on what is a desirable structure. We do not necessarily have to agree with him, but it is a weighty consideration that we should take into account.
<P>
When I dealt with amendments Nos. 170, 174, 175 and 177, I said in my opening comments that the Committee had addressed some of the underlying issues in its previous sitting. It is worth while to reiterate the safeguards that will be built in to the way in which the particular bodies are structured. Hopefully, that will deal with the point made by the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve). First, the office of chairman will rotate annually among each of the four largest parties on the council. It cannot therefore be dominated by one party alone. As far as the schedule is concerned, the appointments process enables the Secretary of State to issue a code of practice, which will set out for district councils and the board the best practice to be followed in the appointments process to ensure independence.
<P>
Secondly, district councils are required to nominate independent members in accordance with that code for appointment by the Policing Board, not by the council. The number of persons nominated should be twice the number of appointments to be made.

<P>

<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> Can the Minister reassure me that the code of practice will have enforceable status? Does he envisage that people who infringe the code will be fairly regularly chucked off the DPPs? How will it work, bearing in mind the incorrigible Mr. McElduff and others? I am no more overwhelmed than is the Minister by Mr. McElduff. He is a prime example of the worst elements of political influence.
<P>
<H5>3.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I hope that we are not elevating Mr. McElduff to something that he is not. If he bothers to read Hansard, he will see that he has become a bogey man for some Members of Parliament. He may even speak an Irish language to explain his excitement, but I will be unable to understand it.
<P>
There are serious issues. The hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone asks how the system will be policed. The code of practice establishes the way in which councils will operate. In one sense, they will be subject to the scrutiny of the Policing Board. Under clause 14, the Secretary of State is responsible for ensuring that there is compliance with all the provisions of the schedule.
<P>
We do not know for certain how it will work out in reality. No one can give absolute guarantees that there will not be hiccups, difficulties, disputes, causes of annoyance and differences between the various levels. As the system beds down, such problems are inevitable. My hon. Friend the Member for Newry and Armagh has been arguing for his vision. We should not base our thought processes on the minority who will be destructive, but try to design systems that encourage people to be co-operative and inclusive.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> I thank the Minister for giving way, because he is making a crucial point. It is a pity that we are ignoring amendment No. 104, because it is crucial to the issue of compliance with the code of practice. I do not want to be longwinded, Mr. Malins, but we are talking as if there were four sets of people in the north of Ireland: good nationalists, bad nationalists, good Unionists and bad Unionists. I think that on this matter we must be indifferent.
<P>
I want to know that the code of practice will ensure that membership is representative of the community as a whole. It is crucially important that it is representative in terms of religion, political opinion, race and gender. If not, the membership will not be in tune with the equality laws in place in the north of Ireland. I would be pleased if the Minister could reassure us.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I agree with the view that has been expressed and I will come to my hon. Friend's amendment No. 67. I was setting out some of the safeguards and the overriding safeguard is clause 14. Schedule 3 has the safeguard of disqualification for independent membership of a partnership, if a person has a conviction for a scheduled offence or any offence leading to imprisonment, whether suspended or not. Such a person would not be allowed to be a member in the first place, so a check must be carried out on all nominations. The other safeguard is that the schedule enables political or independent members to be removed from partnership if they are then convicted of a criminal offence.
<P>
The Government have tried to build in as many reasonable safeguards as is practicable and have taken account of the overriding requirement that people whose names go forward should have a high degree of integrity. Having said that, I cannot give absolute guarantees that there will be no difficulties. It would be wrong to say that we have been able to take account of the totality of the human condition. I make the same point as my hon. Friend the Member for Newry and Armagh that we need to tackle the problems for the majority, with the support of the majority, which can be a powerful discipline on the destructive minority.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> The hon. Member for Newry and Armagh appeared to see something commendable in amendment No. 104, which would require compliance with the code of practice. Is the Minister prepared to consider the amendment? It seems to go some way towards dealing with the anxiety that the code of practice will not be complied with.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I am trying to cover all the amendments. I have not yet responded to amendments Nos. 103, 104 and 67, because we have had a useful debate on the general principle of amendment No. 170 and related amendments. As a result of the safeguards and the explanations that were given under amendment No. 171, I ask the Committee not to support amendments Nos. 170, 174, 175 and 177.
<P>
Amendment No. 210 touches on part of amendment No. 174. Both amendments would ensure that DPPs were
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>representative of the council area<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
in terms of religion, gender, age and cultural background. On that subject, Patten says in paragraph 6.26 of his report:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the independent members should be selected to represent business and trade union interests and to provide expertise in matters pertaining to community safety.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There may be occasions on which a district council will need to look outside the council area for a person with particular expertise or experience. He may be a business man or a trade union representative. We can think of other examples. Someone may work in and be dedicated to an area, but live just outside its boundaries. As a result of all his interests, he could be a useful member of the partnership and people would perceive him as such. The Bill must allow for that. I am sure that the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire (Mr. ípik) would agree that it is appropriate for councils to consider such a person in order to meet the requirements of Patten. That council approach is important.
<P>
The Government's code on appointments will say not only that appointments should invariably be made from the council area, but that they should, as far as practicable, be representative of the local community--using community in the widest sense.
<P>
I ask the Committee to accept amendment No. 67, because it would require the Secretary of State to consult the Equality Commission before issuing the code of practice on appointments. I hope that that is an added assurance for the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire. The Equality Commission will be one of the bodies that are duly consulted.
<P>
Amendment No. 103 is unnecessary because the Bill already contains sufficient safeguards on the appointment of representative independents to ensure that Patten is met. Paragraph 5(5) of schedule 3 is a good example. It shows the layers of thought that have gone into the provision. If the district council does not nominate a sufficient number of people, twice as many independents will be required. The board has an interest in what happens. Clause 14 comes into play if the Secretary of State is not satisfied that schedule 3 is properly adhered to. If there is some frustration or insufficient compliance with schedule 3 or other relevant clauses, the Secretary of State has the power to take action.
<P>
Amendment No. 104, as the hon. Member for Beaconsfield said, deals with DPP compliance with the Secretary of State's code, rather than him "having regard" to it. The phrase "have regard to" is a clear implication that the code should be applied. However, we have to deal with 26 different DPPs and more flexibility will be required because needs in Belfast will be different from those in Moyle. Councils and the policing board must be flexible in going about their business. An over-prescriptive approach will not help.
<P>
It is hard to find a good example to prove the case, but we must try to go beyond generality. For example, there may be a cross-community point of view within a council. If there were unanimity across all political parties within the community about doing something in a particular way, and it was not within the code of practice, it would have to be deemed at variance with it. We need flexibility. Amendment No. 104 is based on a sound principle, but it denies flexibility when, as far as we can, we are trying to devolve decision-making down to local level. Checks and balances should ensure some coherence and structure to the delivery of this part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. ípik:</B> I agree with the Minister on that, but surely the requirement is not to change "have regard to" as the amendment suggests, but to ensure that the code of practice is itself flexible enough to fit all the predictable circumstances; otherwise, people will be nervous that, due to the softening of the words, individuals will be allowed to move away from the content of the code of practice.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I understand that, but there remains a need for an open-ended phrase "within the code of practice". How can an open-ended concept be applied when it could be interpreted in a particular way by a particular council on a cross-community basis? There are checks and balances and clause 14 deals with the power of the Secretary of State. This issue will be heavily scrutinised. If the code of practice is fundamentally flawed and does not achieve its objective, it must go back to the drawing board. It will have its own dynamic. It will have to improve over time as people begin to learn and understand different ways of dealing with this difficult issue. It will be initially contentious, but will change over a longer period. The code of practice must be flexible.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> We are all worried about the nebulous concept of "have regard to", but the Minister makes a valid case. What are the Secretary of State's sanctions against a council that has regard to the code of practice, but patently fails to apply some of its key provisions? What sanction can the Secretary of State impose on a council that is having regard to, but wilfully failing to implement a key provision of the code of practice?
<P>
<H5>3.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I have referred consistently to clause 14, which the hon. Gentleman may want to consider. Clause 14(2) says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>If a district council fails to comply with a direction under subsection (1)--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
that concerns clause 13(1) and any provision of schedule 3--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the Secretary of State may--
<P>
(a) declare the council to be in default; and
<P>
(b) make an order empowering the Board to exercise the functions of that council to such extent as appears to him necessary or expedient to secure that a district policing partnership is duly established for the district of the council.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We have tried to transfer as much responsibility and power as possible to local level, as I know my hon. Friend the Member for Newry and Armagh understands, but we also need a mechanism with which to manage default and a proper procedure for directing councils.
<P>
I do not know how best to describe the provision. Maybe it represents the light touch backed by the heavy hand. However, we would never want to use the heavy hand, as that would mean that the partnership concept and the relationships that Patten envisaged had broken down. Those concepts are essential to evolving the new model of policing and the relationship between policing and the community.
<P>
We shall have to learn as we go along. No one has all the perfect answers, but the Bill touches on the best possible solutions, by using flexibility, giving powers to the district councils and providing the Policing Board's overriding power and the Secretary of State's overarching power, which I hope will never be used. All parts of the relationship can be brought into play, but only time will tell whether the Bill is effective. Of course, that proviso applies to much legislation.
<P>
I ask the Committee to accept amendment No. 67 and reject the other amendments.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> We have listened with interest to the Minister, and several issues have come to light. I think that none of us realised that the Bill allowed the independent members to be appointed from outside the district area that they represented, but that provision has been discovered on closer examination. I am not sure whether it should be permitted, because it defeats the logic of creating district partnerships with political representatives from the area.
<P>
The Minister suggested that he was not too sure whether the system would work. The Government have also said that they followed Patten's decision, as if Patten were someone with superior knowledge, and everyone had to bow down and worship at his altar. The Minister should realise that those of us who come from Northern Ireland and have experience of such matters are more acquainted with the reality and can predict the likely outcome. I was a member of a district council for 12 years, and I have watched its subsequent activities. The council tried to establish a police liaison committee, but every year, the SDLP opposed the proposal. It will be good news if it has had a change of heart.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> I can confirm without reservation that the hon. Gentleman is correct. Our argument has always been let us get the totality of policing right, rather than tack on liaison committees to give the impression that it might be right when it patently is not.
<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for confirming that. The SDLP has voted against it every time. When Sinn Fein arrived on the council, it was against it too, so we never could get the proposal to set up a police liaison committee, with the result that there was an informal committee. Those SDLP members, some of whom opposed it in the council, were quite prepared to sit on the informal committee. For the past few years, Omagh district has had a helpful and useful informal police liaison committee, comprising many community representatives. No Sinn Fein member ever appeared at its meetings or was allowed to disrupt it or destroy the minute book. On the whole, it has been useful. The co-operation with the police has been excellent.
<P>
What will happen under the Bill? Omagh district council will be a Sinn Fein council. If it does not accept this new police force and refuses to set up a committee or uses every means within its power to disrupt and destroy the committee, the good relationships that now exist in that area will deteriorate. I know that the Ministers make up their minds on something and then go through with it. They argue and debate and go ahead, saying, "Oh well, we know more about it than you do." When the whole thing turns out as we said it would, they begin to wonder, but even then they take no notice of what we, the elected members in those areas, say.
<P>
Our amendment aims to ameliorate the difficulties that are likely to arise. At least the independent members who would be appointed to this district police board would be independent and not tied to political matters. They would not be appointed by politicians, who would appoint their yes men. They would be appointed by the independent board, on their merits and their skills, not their political affiliations. These boards are detrimental to what has been going on. They will make the life of district police superintendents in the area hell and will destroy the good relationships that exist at present. The Minister is intent on pressing on as usual. I will therefore ask the leave of the Committee to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> There are some points that need a response. I wanted to set the hon. Member's mind at rest about the issue of people from outside a district council perhaps serving on a DPP. It could be a church leader whose church may be in that community, but whose church house is outside it. Does the hon. Gentleman argue that such a person should not serve on it? It could be a business man who makes a major contribution within a district, but lives elsewhere. Is he to be excluded? Would a trade union representative be excluded, too?
<P>
It is to take account of that eventuality that we have allowed that flexibility to be built in. For the life of me, I cannot see why it should be opposed. I did not say that I was not sure whether the Bill would work. I tried to explain that there is no certainty in anything. I have not been granted omnipotence. I can only try to describe what has been set down. I have every confidence that the way in which we have described the Bill and the way in which it will evolve through debate will deliver Patten's objectives.
<P>
Some people may disagree with that and some people may not want that to happen, but we believe that this is about providing a better means of policing in Northern Ireland, which is unique in the United Kingdom. It will establish new best practices, on which police in other parts of the United Kingdom, and perhaps even elsewhere, will draw to improve their relationships with their communities.
<P>
In relation to the power of disruption by those who are trying to destroy that prospect, we have to return to the question of what the majority wants. The majority can stand up to a minority: they have the power, through the ballot box, to remove those who are disruptive. That is a powerful check and balance. If the people of Northern Ireland want a different and better form of policing, and do not want the kind of disruption that the hon. Gentleman described, they will punish those people through the ballot box--and so they should.
<P>
I am glad that the hon. Gentleman wishes to withdraw the amendment--that is sensible--and I remind the Committee that I seek support for amendment No. 67.
<P>
<B>Mr. ípik:</B> I am pleased that the Minister accepts the principle of amendment No. 210. Clearly, if we put every single qualification and concern into the Bill, it would become a multi-volume affair. Given his words about ensuring, as far as practicable, that the independent members of the DPP are representative, we will comfortably go along with that.
<P>
On amendment No. 104, it is a close call. It deals with such an important point that we have been wondering whether to press it to a vote. On balance, the Minister seems to understand our concerns, but he has not convinced me that he is right. However, I hope that the fact that the Government's exact intentions are now on the record, coupled with the presence of the words "have regard to", will mean that any problems that arise will be slightly easier to resolve.
<P>
It would assist matters if it were determined who is to be consulted as the code of practice is formalised. Consultation with the right people should ensure that the issue of compliance is made absolutely clear to those who run the DPPs. However, we shall have that discussion when we reach clause 18.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Does the hon. Member for West Tyrone ask leave to withdraw the amendment?

<P>
We had a fairly lengthy debate on the previous group of amendments. My inclination is that we should not have a stand part debate on schedule 3, because the debate is very wide at the moment, and properly so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> The amendments seek consistency throughout the Bill in relation to those who are to be removed or disqualified from a district policing partnership. Paragraph 7 states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Board or the council, with the approval of the Board, may remove a person from office as a political or independent member of a DPP if satisfied that--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
certain conditions apply. We believe that "may" should become "shall". If the board were satisfied that a person fulfilled the criteria set out in sub-paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and (d), that person should be disqualified.
<P>
Amendment No. 179 adds the rider that we have sought to add on other occasions. It would add the words
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>and has had passed on him a sentence of imprisonment (whether suspended or not).<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The simple words
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>convicted of a criminal offence<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
in paragraph 7(a) go too far, because some offences may be criminal but would not be serious enough to merit disqualification. We seek to strengthen the provision by adding the provision that a prison sentence must have been passed, whether suspended or not. These are reasonable amendments, and we hope that the Government will accept them.
<P>
Amendment No. 180 would bring the Bill into agreement with our previous proposal to omit the reference to an independent member. Paragraph 8(2) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>A person is disqualified for being an independent member of a DPP if--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
he has been convicted of certain offences. That should apply to all members of the district policing partnership. The amendment would replace the words "an independent member" with "a member". The provision would then include both independent members and political members. The Government will argue that political members had already made a commitment to peaceable means when they were elected. However, if an independent member's past has to be looked into and certified as suitable, it seems reasonable that elected members should be treated on an equal basis. This is therefore a worthy amendment. I trust that the Minister will also look favourably on amendments Nos. 179 and 180.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I wish to speak to amendment No. 178, moved by the hon. Member for West Tyrone, and then go on to deal with the amendments tabled by my hon. Friends and me.
<P>
First, I shall deal with the points raised by the hon. Gentleman. I have considerable sympathy with them, although I have one objection to amendment No. 178. It appears potentially to fetter the reasonable exercise of discretion, in that an individual could be removed from a partnership having committed only the most venial of transgressions. That factor must be bome in mind.
<P>
As I understand it, the amendment would require the board to remove someone who had been convicted of any criminal offence in Northern Ireland or elsewhere. That could include a speeding offence. That is going further than I would wish. We have to face the fact that, human fallibility being what it is, individuals may on occasion transgress in a minor way, but that does not necessarily mean that they should be thrown off a DPP. Even judges, in my experience, remain on the bench after receiving speeding convictions. It would be a bit harsh to extend draconian sanctions to Northern Ireland--some discretion needs to be exercised.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stephen Pound </B>(Ealing, North): Is the hon. Gentleman declaring an interest?
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I assure the hon. Gentleman that in this regard I have no current interests to declare--and I hope that I have no forthcoming interests, either.
<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman acknowledge that amendment No. 179 would do away with the problem that he mentioned? It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>and has passed on him a sentence of imprisonment (whether suspended or not).
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I note the hon. Gentleman's comments. Amendment No. 179 appears to temper or to reduce the effect of amendment No. 178. Someone who had a prison sentence--even a suspended sentence--would be likely to be removed from the board. The hon. Gentleman's comments come nearer to the nub of the issue that we need to consider.
<P>
I return to an earlier debate, when we discussed boards, DPPs and district boards. Current practice in the rest of the United Kingdom would be unlikely to be so specific--it involves a discretionary approach--but in Northern Ireland there are exceptional circumstances.
<P>
Amendment No. 162 is intended to establish whether someone should remain on a board if the party that he represents or to which he is linked or affiliated, irrespective of whether he is a political or independent member, breaches the terms of the Belfast agreement. We should take a robust view in that regard. The whole purpose of DPPs will collapse if the members are adjudged, by virtue of developments in Northern Ireland, to be affiliated to a political party that is not, as the amendment puts it,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>committed to non-violence and exclusively peaceful and democratic means<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
or is
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>linked to an organisation that has failed to begin ... commissioning.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Without wishing to go back over old ground which we covered on Second Reading, I appreciate that there is a problem in this context--the decommissioning process has not started. Patten contained the implicit hope that by the time the report was published, decommissioning would already be under way. That has not happened, although there is a hope that it may start very soon. History suggests that the road to decommissioning, or the steps that are tantamount to decommissioning, is difficult, and the agreement of the Ulster Unionists must be secured. The failure to lay down adequate sanctions to remove people from DPPs if decommissioning has not begun is a recipe for disaster. We must avoid that--I do not see what there is to lose by not doing so. DPPs will have precious little chance of surviving unless those aspects of the Belfast agreement are implemented.
<P>
Why cannot such a provision be incorporated in the Bill? Perhaps more pertinently, why does the Minister believe that the provision would be damaging? I suspect that it commands almost universal support.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Temple-Morris </B>(Leominster): I want to put to the hon. Gentleman what is basically a lawyer's point. How does he define the phrase "linked to an organisation"? Flexibility is the key in this context. It is perfectly likely that Sinn Fein will urge decommissioning on the IRA--that has happened in private already and will happen in public. In that context, what good, frankly, would the amendment be to anybody?
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> All that I can say to the hon. Gentleman is that the Secretary of State, who is a member of the hon. Gentleman's own party, has agreed on countless occasions that Sinn Fein and the IRA are inextricably linked. In such circumstances, I shall always be willing to listen carefully to what the Secretary of State has to say about the current state of the linkage, or otherwise, between Sinn Fein and the IRA. However, I am a little surprised by the hon. Gentleman's assertion. I accept that no political organisation or grouping in Northern Ireland is monolithic, and there will always be internal differences of view. Nevertheless, no one has suggested to me that such a linkage does not exist.
<P>
The hon. Member for Leominster (Mr. Temple-Morris) asks how we can tell whether there is such a linkage, and I am prepared to defer to the Secretary of State on that. Questions about linkage and whether decommissioning is happening are raised in the House on numerous occasions. With the help of the Chief Constable and various decommissioners, we shall know at various times whether decommissioning is taking place in accordance with the agreements that were entered into. If they tell us that decommissioning is not happening, we are entitled to infer that it is not. If, at the same time, no one has contradicted the view that a particular political party is linked to a paramilitary group, we can draw appropriate conclusions. I do not therefore regard the hon. Gentleman's objection as a live one. Like the people of Northern Ireland, hon. Members will have little difficulty in deciding whether such linkage exists.
<P>
<B>Mr. ípik:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that stating formally that a linkage has been broken between a paramilitary organisation and its political wing would be potentially as damaging to the peace process as throwing such people off these organisations?
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I would be prepared to agree with the hon. Gentleman on that, but the point made by the hon. Member for Leominster was a bit far-fetched. Throughout the peace process, it has never been suggested that the linkage between certain paramilitary groups and political parties is on the point of being broken. We can happily live with the assumption that those links exist and will continue to exist. Indeed, in the case of Sinn Fein it is inherent in the approach of the personnel who negotiated the latest agreement on decommissioning that such a link exists. They have signed up to an agreement on which they claim they can deliver. If they cannot deliver on it, they should not have signed it. I see no great objection, but I take the point made by the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire.
<P>
Amendment No. 154A is consequential and need not be touched on. Amendment No. 163, which is of a probing nature, differs significantly from amendment No. 162, which deals with a real issue. Nevertheless, amendment No. 163 concerns an issue that needs to be addressed. It would omit the qualification that the only members with previous convictions that must be disqualified are independent members. In effect, it would prevent membership of elected members with relevant previous convictions. I do not wish to labour this issue, because we have discussed it already in the past few days, but it needs to be considered carefully.
<P>
The Bill will establish the principle that one cannot be an independent member of a district policing partnership if one has convictions that fall within the relevant category. There is a good reason for that, which is that such people are not considered suitable for membership. At the same time, the Bill will countenance the idea that, simply because one has been elected to political office in a council, one should be eligible to be such a member. I would be interested to hear from the Minister the rationale and justification for that approach. I am sorry to force him on that point in respect of each of the categories, but I would still like to hear the reasons. On the face of it, to many right-thinking people it seems an extraordinary anomaly that one should have that double category of membership. There might be justifying arguments that, as part of the peace process and of turning over a new leaf, it must be accepted that elected representatives might have unsavoury pasts.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 163 and 162 are linked. Clearly, the insertion of a provision approaching amendment No. 162 would make amendment No. 163 much less necessary. I am sure that the Minister agrees with that. By its nature, amendment No. 162 would ensure that should the requirements under amendment No. 163 not be complied with, the relevant member of the board would cease to be a part of it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Temple-Morris:</B> I am sure that the hon. Gentleman agrees that, hopefully, peace will eventually reign. Does he think that a district policing partnership would be more or less likely to work if formerly convicted terrorists were in rather than out?
<P>
<H5>4.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> My personal view of the way in which district policing partnerships will work is that, to use the Minister's words, it will clearly not always be a comfortable relationship. I am sure that a measure of discomfort will be good. Referring back to my experience on a police-community consultative group, if the relationship had been comfortable, we would not have made progress in police-community relations in Brixton during the time that I served on that group.
<P>
I accept that there will be creative tension. A reason for having the DPPs and, I suspect, the sole justification, is to ensure that such a creative dialogue is entered into, even if it is at times uncomfortable. There will always come a cut-off point. That point will be when one has moved away from being able to create a climate for the creative interchange of views into a climate of sterile confrontation. Those most likely to be engaged in the process would be precisely those no longer complying with the requirements of amendment No. 162. That is why I find that amendment so much better than amendment No. 163, which I tabled for discussion but against which arguments can legitimately be made.
<P>
With that in mind, I ask the Committee to consider the amendments. I look forward to hearing the Minister's response to them.

<P>

<B>Mr. Keith Darvill </B>(Upminster): I want to speak against amendment No. 178. We have been discussing the effect on paragraph 7(a), but I would like to talk about the effect that the amendment would have on paragraph 7(b). The amendment would remove the board's discretion to remove members. The word "shall" would mean that the board would have to remove members. Paragraph 7(b) deals with members who become bankrupt or who make a composition or arrangement with creditors. A member could have committed a minor financial indiscretion--individuals frequently come to compositions with their creditors for sound reasons--and the board would have no discretion to take into account the severity of the composition or arrangement or, in the case of a bankruptcy, the fact that the insolvent person intended to pay all of his or her creditors. If the Committee was mindful to accept the amendment for the effect on paragraph 7(a), it should think again because of the onerous effect on the other sub-paragraphs.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> I wish to speak to amendments Nos. 68 and 69, which are both straightforward. Amendment No. 68 is designed to ensure that people who are convicted of scheduled offences are not automatically disqualified from membership of a DPP. As the Bill stands, a person who is convicted of any scheduled offence is automatically disqualified from membership of a DPP. There is no discretion. No one has the power to grant exemptions or review the circumstances of individual cases. The provision is faulty and unjust. Some scheduled offences over the past 25 years have been remarkably minor and only fines have been imposed. To prohibit all people who have been convicted of such offences from participating in a DPP would be profoundly unjust and would raise genuine human rights concerns.
<P>
Let me give an example. During the initial stages of ceasefire, before it became a peace process, I took a special interest in how the emergency legislation was working. During one extensive period, almost all the cases and convictions were in relation to people parking their cars in restricted zones. The unfortunate person--and there were many of them--who had parked his car in a town or place that he did not know well had committed a scheduled offence. Such people will not be eligible to serve on a DPP. That is not the Bill's intention. The amendment would remove the reference to scheduled offences and the anomalies in the clause.
<P>
Amendment No. 69 has a simple purpose. It is designed to ensure that people with suspended sentences are not automatically disqualified from membership of a DPP. The Bill provides that anyone who is convicted of a criminal offence and given a suspended sentence will be automatically disqualified from membership of a DPP. No one will be able to do anything about that. There is no discretion. That is unjust because many people were given suspended sentences many years ago for relatively minor matters that did not pertain to the troubles in the north of Ireland.
<P>
There is one extreme case of someone whom we all know, admire and would love to see on a DPP. A sporting figure--I will not use his name--was in a country far from here on a tour and decided, in a moment of youthful exuberance, that he liked the look of a flag on top of a building. He attempted to procure the flag and, indeed, was successful, but that was a heinous offence in that country. Other young people have committed similar crimes and, had they not been young, they would not have got suspended sentences. Suspension was a warning that they had acted foolishly. I was struck by the hon. Member for Beaconsfield's previous reference to the fact that he had been adjacent to people who might have committed an offence of that nature. There cannot be an absolute position on this.
<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the aforementioned person--whom he did not name--was in Argentina? They think more of their flag in Argentina than some people in Northern Ireland think of the flag of the United Kingdom.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> That is a valid point, although I make no comment about what country it happened in. I simply make the point that someone could be disqualified for life from serving on a DPP for such an offence. It might be a good idea if we could give that person a contract to get rid of all flags for a while; that would make life a lot easier.
<P>
I want the system to work fairly and equitably. We should not write into the Bill anything that would be anomalous--which, in my view, the scheduled offences certainly would be. I know of instances in prominent and learned--I emphasise the term "learned"--people would not have been able to exercise their wisdom as they do, had such a provision applied to their chosen role in public life.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> The amendments in the group deal with the criteria for the disqualification and removal of those who serve on district policing partnerships. Our debate has echoed our extensive debate about the disqualification and removal of Policing Board members. We have heard the arguments today, on Second Reading and in previous consideration of the issue, and it is an emotive subject.
<P>
Some people want to see no end of safeguards in place, while others regard any safeguards as unwelcome.The hon. Member for Newry and Armagh wants to loosen the restrictions, through amendments Nos. 68 and 69, but other hon. Members want to strengthen the restrictions. In respect of schedule 1, the Government have to deal with diametrically opposite positions, so we refer to the underlying ethos of the Good Friday agreement. It called for a constructive and inclusive partnership with the community at all levels, and highlighted the importance of policing.
<P>
In considering the issue and establishing the terms of reference, as set out in the Good Friday agreement, Patten met the test of inclusivity. The Government's position is clear, and the Secretary of State set it out clearly in the Irish News on 15 June, when he said that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>elected members of these bodies are not subject to any such restrictions.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I give only part of the lengthy explanation that he provided, but I would say that that is right as it applies to elected representatives. They are already subject to the restrictions set out in the Local Government (Northern Ireland) Act 1972, which disqualifies people on grounds of criminal convictions and stipulates that people wishing to become councillors must make a declaration of non-violence.
<P>
It is worth spelling out how disqualification applies to different elected representatives. Members of Parliament are not subject to criminal record criteria, but councillors are. The test for councillors relates to any offence for which a sentence of imprisonment for three months or more has been passed within a period of five years immediately preceding the day on which a councillor is elected. That test is set out in the Local Government (Northern Ireland) Act 1972. Councillors are also required to make a declaration against terrorism by the Elected Authorities (Northern Ireland) Act 1989. Members of the Northern Ireland Assembly are not subject to disqualification criteria, unless they are Ministers, who are required to affirm a pledge of office, under the Northern Ireland Act 1998. Councillors must satisfy tests before joining councils, and therefore before they can move on to DPPs, and those tests are proportionate to those provisions. We have made it clear that safeguards will make disqualification of persons convicted of serious terrorist and non-terrorist offences mandatory.
<P>
<H5>4.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I shall now deal with the arguments on amendment No. 68. I accept that the provision on scheduled offences would set the threshold too high by excluding people convicted of relatively minor offences from serving as independent members of DPPs. On reflection, I ask the Committee to accept amendment No. 68, supported by my hon. Friend the Member for Newry and Armagh. It will ensure that only people sentenced to a term of imprisonment, whether suspended or not, will be disqualified. That is a robust safeguard. I cannot accept the argument for amendment No. 69, but amendment No. 68 moves the threshold to a point on which I hope the Committee will agree.
<P>
The safeguards that remain include the power in paragraph 7, which allows the council or the board to remove a person convicted of a criminal offence. The provisions individually and cumulatively provide appropriate safeguards.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 155A, 156A, 157A and 163, spoken to by the hon. Member for Beaconsfield, and amendment No. 180, spoken to by the hon. Member for West Tyrone, would frustrate the core aim of inclusivity by applying the restrictions for independent members to political members. The hon. Member for Beaconsfield opposed amendment No. 178, supported by the hon. Member for West Tyrone. Amendments Nos. 178 and 179 would require removal from a DPP for imprisonment for any offence. I do not need to rehearse the arguments again; the hon. Member for Beaconsfield highlighted the fundamental weakness with amendment No. 178.
<P>
The starting point is that elected representatives should be able to serve on a DPP. If someone can pass the initial tests that I described, and the people have judged, we should trust their judgment. That is Patten's intention, and that is how the new beginning to policing in Northern Ireland will be achieved.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 162 and 154A, which the hon. Member for Beaconsfield supported, add further criteria for removal from a DPP. I am surprised that the hon. Gentleman asks me to rehearse the arguments again, but I am always prepared to do that. He wants the Government to set aside the notion of inclusivity, but I hope that we can convince him and his party of the importance of that and the way in which--to use the hackneyed word--bipartisanship applies. We should ask ourselves how best to take forward inclusivity, rather than put road blocks in its way, as the hon. Gentleman and his party are doing.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> Surely amendment No. 162 does no such thing. The purpose of the Belfast agreement was to set a framework within which to achieve inclusivity. All that the amendment would do is remove some people from DPPs if the terms of the Belfast agreement, including decommissioning--the Prime Minister described that as an obligation under the agreement--were not met within a time frame that the Secretary of State tells us has been agreed. That does not breach the inclusivity test.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> Not in the stark way that the hon. Gentleman presents the situation, but he is not viewing the situation correctly. He should consider the earlier argument about people elected to serve on the Assembly. The logic of his position would not allow them to serve at any level, not just in policing. If the Conservative party wants what has been re-established to implode, because, by its definition, the test has not been met, it should say that. However, it is being selective by focusing only on policing. I do not understand the logic of that.
<P>
We constantly look for ways in which inclusivity can be developed and improved on. We always said that decommissioning should be dealt with separately. We have never deviated or shirked the importance of that, and are at one in pursuing that objective. However, it should satisfy different and other tests, on which we and the Conservative party disagree. The Conservatives must come clean. If they do not want the Assembly to be up and running, they should say that the whole process--which is developing, rather than being finished or perfect--should not prevail.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> The Opposition supported the Government in their approach to decommissioning and the Assembly. We certainly supported the Secretary of State in deciding to suspend the operation of the Assembly when decommissioning did not happen. We were content with the idea of the reinstatement of the Assembly on the basis of promises with regard to decommissioning and its rapid inception. The amendment would take effect only if that did not happen. I therefore do not recognise the inconsistency. We support the Assembly, but it cannot and should not survive--and the Executive cannot survive--if it includes Members who have not honoured the decommissioning commitment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> We have also debated the point that this does not rest only with the Government or Governments. It also rests with the parties in Northern Ireland. There are many players in the equation, which is not just about a Government saying yes or no. It is about trying to encourage greater agreement of purpose within the parties in Northern Ireland, which must find common cause to move forward. Judgments have to be made about that all the time.
<P>
We are discussing a framework for a policing structure, which will happen not tomorrow but at some time in the future. We are laying down ground rules and hope for the future. First, the party represented by the hon. Member for Beaconsfield argued that there should be no prisoner releases without decommissioning. I do not know whether it still holds to that view. It is now saying that there should be no policing board unless the guns are handed in. It keeps trying to find ways to stop progress. Decommissioning is a fundamental and important issue for everyone who wants a peaceful future in Northern Ireland. However, it must be dealt with separately, and we have made significant progress, on which we hope to build. The Secretary of State and the Prime Minister have made that clear time and again.
<P>
The Secretary of State has also made clear the consequences of breaching what we want to achieve. If the principles are not upheld, that has serious implications for prisoner releases and many other aspects of the process. The Secretary of State does not speak only for himself and the Government when he articulates that view; he speaks for the wider community in Northern Ireland. It is not the kind of process in which one can take building blocks off the shelf and put them in place to make a total structure. It is not that easy, as the previous Government understood when they tried to move the process forward. I shall not analyse where they failed and where they had partial success. They dealt with difficult situations in trying to reconcile complex issues and achieve a difficult objective. In relation to the inclusivity test, if we say that that precondition should apply elsewhere, we do not have a process. The peace process therefore fails. That is the difference between us on this. That is why I cannot find it within myself to ask the Committee to support the underlying principles of the amendments.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 187, 188 and 189 address a concern raised by the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire. Amendment No. 188 would limit removal from office to conviction for a criminal offence committed after the date of appointment. We considered that under schedule 1. The Committee agreed that it is necessary to ensure that the council or board has the power to act where a person fails to disclose a conviction, and Government amendments Nos. 187 and 189 permit that. We are changing the framework consistent with what the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire argued on a previous occasion. During our consideration of the parallel provisions under schedule 1, I gave notice of the way in which we would deal with this matter. The amendments to that schedule will be tabled on Report. I therefore ask the Committee to support Government amendments Nos. 187, 188 and 189 and amendment No. 68, tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Newry and Armagh.
<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> As usual, I have listened with interest to the Minister. As usual, our recommendation has been turned down. That does not surprise us Unionists because we believe that the purpose of the Bill is to placate Sinn Fein. The new police service will work only if it has the support of Sinn Fein. The Government must therefore do all that they can to placate and persuade Sinn Fein to accept it. We therefore see throughout the Bill that elected members who come from Sinn Fein cannot be prevented from taking office, but independent members have to pass all these processes before they can get in.
<P>
<B>Mr. Temple-Morris:</B> What is the difference between placating Sinn Fein--that wonderfully simplistic statement--and being large enough to move away from the status quo to secure peace in Northern Ireland?
<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> Unionists do not accept that peace in Northern Ireland will be achieved or continued by placating Sinn Fein. Sinn Fein has a large amount of arms and is holding on to them. It may not be using them now, but it does not have to because it has shown over the past few years that it has the capability to use them, especially in London and other places on the mainland. When it has them, it constitutes a threat, and it can use that to get concessions from the Government. The Government have consistently given in to that threat. That is why we have--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman is straying slightly and moving into general territory. I hope that he will remain within the ambit of the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> It may be general, but it is true. That is why a distinction is made throughout the Bill between elected members who will inevitably be Sinn Fein members, both on the boards and on district partnerships, and independent members. We therefore have a complete anomaly: independent members must pass certain qualifications to get in and can be disqualified if they have committed offences, but nothing will happen to Sinn Fein or other elected members who have committed and been imprisoned for the foulest of crimes.
<P>
If I were an independent member who had committed a crime, but not a terrorist crime, and I applied to join a district police board, I could be turned down because of a criminal record; yet, having been turned down, I could view the district police board membership and see welcomed on it several people who had committed far worse crimes than mine. That is unsatisfactory. It is an anomaly whose only possible justification is to placate Sinn Fein. That is precisely what the Bill is about.
<P>
I regret that the Minister has rejected our sensible amendments, but I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<B>Mr. John M. Taylor </B>(Solihull): On a point of order, Mr. Malins. I have never claimed to be a master of procedure on these matters, but my colleague and I would have liked to vote on amendment No. 162. If we are unable to do so, we shall hide our disappointment and return to it on Report. I am in your hands, Mr. Malins.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> These matters are always complex. It is a question of the order in which amendments appear on the amendment paper. If, at an earlier stage, a vote has been sought, the position might have been different. We have now passed the amendment, but the hon. Gentleman may have an opportunity to return to the matter later.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Malins. I am an old master of procedures. What will happen to my amendment No. 69?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> When we have a lead amendment in a group and the first amendment is moved, the other amendments within the group are conveniently debated with it. The amendment is proposed and a vote may or may not be taken at the end of the debate. The amendment may or may not be withdrawn. We then move through the amendment paper. If, before a particular amendment is reached, an hon. Member desires a vote, the Chair will accept a vote on it; but if we have passed on to the next proposal on the amendment paper, it is then too late to vote on it. For the avoidance of doubt, it would be helpful if hon. Members would tell the Chair that a vote will be required when the amendment is called.
<P>
If the hon. Gentleman seeks a vote on amendment No. 69, he can ask the Committee to divide. Does he wish to do so?

<B>Dr. Jenny Tonge </B>(Richmond Park): I beg to move amendment No. 105, in page 49, line 18, leave out
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'from among the political members'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take amendment No. 106, in page 49, leave out lines 21 and 22 and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'the office of chairman is held by a political member and the office of vice-chairman is held by an independent member'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Dr. Tonge:</B> In the schedule as drafted, the chair and vice-chairs of the DPPs must be drawn from their political members, although the positions must be held by members of different political parties. There is no such qualification on the Policing Board.
<P>
We are anxious that the top-end structure of the DPPs will become too politicised. Their function is to bring policing back to the community and not all prominent members of a local community are politicians. We want a variety of views to be represented at the highest level in the DPPS. That would also help to solve any problems in council areas such as North Down when d'Hondt is applied.
<P>
North Down council has a large number of independent members who will not get the chance to be political members of DPPs. They often represent business or single issues in an area and that shortcoming could be rectified by giving independent members the vice-chair of the DPPs.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland (Mr. George Howarth):</B> As the hon. Member for Richmond Park (Dr. Tonge) explained, the amendments would open the posts of chairman and vice-chairmen of DPPs to independent members; it would require the chairman to be drawn from political members, and the vice-chairmen from those designated as independents. That is an interesting idea, although it is contrary to what Patten said on the subject. He recommended that the chair of the DPP should be held by an elected member, with rotations between the parties from year to year.
<P>
The hon. Lady mentioned her understandable fear, which may be shared by those coming from different directions and areas, that the positions could become politicised. However, she will appreciate that the purpose of the proposal is specifically to tie the political parties to the new arrangements. That was made clear by paragraph 6.25 of the Patten report--which is why we have provided it. We have tried faithfully to implement the report's commendations.
<P>
Patten makes no recommendation on a vice-chairman, but we have provided for a sensible balancing provision that requires the chairman and vice-chairmen to come from different parties. While political parties are tied into the arrangement, a balancing effect is therefore created. Amendment No. 106 would remove that requirement, by making the vice-chairman an independent. We also expect the vice-chairman to act in place of the chairman, which will provide an opportunity to serve an apprenticeship, gain experience and become a potential chairman. The amendment would move away from the sort of arrangements that Patten envisaged and which we are trying to reproduce.
<P>
Although I understand why the hon. Member for Richmond Park has gone down that route in her amendments, I believe that the Bill provides a strict and accurate fulfilment of Patten's recommendations. I hope that she will see the logic of the arrangements. The debate--short and, I hope, sweet as it may have been--has been worth while because it enables us to make clear the reason for and origin of the arrangements.
<P>
<B>Dr. Tonge:</B> My hon. Friend the Member for Montgomeryshire is not here; I sometimes need his advice. However, from the instructions that I have received, I think that the Minister's explanation is perfectly acceptable. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendments.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Dr. Tonge:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 213, in page 50, line 2, leave out '5' and insert 'two-thirds of its members'.
<P>
The amendment changes the quorum for DPPs from five to two-thirds of the membership. That is a way of ensuring that most members are present for votes to count, which should in turn ensure that a representative proportion is always present for binding decisions and that the proportion remains constant even if the number of members varies. We are unhappy with having a fixed number.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I apologise for not being present for the hon. Lady's earlier comments. I understand her argument. It would be worth while to draw comparisons with what we are doing on the Policing Board. As a result of consideration and debate, we have reduced the quorum for a meeting of that board to seven out of 19. We will also introduce a variation on that for a direct rule board, for which the quorum is 14 out of 19, although that has still to be defined. Given that a 19-member Policing Board has serious, heavyweight powers to discharge, it would be wrong to have a different, higher standard for the DPPs. That is why we have set the figure at five. It is not unreasonable that the membership of the DPPs should be set within the legislation at 15, 17 or 19. We have simply said that this is a consultative body. It is not in that sense a decision-making body and it is therefore not unreasonable to set it at a figure of five, which is slightly lower than that set for the Policing Board, a body of similar overall size.
<P>
I have set out our objectives. On that basis, I ask the hon. Lady to withdraw her amendment. If she presses it, we will resist it.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Dr. Tonge:</B> I cannot accept that. It seems extraordinary for a proportion of the body not to be present when there is a division to be called or a decision to be made. I accept that the body is consultative. Nevertheless, I am unhappy that the quorum should be five people. What is to prevent five people from ensuring that they will be there and that, by some device or other, all the other people will not be? It seems arbitrary and peculiar, so I would like to press the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> The hon. Lady helped to convince us of the need to change the size of the quorum of the policing board. We did that and set it at seven people, but the board is a decision-making body. We are dealing with a consultative body, for which it is not unreasonable to have a slightly lower figure. It is up to her whether she wants a vote to highlight our contradictory positions on the bodies.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> I believe that we shall have to look again at the business of the quorum in relation to the Bill. The quorum element is preventing decisions on various important matters. If we could consider the way in which it hamstrings decision making, it might allow the hon. Member for Richmond Park to present her position again. It is a subject to which we shall have to return.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> Perhaps I can help. If we return to the subject, we shall consider it in a similar light, but I do not think that we shall precisely come back to it. I do not accept the charge made by the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh about there being a limiting factor. In terms of the previous debate, we were dealing with what seemed to be an extreme issue defined by Patten. That was why we argued that a majority of 10 out of 19 was not unreasonable. I do not see that as a limiting factor, but a responsible approach to an important issue.
<P>
I understand that the hon. Gentleman has a different point of view. We had the argument and said that the subject would probably be reconsidered on Report. I imagine that he will return to the subject, and we shall consider all the arguments.
<P>
In terms of amendment No. 213 on the DPPs, it would clearly fall to the Government to consider any knock-on effect on the relationships. At present, I am not minded to accept the amendment, as five people is not an unreasonable figure on what may be a consultative body of 15.

<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 71, in page 50, line 9, leave out '(3)' and insert '(3A)'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> The amendment would ensure that the meetings had the transparency that Patten required. It recommends, as Patten did, that the DPPs meet in public. It seems strange, given the lengths to which the Bill goes to involve the public in DPPs, that there is no provision for them to meet in such a way. I readily accept that a body might decide, on occasion, that it should meet in private. The amendment does not contravene that; it simply provides that meetings can and will be held in public.
<P>
I thank the Government for telling me that clause 18, in a code of practice to be approved by the Secretary of State, provides for the board to require a DPP to meet in public. That is interesting, and I look forward to what the Government have to say about the clause. I am especially interested in the Secretary of State's approach to the code of practice. Will he approve one that does not require open meetings? The Government's reply may contain the information that I seek. Amendment No. 71 is consequential to amendment No. 70.

<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland (Mr. George Howarth):</B> The amendments would require district policing partnerships to hold each and every meeting in public except when, in the opinion of the partnership, it was not in the public interest to do so. My hon. Friend knows that the amendment goes beyond Patten. We have provided for Patten to be implemented by having the Policing Board issue a code to the partnerships on the exercise of their functions under clause 18. The clause lists the areas covered by the code, including procedures for meetings and public meetings. I can assure my hon. Friend that the Secretary of State would not consent to a code that did not include a provision for public meetings as Patten recommended--that is, once a month.
<P>
We believe that such details should be covered in a code rather than in the Bill. That will allow some flexibility for the 26 DPPs. In an earlier exchange with the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone, my right hon. Friend the Minister of State said that there would be pressures and needs for different procedures in the policing partnership areas. For example, a code could be developed to reflect best practice and for slightly varied arrangements to apply, say, in Moyle, or in Belfast, where conditions are different and the needs to be addressed may vary.
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I am sure that my hon. Friend will note that I cannot envisage any Secretary of State consenting to a code that did not cover such a fundamental issue as public meetings. In the light of my assurances, I hope that he will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> I thank the Minister for his assurances. He is right; the matter goes beyond Patten. It does so because of the lack of reference to such measures in the Bill. I accept that it is a procedural matter for the DPPs--up to a point, in terms of the acceptance of the code of practice. It then becomes a matter for the Secretary of State. On the basis of the Minister's assurance that he could not envisage any Secretary of State agreeing to a code of practice that did not require public meetings to be held by a DPP, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

district policing partnership
to council
<P>
<B>Mr. ípik:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 215, in page 8, line 37, after 'council', insert 'and to the Board'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 216, in page 9, leave out lines 1 to 4 and insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'(4) The district policing partnership shall arrange for a report submitted under this section to be published in such a manner as appears, after consultation with the council, to be appropriate.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 218, in clause 17, page 9, line 9, leave out 'the' and insert 'any'.
<P>
<B>Mr. ípik:</B> The amendment would require that the board, rather than merely district councils, should receive reports from DPPs as a matter of course. Amendments Nos. 216 and 218 are consequential to it. We believe that the board should have an accurate overview of developments in district policing partnership areas. It should not have to request a report; receipt should be automatic. I should be interested to hear the Minister's comments.
<P>
<B>Mr. George Howarth:</B> As the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire said, the amendment would simply be a different way of doing what the Bill already provides for. It would require a copy of the DPP's annual report required under subsection (1) to be sent to the board as well as to the council, whereas the Bill requires the council to send a copy of the report to the board under subsection (4)(b). I ask the hon. Gentleman not to press the amendment or amendment No. 216, which is, as he said, consequential to it, and would effectively tidy up subsection (4) to take into account the changes that the amendments would make to subsection (1).
<P>
Amendment No. 218, which was also tabled by the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire, would enable DPPs to issue their own reports. To use a phrase that the hon. Member for Beaconsfield used, the amendment is otiose, as DPPs will already be able to do that. In light of those assurances--I suspect that these were probing amendments rather than issues of principle for the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire--I hope that he will not press the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. ípik:</B> Filled with rage though I may be at the repeated use of the word "otiose", I shall contain my anger. As the Minister has, having perceptively spotted my anxiety, made it clear for the record that the board will pretty much automatically receive the report, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'(b) district policing partnerships;
<P>
(c) the Secretary of State;
<P>
(d) the Chief Constable;
<P>
(e) the Police Ombudsman;

(f) the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission;
<P>
(g) the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland; and
<P>
(h) such other bodies or persons as the Board considers appropriate.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In essence, the amendments--especially amendment No. 220--deal with who is to be consulted before the code of practice is revised. I made this point earlier in the debate. Amendment No. 220 specifies a list of bodies, which the Government might find over-prescriptive. However, I am probing to see whether they might be interested in accepting either of the amendments as they stand, or in adding a phrase such as "any other body appropriate" at the end of line 22 on page 9.
<P>
The background to the amendments is a concern that not enough people with a vested interest in the codes of practice will become involved in the process. I suspect that the Minister will reassure me that that is not the case. However, unless the organisations mentioned in the amendment become involved, they might not buy into the code of practice.
<P>
Amendment No. 219 reflects our concern that the Secretary of State will have the right of veto in relation to the code of practice. We believe that the board should be able to operate independently of his approval. I shall be interested, as ever, to hear the Minister.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> Contrary to my remarks in earlier debates about the conversion of "may" to "shall", I am inclined to look at amendment No. 219 sympathetically. However, in terms of the relationship between the Secretary of State and the board, it is important, given previous debates on his role in terms of oversight, that this part of the Bill should adopt a light touch approach, but with the Secretary of State as the fallback. I am not inclined to remove the provision, but we do not expect it to be heavily exercised because we want to devolve power and decision making as far as possible. I am prepared to consider the principle of amendment No. 219. If we return to the matter on Report, the hon. Gentleman may wish to discuss it further then.
<P>
I accept that amendment No. 220 is a probing amendment, but the hon. Gentleman suggested a list of the bodies that should be consulted. Other hon. Members may suggest others, but a line must be drawn. The Bill requires the board to consult district councils, which have responsibility for setting up DPPs, and the Chief Constable, but they may consult anyone else if they wish. I would expect normal practice to be for representative bodies to be consulted.
<P>
We do not want to be too prescriptive, so the approach is open-ended, but the principle is sound. Consultation should be the order of the day for the Policing Board and it will be expected to approach various organisations with vigour because a great body of knowledge and opinion is available that can help it in coming to a judgment on the policing of the wider community. I hope that, with those assurances and my agreement to reconsider amendment No. 219 on Report, the hon. Gentleman will withdraw his amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. ípik:</B> I am pleased that the Minister accepts the principle of autonomy in amendment No. 219.
<P>
On amendment No. 220, I accept that hundreds of organisations could be included, but I hope that he will at least consider whether words such as "any other body as appropriate" could be inserted at the end of line 22. That would help to emphasise that there is an expectation that such bodies will be consulted, but I accept, however, that there may be benefits in not listing specific organisations. I hope that we can return to the matter on Report.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pound:</B> I rise in a genuine spirit of trying to discern the working of the Liberal Democrat mind. Amendment No. 220 would require the police ombudsman to be consulted. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the role of the ombudsman is to consider events that have occurred and not to take any part in the prescription of events that may occur? I realise that time and space sometimes become warped in the hon. Gentleman's mind, but surely the ombudsman's role is specifically ex post facto. The hon. Gentleman is trying to construct a whole new role for the ombudsman which I suspect may not convince the majority of the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. ípik:</B> I believe that the hon. Gentleman is a bit naughty. I leave it to you, Mr. Malins, to rule whether his use of language was out of order.

<P>
and insert 'shall'.
<P>
<B>Mr. ípik:</B> These are small but important housekeeping amendments. I hope that the Minister will either agree to them or give an assurance that the Government agree with their intentions.
<P>
Amendment No. 221 would require the code of practice to include "the publication of ... minutes". An accurate record of meetings should be available. We should also specify to whom they would be available. Amendment No. 223 relates to the code of practice, and amendment No. 224, which is a probing amendment, would replace the general requirement to "consult" with a more specific requirement to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>take fully into account the views of<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
the relevant DPP.
<P>
Amendment No. 225 would remove from the Bill some words that we believe are otiose and replace them with the word "shall". Those who are interested can establish for themselves exactly what that amendment involves. Basically, autonomous action should be taken on behalf of DPPs, and the approval of the board should not always be necessary for the actions that are referred to in clause 21.
<P>
As ever, I am dying to hear the Minister's response.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> Amendment No. 221 would require the clause's code to cover the publication of minutes of meetings. Paragraph 6.37 of the Patten report dealt with that matter, but no recommendations were made--it simply proposed a useful way to deal with the matter. We can safely assume that DPPs will publish minutes, in the manner that PANI and the Independent Commission for Police Complaints for Northern Ireland currently do. It is standard practice to publish minutes in that way.
<P>
The amendment involves a level of detail that is not necessary--it would be over-prescriptive to require minutes to be published. The code of practice will contain the relevant provisions and deal with that matter. I find it difficult to imagine that a DPP, whose membership will include people who worked with councils that publish minutes and independents who understand the importance of transparency, will say that it will not publish minutes. DPPs will be given guidance about the relevant requirements. We should not be heavy handed in this regard--the provision is not needed in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. ípik:</B> Will the Minister confirm that it is the Government's expectation that minutes will be widely available to members of the public who are not directly connected to a DPP?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> Yes. Our expectation is that the minutes will be published.
<P>
Amendment No. 223 would deal with matters that are covered by the code. It fails because it, too, tries to be over-prescriptive. The code focuses on issues recommended by Patten, of which this was not one. If the board chooses, it can determine who, or what bodies, should be consulted, because it can issue guidance as to the exercise by DPPs of their functions under clause 18(l). That is why we shall not accept amendment No. 223.
<P>
Government amendment No. 229 was tabled in response to a concern of the Police Authority that the code should include provisions about the arrangements to be made by DPPs to get the views of the public about policing, and to obtain the cooperation of the public with the police in preventing crime. Given that the board also has responsibility in that respect, similar to that exercised by the Police Authority, it is sensible to carry that through into the provision. That is the reason for Government amendment No. 299, which I ask the Committee to accept.
<P>
Amendments No. 224 and Government amendment No. 230 deal with clause 20, and are effectively intended to achieve the same purpose. Amendment No. 230 will ensure that district commanders take account of the views of DPPs when drawing up local policing plans.
<P>
Amendment No. 225 would require DPPs to make arrangements for consultations with the police at local community level and would remove the approval of the board. That is not a desirable approach. The other provisions on DPPs, including the code of practice, make it clear that this is an area where they will be required to act. I would therefore question the removal of the role of the Policing Board, which has overall responsibility for community accountability, as can be seen from the description of its functions in clause 2(3)(d)(iii), which states that it must
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>assess ... the effectiveness of arrangements made under Part II of the Bill in obtaining the views of the public.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Policing Board must be given its due place. Although we have argued that it is time to transfer power down to a level that is as close as possible to the local community, the board has an onerous set of responsibilities placed on it. On that basis, I am not inclined to accept amendment No. 225. I ask the hon. Gentleman not to press the amendment and to accept Government amendments Nos. 229 and 230.
<P>
<B>Mr. ípik:</B> The Government seem to be taking the same view in amendment No. 230. Much of the time, our amendments seek to achieve a balance in terms of the board and so on. The Minister seems to be sympathetic to what we are trying to achieve. However, we must be careful to ensure that, if it transpires that there are problems when the Bill is enacted, there is some mechanism for tidying it up. That will be easier to do in practice than in the rather theoretical proceedings in this Room.
<P>
In the words of Winston Churchill, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Malins. I heard you say that clause 20 has been passed "as amended", but in my simple frailty, I could see no amendment to that clause. My intention was to ask you about that, but I expect that it was discussed earlier, so my point of order turns out to be completely otiose.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The hon. Gentleman has a reputation for raising entirely valid points of order at all times.
<H4><center>Clause 21</center></H4>
<H4><center>Other community</center></H4>
policing arrangements
<P>
<B>Mr. ípik:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Malins. I apologise for interrupting, but I wanted to offer some advice. Amendment No. 81, which we shall consider shortly, appears to be in the wrong place on the selection list. I mention that now, so that the clerks can establish whether I am right.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I have heard what the hon. Gentleman has said. The point has been noted and we shall look at the matter.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> It is obvious that we in the Ulster Unionist party do not like policing partnerships and, in theory, we have voted against them. However, I draw Committee members' attention to clause 21. Empowering a district policing partnership to require the police to meet local communities on a statutory basis seems to be going much too far. The police normally meet any local community that they wish to meet, but a statutory arrangement such as this goes too far. Will the Government look seriously at my objection at some future date?
<P>
<B>Mr. George Howarth:</B> As the hon. Member said, the clause enables the DPPs to make arrangements to facilitate consultation between the police and any local community within the district. These will be along the lines of the current CPLCs, whose virtues the hon. Member extolled in an earlier debate. Indeed, I believe that he played an active part in the one in Omagh over several years. I join him in paying tribute to those bodies. The Chief Constable should be consulted before any such arrangements are made. The clause will enable arrangements at a level below that of the DPP, and it recognises the role of the current community and police liaison committees.
<P>
In response to what I hope will be unfounded concerns that DPPs might not act responsibly in making such arrangements and, more positively, to ensure best practice, we have required the DPPs to have the approval of the board to set up such bodies. Furthermore, if the board believes that the DPP has not made satisfactory arrangements, it may itself make local arrangements having first consulted the DPP. The hon. Gentleman's concerns, although real and relating to matters that needed to be addressed, are unfounded because the arrangements set out in the clause obviate his fears. I hope that members of the Committee will find the goodness in their hearts to allow the clause to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B> For the record, I ought to refer to the remarks right that I made on Second Reading about the various layers of consultation, and about whether due thought had been given to the resources that would be required for this consultation. I also wondered whether there might be a danger that it would deflect the police from their main roles of crime fighting and law enforcement. I will not labour those points now, but I felt it appropriate, as I had raised them on Second Reading, not to let the moment pass to mention them in Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> The hon. Gentleman raises a legitimate concern that he has mentioned before. However, to achieve the right cross-community balance, especially in Northern Ireland, it is important that we consult, so that anyone from any section of the community, and from either tradition, who feels that his or her concerns are not being properly addressed has the opportunity to raise them during the consultation process, and, one hopes, have them addressed. That is why various points in the procedures have opportunities for consultation built into them.
<P>
I recognise the point that the hon. Gentleman is making. One reaches a point, as a Minister, at which the amount of consultation in which one has to engage can seem onerous. However, it is my considered opinion that, in the end, the results are usually better as a result of consultation, rather than worse. Nevertheless, the hon. Gentleman is right to raise that fear, and we must always be vigilant about the issue.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I am not terribly sure whether the Minister took the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for West Tyrone as far as had been intended. We are concerned about the clause because it appears to place an onus on the police to meet other organisations under the aegis of the DPPs. In certain circumstances, the DPPs may feel that they alone can provide the vehicle by means of which other groups can meet the police. Will the Minister assure us that, if the police want to meet a request from a group of individuals or an organisation for a meeting, there will be no obligation on them to consult the DPP about it, even if the meeting will deal with matters that may have a broader impact on the community? In other words, will the police still have the freedom to consult whomever they like, without reference to the DPP?
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I am afraid that I cannot give that assurance to the hon. Gentleman. It is our intention that the DPPs will make the arrangements to facilitate consultation between the police and the local community, with the approval of the board and after consultation with the Chief Constable. The Chief Constable would not allow inappropriate consultation to take place, and would make his views known, as part of that process. The process might include setting up bodies like CPLCs, where they do not already exist. The hon. Member for West Tyrone has expressed his concern that, in some parts of Northern Ireland, such bodies do not exist.
<P>
The hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone may be making a different point. There may, for example, be a group of local women who feel vulnerable in certain places late at night. Those women would want to consult the police collectively, rather than expressing their concerns through a more formal body. I cannot foresee circumstances in which the procedure would preclude that. If a group of people with a specific interest in an operational police matter wanted to make contact with the local police, I am sure that that could be done. We know that the Chief Constable welcomes the local consultation process and that the police will be free to consult with whomever they like outside that framework. I hope that that reassures the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I think that I am reassured by what the Minister has said. I am rather flattered to find that I have managed to raise an issue that had not previously occurred to him.
<P>
People will have as little regard for the DPPs, as constituted under the Bill, as I am likely to have. Thus, I want to be doubly assured. First, any group of people representing, for example, pensioners or elderly ladies concerned about their safety who come to me, as a Member of Parliament, must have access to the police. Secondly, the DPP must not be able to inhibit such groups in any way, if it discovers that they have such access.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I can give the hon. Gentleman the assurance that he seeks. I am glad on this occasion to have flattered him, although I suspect that he paid me a back-handed compliment.
<P>
Our expectation is that the DPPs and the local arrangements that they establish will be the main formal mechanism for consultation. I am sure that the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone would expect the police to defend, in almost any circumstance, the right of access that he and various groups have with the police. If I have reassured him, I shall feel that my day has not been totally in vain.
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> The more I listen to the Minister, the more I feel enlightened about the clause. My understanding is that every district councillor will have to set up a DPP. However, that is not completely clear in the Bill, which states that, if a DPP is not set up, the Secretary of State may direct a council to establish one. However, that would not be mandatory--the word "shall" is not used. A substitute community organisation could be set up to liaise with the police. Councillors are likely to refuse to set up a DPP. Ordinary community groups, which can currently go directly to the police if they have a problem, will no longer be able to do so. They will have to go through a DPP--
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> No.
<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> Well, it depends on the matter that they want to raise. The Minister's comments were rather unclear.
<P>
 The relevant power is extremely broad. Subsection (1) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>A district policing partnership may, with the approval of the Board, make arrangements to facilitate consultation by the police force with any--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I stress that word--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>local community.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Subsection (2) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Where it appears to the Board that a district policing partnership has not made satisfactory arrangements under subsection (1) in relation to any local community.
<P>
We are seeing the growth of local communities--they are multiplying and appearing everywhere. The suggestion that they will be recognised by a DPP and that the police will liaise with all the relevant groups will, as was previously said, take up a tremendous amount of the time of the police and may prevent them from carrying out their prime responsibilities.
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Temple-Morris:</B> Where does the clause state that anyone has to do anything? It merely involves facilitation. If someone does not want to talk to anyone, that person will not be facilitated.
<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> Subsection (1) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>A district policing partnership may--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
which suggests that the arrangement is discretionary. Subsection (2) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Where it appears to the Board that a district policing partnership has not made satisfactory arrangements ... in relation to any local community, the Board may, after consultation.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Again, I stress the word "may". In other words, if someone who has applied to be recognised does not receive recognition, he may go to the board to complain. That arrangement may appear to be discretionary, but the person may have to be recognised, which returns us to the problem that many community groups suffer.

<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> For the sake of absolute clarity, I make it clear to the hon. Gentleman that the police will be free to consult whomever they like, including an individual, a group of individuals or a community group. We hope that the DPPs will provide a mechanism whereby formal arrangements will be in place. The hon. Gentleman welcomed that, having taken part in Omagh in that respect over many years. He rightly said that they have been a useful innovation that has enabled the community to consult the police in a positive and constructive way.
<P>
The hon. Member for West Tyrone said at the beginning of his remarks that the more he heard from me, the more enlightened he became. I am pleased about that. I think that it was Gladstone who said that it was his mission to pacify Ireland. It is my mission to bring enlightenment to the hon. Gentleman, although I admit that it may be beyond me.
