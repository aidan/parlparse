<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Home Office (Mr. Charles Clarke):</B> I beg to move amendment No. 62, in page 95, line 35, leave out second 'a' and insert 'the'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 64, 88 to 91, 66 and 67.
<P>
<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> These are minor drafting amendments. Amendment No. 62 replaces the word "a" with the word "the", as there is only one border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Amendment No. 64 adds a reference to Northern Ireland to paragraph 12(3), which relates to granting permission to land at a non-designated airport. Amendments Nos. 88 to 91 correct errors in the table at the end of the schedule. We listed Ballycastle and the port of Londonderry as seaports in Great Britain, and they are of course in Northern Ireland.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 66 and 67 delete the reference to "arrest or" in two consequential amendments in schedule 13 to provisions in the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 that relate to England, Wales and Northern Ireland respectively. They define "terrorism provisions" for the purposes of the two measures. No separate arrest power is provided under schedule 6 to cover people at ports who are likely to be arrested under the terrorism power of arrest or under clause 39. Such people are covered in the same way as people who are not at ports. The reference to arrest and detention provisions in schedule 6 is therefore unnecessary.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 86, page 96, leave out line 3.
<P>
This amendment deletes the requirement that a document providing evidence of nationality or citizenship must be shown to an examining officer on request. Although it is quite proper for an examining officer to ask to see evidence of identity, it is not reasonable for him to require that to include evidence of nationality, too, because passports need not be carried for journeys between Northern Ireland and Great Britain or the Republic of Ireland, for example.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Lidington </B>(Aylesbury): I beg to move amendment No. 127, in page 96, line 17, leave out 'nine' and insert 'twenty-four'.
<P>
This is a probing amendment that would change the period of maximum permitted detention from the nine hours specified in the Bill to the 24 hours allowed under existing legislation. I am aware from both Lord Lloyd's report and the Government's consultation document that the power to extend the period of detention beyond more than a few hours is rarely used. Lord Lloyd suggested a maximum period of six hours detention. In their consultation document, the Government concluded that six hours would cause difficulties for the police and other agencies, but that they were prepared to consider a shorter period than the 24 hours currently permitted.
<P>
I wonder why nine hours was fixed upon. The current legislation does not seem to have been abused, and the vast majority of people who are stopped are detained for a matter of minutes. Only a handful of people, whose cases seem to merit detailed investigation, are detained for anything remotely approaching 24 hours. Is it really necessary to make such a change? Might not the change proposed in schedule 6 remove a useful backstop from the authorities, who derive a real advantage, if only rarely, from being able to detain someone suspected of terrorism for the permitted 24 hours? The authorities might need to obtain documents from foreign countries, or seek intelligence from other bodies, perhaps from abroad. In all those circumstances, would it not be more prudent to retain the 24 hours maximum time currently permitted?
<P>
<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> The current law provides that a person may be held for more than 12 hours only if a reasonable suspicion has been formed that the person is concerned in terrorism. The amendment does not include that important qualification, but I understand its probing nature.
<P>
We consulted the police about the period for which people may be held without charge under the port's powers. The police are alive to the need to balance their desire to detain people for long enough to allow them to conclude their inquiries with the need not to hold people for an unduly long time.
<P>
Bearing in mind representations made by the police, we have arrived at a maximum period of nine hours. We believe that that should be sufficient time for the police to conclude their initial inquiries, even across time zones. After nine hours, we believe that the police should have to choose between arresting the individual under clause 39 or for another offence, and allowing the person to go. As the hon. Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Lidington) said, nine hours is more than Lord Lloyd recommended. He settled on a maximum of six hours. In response to reasoned representations from the police, we decided to set a higher limit.
<P>
The most recent statistics bear out our view that nine hours is an appropriate point at which to draw the line. For the reasons given by the hon. Gentleman, the vast majority of people are held for under four hours. A smaller number is held for between four and eight hours. The number of people held for more than eight hours is tiny. In 1998, the last year for which we have complete figures, 185 people were held for between one and two hours, 323 were held for between two and four hours and 72 were held for between four and eight hours. Only 19 people were held for between eight and 12 hours, and one was held for between 12 and 24 hours. It is a tiny tail of people. The figures for previous years show a similar profile. The reduction in detention time to less than eight hours could cut significantly into the time that the police need to conclude their examinations. Beyond that, there is only a handful of cases. That proved to be the case even in years when the Provisional IRA campaign was at its height.
<P>
As the hon. Gentleman said, a balance of judgment has to be made. Following discussions with the police, we decided that it should be longer than the six hours recommended by Lord Lloyd, but not as long as the 12 hours allowed under existing legislation, a time that can be extended if the police have reasonable suspicions. We believe that it is reasonable for the balance to fall between the two times. I appreciate the spirit in which the hon. Gentleman moved the amendment, but I hope that he might be persuaded to withdraw it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes </B>(Southwark, North and Bermondsey): The starting point was Lord Lloyd's recommendation of six hours. I shall not pursue the history of the current legislation now but I shall do so in the schedule stand part debate. However, as I have done when probing similarly in other parts of the Bill--normally in the other direction, but not necessarily so--I hope that the hon. Member for Aylesbury will be persuaded that it is better, for the time being, to proceed cautiously, especially if one intends to extend power and one is advised that nine hours is sufficient time. I hope that he will accept that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lidington:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for the comprehensive nature of his reply. I confess that I remain concerned that a power that the evidence says is not being abused by the police should be restricted as the Government propose. However, I want to reflect carefully on what the Minister said. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 63, in page 97, line 11, leave out 'to 4' and insert 'and 3'.
<P>
The amendment deletes the power that the Bill gives to those authorised to search on behalf of examining officers to exchange information with the parties set out in paragraph 4 of schedule 12. The powers granted to authorised searchers are set out in schedule 12, which gives them the power to enter a vehicle and the power to use reasonable force if necessary. However, we believe that searchers do not need the power to exchange information with other frontier control authorities. The amendment seeks to straighten that out.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Amendment made: No. 64, in page 97, line 41, after 'Great Britain' insert 'or Northern Ireland'.--[Mr. Charles Clarke.]
<P>
<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 65, in page 99, line 26. at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'( ) A request to an owner or agent may relate--
<P>
(a) to a particular ship or aircraft,
<P>
(b) to all ships or aircraft of the owner or agent to which this paragraph applies, or
<P>
(c) to specified ships or aircraft.'<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss Government amendments Nos. 87 and 68.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> The amendments clarify the drafting of provisions on the collection of information from passengers. Amendment No. 65, which amends paragraph 17 of schedule 6, specifies in a little more detail the way in which examining officers may request information from owners or agents about ships or aircraft. In particular, it makes it clear that a separate request does not need to be made in respect of each sailing.
<P>
Amendment No. 87 is an addition to paragraph 17 that makes it clear that when an owner or agent has to provide information for immigration purposes, he does not have to provide it again to an examining officer.
<P>
Amendment No. 68 is consequential. It repeals a provision in the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999, which cross-referred to the Prevention of Terrorism Act 1989.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<P>

<B>Mr. Lidington:</B> The schedule simply reproduces the provisions of the Prevention of Terrorism Act. For  reasons that my hon. Friend the Member for Maidstone and The Weald (Miss Widdecombe) made clear on Second Reading, reasons that I have repeated at various times during the Committee's proceedings, we support schedule 6. However, I have a question for the Minister about one provision of the schedule that departs from the exact provisions of the PTA. That provision deals with the circumstances under which aircraft not carrying passengers for reward may use a non-designated airport.
<P>
I understand the Government's wish for a more flexible regime to minimise the inconvenience to small private aircraft. Such aircraft were previously required to land only at designated airports, and they would much prefer to deliver their passengers at smaller aerodromes. However, page 55 of the Government's consultation paper states that the police and security service regard present arrangements in the Prevention of Terrorism Act as a useful measure and of material benefit to agencies pursuing the fight against terrorism.
<P>
How did the Government weigh up the balance between aircraft operators' convenience interests and the interests of the police and the security service? That may be a point of detail, but it was important enough to be signalled in the consultation paper. I should therefore be grateful for an explanation.
<P>
 4.45 pm
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> Entitlement to powers at ports of entry is inevitable and right in relation to proper border control. I have a hardline view on control of ports of entry, as a country is entitled to check what is going on at its borders. I hold that view, regardless of people coming in from different categories of country, including Ireland, which has a common travel area with the United Kingdom.
<P>
I therefore support the schedule and the proposition that members of the public do not regard being asked a couple of routine questions on arrival at an airport or seaport as an infringement of their civil liberties, provided that the authorities think that appropriate. That applies whether travel to the United Kingdom is from Ireland or inside or outside the European Union mainland. Clearly, there is a difference between parts of the United Kingdom. As a result of political developments however difficult on a day-to-day basis--I hope that people who have clearly made journeys between either Northern Ireland and Great Britain or Great Britain and Northern Ireland will not be subject to intervention.
<P>
I wish to raise a statistical matter, although the Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office would probably call it a fishing expedition. Lord Lloyd's report provided figures which were up to date at that time. In paragraph 10/29, he gave the number of examinations lasting more than an hour reported under the Home Office circular and published annually. In 1995--the last year on which Lord Lloyd reported--about 200 people were examined for more than an hour. A helpful table appears later in the report showing the total number of passengers from the European Community within the common travel area, the number examined and the number examined for more than an hour.
<P>
If figures are available for subsequent years, it would be helpful if those could be provided. One of Lord Lloyd's recommendations was that people should be notified in writing of what was going on after half an hour, rather than an hour. Are figures available for that back to 1995 or for the period since then?
<P>
Paragraph 10.40 of Lord Lloyd's report states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The figures also show that preventing terrorists from entering or leaving the UK is by no means the only function carried out by police special branch officers at ports. I draw attention to the large number of people arrested following examination. Roughly half were the subject of outstanding arrest warrants".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Will the Minister update us on what has happened since 1995, when the report was produced?
<P>
The second part of my question links two points. The report makes the point that ports of entry often have officers of three different state agencies: the police, Customs and Excise and the immigration and nationality directorate.
<P>
I shall lay my cards on the table. I think that there is scope to rationalise much of what happens between those agencies. I understand that they come from different disciplines and have specific jobs. I am not saying that the Bill is the context in which we should amalgamate Customs and Excise with the police. However, they have linked responsibilities but are not always compatible. An obvious example is that Customs and Excise often thinks that its principal task is to find goods and impound drugs, and it often measures its success by the amount of drugs that it seizes, whereas the police would prefer to arrest people and take the materials from them, although they are obviously interested in both matters.
<P>
The police often prefer to make an arrest in this country, where they can secure a prosecution for carrying, trading, exporting or whatever. Clearly, the immigration and nationality directorate officials undertake other checks. However, tricks and people have been missed over the years. Is the Home Office thinking of improving its procedures more generally, so that not only terrorist activity is deterred more effectively?
<P>
I ask that question because the debate about border controls has been relaunched recently. If I have been informed correctly, Belgium and Holland have changed their views on the Schengen agreement and are backing away from an open-frontiers policy, for what I have always thought to be understandable reasons. Although I am a signed up pro-European, I have always been nervous of removing every border control in the European Union. We must be cautious about dropping our guard at national ports of entry and barriers, certainly until we are absolutely sure that the external boundary works well.
<P>
Are there any proposals for improving co-ordination between the three agencies so that they act together at our ports of entry? Is any change in policy likely? Will the policy be clarified, given what is happening with the Schengen agreement? I remember that the Minister said in a debate in the Chamber that he had attended an international conference in Moscow, at which I assume such matters were considered. Perhaps he will tell us about that.
<P>
I have another question that, I hope, comes under the same umbrella as the others. A few weeks ago, the Home Secretary rightly ordered an inquiry into how Konrad Kalejs had entered the country without anyone knowing. I wonder whether there will be an outcome. The system is deficient if those who are known to be wanted, those who are subject to deportation proceedings elsewhere or those who have previous convictions can enter easily. Is any work being done to improve the system so that it picks up those who are wanted in connection with terrorism? Clearly the port of entry is the best place for such people to be caught.
<P>
There is none the less, an important civil liberty matter, not only in the context of Ireland-United Kingdom travel, but generally. People should not be stopped without justification or harassed. With the best will in the world, it seems that authorities stereotype people more often than they should. I do not know whether hon. Members saw it, but one of the tabloids printed a story about someone who dressed up as a vicar and went through the border controls. He then dressed up as a hippy. He was never stopped as a vicar, but always as a hippy. I may have exaggerated the story slightly, but that was the nature of the case.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike Gapes </B>(Ilford, South): Was he a member of the Liberal Democrat party?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B>  I shall ignore that typically unhelpful comment from the hon. Gentleman. The question is what steps will be taken to ensure that there is no abuse of the system? Are records kept of people who are stopped on more than one occasion? One thing that has caused concern on Ireland-UK traffic, which is obviously where the stops have happened most often, is that people have thought that they were being picked on. It would more often be certain types of people.
<P>
The Minister sent us the draft code of practice, for which I am grateful. It is the code of practice relevant to the schedule and referred to in the Lord Lloyd report. I shall give it considered attention and make any suggestions as soon as I can. Have the Ministers accepted Lord Lloyd's recommendation that half an hour's notice should be given rather than the existing one hour? That is one of the four proposals that the Minister has not dealt with yet. Do the Government intend that people should only be notified of their rights after one hour or have they accepted the Lord Lloyd proposal? If they have not, could they explain why the case put by the person they asked to review the Act has not been followed?
<P>
<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> A range of points has been raised. First, I am glad that the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey (Mr. Simon Hughes) has received the code of practice, and I look forward to hearing his comments at a later stage. As I emphasised in my letter to him, it is very much a preliminary draft. We do not think that we need to stick at an hour. Police representations are strongly against doing that, and that is reflected in our data too. We do not have figures below 30 minutes, as no formal notification has been required before then. I shall let the hon. Gentleman have a note on the other figures that he referred to as soon as possible, but I have no further information on them now.
<P>
One of the reasons for having a code of practice is to avoid the type of stereotyping that the hon. Gentleman describes. I hope that he was not suggesting that we issue an edict to stop all vicars entering the country. I was present at the enthronement of the Bishop of Norwich on Saturday--the first enthronement of the third millennium with Norwich leading the world, as one would expect. The most splendid part of the enthronement ceremony was when all the vicars in Norfolk came through the great cathedral. I could not tell which were hippies and which were not as there was a certain hippy element to their behaviour. The short answer is that we are considering the matter carefully and ensuring that is kept under constant review. The code of practice is specifically designed to achieve that. I shall not be drawn into conversations about Mr. Kalejs, as this is a discussion on the Terrorism Bill.
<P>
I take the hon. Gentleman's general points about the merit of greater co-operation between the different agencies. We are seeking much greater co-operation, and we have an official working group to promote that. Clause 12(4) gives the statutory power to exchange information. My hon. Friend the Minister of State, Home Office, the hon. Member for Hornsey and Wood Green (Mrs. Roche) and I had a meeting to discuss this issue in relation to some of the forces at ports. It certainly is necessary to build a much higher level of co-operation at ports between these different agencies, and we are very committed to that for all the reasons that he described. We have the matter consistently under review. That deals with the specific points raised by the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
The hon. Member for Aylesbury made a fair point. We received a number of representations, particularly from private airfields and private pilots. We believe that the 12-hour notice set out in paragraph 12(3)(b) in schedule 6, which gives 12 hours' notice in writing to an examining officer, is a significant safeguard compared with the present position. It gives the police time to meet a flight if they wish, and to be clear about the situation. Our proposal that such aircraft should land at designated airports, or at non-designated airports with 12 hours' notice is half way between Lord Lloyd's suggestion that the bar on landing at non-designated airports should be lifted entirely, and keeping the present rule, which is that they can land only with a police officer's permission. We felt that it was a move towards a general relaxation, which we think is desirable. However, we felt that the hon. Gentleman's perfectly reasonable concern about the need for a safeguard was covered by the requisite 12-hour notification under paragraph 12(3)(b). I hope that that meets the hon. Gentleman's concern. Given those assurances, I hope that the Committee will agree that schedule 6 should stand part of the Bill.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> The Library research paper 99/101 states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Lord Lloyd noted that the offence under section 34 of the EPA"<P>
</UL></FONT>--<P>

<P>
the current defence for which the Bill would be a replacement--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"was difficult to prove. He said that he had been informed that there was no record of any prosecutions having been brought since its introduction. He said that in the absence of any evidence that such a provision would be of ... value in tackling terrorism in the longer term he would not recommend its incorporation"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
into these legislative proposals. The Government have rejected that advice, saying that the provision should be kept. Please can we have information, now, if possible, about how many times the existing legislation has been used, how many prosecutions there have been, and how many were successful?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> I cannot give the hon. Gentleman the information now, but, as I acknowledged in our previous discussions, this is information that he is perfectly entitled to ask for. I have committed myself a number of times and I am of course willing to give him the information, but I cannot do so at the moment.
<P>
The reason we believe that the clause should stand part of the Bill is that it is important to maintain the offence based on section 34 of the EPA. Whereas that offence applied in Northern Ireland only, the new version applies throughout the UK. The provision has been extended to cover chemical, biological and nuclear weapons and materials as well as conventional firearms and explosives, and to cover recruitment for training, as well as training itself.
<P>
We believe, reasonably, that these are important issues for many of the reasons that we discussed earlier concerning the type of activities and engagements in which people may be involved. The definition of these offences is important, and we think that they should be part of the Bill. I hope that the Committee will agree to the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> The only reason I want to press the Minister on this issue is that if there has never been a prosecution, the argument for ensuring that we have a proper review mechanism--not least because Lord Lloyd recommended that this provision be deleted from the Bill--is stronger than ever. Can the Minister say whether there has ever been a prosecution? The latest information given to us is that there has never been one, so it strikes me that the Government should have a justification for including this provision that goes beyond the cases in which it has been used.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> I understand the force of the hon. Gentleman's concern. We are not aware of any use of the power in the circumstances that he described. However, it is important to emphasise that there is increasing evidence of terrorist interest in acquiring nuclear, chemical and biological weapons materials. It would be foolhardy in the extreme for us not to maintain the power to inhibit use of such materials. It is obvious to all concerned that their impact is so cataclysmic that any mistake in this regard would not be acceptable and must be ruled out. That is why the clause is necessary, and why I hope the hon. Gentleman will support it as part of the Bill.
<P>
The training of people in this country for terrorist activities abroad is a particular concern and in the spirit of international co-operation, as much as anything else, we think it an important issue. It is of increasing concern worldwide.
<P>
Clause 52 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<H4><center>Directing terrorist organisation</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I agree with the provision of this power in legislation, just as I agree, if not expressly, then by implication, with the principle of a weapons-training power. I therefore have just two questions on the clause. First, I seek clarification on the drafting. I think I am right in saying that there is no further definition of "direct" and would like to know the thinking behind that. Anything that specifically relates to such offences normally ends up with a clarifying definition. I emphasise that there ought to be a power to ensure that such people are caught.
<P>
My second question is the usual one about statistics. The last evidence we had is that there have been two convictions for this offence. Again, could we as soon as practicable, now or later, have details of prosecutions, convictions and sentences?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> I make the comment about statistics that I have consistently made: I am happy to give the information that is available. There is no further definition of "direct". It is a reasonable and also an important word because it is obviously possible for people to direct activity without immediately participating in it. If the hon. Gentleman has any further reflections on phrasing that might clarify the matter, I should be happy to listen to him, but we felt it unnecessary to define the word further because "direct" is clear. That is why it is in the clause and why I hope the clause stands part of the Bill.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 54 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 55</center></H4>
<H4><center>Possession for terrorist purposes</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Steve McCabe </B>(Birmingham, Hall Green): I beg to move amendment No. 128, in page 24, line 16, leave out from 'he' to 'for' in line 18, and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'knowingly possesses an article intended'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment is relatively straightforward. It attempts to tighten the meaning of the clause because I and many others believe that the wording of the clause--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"possesses an article in circumstances which give rise to a reasonable suspicion"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
--may be too vague and woolly. It is possible to conceive of circumstances in which it could become a catch-all phrase. The fundamental concern is about the possibility of Kafkaesque language that could trap the innocent or the naive.
<P>
I want bombers caught and stopped, and those who help them and other terrorists caught and stopped, but I want that done through laws that are secure and reliable. I am worried that we may be tilting the balance too far and creating circumstances in which authorities are tempted to be lazy in their investigations or in the construction of their evidence, or overzealous in identifying suspects so that they identify suspects without proper cause.
<P>
The purpose of the amendment is to make the clause more specific. I have no desire to put the amendment to a vote, but I ask my hon. Friend the Minister to think about the implications of its wording. The intention is to trap people who are knowingly in possession of an article that is intended to help a terrorist action, not someone who may inadvertently or innocently possess such an article in circumstances that others may reasonably find suspicious.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> I do not seek to undermine the strength of the hon. Gentleman's proposition, because I have been in the House long enough to know that amendments moved by a Government Back Bencher sometimes happen to be more favourably received than Opposition amendments. Therefore, a good amendment deserves to be allowed to make progress.
<P>
The amendment relates to one of the key issues of the clause, which is whether people should be convicted not only if they know but if they are ignorant of the fact that they possess an article used for terrorism. It will be no secret to the Minister that we will come to our other significant concern on the clause stand part debate. Under clauses 55 and 56, it is possible for someone to be convicted without knowing about the article's use, as the burden falls on them to disprove something rather than on the prosecution to prove it. I shall reserve my greater fire for the clause stand part debate, not least to give the amendment moved by the hon. Member for Birmingham, Hall Green (Mr. McCabe) the fairest wind possible.
<P>
<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> Nothing that the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bennondsey could do, despite his best efforts, would undermine the power and efficacy of my hon. Friend the Member for Hall Green.
<P>
I appreciate the positive and creative spirit in which my hon. Friend moved the amendment to try to establish how we can address the issue properly. He was quite clear that the purpose of the amendment was to alleviate concerns about whether the offence in the Bill undermined the presumption of innocence. He wants to ensure that any concerns on the matter are fully alleviated, and that any issues arising in relation to the European convention on human rights are dealt with effectively.
<P>
We believe that the offence is useful and effective. I shall quote Lord Lloyd's report on recommending its retention. Paragraphs 14.4 and 14.5 on page 91 state that:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The purpose of the provision is to allow action to be taken against a person who is found in possession of articles which, though perhaps commonplace in normal circumstances, are well known to be used in the manufacture of bombs. It is, of course, not the possession of the items themselves which constitutes the offence, but possession in such circumstances as to give rise to a reasonable suspicion of their connection with terrorism.
<P>
The need for the police to intervene against the terrorist at an early stage, before he has an opportunity, to plant a bomb is well recognised. Given that terrorist bombs are usually home-made, it is quite possible that, during a search of premises occupied by a suspected terrorist, the police will find materials such as timers or chemicals in highly incriminating circumstances without also finding explosives or other prohibited materials. If other evidence exists, he might be charged with conspiracy to cause explosions...Otherwise I see no reason why the person should not be required to account to the court for his possession of the articles."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is a powerful conclusion. My hon, Friend seeks clarification, and it is that argument that has led to us include the clause in the Bill.
<P>
The whole point of the provision is to deal with suspicious circumstances, such as someone having coffee grinders in every cupboard or a car boot full of fertiliser in the middle of London. That is important, which is why the Bill is drafted as it is.
<P>
As I have suggested before, I do not accept that the offence is in breach of the European convention on human rights. It is important to acknowledge that the Bill will not be implemented before the Human Rights Act 1998 becomes law. The Act requires the courts to read legislation in a matter compatible with convention rights, including the right to a fair trial. On the basis of the Lords' decision on the Kebeline case, we are satisfied that the provision is not incompatible with the European convention on human rights. I trust that that clarification of Government thinking assists my hon. Friend and that he will withdraw his amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. McCabe:</B> I am happy to do that. However, I wish to make one further point.
<P>
 The Human Rights Act 1998 requires more than reading. Indeed, the Lord Chancellor spoke about searching for possible meaning compatible with the convention. That is more rigorous than simply reading the words. Nevertheless, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed: That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I shall take a little more time on this. I shall lay my cards on the table straight away. I shall not seek to divide the Committee on clauses 55 and 56, but I do not support them. They may breach the European convention on human rights and I expect that my hon. Friends will seek to remove them on Report, by forcing votes on the Floor of the House. I hope for significant support in other parts of the House. I want to get out into the open arguments against the clause and the Government's defence of their position.
<P>
I have received legal advice that clauses 55 and 56 may fail to comply with the convention, As I said earlier, I am happy to exchange legal opinions. If the Government show me their legal opinion, I will show them mine. As the Freedom of Information Bill is being discussed in another Committee, I trust that the Government will be willing to take up my generous offer and I look forward to the first manifestation of the open government style promised in that Bill.
<P>
I have five major concerns about the offence. First, it is widely drawn, The word "terrorism" is drawn widely in clause 1. Similarly, clause 55(1) defines the offence as possession of
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"an article in circumstances which give rise to a reasonable suspicion that possession is for a purpose connected with the commission, preparation or instigation of an act of terrorism."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
By definition, that could be any article. The Minister used the examples of fertilisers and coffee grinders, but anything could be involved. We are therefore starting with the widest possible definition. Such articles need 245 246 not be unlawful in themselves. They could be lawful, purchased lawfully--either singly or in bulk--and used lawfully. They may not be involved in terrorism normally or directly and may be connected with it only in the most extreme and far-reaching circumstances. All that is required under the clause is reasonable suspicion that the article is
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"connected with the commission, preparation or instigation of an act of terrorism."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There have been two prosecutions under section 16A of the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act 1989. In both cases, the prosecution relied on literature, correspondence and identity documents as articles within such a definition.
<P>
My second set of concerns relates to the definition of "possession". Under section 16A of the 1989 Act, the mere presence of the article, together with the presence of the accused in any premises or any vehicle may be sufficient evidence of possession unless the accused proves lack of knowledge or control. It does not matter whether the article is in a vehicle or a house that is not the accused's own, nor whether it is in a vehicle or house that the accused does not normally use, even if it is his own. It may be a vehicle that the accused travels in for a yard or sits in for a minute, or a house into which he goes for a cup of coffee or a longer period. Immediately that happens, the accused person must give proof to the contrary if he is charged under the provision. I hope that that is beginning to alarm hon. Members on both sides of the House. There is already a clear duty on the state to deal with terrorism and its tools. There is a line beyond which one should not assume that that is what is going on when people are using ordinary articles for what must normally be assumed to be ordinary business.
<P>
The presence of an article in any premises where the accused is the occupier or to which he is a habitual visitor may be sufficient evidence of possession under the Bill, even if he is not there when the article is found. Thus, the person could be abroad when his house is raided or his vehicle searched, but if an article that is held to be connected with the preparation or instigation of terrorism was found, that person could be charged. Again, he will have to disprove the accusation that he is guilty of the offence. He might have been one mile, 100 miles or 1,000 miles away--it makes no difference. The court may treat the evidence of the presence of the item as sufficient to establish that it was in the accused's possession unless he proves either that he did not know of it, or that it was not under his control. As we all know, it is difficult to prove that one does not know something. Likewise, it is difficult to prove that something was not potentially under one's control.
<P>
The Government are seeking to give the state very wide powers. The citizen will have a tall hill to climb before he can get out of the net that the state can cast over him. Various legal arguments, which are based not just on European law but on legislation from other parts of the world, deal with this issue. One 1996 case from the South African constitutional court has been drawn to my attention. In the state v. Mbatha, a presumption of possession was found to be in breach of the presumption of innocence.
<P>
The third objection, which is perhaps more serious than the other two, relates to the presumption of guilt intent. Subsections (1) and (3) of section 16A of the current Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act 1989 mean that a person is found guilty of the offence if the possession of the item occurred in circumstances giving reasonable suspicion of terrorist intent. The burden of proof--here it is properly called the burden of proof--then shifts to the defendant. He must prove, on the balance of probabilities, that the item was not in his possession for such purposes. If he succeeds in raising a reasonable doubt about that, but fails to prove his innocence on a balance of probabilities, he will be convicted. Thus, he cannot even send the burden of proof back to the prosecution by raising a doubt, as one can in other parts of the law; his evidence as a defendant must pass the balance of probabilities test.
<P>
The consequence, if the defendant does not succeed in that, is that he can be convicted of an offence with a sentence of 10 years' imprisonment, despite the fact that there is reasonable doubt. In a country in which the Government are asking us to re-examine the concept of trial by jury--at present in Northern Ireland there is no jury trial--for a defendant to have to prove something  on a balance of probabilities, and be open to conviction where there is reasonable doubt about whether he is guilty is a road down which the Government ought not go. Labour certainly did not support it when in opposition. This is another case where Government spokespeople such as the Attorney-General now propose something that they explicitly opposed when the previous Government debated the matter. That must give us cause for concern. As with the jury trial issue, the fact that Ministers are on record as having strong opposition to the proposal only a couple of years ago must set loud alarm bells ringing.
<P>
Reasonable suspicion does not even require the prosecution to prove a prima facie case. The most famous definition that I can recall, which was well reported at the time and continues to be in the law books, was the Privy Council's decision in Shaaban Bin Hussein v. Chang Fook Kam in 1969: on defining evidence necessary to establish suspicion:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The circumstances of the case should be such that a reasonable man, acting without passion or prejudice would fairly have suspected the person of having committed the offence ... suspicion in its ordinary meaning is a state of conjecture or surmise where proof is lacking: 'I suspect but I cannot prove'. Suspicion arises at or near the starting point of an investigation of which the obtaining of prima facie proof is at the end."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In another, similarly important, case in 1993--the Attorney-General for Hong Kong v. Lee Kwang Kut--the Privy Council, the highest court available, found that creating a statutory offence using the same legislative technique as section 16A of the Prevention of Terrorism Act was in breach of the presumption of innocence in the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance.
<P>
The fourth point is the link between this provision and terrorism abroad. The Bill's understandable purpose is that it looks at terrorism on a United Kingdom-wide basis, but a fallacious argument arises based on the Northern Ireland experience in relation to international terrorism.
<P>
Pages 57, 58 and 59 of the Government's consultation paper, which recite the ancilliary offence under the PTA and the emergency provisions Act, states that section 16A has proved particularly useful in Northern Ireland, where there have been several prosecutions. My understanding is that that is incorrect; that prosecutions have occurred only under the EPA, not under the PTA, and especially under section 32 of the EPA. I understand that there have been no prosecutions in Northern Ireland, or in relation to the affairs of Northern Ireland, under section 16A.
<P>
One of the Government's arguments for this proposal has the support of Lord Lloyd. I accept that that argument does not appear to be borne out by the facts. It may be an error or a fault which was discovered subsequently and I should be grateful for the Minister's confirmation on that. The precise issue is the aim of anti-terrorism. We have on the shelf the wide definition of terrorism that comes from section 1. A concern that has been widely expressed to me, and in the House, when we have debated similar legislation, is that the provision might be extended to cover people whom some might consider to be terrorists and others freedom fighters. The hon. Members for Swansea, East (Mr. Anderson), the Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee, and for what is now Gainsborough, and was then Gainsborough and Horncastle, (Mr. Leigh) argued on the Second Reading of the private Member's Bill that the hon. Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Waterson) promoted before the 1997 general election that we should be careful of legislation that moves in that direction, and reserved their position. The Bill ultimately fell, as it was blocked by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Kelvin (Mr. Galloway), and the general election intervened.
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The two prosecutions that have been made under section 16A since 1994 involved people allegedly exporting equipment, including manuals and other information, for use in Algeria. The difficulty with the clause is that a British jury--in those parts of the country in which a jury trial will apply, which we hope will eventually include Northern Ireland, too, after the next five years--will have to decide whether activity in, for example, Kosovo, Algeria, Rwanda, Bosnia, Yugoslavia, Sri Lanka or Pakistan constitutes terrorism. There is an obvious difficulty in expecting a British jury to assess political questions about what constitutes terrorism as opposed to a reasonable and proportionate response to oppressive attack.
<P>
One of the issues involved arose when we were recalled for two days in September 1998 to deal with the consequences of the bombing in Omagh. The Government introduced legislation, which was much criticised both at the time and later, to create conspiracy offences. Much disquiet was expressed at the time about how to define what might constitute a conspiracy offence, and this is a similar debate. The problem arises in this case and in relation to clause 57, which relates to incitement.
<P>
The last of the five points relates to the weakness of the justification advanced--other than praying in aid Lord Lloyd, which is perfectly reasonable--by the Government in the consultation paper. The Government are trying to persuade us that a new terrorist offence should be introduced under clauses 55 and 56, However, criminal law already provides a perfectly adequate offence that is well tried and tested and has been on the statute book for a long time--under section 4 of the Explosive Substances Act 1883, which the Government could amend if they considered it defective. That seems to constitute a perfectly reasonable basis, in either its present or an extended form if the Government want to justify extension, on which to proceed.
<P>
Under that Act, which has been on the statute book for more than 100 years, it is an offence to possess an explosive substance in circumstances that give rise to a reasonable suspicion that the person involved does not have the substance in his or her possession for a lawful object. The definition of an explosive substance is
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"any materials for making any explosive substance; also any apparatus, machine, implement, or materials used or intended for use. . . for causing. . . or aiding in causing any explosion."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is an extremely wide definition.
<P>
I do not pretend that that definition could not be reconsidered, but I argue that we should not create terrorist offences if criminal law will do. That brings us back to an earlier debate. We should not seek to put activities that the criminal law adequately deals with in a special box that has additional penalties. The difference is that the Explosive Substances Act 1883 does not require reverse burden of proof. The Crown has to prove knowledge of possession of the item in question under that Act, which brings us back to the amendment moved by the hon. Member for Hall Green in our previous debate. Under that Act, the Crown has to prove by the normal standards that the apparently innocent item is intended for causing or aiding an explosion.
<P>
Significant arguments suggest that the Government do not need the power, as they have existing power that has been properly used and would be valid even if it needed amending. Serious questions remain unanswered about how juries are meant to deal with international terrorism. There are wide definitions throughout the provision, and there are concerns about compatibility with the convention.
<P>
The Minister raised a point about the decision of the House of Lords a couple of months ago--not only the most recent authority, but a very recent one--on the Kebeline case. Many issues arise from it, but the key element of its relatively technical decision was an acceptance that not all reverse burdens of proof are incompatible with the European convention. Therefore, as the Minister will understand, I will not argue that incompatibility would result from a reverse burden of proof.
<P>
One of the Law Lords, Lord Hope, proposed that three things--what the prosecution had to prove to transfer the onus, the nature of the burden on the accused, and the nature of the offence and the threat to society--be tested. In clause 55, the prosecution has to prove relatively little to transfer the onus. There will be similar arguments 249 250 about clause 56. Also, the burden on the accused is onerous by any definition--I described it earlier as quite a steep hill to climb--and the nature of the offence as a threat to society is clear. None of us would argue that terrorism was not such a threat. The definition of terrorism is so wide that not only terrorism as it has traditionally been understood will be swept into the context of that provision.
<P>
I shall conclude with the legal advice that I have been given about clause 55, which also applies to clause 56. Clause 55 is not compatible with the presumption of innocence set out in article 6.2 of the convention. A court would be likely to issue a declaration of incompatibility. It is important to note that the main reason for that conclusion is the wide-ranging definition of terrorism in clause 1, which means that the offences created by the relevant clauses constitute a disproportionate response to the genuine threat posed by what most people would regard as terrorist activity.
<P>
As was suggested in the Kebeline case in the House of Lords, the jurisprudence of the European court is developing in relation to the issue, as it is in relation to all issues. Our domestic courts will not slavishly have to follow all its decisions as they will have an obligation to follow the Human Rights Act 1998, which will come into force in October. Section 2 of the Act enjoins our courts to take the European court's decisions into account, but 1 have been advised that even if our domestic courts use that less rigorous test, they are just as likely, perhaps even more likely, than the European court to conclude that the relevant provisions contravene the presumption of innocence laid down in article 6.2.
<P>
We should all be cautious, no matter whether we are Government Back Benchers, Ministers or Opposition Members of Parliament. We should not reverse the burden of proof lightly; if we do, it should be done only in the most exceptional cases, and only if we are absolutely sure that the change is compatible with other legislation and with judicial decisions. The Government have not started making their case, especially as existing legislation could be revisited and amended.
<P>
Despite the Government's instinctive reaction in this Parliament, which has resulted in the provisions in clauses 55 and 56, I hope that they will return to the views that they held only a few years ago, and that they will consult with those who expressed strong criticism of such provisions, even in this sort of legislation. If they thought that only a few years ago, we are just as entitled to think it now.

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> I believe that the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey referred to the hon. Member for Swansea, West (Mr. Alan Williams) taking a particular view. If he was referring to the Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee, he should have said Swansea, East. For the purposes of the record, I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would like me to say that he meant to refer to the hon. Member for Swansea, East (Mr. Donald Anderson).
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I said it hesitantly, Mr. Malins.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The bon. Gentleman never speaks hesitantly. He speaks with great force.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lidington:</B> Practically the only point on which I agree with the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey is that the burden of proof should not be reversed lightly. When the Conservative Home Secretary introduced the measure in 1994, the decision was not taken lightly, but it was done to combat the real threat posed by organised terrorist groups.
<P>
It seems to me that the practical starting point in our debate should be not only that it is a criminal offence to possess firearms or explosives for a terrorist purpose, but that it is a criminal offence to posses the ingredients of explosive devices for a terrorist purpose, even if those ingredients have legitimate applications. In an earlier intervention, the Minister talked about a lorry load of fertiliser detected in central London in the small hours of the morning. That is precisely the sort of thing that the clause is designed to deal with.
<P>
The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey's comments on clause 55 were consistent with the views that he has expressed on other clauses. It seems to me, however, that the safeguard is provided by the requirement that it is not an offence to possess the articles but that they were possessed in circumstances that were likely to give rise to the reasonable suspicion that they were possessed for
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"a purpose connected with the commission, preparation or instigation of an act of terrorism."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Unless the Minister is about to tell me that my interpretation of the clause is wrong, it would be for the prosecution to prove beyond all reasonable doubt--the normal standard of criminal proof--that the circumstances were such as to justify the charge being brought.
<P>
Someone who was innocently driving a lorry load of fertilizer across a field would not usually be hauled before the courts, and if he were, I doubt that he would be convicted. However, if someone drives a lorry load of fertiliser through Canary Wharf at 4 o'clock in the morning, with an IRA target list in his back pocket and a note for a rendezvous at an IRA safe house in the inside pocket of his jackct, that gives considerable cause for concern, and the onus would lie on that individual to provide a convincing answer.
<P>
As the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey said, we should not reverse the burden of proof lightly, but the threat from organised terrorism is so great and the risk to the lives and safety of many of our fellow citizens is so great that we are justified in retaining the provisions.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey said that only a handful of cases had been prosecuted in Great Britain since 1994, but Lord Lloyd's report indicates that a considerably larger number of prosecutions--and convictions--have occurred under the equivalent legislative provisions of the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act 1996. Indeed, the police told Lord Lloyd that that power was a significant weapon in their counter-terrorist armoury. For those reasons, I support the Government in wanting the clause to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> A wide range of points has been made. I shall start where the hon. Member for Aylesbury concluded. The provisions in section 32 of the Emergency Provisions Act is similar, but not identical, to the provisions in the Prevention of Terrorism Act. The EPA applies in Northern Ireland, and no prosecutions were made there under the PTA. However, more than 20 prosecutions have been made under the EPA. Three prosecutions are under way in relation to the PTA equivalent provision, so there is clear evidence that the provision is useful.
<P>
I turn next to the human rights issues raised by the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey. I do not want repeat earlier discussions about the validity of legal opinions. Everyone is entitled to a legal opinion, even lawyers. The hon. Gentleman was entitled to read that legal opinion into the record, but I say again that the Home Secretary is satisfied that the Bill is compliant with the Human Rights Act 1998. That is why he signed the certificate.
<P>
I repeat what I said earlier about the decision in the Kebeline case. In the Lords judgment, Lord Hope of Craighead said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> "It is not immediately obvious that it would be imposing an unreasonable burden on an accused who was in possession of articles from which an inference of involvement in terrorism could be drawn to provide an explanation for his possession of them which would displace that inference".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I do not intend to say more about the human rights matter other than to recapitulate earlier arguments and to assert that the Home Secretary's statement on the front of the Bill is a considered and well-advised judgment; it is not frivolous.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> I am sure that the Minister realises that I did not say that it was a frivolous judgment. Is he willing to put the legal advice given to the Government in the Library?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> The hon. Gentleman has much more experience of the House than I have. In my humility, I suggest that he knows full well that it is the long-standing practice of Governments not to put legal opinions in the Library. I appreciate his generous invitation, but I shall not accede to it.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman said that a new offence was  not necessary because we have the Explosive Substances Act 1883. There are many reasons why that argument is wrong, but the most important is that terrorists do more than cause explosions. Articles possessed for terrorist purposes will include more than explosive substances--for instance, the sarin poisoning on the Japanese tube and developments in various biological weapons. It will not do to state that the Explosive Substances Act 1883 provides a basis on which we can act. Modern terrorism is about more than explosives, which is why we need new legislation.
<P>
The best way in which I can deal with the points that the hon. Gentleman made is to go through the subsections. Subsection (1) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> "A person commits an offence if he possesses an article".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If that were all it stated, perhaps there would be substance in the suggestion, made by the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey, that the Bill is widely drawn and, therefore, dangerous and open to misinterpretation. However, after the word "article", the subsection states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"in circumstances which give rise to a reasonable suspicion that his possession is for a purpose connected with the commission, preparation or instigation of an act of terrorism.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is a serious qualification on the possession of an article. The subsection does not just relate to the load of fertiliser, the piece of paper or whatever. It must be shown that such circumstances have arisen, which would be a pretty serious state of affairs. The subsection is not susceptible to the charge that it is too widely drawn.
<P>
The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey mentioned papers. The offence depends on the document, and the Bill contains qualifications. If the document is a death list, or a map with a particular target, it is a pretty serious article for someone to possess. I reject the suggestion that the subsection is too widely drawn because of the important qualifications that I have quoted. The hon. Gentleman is wrong to dismiss the subsection by suggesting that it is too widely drawn.
<P>
Subsection (2) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"It is a defence for a person charged with an offence . . . to prove that his possession of the article was not for a purpose connected with the commission, preparation, or instigation of an act of terrorism.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That takes us back to familiar ground, which the Committee covered last week--it is a statutory defence. That does not mean that all the other defences that an individual might adduce cannot be used.
<P>
The Bill clearly and simply states that it is a defence if the person can prove that the possession was not for a purpose connected with terrorism. That important statutory defence is not the same as a total reversal of the burden of proof. That statutory defence exists, along with other defences. It will be perfectly legitimate to argue other defences, and the court will make the judgment. The court provides an important protection. That statutory defence exists, the proposal is legally sustainable, and the Committee should support it.
<P>
The second point that the hon. Gentleman made was on possession. Subsection (3) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"In proceedings for an offence under this section, if it is proved that an article--
<P>
(a) was on any premises at the same time as the accused, or
<P>
 (b) was on premises of which the accused was the occupier or which he habitually used otherwise than as a member of the public,
<P>
 the court may assume that the accused possessed the article".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That statement is followed by a qualification. Those provisions do not relate to ridiculous circumstances--for example, if someone owns a holiday home, which he or she has not visited for half a year, and someone else makes something there. So the suggestion that the offence is very widely drawn does not stand up to scrutiny.
<P>
The qualification in subsection (3) is:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"unless he proves that he did not know of its presence on the premises or that he had no control over it."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Again, that is an important defence. If such articles are found in the house where I live, it is reasonable that I should be asked why they are there.

<P>

<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> If I owned a caravan, it would be the place that I occupy. Although I was not there at the time, I could be prosecuted under subsection (3)(b), because it states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"was on premises of which the accused was the occupier".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
A person does not have to be there; he has only to be the occupier, in which case prosecution would be possible under the provision.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> That is precisely my point. That is not unreasonable in the case of the occupier or a member of the public who used the property habitually.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman's final point was about links with terrorism abroad. He questioned the ability of juries to consider such matters effectively--a proposal that I think is a dangerous incursion on the right of jury trial. Of course, difficulties are involved. We have said all along that the question of how to deal with international terrorism will be tough. But we must deal with it. The clause applies to international terrorism as it does to other forms, and rightly so.
<P>
I refer the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey back to the tight language of the clause, which is not susceptible to his wide-ranging accusations about reversing burdens and so on. The clause is deliberately tight. As I have said, evidence proves that legislation has been helpful in fighting terrorism, which is the core point of the Bill. It will be compliant with the Human Rights Act 1998 and will operate on that basis.
<P>
I urge the Committee to agree clause stand part and I advise the hon. Gentleman to consider matters carefully before he decides to oppose the clause on Report. I assure him that the full weight of this debate in the public arena will be to the benefit of the Government's determination to fight terrorism. He would need to develop some powerful arguments, which, with respect to him, we have not heard so far before he can justify urging his colleagues to vote against the clause on Report.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I am grateful to the Minister; I was not seeking to divide the Committee. The purpose of my argument was to set out the position clearly before the Bill is debated Downstairs. Obviously, like everyone else, I give due consideration to the argument before deciding tactics. Even if the argument were right, although not popular, there may be a case for seeking either to amend the clause or to remove it, but I am happy not to proceed with such action at present.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 55 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Malins. I apologise for my pager making noises, but at least I have received the same information as others have received.

<B>Mr. McCabe:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 129, in page 24, line 38, leave out
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'of a kind likely to be useful to'<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'in order to assist'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments:
<P>
No. 130, in page 24, line 40, after 'he', insert 'knowingly'.
<P>
No. 131, in page 24, line 40, leave out 'of that kind' and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'in order to assist a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 132, in page 25, line 1, leave out subsection (3).<P>

<P>
The amendments are wide-ranging and the length of the debate might have some consequence on whether there will be a clause stand part debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCabe:</B> Amendment No. 129 and amendment No. 138 have a similar intention. They would tighten the language of the clause, so that the offence is more specific and the deliberate intent of the accused is clearer. I am anxious that someone who is caught by the clause may not intentionally be committing the act which we fear he is.
<P>
Consequently, the amendment would rule out the need for too many assumptions or arbitrary judgments by the police or other authorities who may be under intense pressure to get a conviction or make an arrest. I would certainly not defend the police's actions in relation to the Birmingham Six, who were wrongly arrested and convicted for the Birmingham bombings. However, I remember the intense pressure for the police to make an arrest. In such circumstances, people may be tempted to use the clause without doing sufficient background work to ensure that information gathered fitted a consistent pattern leading them to believe that they had the right person. The purpose of the amendment is to make the matter crystal clear.
<P>
Amendment No. 130 is in the same vein and would be a safeguard for people collecting information for other purposes. Investigative journalists, for example, may collect a lot of information, but it does not always follow that they know the exact value of material in their possession. That is especially true of the early stages of investigations, when they are in the midst of acquiring information. The amendment would provide a safeguard for such people as well as those who innocently collect information about, for example, car registrations or train timetables. The latter activities may be wholly innocent, but, unfortunately, may be deemed to have a different purpose.
<P>
The hon. Member for Aylesbury used the example of someone with safe house and target addresses in his pocket. A person could be innocently drinking in a pub and someone could put that information into the wrong jacket. People could come into possession of information without any of the intentions given in the clause. Amendment No. 130 would clarify the matter, specifying that someone who has information knowingly for the purpose of aiding and abetting terrorism is guilty of that offence.
<P>
If amendments Nos. 129 and 130 are accepted, subsection (3) becomes redundant, as we will have dealt with the reverse burden of proof. Tightening earlier subsections will make them more specified and put the onus on the authorities to prove that the person is collecting information for a particular purpose. The intent of the accused will be specific, so subsection (3) will become unnecessary.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> I shall follow your implied suggestion, Mr. Malins, that a comment or two may be appropriate in this debate. I shall be briefer than I was in our previous debate. My comments go to the heart of the clause, so there should be no need to repeat them in any clause stand part debate.
<P>
Obviously, the matter involves another offence in which statutory defence and reverse burden of truth arguments are writ large. The amendments seek to make the law more like it was previously and indeed follow exactly the criticism made by Lord Williams of Mostyn when he was an Opposition spokesman in the last Parliament before he become the Attorney General in this Parliament. When the matter was considered he said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"If we condemn our citizens to the possibility of 10 years' imprisonment on the basis of reasonable suspicion...we are in serious danger of giving terrorism a victory that it would not otherwise achieve."--[Official Report, House of Lords, 7 June 1994; Vol.555, c. 1208-1209.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
 He described this offence as being "far too harsh" and "draconian" and added that it would bring the law into disrepute.
<P>
That is the strong argument against this provision. The offence deals not with items such as weapons but with information. I well remember the intervention of the hon. Member for Aylesbury about someone who was found with a membership list, an address book and some fertiliser. Obviously, one can put two and two together to build up a picture of someone. In practical terms, that is often how it happens.
<P>
One of the categories, but by no means the only category that Lord Williams addressed, was journalists. This is not a plea for journalists, but they would be among those troubled by this sort of provision. They carry information, such as lists of phone numbers, names and so on. The Minister will inevitably respond to the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Hall Green, particularly the pivotal amendment No. 130, which adds the word "knowingly", by saying that it has to be proved as something likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism. But if clause 56(l)(b) is not amended, it will sweep in things very easily.
<P>
One can always paint extreme pictures and no one would suggest that you, Mr. Malins, or I or the hon. Member for Aylesbury could be successfully prosecuted on the basis that we had an A to Z in our glove compartments. That is clearly not the case. The issue that arises is the same as the proportionality of the reverse burden of proof and its compatibility with the European convention on human rights. If the amendment is not accepted and if a person can be done without knowing that he had the information on him, it puts on him the burden of proof to prove either that he was lawfully justified in having it or that he might have a reasonable excuse. The mischief is not against someone who cannot prove that or who has nothing to say about it, but against the perhaps rarer individual who has had something left in the vehicle and who might be easily picked up when the chief villain gets away with it. We all agree that terrorists are very wily and determined individuals. They will cover their tracks. They will want to ensure that they do not get caught and if they can leave something that might be suspicious such as a list in someone else's vehicle, they may well do that.
<P>
Why is the current law of conspiracy not sufficient? Why is it not sufficient either to accept the amendment, to put "knowingly" back in, or to get someone on the basis of conspiring to create a terrorist offence simply on the basis of the information that is available?  One can at least get near to securing, if not secure, a conviction in that way. As I understand it, the prosecution of the case involving the right hon. Member for Bridgwater (Mr. King), which was based on people carrying information--maps, notebooks, records, addresses and so on--in their pockets occurred in that context. There have been other such cases; the former chairman of Whitbread, Sir Charles Tidbury, was also targeted in that way. The question is whether the charge of conspiracy is an adequate alternative.
<P>
My final point is on the viability of the amendments. The Minister quoted the law lord who gave one of the key judgments in the Kebeline case in October. That case was not determinative because it had to be tested in the courts, so the issue was addressed by a side wind, as it were, rather than a definitive adjudication. However, the criminalisation of possession of information that is likely to assist a terrorist if the defendant is unable to show that possession is for a lawful purpose may create a presumption of guilt that does not strike a proper balance between the rights of the individual and the interests of society.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> My only substantial point is that the amendments tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Hall Green raised a series of points to clarify the ECHR issue. The nub of the debate is one that we have covered before: does the statutory defence 257 258 provided by clause 56(3) constitute a sufficient safeguard to deal with the offences the other way round? As with other clauses, we contend that it does, while my hon. Friend contends that it does not.
<P>
It is important to deal with such points as the A to Z in the glove compartment. If the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey were asked why he had an A to Z in his glove compartment and said that it was to find the offices of Liberty in his constituency, a court would say that that was a reasonable excuse. The question is straightforward: does one think that clause 56(3) provides an adequate statutory defence? We contest that it does. That also deals with the issue of investigative journalism and so on.
<P>
On conspiracy, my main point is that it takes two to conspire. However, in the cases that we are dealing with, there may be no second person involved so the conspiracy legislation simply cannot deal with them effectively enough. I hope that the amendment can be withdrawn and that the clause as a whole will stand part.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> The hon. Member for Birmingham, Hall Green is on his way, but has not arrived. I assume that his amendment was a probing amendment. Perhaps I could take up one point with the Minister while we are waiting.
<P>
I think that I am right in saying that although the allegation of conspiracy has to involve another person, one does not have to produce that other person. One can have conspiracy with a person or persons unknown. It is therefore possible for only one person to be in the frame.
<P>
The Minister made a generic response. He will remember that I did not suggest that the A to Z argument worked; I said that it was a ridiculous extreme.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> I know that that is the case, but I get frustrated with obvious common-sense issues such as possession of an A to Z being thrown around in the context of the legislation as though people might be caught by it. That is why I feel that it is important to rebut each ludicrous example. As the hon. Gentleman will concede, they are unhelpful to serious debate.
<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I understand that. That was not my example, and I did not argue that such a case that would result in a prosecution.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> It must have been someone else that I heard speaking.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I used that example, but I did not associate myself with the proposition that an A to Z would be adequate.
<P>
Now that the hon. Member for Hall Green is back in his place, the Minister might deal with my point before he wraps up the debate. There has to be an allegation that other people have been involved in conspiracy, but they need not be produced. Many people can be caught by conspiracy, but some acting on their own are not. Will the Minister confirm that that is right?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> My understanding is that one can conspire with a person or persons unknown, but the issue of whether it is possible for one person to take action still arises. Under those circumstances, the law on conspiracy alone is not enough.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCabe:</B> I apologise for being delayed in returning to the Committee. It is strange to say, but I would like to thank the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey for talking for a bit longer. I was hanging around because I heard that there had been a reshuffle, and, given my latest opposition to the Government, I wondered whether there was so much need for new blood in the Conservatives that I might be offered a job.
<P>
The intention of the amendments was to make the argument clear and to ensure that people would not be inadvertently drawn in. I am happy to receive assurances from the Minister to that effect, so I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave withdrawn.
<P>
Clause 56 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 57</center></H4>
<H4><center>England and Wales</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 133, in page 25, line 22, after 'Kingdom', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'knowing that the other person was--
<P>
(i) acting on behalf of, or in connection with, any organisation which carries out activities directed towards the overthrowing or influencing by force or violence, of any government de jure or de facto, and
<P>
(ii) by his act of terrorism, intending to carry out such activities;',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Minister will recognise that the amendment is similarly worded to one that we debated on clause 1. For reasons that were well made by the hon. Members for Basingstoke (Mr. Hunter) and for Fermanagh and South Tyrone (Mr. Maginnis), I accept that the wording is not ideal, so the amendment is probing by definition. If we want to amend the clause later, we shall return with an amendment that would reasonably do so. I shall not put the amendment to a vote, but I shall briefly deal with the issue that it raises before I deal with the remaining matters on the clause stand part debate.
<P>
The amendment to page 25 of the Bill would change the basis of the offence of incitement of terrorism overseas. As drafted, the offence is committed if someone
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"incites another person to commit an act of terrorism wholly or partly outside the United Kingdom"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
that is a terrorist offence as listed in subsection (2) and is committed in England and Wales. The amendment would seek to ensure that we dealt with the mischief that would be the exclusion of freedom fighting.
<P>
There is a strong argument that, without such an amendment, there will be difficulties because the legislation will be more wide than it should be. Unless we limit, especially in relation to international terrorism, the definition to activities that seek to influence Governments, which is the specific purpose of the amendment, or seek to influence political parties or groupings, which unfortunately the amendment would fail to do, we would be in danger of sweeping up all sorts of people and activities. While it may be bad enough in legalistic and civil liberty terms to do that in relation to offences committed in the United Kingdom, there is more widespread concern when it applies to activities that are committed outside the United Kingdom.
<P>
I am absolutely clear that the qualification under subsection (2) limits the nature of subsection (1), so however tightly or widely that is drawn, it is limited to those five offences under subsection (2). Clearly, they are serious offences; we do not argue with that. The offence under the Criminal Damage Act 1971 is a serious offence, not a minor offence. Does the Minister think that it is appropriate to have the same definition of terrorism throughout the Bill? He said that he would be open to a debate on the definition on Report. Surely, when talking about terrorism overseas and offences committed in this country, but which are connected to activities overseas, we must have the most tightly drawn definition possible.
<P>
<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> I have two points to make. First, we have decided--rightly, in my view--that one definition of terrorism should run throughout the Bill. The amendment would add an extra component to the clause 1 definition of terrorism in that it would be an incitement offence only. I understand why the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey tabled the amendment, but we decided to have one definition because it would enable all those involved in any respect to understand the situation more clearly. We considered that it would be wrong to have different definitions for different offences. That is the principal reason why I am glad that the hon. Gentleman said that he would withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Secondly, I refer to our general discussions on clause 1. The amendment refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"overthrowing or influencing by force or violence, any government".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I do not want to replicate our earlier discussion, but it is not right to limit the provision so narrowly. We have discussed at length the role of the terrorist in seeking to overthrow democracy as such, rather than to overthrow the Government. For the reasons that I explained when we debated clause 1, I do not think that the definitions in the amendment are right.
<P>
We believe that the clause 1 definition is the best that we can find but, if anyone comes up with a better set of words, we will be willing to consider them. [Interruption.] The hon. Gentleman must have discovered that he has been reshuffled and put on the shadow, shadow, shadow Opposition Front Bench. I am glad that he is prepared to withdraw his amendment, which does not stack up.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I am sorry to disappoint the Minister, but the pager message was not nearly as exciting as he implied. It was a summons to another meeting which, of course, I put second to my Committee duties. [Hon. Members: "No."] I thought that that would be the response: one must stick to one's commitments. As I said earlier, one of my hon. Friends could have been here instead, but the Government Whips would not put up with that. It is all their fault.
<P>
The incitement provision raises two important matters. First, incitement is a wide concept, and I would be grateful for the Government definition of it and how it is expected to be defined in the courts. Such a definition may be fulfilled by words, writings, documents, tracts, bits of paper, speeches and so on.
<P>
Secondly, in 1980, a clause such as this could have caught a large number of people who supported the African National Congress. Therefore, those supporting freedom fighters--whether against the South African regime in 1980, the Burmese Government in 2000, or totalitarian regimes such as the Russian Government in Chechnya--would be caught. In such circumstances, what the Minister said earlier and what the Secretary of State said on Second Reading would not be true. Someone supporting by words or action what the Bill defines as acts of terrorism would not be precluded from the provisions in the clause for saying things--directly or indirectly--in support of people who resorted to violence.
<P>
Archbishop Tutu said that when the ANC were out of Government and Parliament the role of the church was not to walk away from people with whose views it might not agree but with whom it had solidarity. He and his predecessors refused to condemn such people. Those who accept that people are justified in resorting to armed struggle to overcome authorities may risk being caught by the clause.
<P>
I do not support the clause, as I have a practical concern about its operation. That connects to my view on clauses 55 and 56, neither of which I support. I shall not divide the Committee, but I reserve the right to do so when the Bill goes Downstairs.
<P>
It is easy for Governments or regimes in power to pay for their people to come and give evidence against someone. It is often difficult for people involved in liberation struggles or freedom fighting to get witnesses to support their case. There is inequity between the powers of the state and the powers of the people who are against it. Thus, were it to come to a prosecution, the clause would give many more opportunities to the agents of foreign Governments and regimes and the powers of the state than to the individual. It is weighted by its drafting and by the way in which society is structured, so we must be doubly careful that we do not weight it absolutely against the individual.
<P>
A definition of the incitement provision would be helpful, as would the best possible exposition of how the clause would avoid catching those who support people committed to violent activity in the pursuit of democracy in other countries, or places where there is no government. Concerns about this clause are widespread.

<P>

<B>Mr. Gapes:</B> I can understand the superficial attraction of the arguments that we have just heard. Those of us who supported the ANC in the 1970s and 1980s and who have a track record of speaking in support of liberation movements over decades can understand those arguments in the context of an authoritarian, undemocratic regime in which there is no possibility of democratic change. But I am afraid that the world has moved on. There was the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in South Africa and the apologies from Thabo Mbeki, now the President of South Africa, for actions that the ANC carried out, including terrorist bombings. Many people from that movement have said that, in retrospect, those actions were not the most appropriate way forward and must be apologised for.
<P>
The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey talked about liberation struggles, freedom fighting or whatever, but it is the whatever that is the problem. We must distinguish between what is  justifiable and what is not. I do not believe that simply by calling itself a liberation movement, a group can justify blowing up children, gunning down pregnant women or hacking people to pieces. Certain criteria must be applied in all circumstances to decide what is legitimate and what is not. Clearly, there are problems when people who set out to harm property and not people, nevertheless do something which leads to casualties. There is also the problem of ends and means, but that is a difficult philosophical debate and I do not intend to go into it now.
<P>
We must be clear about one thing. I cannot justify having one rule against terrorism in this country while saying that it is perfectly legitimate for people to carry out terrorist acts against innocent people in another country in Europe or elsewhere in the world. People might be organising or inciting that violence in this country, even if they are not carrying it out here. With increasing numbers of international organisations, we need provisions to deal with the incitement and organisation of terrorist activities in one country which are carried out in a second country by nationals of a third country who then seek refuge in a fourth country. If we do not have them, we will never be able to deal with this nexus of people in small but dedicated groups. We know from experience that IRA funding goes on in the United States of America. The most fanatical Irish Republicans and the most extreme anti-Belfast agreement Republicans are not in Ireland or Britain but in Quincy, Boston in the state of Massachusetts. The same phenomenon applies to exiles from, for example, Sri Lanka, Kashmir and Algeria.
<P>
We need to deal with the problem carefully. We must be able to justify action in the courts, but if we sit on the fence and say that these measures would have hit the African National Congress and stopped the struggle for liberation in South Africa, we shall not deal with the problem of well-organised, well-funded groups that are capable of operating effectively and carrying out terrorist acts against states all over the world.
<P>
<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> I agree with every word that my hon. and longstanding Friend the Member for Ilford, South (Mr. Gapes) said about some of those struggles. It is vital to understand that the world has changed. Murder or endangering the lives of innocent people are crimes, whatever the killer's motivation or however corrupt the regime that they are fighting against. My hon. Friend makes the point very powerfully and what he says must be taken seriously. He has a wealth of experience of such issues well beyond that of most of us in the Committee. It is important that people listen to what he says.
<P>
I shall set out the case for the clause, as the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey invited me to do, because it is important that that should be done. The clause will introduce the offence of incitement to commit an act of terrorism wholly or partly outside the United Kingdom where that act, if committed in England and Wales, would constitute one of a number of specified offences--in particular, murder. It will be immaterial whether the person incited is in the United Kingdom.
<P>
The clause provides that the offence of incitement will attract the same penalty as the specified offences. The clause includes a specific exemption from criminal liability for some people. That is merely to ensure that there is no doubt that such an exemption applies in view of the nature of the offence.
<P>
Associated clauses 58 and 59 will introduce similar provisions in Northern Ireland and Scotland, respectively.
<P>
Our debates so far have highlighted the need to ensure that the United Kingdom remains able to respond effectively to the continuing threat of international terrorism. That is important adequately to protect our citizens here and abroad and, moreover, to co-operate effectively with our international partners to tackle terrorism more generally. Therefore, the Government believe that it is important to send a strong message to extremists in this country that inciting terrorism anywhere overseas is simply not acceptable.
<P>
In tandem with other clauses, the incitement provisions show our commitment to change the climate in which supporters of terrorism seek to operate in this country. The United Kingdom has no intention of becoming a place where international terrorists and their supporters can form their base. Although the clause will provide a new and carefully prescribed offence, the notion of an offence of incitement from within the United Kingdom is far from new.
<P>
An offence of incitement to carry out specific acts abroad that are commonly associated with terrorism, such as hostage taking or hijacking aircraft or ships, is already available to the prosecuting authority under the extra-terroritorial jurisdictions that we have established over those offences in the different measures that have implemented various United Nations counter-terrorism conventions. I am not aware of any case of incitement under those extra-terrorital provisions, but the power exists to act if necessary and appropriate. I accept that the investigative and evidential constraints in relation to any incitement to terrorist activity will be considerable, but that does not mean that it is right to do nothing.
<P>
The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey referred to definitions. All lawyers, whether practising or non-practising, in the Committee will know that experience shows that the common law offence of incitement can be difficult to prove, especially if the language used is directed not at a specific individual but at the public or a section of the public. A successful prosecution requires more than language that may encourage others to commit offences. For example, the prosecution must establish that the inciter intended that his or her words would persuade others to commit a crime. Of course, that will apply to clause 57.
<P>
How prosecution authorities apply the offence proposed in the clause will be a matter for their judgment. The problems inherent in prosecuting incitement in this country could be significant if the person is overseas. In addition, those engaged in supporting terrorism are usually extremely careful to ensure that they use language that falls short of incitement. While recognising those possible constraints, the Government nevertheless believe that it is important to ensure that the framework of our law is sufficient to enable action to be taken when the circumstances merit it and to ensure that the remaining anomalies in our law are removed.
<P>
I have tried to address the specific points made by the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey. I want to emphasise that international terrorism is a real threat. It is important that the UK does whatever it can to inhibit this evil and cowardly way of proceeding. It is important that the clause stands part of the Bill. I hope that all hon. Members, I say all advisedly, are prepared to support it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> I want to respond quickly to the hon. Member for Ilford, South and to the Minister. My reading of their comments is that they would reply yes to the following proposition. In an article in The Guardian just before Christmas, Richard Norton-Taylor put the proposition that if the clause remained in the Bill, it would have caught not only Nelson Mandela when he was in prison, but the Chilean exiles who resisted Pinochet when he was in power, those who defended Palestinian attacks against Israel in the occupied territories, those who opposed the Indonesian occupation of East Timor, dissidents opposed to the Saudi regime, Islamic militants and Britons of Pakistani origin supporting fighting in Kashmir. As I understand it, the hon. Member for Ilford, South said that that might be the case but that we just had to accept it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gapes:</B> The hon. Gentleman is putting words in my mouth.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I am giving him the opportunity to say whether he now argues that whatever the undemocratic nature of the regime now, there is never an excuse for taking armed or non-pacific struggle to overcome it. I should be interested to know whether that is the hon. Gentleman's position, but the Minister wants to intervene.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> The hon. Gentleman strings across a range of solidarity struggles, but it is important to recognise that the world has changed. He must tell the Committee which specific terrorist acts he has in mind. The Bill is about specific terrorist acts.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> That is a fair point. The string was not mine but came in the article by Richard Norton-Taylor.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> They were the hon. Gentleman's words.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> Well, they were, but I was putting the case that he put in that article. The Minister is right to say that such people would be caught only if they committed acts that constituted incitement and one of the five offences set out in the Bill. Of course, they would have to be as specific as that.

<P>

<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> Mr Norton-Taylor is not, as yet, a member of the Committee. I do not know whether he intends to stand for Parliament, but if he does I will welcome his contribution. We are not in a position to ask what he had in mind. It is incumbent on the hon. Gentleman if he prays in aid such an article to give concrete examples of the specific acts. People will draw their own conclusions if he cannot do so in this exchange. He makes a serious point and he understands the Bill, but the whole point is that it is about specific terrorist acts. To which does he refer?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I shall not attribute to someone who is outside the Committee an interpretation of the comments that were limited to those I quoted. I will answer the Minister's question in part and I will be even more explicit. The Bill proposes that incitement to commit one of a specific set of five acts would constitute an offence. The Minister and the hon. Member for Ilford, South say that the world has changed. Does that imply that it will be perfectly possible for someone to be convicted in this country of an act that constitutes incitement to any of the five offences, no matter how dastardly the foreign regime, no matter how undemocratic the country, no matter how much human rights are suppressed, no matter how much there is a world view that the regime should be overthrown? If that is the Govemment's position, that is fine and they can stand on it. But I do not think that the world has moved to such an extent that everyone now says that whoever is in power, the world must just stand by and not give solidarity to people who may use violence and commit the five offences in the Bill. That is our debate. The Government and the hon. Member for Ilford, South may have taken the view that a new position is required and that nothing but diplomatic means must be used to overcome authoritarian governments. That is why I seek clarification. I do not understand the current position or how the answer to the general proposition put in this case by an eminent journalist can be that all those types of support, provided that they were carried out in the context of offences in the Bill, could have been the subject of a prosecution under the Bill if it had been enacted at that time.
<P>
<H5>7 pm</H5>

<P>
<B>Mr. Gapes:</B> The debate is interesting because I have yet to hear what actions would be justified in support of an unspecified liberation struggle. People who take illegal action, blow up buildings, or carry out terrorist actions, however defined, must be prepared to take the consequences. There have been cases in which such activity could have been legitimate, against an authoritarian regime. I would have supported any action to assassinate Hitler, so I have no qualms in saying that 265 266 actions of that kind can be justified. I suspect that anybody brought before our courts and charged with such an offence would have been acquitted, because the courts would have regarded that prosecution as one that should never have been pursued.
<P>
If the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey thought about it, he might say that blowing up a nursery or machine-gunning a bus full of children could not be justified by the cause of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, the Tamil Tigers or whatever Organisation he might pick. I hope that even if a liberation struggle were going on and the dispute was regarded as legitimate, he would not justify actions of that kind. If it could be proved that people from this country were inciting or organising such actions, helping to provide weaponry or assisting in some other way, it would be legitimate to take action against them. However, I do not think that such assistance should encompass the distribution of leaflets or publicity material for an organisation. Clearly, if such a case went to the courts, the court would decide whether those people were guilty. The courts make their own decisions. We should not use an extreme example to justify removing the possibility of taking action against organisations that carry out terrorist actions and use this country to assist in that process. That is my position.
<P>
I reiterate that the world has moved on. I do not believe that Nelson Mandela would have been found guilty if he could have been brought to trial under the Bill in a British court. The Crown Prosecution Service would have decided that there was little chance of a successful prosecution of him or any other African National Congress leader at that time. That is my answer to the hon. Gentleman's question.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> That was helpful. I do not entirely agree with the hon. Gentleman, but I understand the distinction. Of course it would be impossible to justify blowing up a bus full of children or a nursery. However, one of the offences in the Bill is that of causing an explosion, from the Offences Against the Person Act 1861. It might have been entirely justifiable to have incited people to cause explosions to destabilise the regime in Cambodia when it was run by Pol Pot. It might be justifiable to cause explosions that cause civil damage in an authoritarian state now, even if prosecution were possible on the basis of a risk to a section of the public. Those are questions of judgment for the individual. Of course there are matters of degree, but the issue is whether we will decide that nothing that comes within even the least serious of the offences under clause 57(2) or the least harmful extension of the definition of terrorism under clause 1 would be caught. That appears to be the case and it is the reason why the clause is so wide.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 57 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
Clauses 58 and 59 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> I beg to move,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>That the remaining provision of the Bill be considered in the following order: Clause 62, Schedule 8, Clauses 63 to 81, Schedule 9, Clauses 82 to 95, Schedule 10, Clauses 96 to 99, Schedule 11, Clauses 100 to 111, Schedule 12, Clauses 112 to 120, Schedules 13 and 14, Clauses 121 to 125, Schedule 7, Clauses 60 and 61, new Clauses and new Schedules.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am moving the procedural motion because the Government have been working hard on a number of amendments to the Bill to take account of our signature, on 10 January, of the international convention for the suppression of the financing of terrorism. The provisions that are necessary for the United Kingdom to ratify the treaty appear on the amendment paper under my name as two new clauses.
<P>
On advice, we have decided that the best way to package the material flowing from the signature of the financing of terrorism convention is to introduce two new clauses. The first is new clause 8, which gives the United Kingdom the necessary extra-territorial jurisdiction in respect of the terrorist financing provisions in clauses 14 to 17. The second is new clause 9, which deals with a number of extradition-related matters flowing from our signature of the financing convention and the terrorist bombings convention. The extra-territorial jurisdiction implications arising from the latter convention are already covered in clause 60.
<P>
To achieve our aim in the most streamlined fashion and to avoid unnecessary repetition in the Bill, we propose that Government amendment No. 82 should have no effect and that the Committee does not consider clause 61 in its present form yet. We propose that the two new clauses on the amendment paper in my name should replace those measures. In order that we can have one debate on the United Kingdom's future application of the two United Nations conventions, we propose that consideration of clauses 60 and 61 be deferred to the end of the Bill and debated with the new clauses. That is what the motion is designed to achieve, and I hope that the Committee will agree to it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lidington:</B> I am content for my part to accept the revised order of proceedings that the Minister has proposed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> The Minister was kind enough to make his intention clear and it seems entirely sensible; we are happy to agree.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Resolved,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>That the remaining provisions of the Bill be considered in the following order: Clause 62, Schedule 8, Clauses 63 to 81, Schedule 9, Clauses 82 to 95, Schedule 10, Clauses 96 to 99, Schedule 11, Clauses 100 to 111, Schedule 12, Clauses 112 to 120, Schedules 13 and 14, Clauses 121 to 125, Schedule 7, Clauses 60 and 61, new Clauses and new Schedules.<P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 83, in page 27, line 35, after first 'I', insert 'or III'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 84 and 101.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> We are moving on to part VIII, which deals specifically with Northern Ireland. The amendments deal with one specific aspect.
<P>
The Criminal Jurisdiction Act 1975 enables certain offences committed in the Republic of Ireland to be tried in Northern Ireland. Parallel legislation also exists in the form of Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act 1976 in the Republic of Ireland. Under the current terms of the EPA, the extra-territorial offences must be dealt with as scheduled offences. There is no provision for certifying out particular cases for jury trials, even if those cases are not terrorist related.
<P>
In his 1998 report on the operation of the EPA, Mr. John Rowe, the independent assessor, recommended that those offences should be added to those that could be certified out for jury trial by the Attorney-General. He said that he could see no reason why that was not possible. The Government agree with that conclusion, and are therefore happy to follow the recommendation. That is the straightforward effect of the amendments.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Amendment made: No. 84, in line 35, leave out 'Part I or III of that Schedule' and insert 'either of those Parts'.--[Mr. Ingram.]
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.

<P>

<B>Mr. Lidington:</B> We welcome the Government's decision to change the line that they pursued in opposition and adopt the policy followed by my right hon. and hon. Friend's when they were in government--that we should approach the issue of scheduled offences by certifying out, rather than certifying in. We have always taken the position that certifying out was the right procedure, and Mr. Rowe supported us in that, when he argued, in paragraph 45 of his report, that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The Attorney General's decision to certify opens the door to jury trial. In the reverse direction he would be denying jury trial, and that is inappropriate for the officer who has the conduct of all criminal prosecutions, It is also inappropriate for the officer who is indeed, in the words of a former Attorney General, Lord Mayhew of Twysden, 'constitutionally the guardian of the public interest'."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Earlier this afternoon, the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey chided Ministers for having come closer to the position taken by the Conservative Government. I would like to express my appreciation of the wisdom that Ministers have shown in that regard.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I am sure that that will be helpful to the Government.
<P>
As we are debating clause stand part, I shall tell the Committee, as I have already privately told the Minister, how I intend to proceed with this clause and others. As I have said, I have accepted the proposition that there should be an agreed timetable, if possible, for phasing out part VII. Some say it should go now--the Minister knows that perfectly well--because the powers are exceptional.
<P>
This week of all weeks, and today of all days, however, it would be impolite--I put it no higher than that--for members of the Committee to argue that we ought to move suddenly from a special powers system to one that pretended that normality had returned for good. Clearly, it has not. We hope and pray that normality will return, and soon. That must be the wish of every member of the Committee, without qualification, but we are not there yet.
<P>
I do not intend, by and large, to take issue with the details of part VII, not least because, if we are honest, the people who will have most knowledge of and interest in part VII are not, with the exception of the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone, members of the Committee. They will want to raise some issues on Report. It is pointless to have a less than satisfactory debate here, when there can be a better informed debate elsewhere. I do not want to preclude those who are not members of the Committee from having their say, and I have no objection to the clause. Indeed, it will be a consolation for the Committee to know that there are a few clauses following this one about which I do not propose to say anything at all. [Hon. Members: "Shame"] There are a few things a little later in part VII that I will raise with the Minister, just to make sure that he earns his money.
<P>
There is a case for part VII to remain, including clause 62. When we debate the timetable provisions, no doubt we will debate the Government's proposition that there should be yearly review and yearly renewal. In this case, the Government are right: there should be not only review but renewal. Parliament should have to decide what is appropriate; the decision should not be left to ministerial discretion. I hope that that is helpful and that it will encourage hon. Members to think that they will not be here all night.
<P>
<H5>7.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> The hon. Member for Aylesbury paid a noble compliment, but he got it slightly wrong. I am sure that he is aware that we are carrying out a review of the Diplock court system. We hope to report in sufficient time for it to impact on the progress of the Bill either in another place or in its later stages in this House. That is consistent with what we said in opposition. Indeed, in 1998 I tabled an amendment to the EPA on the Government's behalf. That allowed us to begin to tackle some of these issues, which shifted the territory somewhat. We are trying to achieve the normalisation of society in Northern Ireland and I am sure that everyone wants that. In a normalised society, trial by jury becomes a given, even in the most extreme cases. If we can achieve a situation in which any terrorist acts are carried out by a minority, and without broad community support, that will be a major development. It would be an even greater development if no terrorist acts were carried out. The normalisation of society is likely to be a phased process.
<P>
The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey said that part VII was justified by the events of the past week. However, it is too early to judge. [Interruption.] I know that he did not mean it in quite that way. That part of the Bill stands in its own right because the threat still exists. There is a need for such legislation and that is why the Government introduced the Bill, with all the caveats and conditions about annual review and the five-year life expectancy. If further debate is needed on certifying in and certifying out, that will be most appropriate under clause 72.
<P>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> We still have many clauses ahead and I am considering whether to take them in blocks, unless there are certain clauses on which hon. Members want a debate. It will be helpful if they told me which clauses they want taken separately.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I would be happy if we took a block up to and including clause 71. The Minister is right that the clauses that raise matters for debate begin at 72. It might also be helpful to members of the Committee if, through you, Mr. Malins, we established plans for the evening. I have no problems up to and including clause 71. However, I have questions on the next set of clauses. Therefore, it may be convenient if the Committee adjourns at the end of the block of clauses on which we are about to make a decision.
