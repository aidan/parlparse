<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before the Committee begins to consider new clauses, several points of procedure require clarification. First, the Committee will know that new clauses 3 and 9 have already been debated. I shall call them formally, but without debate. Secondly, there is a small mistake in the selection list. New clause 15 is included, but that is a mistake as it has not been selected. A revised list is available in the Room, which supersedes the one that was available last night and contains the correct selection. Finally, there is one small amendment to the grouping on the selection list. New clauses 21 and 17 are grouped together and new clause 8 will now be included with that group.
<H4><center>New Clause 3</center></H4>
<H4><center>Prohibition of hunting, &c.</center></H4>
<ul><font size=-1> `.--(1) A person commits an offence if he hunts a wild mammal with a dog.
 <p>(2) An owner or occupier of land commits an offence if he permits another person to enter or use that land to hunt in contravention of subsection (1).
<P>(3) The owner or keeper of a dog commits an offence if he permits another person to use the dog to hunt in contravention of subsection (1).
<P>
 (4) It is an offence to own or keep two or more dogs for the purposes of their being used to hunt in contravention of subsection (1).
<P>
 (5) In this Act a reference to hunting a wild mammal includes a reference to searching for or coursing a wild mammal.'.--[Mr. Michael J. Foster.]<P>

<P>
Brought up, read the First and Second time, and added to the Bill.
<H4><center>New clause 9</center></H4>
<H4><center>Forfeiture: supplementary</center></H4>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `.--(1) This section applies where an order has been made under section 4(1)(a) for forfeiture of an article.
<P>
 (2) The order shall deprive the person convicted of his rights, if any, in the article; and the article shall be taken into, or remain in, the possession of the police.
<P>
 (3) If a person, other than the person convicted, applies to the court which made the order, or to a magistrates' court in the same petty sessional area, the court may order the article to be delivered to that person if he appears to the court to be its owner.
<P>
 (4) The court shall not make an order under subsection (3) unless it is satisfied that the applicant--
<P>
(a) had not consented to the person convicted having possession of the article, or
<P>
(b) did not know, and had no reason to suspect, that the article was likely to be used for the purpose of hunting in contravention of section (Prohibition of hunting, &c.)(1).
<P>
 (5) No application shall be made under subsection (3) after the expiry of the period of six months starting with the date on which the order was made.
<P>
 (6) An order under subsection (3) shall not affect the right of any person to take proceedings for the recovery of the article within the period of six months starting with the date on which the order under section 4(1)(a) was made; but that right shall cease on the expiry of that period.
<P>
 (7) If, on the expiry of the period of six months starting with the date of the order, the article has not been ordered to be delivered up in accordance with subsection (3) or (6), it shall be destroyed as soon as possible.'.--[Mr. Michael J. Foster.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Brought up, read the First and Second time, and added to the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael J. Foster </B>(Worcester): On a point of order, Mr. O'Hara. Last week, I said that I did not intend to mention pigs because my hon. Friend the Member for Brigg and Goole (Mr. Cawsey) was not present. I should like you to rule, Mr. O'Hara, on whether you interpret that as I do so--that no mention was made of pigs not because of the hon. Member concerned, but because his constituency is, as we have been told numerous times, the pig capital of Britain.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am not sure whether that is a point of order, but am happy to confirm that I have at no point confused the hon. Member for Brigg and Goole with a pig.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> Thank you, Mr. O'Hara. That has saved my neck, I hope.
<H4><center>New Clause 10</center></H4>
<H4><center>Rabbits and Rodents</center></H4>
<H4><center>`Exceptions from the prohibition of hunting</center></H4>
<P>
 . A person does not commit an offence under section (Prohibition of hunting, &c.)(1) if he hunts rabbits or rodents--
<P>
	(a) on land which he owns or occupies, or
<P>
	(b) partly on land which he owns or occupies and partly on neighbouring land, or
<P>
	(c) at the request of the owner or occupier of the land where the hunting takes place.'.--[Mr. Michael J. Foster.]
<P>
Brought up, and read the First time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<P>
New clause 10 replaces old clause 5(2)(a). As previously mentioned, it makes an exemption to the offence of hunting, allowing the owner or occupier of land to hunt rabbits or rodents. It also caters for the situation in which a dog follows a rodent or rabbit on to neighbouring land. New clause 10(1)(c) is intended to allow an owner to call someone in to help dispose of rabbits or rodents.
<P>
The new clause is further proof that people will be safe to walk their dogs. They will not be prosecuted if their dog chases a squirrel, rabbit or vole. That point was raised on Second Reading. I hope that the new clause puts paid to that bogus interpretation of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Garnier </B>(Harborough): I hope that the lack of artificial light in the Room will present no problems to Members who intend to speak. I shall endeavour to tease from the hon. Member for Worcester (Mr. Foster) information on one or two points. The new clause expressly contradicts a principle outlined over the many weeks that we have spent discussing the Bill. Many of the Bill's supporters seem to have lost sight of its philosophical roots; indeed, some of them may never have known what they were.
<P>
We should reconsider a document published by the hon. Member for Worcester before the Bill was produced in July 1997. He issued a press release with the assistance of the Campaign for the Protection of Hunted Animals, which set out three principles that he thought should be followed. New clause 10 directly contradicts them.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman said that the Bill's purpose was to enhance the protection of wild animals from cruelty by outlawing ``sports''--the inverted commas are his--that involved hunting with dogs in the United Kingdom. The second principle was that the sponsors and supporters of the Bill believed that hunting and killing of wild animals by dogs inflicts unnecessary suffering. Thirdly, he said that the Bill's supporters accepted that the populations of some wild mammals must be controlled, but believed that there are always more selective and humane solutions than setting dogs on wild animals for the purposes of pleasure. I can see the hon. Member for Reading, West (Mr. Salter) nodding his agreement with all that.
<P>
Each of those principles is relevant to new clause 10. Each betrays the sloppy thinking of the sponsors of the Bill, of which there has been much evidence during the past eight weeks or so. Wild mammals include not only the foxes, deer and hare to which the hon. Member for Worcester has referred over the past six months, but rabbits, rats and rodents. The Bill purports to protect wild mammals and should therefore protect all wild mammals. If it does not do so, it should say so.
<P>
The Bill excludes a class of wild mammals and would be more accurately titled, ``Certain Wild Mammals (Hunting with Dogs) Bill''. It would be more tellingly titled, ``Cuddly Wild Mammals (Hunting with Dogs) Bill''. The Bill splits off animals, such as rats, which are sentimentally unappealing or whose welfare has no political value among the financial backers of the campaign of the hon. Member for Worcester to protect hunted animals. Should we call it the campaign to protect cuddly hunted animals? There was evidence of that when the hon. Gentleman emerged from St. Stephen's entrance after Second Reading carrying aloft a cuddly toy. The world at large was able to see that a cuddly fox was uppermost in his thoughts--[Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. and learned Member is making some serious points and the Committee should give him a hearing.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> Not many pieces of legislation contradict their own central doctrine, but this Bill does precisely that, as is demonstrated by the new clause. It permits the hunting of rabbits and rats with dogs. Whatever happened to the published principle that hunting with dogs causes unnecessary suffering?
<P>
The sponsors and supporters of the Bill believe that the hunting and killing of wild animals by dogs inflicts unnecessary suffering. The hon. Member for Worcester said that on the record last July, last November and doubtless on numerous other occasions, both between those dates and subsequently. He has been clear about that. But a wild rabbit is an animal and if the hon. Gentleman has a formula by which he can exclude rabbits from the category of wild animals, he must explain it to the Committee. I am sure that his hon. Friends will listen to him with increasingly attentive rapture.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman must resolve that problem because it is indisputable that rabbits live as wild animals in the countryside. Logically, I am entitled to test the hon. Gentleman's stated principle by substituting the word ``rabbit'', so that the new clause reads, ``The sponsors and supporters of the Bill believe that the hunting and killing of wild rabbits by dogs inflicts unnecessary suffering.'' Either they do or they do not. What explanation will the hon. and his supporters give to a bunch of animal rights demonstrators who object to the hunting of rabbits with dogs? How will they justify the hunting of rabbits for the purpose of pest control while outlawing, with heavy penalties, the hunting of hares even in East Anglia, where hares are so prolific as to be considered by some as an agricultural pest? The British mainland hare population is in the region of 800,000 to 1 million--I see the hon. Member for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson) nodding in agreement.

<P>

<B>Mr. James Gray: </B>(North Wiltshire): My hon. Friend comes to a particularly interesting point with regard to rabbits and hares. Does he agree that when dogs are set on to a piece of ground and set off after a mammal with four legs, it may be some considerable time before one discovers whether that mammal has big ears and is therefore a hare, or a white tail and is therefore a rabbit? Under the new clause, if it subsequently turns out that the dogs have accidentally chased a hare, even though one thought they were chasing a rabbit, one would be guilty of a criminal offence. Is that not a curious anomaly? What if one sets out to chase rabbits, but the dogs chase them on to land where that is not considered legal? If, for example, one went into a neighbour's garden, one would be guilty of a criminal offence. Is not the clause completely out of order?
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I am not sure that it is out of order as we have been allowed to debate it.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am happy to confirm that the clause is not out of order.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> I used the phrase inadvertently.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I know exactly what my hon. Friend meant. He tellingly pointed out one or two of my concerns about the new clause, with which lawyers, magistrates, judges--and juries if it goes to the Crown court--will have to grapple. That is assuming that the Bill becomes an Act. I have no doubt that if the hon. Member for Worcester replies to my concerns, he will have the answers to the questions raised by my hon. Friend the Member for North Wiltshire (Mr. Gray) at his fingertips. He has undoubtedly sweated many a midnight hour to ensure that the drafting of the new clause is as perfect as that of the original Bill. The proposal may have received the assistance of the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, the hon. Member for Knowsley, North and Sefton, East (Mr. Howarth) and of legal draftsmen from the Home Office. I hope that the hon. Member for Worcester will be able to deal with the points rightly raised by my hon. Friend the Member for North Wiltshire.
<P>
The hon. Member for Worcester and his hon. Friends must say why, in the context of vermin control, they consider it cruel, evil and wrong to hunt foxes with hounds, but not cruel, evil and wrong to hunt rats with terriers. However contorted their explanations, which I look forward to hearing, the real reason, which harks back to the demonstration outside St. Stephen's entrance to the Palace of Westminster in November, is that toy companies make fluffy toy foxes that the hon. Gentleman can hold aloft--
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Cawsey </B>(Brigg and Goole): What about Roland Rat? The hon. Gentleman does not know what he is talking about.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> The hon. Gentleman would be hard pushed to emerge from St. Stephen's entrance holding aloft a little cuddly rat, which would not have the anticipated televisual appeal of a cuddly fox. While we are on the subject of cuddliness, I shall give way to my right hon. Friend.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Miss Ann Widdecombe </B>(Maidstone and The Weald): Surely my hon., learned and usual Friend is aware that rats are indeed very cuddly. They are becoming increasingly popular as pets for children. He must have heard of Peter Rabbit; if he visits any toy shop just before Christmas he will find a phethora of cuddly rabbits. His analogy is unfounded; rabbits are cuddly, rats are cuddly, anything can be cuddly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> My right hon. and extremely cuddly Friend is always exactly on the point when discussing children's toys. I listen to her advice with the greatest interest. Although she believes the opposite, the point that she made was in my favour. If, as she correctly suggests, there are cuddly toy foxes, rabbits, rats and so on, why are not she and the hon. Member for Worcester prepared to protect cuddly rabbits and rats as they apparently seek to protect cuddly red foxes?
<P>
New clause 10 suffers from being derived from clause 5 of the original Bill. We must remind the Committee, and the public, that the mere existence of new clause 10 reminds us of the much-lamented but moribund Bill that we debated on Second Reading and at the first few sittings of the Committee. As the hon. Member for Worcester said, the new clause is the descendant of and replacement for parts of old clause 5. The hon. Gentleman mentioned the former clause 5(2)(a), but much good it did him. The new clause is a crude attempt to restrict the hunting of rabbits and rodents to the landowner in person, and possibly to reduce the range of people who might hunt--in case any of them enjoy working with their dogs--and the activities associated with pest control, as if that made any difference to rats and rabbits.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tony Baldry </B>(Banbury): On a point of order, Mr. O'Hara. Discussions between you and members of the Committee should be common to the whole Committee. It is unusual for members of the Committee to have private discussions with the Chairman.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> On the contrary, it is common throughout the proceedings of this and other Committees chaired by me and by other members of the Chairmen's Panel for members of the Committee to seek advice from the Chairman or the Clerk. Because of a point of order, I have not yet been asked for advice.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I do not want to lose another cuddly friend, but I must tell my hon. Friend the Member for Banbury (Mr. Baldry) that during our proceedings, while he was trying to listen to interesting points made by the hon. Member for Worcester and others, I have been to the Chairman for advice which he courteously provided. After receiving the advice, I had to sit down again quickly. I hope that my hon. Friend will now allow me to continue.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department </B>(Mr. George Howarth): The hon. Gentleman is being otiose.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I am not sure what should happen to that intervention.
<P>
New clause 10, which is derived from clause 5, is a crude attempt to restrict hunting rabbits and rodents to the landowner, and to reduce the range of people who might hunt, in case they enjoy it.
<P>
We are considering the rump of the clause, which contains anomalies. It requires a request from the owner or occupier of land to make exempted hunting legal. The new clause states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``. A person does not commit an offence under section (Prohibition of hunting, &c.)(1) if he hunts rabbits or rodents--
<P>
(a) on land which he owns or occupies, or
<P>
(b) partly on land which he owns or occupies and partly on neighbouring land, or
<P>
(c) at the request of the owner or occupier of the land where the hunting takes place.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The hon. Member for Worcester may not appreciate that ownership and occupation of land in this country is not as simple as the new clause implies. Ownership and occupation and the rights, duties and permissions that are attached to a piece of land, are often shared by several individuals and corporate bodies. We discussed that briefly in a previous sitting.
<P>
When a member of the public faces trial as a result of committing an offence under the Bill, the court will have to consider not what happened to the rabbits, but whether the person who made the request was entitled to do so and whether he was the owner or occupier of land. The proponents of the Bill have not grasped that.
<P>
Under the Bill, hunting a rabbit or rodent on common land, in woodlands or a park will remain an offence. The new clause does not tackle that. We have been told endlessly that the Bill deals with animal welfare and so-called cruelty.
<P>
But it is more cruel for a redundant west or south Yorkshire coalminer, who owns a lurcher, to take the dog to a common and set it after a rabbit for the pot, or to take it to a farm that has asked for rabbits to be hunted?
<P>
The hon. Member for Worcester must explain the Bill's limited powers for dealing with predator animals used to hunt rabbits and rodents. Is the hon. Gentleman aware of the popular activity of ferreting? Many Labour supporters who live in the country--or who live in urban areas but visit the countryside--keep ferrets for rabbiting. Perhaps the Bill's supporters have forgotten such activities. They have concentrated only on the concept of hunting on horseback by people wearing red coats.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> Or ferrets or dogs.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I did not know that many people hunted ferrets or dogs on horseback. Doubtless the hon. Gentleman will enlighten me.
<P>
If one's primary concern is animal welfare, and if one believes that it is wrong to hunt animals with dogs, surely it is also wrong to hunt them with ferrets or polecats. With regard to animal welfare, there is no dissimilarity between hunting with dogs and hunting with polecats. If the Bill is meant to spare animals from hunting, what possible justification could there be for arbitrarily restricting the type of hunting that is banned? Perhaps the hon. Member for Worcester simply wanted a neater title for his Bill--Light is finally being thrown on my remarks; I am most grateful--since I earlier discussed the anomaly that is created by the Bill's long title.
<P>
The new clause returns us to a dilemma that has haunted all anti-hunting Bills. My hon. Friend the Member for North Wiltshire touched not so very long ago on the difficulty that people and dogs have distinguishing rabbits from hares at a distance. It is not usually possible, on entering land in order to hunt rabbits, to know whether the land also contains hares. With the exception of the extreme north-west of Scotland--I do not believe that there are any Scottish Members in the Committee--the hare occupies the same territory as the rabbit. If prosecutions result from the Bill's enactment, it will not be possible to say that an area was exclusively rabbit or hare country, or a mixture of the two. It would not often be possible to tell at a distance, when one releases a dog to hunt a partially visible animal, whether one would earn the gratitude of a farmer or six months in prison.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for North Wiltshire briefly explained how to distinguish a rabbit from a hare. According to Professor Stephen Harris' ``Handbook of British Mammals''--the hon. Member for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson) may be familiar with that volume--the hare is distinguished from the rabbit by its large size, its long limbs, its brownish rather than greyish colouration, and its much longer, black-tipped ears.

<P>

<B>Dr. Ian Gibson </B>(Norwich, North): And by its chromosome number.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> Yes, and by its chromosome number--but chromosome numbers are not normally worn on the outside of the animal, for reasons of fashion or for other reasons.
<P>
<B>Dr. Gibson:</B> Yet.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> The hon. Member for Norwich, North appears to have plans in that regard, which he might want to apply to Opposition Members--who knows?
<P>
Furthermore, the hare has a loping gait or leaping stride when running fast, and the tail is held down when running, so that the black dorsal surface is visible. I understand those differences, and I am sure that you do, too, Mr. O'Hara. I am reasonably certain that the hon. Member for Norwich, North understands them and that some other Committee members may do. The problem is that the dog belonging to the hon. Member for Worcester does not understand them, the dogs that the hon. Member for Reading, West discussed--I think that they were Rottweilers or Dobermans--do not understand them, and the pet dogs that are owned by the wider British public may not understand them.
<P>
It is no longer possible--if it ever possible--for the Bill's supporters to claim that I am describing a hypothetical or unlikely situation when I describe the legal jeopardy that a dog handler could face if the new clause were accepted. The first problem is that the dog may be sent after what is believed to be a rabbit, but which turns out to be a hare. Secondly, the dog may be sent after a rabbit, but it may be diverted to chasing a hare. Thirdly, the dog may be sent to flush out rabbits in a field where only rabbits are usually found, but flush out a hare.
<P>
The hon. Member for Worcester and the Bill's supporters have told us time and again that they want the public to know where they stand under the Bill, which was designed to extend the criminal law in a draconian fashion. It is right that the hon. Gentleman should have that ambition, but where do the public stand?
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The proposed defence for hunting now relies on the mens rea--the criminal intent--of the person accused of hunting. That is a big improvement on the Bill as originally drafted and I congratulate the Under-Secretary on his correction of some of the problems in the original Bill. Perhaps we should call him the corrector-general. The legal cogency of the Bill is now better than at its outset. Under the original Bill, we had to consider the mens rea not only of the person who owned or kept the dog, but of the dog.
<P>
The new clause shows how the balance of justice will pivot on an arbitrary interpretation of a suspect's actions. Two people might be filmed. One might want his dog to catch a hare and one might want his dog to catch a rabbit, but the films might be identical from frame to frame. The burden of proof should lie on the prosecution in a criminal trial, but there is no reference to that in new clause 10. What do the supporters of the Bill propose to do about that? How can an active defence be mounted--surely they are as interested in fair prosecution as in fair defence of an alleged offence--and how can a successful prosecution be mounted if it is impossible for the state of mind of the defendant to be inferred from what he said, did or knew at the time when that is invisible to the court? It is highly unlikely that there would be circumstantial evidence to allow the court to reach a successful conclusion and I gave an example earlier. I am sure that members of the Committee can think of other examples. There will certainly be no giveaway evidence, such as the alleged hunter wearing a red coat or blowing a hunting horn. The supporters of the Bill will have to consider that.
<P>
Paragraph (b) would allow the hunting of rabbits and rodents on neighbouring land. The Bill has been plagued by poor drafting--that must be generally agreed because the Home Office had to gallop to the rescue of the hon. Member for Worcester--but those who drafted the new clause seem to have given up on the chance to be specific. We are not told whether paragraph (b) includes common land, woodland, park land, neighbouring land such as the huge acreages of national parks and neighbouring counties, or whether it is land defined simply as the next immediate parcel of land with a distinctive possessory title. That is not defined, but I am sure that the drafter of the clause had in mind that a farmer hunting vermin on his own farm could continue in hot pursuit of the vermin to the farm next door. It is all very well for the drafter of the Bill or the hon. Member for Worcester having visions in their minds, but what is important is the words in the Bill and how they are likely to be interpreted by the court. The rule in Pepper v. Hart, with which my hon. Friend the Member for Banbury will be familiar, is not likely to apply if the Bill is enacted. Would the hon. Member for Worcester care to apply his mind to the judgment in that case?
<P>
<B>Mr. Owen Paterson </B>(North Shropshire): Will my hon. and learned Friend explain the background to that case, which I do not know?
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I was hoping that the hon. Member for Worcester would do so, but I shall give a brief explanation. Pepper v. Hart was a case that ended up in the Judicial Committee of the House of Lords. It was there decided that a court could refer in certain limited circumstances to Hansard to see what a Minister had said during a Bill's progress through the House of Commons or another place, and to decide on the intended meaning of words in the Act. Previously, it had not been permissible to refer to Hansard in court to established what a Minister intended a provision to mean. If the judge, relying only on the wording of the Act, produced an interpretation that ran contrary to the intentions of the Government who prepared the legislation, that was bad luck. The Act would have to be amended to reflect such a different intention. However, I do not think that Pepper v. Hart would apply in the case of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> Those comments were helpful. In the light of what my hon. and learned Friend has told the Committee and our previous deliberations, how does he think a magistrates court would interpret the word ``hunt'' in the second line of new clause 10?
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> It is my earnest hope that no magistrate will ever have to interpret the word ``hunt'' as set out in the Bill, but I imagine that it would be necessary to marry new clause 3, which will become section 1 of an Act, if the hon. Member for Worcester has his way, with new clause 10 and see what emerges.
<P>
Another anomaly is apparent concerning new clause 10. It would make it a criminal offence, possibly warranting six months imprisonment, for a farmer's son to take the initiative to hunt rats on his father's farm while his father was away. However, it would not be an offence for the farmer's neighbour, on his own initiative, to hunt the farmer's rats while he hunted his own. If the Bill's promoters intend to placate farmers, who perhaps have a more serious and mature understanding of the need for vermin control than they do, by preserving their right to hunt vermin effectively with dogs, they should explain why farmers' neighbours, but not their friends, families or farm workers, may react to an outbreak of vermin.
<P>
The Bill's promoters claim to want to let people know where they will stand under the new clause, so they are surely obliged to specify what form of request from a landowner or occupier would be adequate to make a hunting episode legal. Would a general request, without a time limit, be acceptable, so that it would be enough for a landowner to say to someone, ``Come and sort my rat problem out when you have time to spare'', or would such a request have to specify the time and date of each hunt? Under new clause 10(1)(c), would the recollection of the form of words used in a verbal request be admissible as evidence in court? To whom would a request extend? How far could it be diluted or delegated?
<P>
To illustrate the point, I daresay that the Bill's proponents would regard people who follow fox hunts as engaged in hunting, despite the fact they they do not control dogs, which is the job of the huntsmen. Do the Bill's proponents think that someone who follows a man who hunts rats but does not control dogs, is guilty of hunting if he has not had a specific request to do so from the landowner?
<P>
Those anomalies occured to me during my reading of new clause 10 overnight. They require the mature consideration of the Committee and, more to the point, that of the hon. Member for Worcester, before the Bill reaches the statute book. The hon. Gentleman has created a huge raft of problems, not only for himself but for the wider public and the administration of justice. New clause 10, although it is the product of old clauce 5(2)(a), is no improvement.
<P>
I urge the hon. Member for Worcester to think carefully; indeed, I urge him to have a discussion with one of his neighbouring bishops. A number of bishops wrote to The Daily Telegraph today regarding hunting and the hon. Gentleman's proposed ban. Those bishops were: the Bishop of Hereford, the Right Rev. John Oliver, the Bishop of Bath and Wells, the Right Rev. James Thompson, the Bishop of Carlisle, the Right Rev. Ian Harland, the Bishop of St. Edmundsbury and Ipswich, the Right Rev. Richard Lewis, the Bishop of Gloucester, the Right Rev. David Bentley, and the Bishop of Norwich, the Right Rev. Peter Nott. I am sure that the Bishop of Hereford and the Bishop of Gloucester--neither of whom live far from Worcester-- would be available for discussions and would welcome the hon. Gentleman. In their letter, the bishops write that the hon. Gentleman's Bill to ban hunting followed a long debate that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``left a good deal to be desired''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
They refer, of course, to the debate on Second Reading and I must agree with them. New clause 10 is one aspect of the Bill that leaves a great deal to be desired. The letter says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The debate was a long one, but left a good deal to be desired in terms of knowledge and understanding of the issues, and did not reveal much meeting of minds.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Although the Government is not intending to give the Bill parliamentary time in its own right''
<P>
I am sure that the Minister can confirm that from a sedentary position; and I see that he does--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``it has indicated that it wishes to find some means of enacting legislation like that proposed in Mr. Foster's Bill to be enacted.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> Before the November debate, campaigning lobbies were actively involved on both sides, and it was in the nature of the debate that strong opinions were expressed on both sides of the argument.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> We believe that because the proposed legislation would cause far-reaching changes to rural communities, it should be introduced only when the issues have been thoroughly and impartially examined by a formal process of investigation, such as a royal commission or similar form of exhaustive inquiry.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> We are deeply concerned at the possible consequences of the proposed legislation, and we urge the Government to institute a proper investigation of the whole subject of hunting along the lines of the Scott-Henderson inquiry of 1951.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I have no doubt that the hon. Member for Worcester has read the whole of the Scott Henderson inquiry, the evidence it took and the suggestions made in the report. If he will not listen to me--he has not done so in the past, and I do not expect him to change his habits today or on subsequent days when we discuss the Bill--I urge him to listen carefully to the bishops' advice. I especially urge him to bear in mind a call for caution that I can extract from that letter about new clause 10. I hope that I have demonstrated that new clause 10 leaves the Bill in no better shape than it was on 28 November, and certainly in no better shape than it was when we started Committee proceedings--and we all know what has happened to the Bill since then.
<P>
Indeed, since the selection of new clause 10 on the amendment paper a few days ago, I have done my utmost to do justice to the hon. Gentleman's new clause, to discover how it can sit comfortably with the criminal law and whether it fits with the hopes and fears of the huge number of people who will come to London, among other reasons, to protest about the Bill.
<P>
I urge the Committee to think very carefully indeed before allowing new clause 10 to form part of any Act of Parliament, especially one as muddled and defective as that proposed by the hon. Member for Worcester.

<P>

<B>Mr. Baldry:</B> As my hon. and learned Friend said, perhaps the Bill should be referred to as the ``Some Wild Mammals (Hunting with Dogs) New Clauses Bill''. I suspect that very few Bills have received a Second Reading, been considered in Committee and emerged as a stick-and-paste job, consisting almost entirely of new clauses. It is one of the perplexing aspects of the Bill.
<P>
One of the problems with the new clauses is that it is frequently unclear whether they are Government-inspired, and have been drafted by the Home Office, or have been drafted by the Bill's proposer, having listened to arguments from hon. Members who oppose the Bill or from outside the House. The fact that most of the new clauses have come from the Home Office has made it difficult for the hon. Member for Worcester. I suspect that he has not had the benefit of anything other than merely being given a new clause as a fait accompli. He has certainly not had the benefit of notes on clauses, which Ministers would normally have--nor has the Committee. As with new clause 10, we have therefore ended up with a complete muddle.
<P>
The clause also demonstrates some of the inherent contradictions in the Bill. New clause 10 effectively says that it is acceptable to hunt some wild animals, but not others, which takes us back to arguments that we heard on Second Reading about cruelty.
<P>
The Bill's proponents believe that it is unacceptable to hunt some wild animals because they believe that it is cruel. However, on Second Reading or indeed in Committee there has never been an adequate explanation of why it is cruel to hunt certain wild animals in certain ways, but it is not cruel to hunt, for example, fish by angling, or to breed and rear pheasants simply to be shot. We have never had such an explanation. New clause 10 demonstrates the inherent contradictions that manifest themselves when one gets into such a muddle.
<P>
<B>Miss Widdecombe:</B> The two issues are different. With shooting, the intention--although I accept not always the realisation--is to kill outright. There is no question of trying to generate fear beforehand, or of a prolonged chase, during which terror mounts. I said clearly on Second Reading that that was my objection. That remains my objection; the analogy with shooting is simply not founded.
<P>
<B>Mr. Baldry:</B> Is my right hon. Friend arguing that the essential element of cruelty is the chase? People who fish--I do not--chase a fish; they may play a fish on the line for a long time, and it is not an instant kill. It is difficult to draw a distinction between different types of cruelty. Why is it not cruel for a wild mammal or animal to be killed instantly, but it is cruel when it is not?
<P>
Probably because I am a lawyer, my thoughts turn to a magistrates court on a dusty Thursday afternoon, where various lawyers are having to make sense of the Bill in front of a bench of magistrates advised by their clerk--a combination which often leads to extraordinary results. My mind is also on a Christmas eve about three or four years ago. I have never made a secret of the fact that I regularly go beagling with the Christchurch and Farley Hill beagles. Indeed, it is included in my pastimes recorded in ``Who's Who''. On that Christmas eve, we were hunting towards a cut which leads from Stoner to Oxfordshire. Anyone who has used the M40 will know the white cliffs before Oxford--we were hunting just below there. The hounds got into a huge rabbit warren and, because they had an almost infinite supply of rabbits to chase, it was extremely difficult to get them out.
<P>
The curious thing about the new clause is that had we been hunting rabbits, it would have been acceptable to continue, but had we been hunting hare, it would not. How on earth are we to demonstrate to magistrates what we are seeking to hunt? A pack of beagles generally fix on the scent of a hare, but if someone said, in defence, that he was hunting rabbits, how would the prosecution gainsay that? How would it demonstrate beyond any reasonable doubt that the person was after a hare and not a rabbit? The problem highlights the confusion in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Miss Widdecombe:</B> It is not necessary for the hon. Gentleman to give way. His confusion is so obvious that he is obscuring the very argument that I was about to question.
<P>
<B>Mr. Baldry:</B> My right hon. Friend is not a lawyer. I do not mean that in a pejorative sense. I promise her that if the Bill becomes law, many a day will be spent in court while people try to interpret it. The greater the contradictions in the Bill, the greater the number of days will be spent trying properly to interpret it, and the greater the confusion and injustice.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> Is not my hon. Friend's point all the more reinforced by the fact that the penalty clauses--I do not know whether they will be revised--may make a defendant liable for six months' imprisonment for each offence of hunting? Let us take the example of the Christchurch and Farley Hill beagles. If those dogs were to encounter a number of hare, the people involved could face prison sentences of six months, which might be served consecutively. Lawyers acting for those defendants would wish to test to destruction, in the interests of their clients, new clause 10. The point made by my right hon. Friend the Member for Maidstone and The Weald (Miss Widdecombe) may be honest, but it should not distract my hon. Friend the Member for Banbury from purusing his point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Baldry:</B> I have absolutely no doubt that my right hon. Friend the Member for Maidstone and The Weald is always honest, but she is mistaken. Like everyone else, she must appreciate that the Bill will add to the criminal calendar of England and Wales and that it contains serious criminal sanctions. People may come before magistrates with their freedom in jeopardy. Of course matters will be tested fully. The greater the ambiguity in the Bill, therefore, the greater the uncertainty and the subsequent litigation.
<P>
It is extraordinary that the clause makes it permissible to hunt rabbits but not permissible to hunt hares. It will be permissible to hunt rats, but not foxes. I am at a loss to understand why one would need to hunt rats. On new clause 3, we were told that ``hunt'' required no further definition because it has a common or garden meaning. My right hon. Friend the Member for Maidstone and The Weald implied that hunting also involved a chase. I cannot understand why it would be thought necessary to hunt rats. What chase will take place to cause objective observers to believe that rats are being hunted? Whatever the clause intends, it is difficult to see why hunting rats and rabbits is justified when no other mammals can be hunted. I cannot see any justification in law or public policy for that.
<P>
New clause 10 demonstrates that the Bill has no inherent logic. It is based on honourably held prejudices, but they are prejudices none the less. It is not good to base public law on prejudice. The Bill is not about protection; it is about prejudice.
<P>
New clause 10 would make hunting a rabbit lawful on some land and not on other land. That would lead to amazing numbers of cases in the magistrates courts if ever the Bill becomes law. Points have been raised about owners and occupiers. Some landowners occupy considerable amounts of land and would effectively be able to run dogs over large tracts, claiming to be looking for rabbits. How could a prosecution prove that they were looking not for rabbits but hares? Bizarrely, it would be an offence to hunt rabbits or rodents on common land, in woodland or on park land, which is also difficult to justify.
<P>
It can be difficult to distinguish a rabbit from a hare. Does the Bill afford a defence to someone on his or her own land who reasonably considers that his or her dog is seeking or chasing rabbits, not for vermin control but simply for the pot--many rabbits are eaten in different parts of the country--but discovers that the dog has set on a hare? If a farmer goes out to hunt rabbits, but finds that his dogs have set off after a hare, is it an offence if he does not attempt to call them back? Where does the offence begin and where is the mens rea in all this? It will be extremely difficult to explain to farmers that they can chase rabbits with dogs and hunt rats--although we are not sure what they are allowed to hunt rats with--but they cannot hunt anything else.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The new clause then refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``land which he owns or occupies''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We had a long debate about ownership and occupation on new clause 3. New clause 10 takes no notice of the fact that there are rights over land other than ownership or occupation. There are rights under the Law of Property Act 1925. The Minister thought that I was being rather bizarre when I talked about that Act and about continued easements and the rights of lords of the manor and others to have hunting and othe rights over land, but I predict that, if the Bill is enacted, it will not be long before the magistrates' courts start construing deeds going back over many centuries to see what continuing rights exist over land which a lord of the manor would consider that he occupied in the sense that he continued to have certain rights over it.
<P>
We then come to the very bizarre bit of the new clause which reads:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``partly on land which he owns or occupies and partly on neighbouring land''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
When we get into definitions like that, how will it ever by possible to bring a prosecution? A farmer will say, ``I started off hunting rabbits on my land and the dogs chased the rabbits on to a neighbour's land and it was difficult to call them back.''
<P>
Where does the offence begin and end? Does it begin when the dogs leave the farmer's land? Is it sufficient if they are still hunting on the land which adjoins his land? If they cross a bridge or go on to land which does not immediately adjoin his land, notwithstanding that it might be a short way away, is an offence committed? The phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``partly on land which he owns or occupies and partly on neighbouring land''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
is ridiculous.
<P>
We then come to paragraph (c), which reads,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``at the request of the owner or occupier of the land''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That takes me back to new clause 3. The Minister and the proposer of the Bill thought that I was just being obtuse when I tried to probe them on that, but I was not. Under new clause 3 a person commits an offence if he allows or permits hunting to take place on land which he owns or occupies. Here the phrase is,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``at the request of the owner or occupier of the land''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Must that request be in writing? Is the burden of proof on the defendant? What will the test be? Will it be the balance of probability so that the court can be sure that a request was made? Is an oral request sufficient? Must it be a specific request? Must the defendant demonstrate that the landowner asked him to hunt his rabbits on such and such a day or is a once-in-a-lifetime statement sufficient? Is it sufficient if a whole group of farmers tell him that he is welcome to hunt rabbits on their land whenever he wants? What does a defendant have to show to prove that defence? The Bill is silent on the matter. In such a case, the defence might be that an adjoining landowner had invited a farmer to hunt rabbits on 20 February, but that the farmer had been detained because he was drilling seed, or doing some other work, and could not go until 21 February. Would that be an offence?

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> New clause 10(b) states that a person does not commit an offence if he hunts rabbits or rodents
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``partly on land which he owns or occupies and partly on neighbouring land.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Has my hon. Friend the Member for Banbury noticed that? The provision would not help a Welsh farmer, in areas where farm units are small. The hon. Member for Montgomeryshire (Mr. &#214;pik) might wish to comment on that.
<P>
There might be occasions when a person might be lawfully hunting rabbits under new clause 10, and might then equally lawfully move across to his immediate neighbour's land, as set out in subsection (b). However, he might then move to a third field which belongs to yet another farmer--that could easily happen in Wales--but which might not constitute ``neighbouring land'' under the Bill. When does neighbourliness end? Is a person allowed to hunt on their neighbour's neighbour's land along a chain of neighbours, or is the hunting of rabbits lawful only on a person's own land and land which is contiguous to it?
<P>
<B>Mr. Baldry:</B> That was exactly the point that I made earlier.
<P>
I used to own some land in Oxfordshire, which was separated from the adjoining land by the Sor brook. Are pieces of land defined as adjoining if a river separates them? If dogs cross a bridge, is the land considered as adjoining? What would happen if land were under the same ownership, but had different occupiers? In Oxfordshire, huge parishes are owned by New college and Trinity college. Those colleges did very well at the reformation; they mopped up whole villages. It used to be said that it was possible to walk from Oxford to Cambridge entirely on college land. In my constituency, it is certainly possible to walk for considerable distances on land belonging to single colleges.
<P>
The matter is unclear. Farmers will need advice about whether an offence might be committed. The new clause was probably introduced because it was suggested to the Home Office and the hon. Member for Worcester that there would always be some need for pest control. The Bill would make that control difficult, and the new clause was cobbled together to try to deal with the matter. However, the clause is unclear and that makes it likely that there will be a myriad of potential offences.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lembit &#214;pik: </B>(Montgomeryshire): The hon. and learned Member for Harborough (Mr. Garnier) referred to the hundreds of small holdings in Wales, and pointed out how unpredictable the direction of hunts were. What would be the legal position of someone who planned to hunt over a particular 10 acres, but, in pursuit of the pack, ended up far away?
<P>
<B>Mr. Baldry:</B> According to the new clause, it would appear that an offence would be committed if the hunting did not take place on neighbouring land. That is why we need a definition of neighbouring. Does it simply mean adjoining? If so, why is the word ``adjoining'' not used in the clause? Why was the word ``neighbouring'' chosen? I have many neighbours, some of whom are some distance away across the fields. In common parlance, neighbouring means within the vicinity; is that what the new clause means?
<P>
The new clause shows the Bill's moral redundancy more clearly than any other. It is not about protection, but about prejudice. It will create enormous uncertainty and put many people in criminal jeopardy in ways that are difficult to predict.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> During our earlier debates, the effect on the body of the animal being hunted was much discussed by the hon. Member for Norwich, North. Is my hon. Friend aware of university research or a learned paper on the effects of being hunted on rabbits or rodents, as opposed to red deer and other larger mammals?
<P>
<B>Mr. Baldry:</B> No, and I am sure that there is no such research. The Bill's promoters seem to be able to distinguish intellectually between rabbits and rats on the one hand and hares and other mammals on the other. If the new clause were accepted, the Bill would have to be renamed the ``Some Wild Mammals (Hunting with Dogs) Bill''. That shows its inherent contradictions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> I want to add to my hon. Friend's comments by tackling the issue from a slightly different angle. My opposition to the proposal is that it is intellectually unsupportable. It blows a hole through the centre of the Bill by supporting two important principles behind the act of fox hunting.
<P>
We should not be entirely surprised that there is no intellectual rigour in the argument advanced by the Bill's supporters. Throughout the shambles of discussions in Committee, hon. Members who support the Bill have advanced powerful arguments on both sides of the debate, apparently for the intellectual joy of arguing. The hon. Member for Denton and Reddish (Mr. Bennett) expatiated for some time on whether it was possible to hunt red deer using wolves. Various other hon. Members rambled on about assorted proposals that would entirely destroy the main thrust of the Bill. I should not, therefore, be surprised that the clause lacks the intellectual rigour that we would usually expect.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman is intervening.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> No. I am making a speech. Perhaps I should have made it plainer that I am not attempting the world record for interventions, although I may try to do that later.
<P>
The new clause is intellectually unsupportable in the context of the Bill because it accepts two principles that, if the Bill's opponents accepted them, would result in the control of foxes using hounds being continued and the Bill falling. The first principle that the new clause accepts, is that it is necessary to hunt certain types of mammals using dogs.
<P>
The second principle is that the most humane method of dispatching those mammals that the hon. Member for Worcester has found it necessary to hunt using dogs is by killing them using dogs.
<P>
I am delighted that the hon. Member for Worcester has done some research on the first of those principles. During our proceedings, I have been disturbed by the incredible lack of knowledge of the countryside and hunting that the Bill's supporters have shown. Therefore, I am pleased that the hon. Member for Worcester seems to have done some research about the natural habitat of some of the mammals that need to be hunted with dogs. The hon. Gentleman has realised at last that some mammals live in long grass, in impenetrable woodland, and in scrub land with brambles, which human beings cannot penetrate. He has also realised that many mammals are nocturnal and cannot be easily shot or dispatched by means other than flushing them out of the undergrowth with dogs. That is a significant concession.
<P>
When the Bill first received publicity, the hon. Member for Worcester talked about banning the use of dogs altogether because the practice was inhumane, disgraceful and disgusting. He wanted an absolute ban on hunting and on any form of pest control. The new clause acknowledges that it is necessary to flush out some mammals with dogs.
<P>
In passing, Mr. O'Hara, I suspect that sedentary interventions from officials are out of order and they should certainly control their facial expressions.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. If I notice such interventions, they will be deemed out of order.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> Thank you, Mr. O'Hara. I shall bring them to your attention if they happen again.
<P>
The hon. Member for Worcester initially claimed that the Bill would stop the barbaric and cruel practice of hunting mammals with dogs. The new clause acknowledges that many mammals can be hunted only with dogs.
<P>
I invite the hon. Member for Worcester and the Bill's supporters to accompany me to Salisbury plain where I hunt foxes. No territory highlights better than Salisbury plain the impossibility of controlling mammals except by using dogs. The grass there grows up to one's head and it is impossible to walk through it without getting lost. The ground is also full of holes. The only way to track down and flush out mammals is by using dogs. New clause 11 acknowledges that.
<P>
New clause 10 also accepts that the most humane method of dispatching mammals such as rabbits and rats is by using dogs. One of the most curious aspects of our proceedings is the total absence of knowledge among the Bill's supporters about the way in which a pack of hounds dispatches a fox. I hope that I shall be allowed to digress and talk about foxes to highlight the point that the new clause makes.
<P>
We have heard at least two absurdities about the means by which a pack of hounds kills a fox. It is claimed that a pack of hounds catches a fox by the tail and rips it to pieces. We have heard graphic descriptions of that from the Bill's supporters. The hon. Member for Worcester is keen on digging descriptions out of ancient newspapers of 150 or 200 years ago.
<P>
The Bill's supporters consistently claim that a pack of hounds rips a fox to pieces in the most inhumane way, but when we ask them how they know that that happens and whether they have been present when a hunt has caught up with a fox, they reply that they have not. Some of them say, ``We're rather brave. We went out for half an hour with our local pack. We went to the meet and spoke to the master, but to be present at the kill, you've got to gallop across the countryside on a horse.'' Few of the Bill's supporters are outstanding horsemen, I think, although I would be happy to be corrected on that point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Martyn Jones </B>(Clwyd, South): On a point of order, Mr. O'Hara. New clause 10 contains no reference to foxes.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> As the debate has proceeded, a question has arisen about whether a distinction should be drawn between foxes and the rabbits and rodents referred to in the provision. For that reason, I have ruled references to foxes in order, as long as they are comparative and not the main burden of the argument.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> Thank you, Mr. O'Hara. I shall, of course, constantly refer back to the notion of catching rabbits or rodents with dogs, because the thrust of my comments is to show the absurdity of the new clause, given the arguments that have been presented about foxes.
<P>
Hon. Members claim that the normal way in which a hunt kills a fox is by catching it by the tail and ripping it to pieces. They have produced graphic descriptions to inflame the public's emotional support for their case against the sport of fox hunting. When we have asked how they know what happens and whether they have been present, they have readily admitted that they have not been. They were surprised and interested when I said in a recent sitting of the Committee that I had been present many times, because I can ride a horse and I hunt foxes. Perhaps I speak with some knowledge of what happens when a pack of hounds catches up with a fox. I suspect that my opponents speak with great ignorance.
<P>
The second type of evidence presented to demonstrate that hounds rip a fox to pieces when they catch up with it is from post mortems on fox carcases. Those are said to prove it beyond a shadow of a doubt.

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Member is straying down the path that I counselled him against.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> I happily accept your direction back on to the straight and narrow, Mr. O'Hara.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> The new clause would create exemptions from the criminal law, which the hon. Member for Worcester wants to be enacted. I suggest that it is important in discussing an exemption to be told about the provision from which there will be exemptions. Fox hunting will be illegal under the Bill. Rabbit and rodent hunting will not. Does my hon. Friend agree that as long as he keeps his remarks in order and does not annoy the Chairman--an essential aspect of our deliberations--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. It is not a matter of pleasing or annoying the Chairman, but of the Chairman's keeping the debate in order and relevant to the amendment or new clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> Pleasing you, Mr. O'Hara, is not, of course, essential, but it assists.
<P>
I hope that my hon. Friend will bear in mind that in discussing new clause 10 he is dealing with an exemption from a proposed criminal law, which would render the hunting of foxes a crime.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> I am grateful to my hon. and learned Friend. It is nice to have two learned as well as honourable Friends on the Front Bench. That would have benefited those who presented the Bill. A couple of decent Queen's counsels, as opposed to the one they had, would have improved the drafting. The sharp QC's mind of my hon. and learned Friend has focused the argument that I, with my non-QC's mind, was inexpertly attempting to make.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Nor are the qualifications of hon. Members on either side of the Committee relevant to the new clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> If, indeed, under the new clause, the hunting of rabbits and rats will be exempted from the criminal law, the implication is that it is acceptable for rabbits and rats to be killed by hounds. Other provisions in the Bill make it clear that the killing by hounds of foxes and mink--deer are a different case--is not acceptable. That is why it is important, without trespassing on your permission, Mr. O'Hara, to give some slight attention to the reasons why the Bill's promoters believe that the killing of foxes by hounds is a bad thing. If their arguments are correct, the new clause must fall. If the clause is accepted, their arguments on foxes must be incorrect.
<P>
I can explode the arguments on post mortems of carcases that had apparently been ripped to pieces. If the carcases had been ripped to pieces, there could be no post mortem, so that argument has no shred of intellectual support.
<P>
Equally absurd as the argument advanced by the hon. Member for Norwich, North, who is studying his papers. He recounted an ancient history in which foxes were chased to the point of exhaustion, tending to die of exhaustion rather than being eaten by the hounds. He described how 14 fox carcases were found in a drain in Leicestershire--
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> Northamptonshire.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> I apologise for having been so rude about the county in which my hon. and learned Friend's constituency lies. It was, of course, Northamptonshire.
<P>
The hon. Member for Norwich, North read out an ancient report--he likes ancient reports--of finding 14 fox carcases--
<P>
<B>Mrs. Jackie Ballard </B>(Taunton): Thirteen carcases.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> I am happy to confirm the hon. Lady's sedentary correction. It was indeed 13 carcases.
<P>
The hon. Member for Norwich, North got a little muddled when we asked him whether he was making the point that on 13 occasions 13 hunts had arrived at that drain and the fox, having coincidentally not been killed on each occasion, had happened to crawl into the drain to die of exhaustion and exposure. The hon. Gentleman shook his head. He must have argued that one pack was hunting 13 foxes simultaneously, all of which had by chance died of exhaustion at the same place.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman is straying too far from the terms of reference of new clause 10.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> You have been more than kind, Mr. O'Hara, in allowing me to advance my argument. I was pointing out that the new clause has no intellectual rigour.
<P>
The hon. Member for Worcester is hugely mistaken on two counts. Either, as has often been argued, hunting is an inhumane, disgraceful and appalling way to kill any mammal, in which case the new clause must form no part of the Bill, or, if the clause is acceptable, the hon. Gentleman's argument that killing foxes is inhumane, appalling, disgraceful and degrading is shot full of holes.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman must accept that the clause brings his entire argument and Bill into disrepute. He may have decided to include the clause because of pressure from the Minister. Perhaps, the Home Office has decided that it is necessary--[Interruption.] I shall not comment on the extremely unparliamentary language used by the hon. Member for Brigg and Goole; if it had reached your ears, Mr. O'Hara, it would doubtless have resulted in suitable retribution.
<P>
I am not in the least surprised about the lack of intellectual rigour in the new clause. Throughout our discussions, intellectual rigour has been 100 per cent. absent from the arguments of those hon. Members who support the Bill. Supporters of the Bill have consistently avoided arguing passionately their case for the abolition of fox hunting. They have consistently become bogged down ad nauseam in talk on both sides of the argument. They have brought their arguments and our proceedings into disrepute. I call on the hon. Member for Worcester to withdraw his new clause as there is plainly no intellectual support for it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ivor Caplin </B>(Hove): On a point of order, Mr. O'Hara. We have heard a lot about the Committee process. Is not it right and proper to insert new clauses during the Committee stage, as will be done in the House later today on the Government of Wales Bill? That is the point of having a Committee stage.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Yes. I am happy to confirm that it is in order for new clauses to be tabled, selected and debated.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. &#214;pik:</B> As I have said previously, this is one of the most interesting debates that I have been involved in since being elected to Parliament. It strikes at the heart of several philosophical questions. Perhaps I was too well educated at Bristol university in philosophy, but I was taught that if one wants to make an argument hold together it is absolutely essential that one's position has intellectual rigour and that one leaves no space for sloppy thinking. The cost of sloppy thinking in Bristol university may have been a lower degree result, but in relation to the new clause and the introduction of criminal law, the cost is much greater. The new clause underlines the inconsistency in the Bill's construction. It may be clear to the Bill's supporters how the proposals fit together, but it is clear neither to me nor to the many people who will be affected by it.
<P>
I shall discuss three matters and try to explain how the inconsistency arises and what the new clause would do. The three matters are the distinctions that seem to underpin the Bill, on-going inconsistencies about animal rights and problems about legislating in a binary way--stating that something is either right or wrong--when the subject simply does not lend itself to such analysis.
<P>
I, too, am baffled by what drove the hon. Member for Worcester to introduce the Bill. The new clause baffles me because it cuts across many of the criteria that the Bill's supporters used to justify the ban on certain forms of fox hunting. Was the Bill introduced to alleviate suffering of animals in the countryside? The new clause convinces me that that cannot be the key motivation. The animals that are excluded by the new clause--rodents and rabbits--can be hunted in ways that, by direct implication, cause suffering. Was the Bill meant to reduce mental suffering, including, for example, the fear of the chase? The same considerations apply. Unless one states that rabbits are in some way immune to fear, it cannot be consistent to say that rabbits should be excluded from the ban and that foxes should be included in it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> In that context, is my hon. Friend aware of recent scientific research that seemed to question the conclusions of the Bateson report about fear in deer? Professor Bateson said that he was not aware of similar physical conditions in foxes or other rodents.
<P>
<B>Mr. &#214;pik:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes a good point. We have discussed the evidence relating to animals' suffering, and I said previously that statistics prove that fish can feel pain. I shall not go down that route too far, because it deviates too much from the new clause, but I shall return to it to underline an inconsistency that I have observed.
<P>
The fact that rabbits are excluded from the Bill's provisions shows that it was not meant to reduce physical or mental suffering. I am sure that the Bill's supporters do not really believe that rabbits are immune to fear or physical pain-if they did, that would not be logical.
<P>
The third possible reason relates to pest control, assuming that rabbits constitute a danger or pest, but that foxes do not.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cawsey:</B> Is that what they taught you at Bristol?
<P>
<B>Mr. &#214;pik:</B> Would the hon. Gentleman like to intervene? Obviously not. That cannot be the case because all parties have clearly accepted that foxes are a pest and that there is justification for controlling them. The issue is the means of control, not whether they are pests. So the criterion for new clause 10 cannot be simply pest control.
<P>
My fourth question is whether the Bill intends to restore natural processes--a phrase that I have heard used by those who favour the Bill. New clause 10 creates an inconsistency that I am unable to square with the rest of the Bill. Natural processes are a matter of complex definition. Furthermore, if natural processes are so important, and if those who support the Bill claim that natural processes exclude the hunting of foxes with hounds, why are rabbits being excluded from the legislation? Why is an unnatural process acceptable for rabbits but not for foxes?
<P>
That leads me to my fifth speculation; that there is some other motive, which I have missed. If that is the case, I shall happily give way to any hon. Member who can appraise me of that missing motive.

<P>

<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman consider it passing strange that those who support the legislation were content to spend six weeks arguing over the first two lines of the Bill and putting forward arguments that they believed should have come from this side of the Committee, but that today we have heard nothing at all from many of the voluble Members who spent six weeks discussing two lines?
<P>
<B>Mr. &#214;pik:</B> I understand the frustration of the hon. and learned Gentleman. I said at the outset that I was not here to play games and, although it is tempting, I shall not speculate on the reason for the silence of hon. Members who support the Bill.
<P>
To return to my point about new clause 10, I repeat my request for clarification of the Bill's motive, which allows new clause 10 to fit comfortably with everything else that we have discussed. I fear that the silence of the Bill's supporters might suggest that they, too, understand the fundamental philosophical inconsistency of the debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> In contemplating the motivation of the hon. Member for Worcester in proposing the new clause, does the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire agree that it may have nothing to do with the hon. Gentleman's philosophical beliefs on the subject of pest control or the countryside, but is a convoluted Machiavellian procedure, with which those who support the legislation have been fiddling around for six weeks in order to find some way in which the Bill may become law?
<P>
<B>Mr. &#214;pik:</B> I have great respect for the hon. Member for Worcester (Mr. Foster). He is a nice, honourable man and I shall steer clear of accusing him of Machiavellian desires. Nevertheless, as he has listened to our remarks--for example, on flushing--I challenge him to explain something that has bothered me from the start. What is the philosophical justification for allowing fundamentally inconsistent clauses to be included in the Bill? I have sought and failed to find a consistent criterion which allows new clause 10 to sit comfortably with the rest of the Bill--a Bill that was changed beyond recognition from that which we came to the Committee to discuss.
<P>
My second anxiety concerns the implication of new clause 10 on the rights of animals. It has been clearly established in previous debates that a hierarchy exists which allows different rights to different animals. The Committee has established that it is acceptable to kill domestic animals for food and to subject them to the experiences that they must go through in an abattoir, but that different rights accrue to animals in the wild. Although that was established, supporters of the Bill have never explained why that position is philosophically consistent with the Bill. We seem now to be taking another step forward in new clause 10 with different rights for different wild animals, many of which are very similar.
<P>
I would be willing to bet that without my glasses I could not tell the difference between a hare and a rabbit at 50 or 100 yards because I am slightly short-sighted. I believe--I stand to be corrected by the expert biologists among us--that those animals have a similar ancestry. There is not much difference between hares and rabbits, although we have heard some explanations of how to tell them apart. What bothers me is that those near relatives in the evolutionary chain are to be ascribed completely different animal rights. Rabbits may be hunted but hares may not. Again I ask the hon. Member for Worcester or his supporters to explain and to justify how that is consistent. I for one am at a loss to undestand the arbitrary distinction highlighted in new clause 10.--[Interruption.]
<P>
Despite the titter of mirth from hon. Members opposite, I am asking those questions sincerely. The public, as well as members of the Committee, have a right to understand the logic of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that in country constituencies such as his and mine the Bill is desperately serious and that it is not good enough for hon. Members opposite to laugh? People may go to gaol if we do not do a good job in the Committee. We are discussing the nub of the Bill and it is not good enough for the hon. Member for Brigg and Goole to be reading the literature of the League Against Cruel Sports and laughing.
<P>
<B>Mr. &#214;pik:</B> The hon. Gentleman may be laughing at the literature of the League Against Cruel Sports. The alternative explanation, which I presumed, was that he laughed with the realisation of enlightenment that has accrued from listening carefully to my argument. I invite him to cross the Floor and join those of us who have been blessed with that insight.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cawsey:</B> I intervene to say that unlike hon. Members opposite, who are doing their mail, I am reading briefing papers relevant to our discussion. I too represent a large rural constituency without a single registered hunt and my constituents want the Bill to succeed.
<P>
<B>Mr. &#214;pik:</B> While understanding the hon. Gentleman's motive for reading the material before him, I hope that he will do more than just read it. I hope that he will contribute some answers to the questions I am asking. I see his eyes widen in anticipation of the enormity of the task that I propose, but I am optimistic that as one of the regular contributors to the debate he will try to provide answers even if the hon. Member for Worcester does not.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that the previous intervention symbolises the nub of the debate? Hon. Members opposite derive their information from well-meaning but wrong pressure groups. We derive our information from practical experience of living in the country.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cawsey:</B> I am reading Horse and Hound; I do not know what that says about the hon. Gentleman. Nevertheless, if that is what he says, I am happy to take his advice.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind the Committee that the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire has the Floor, so interventions should be directed to him.
<P>
<B>Mr. &#214;pik:</B> Thank you for your guidance, Mr. O'Hara. I have always been willing to allow interventions in the spirit of constructive debate.
<P>
Hon. Members have referred to the League Against Cruel Sports and Horse and Hound. I do not question the motives of such organisations as they are sincere in their beliefs. I therefore do not want to deride such organisations, which, through us, participate by proxy in the debate. I merely want to highlight fundamental inconsistencies in their arguments.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
New clause 10 is a graphic example of those inconsistencies, which have presented themselves to the Committee on various occasions. In respect of the rights of animals, it is entirely inconsistent to construct a three-tier hierarchy in the animal kingdom, consisting of domestic animals with certain rights, certain wild animals with other rights and their close evolutionary relatives with different rights. I implore hon. Members who support the Bill to explain why that makes logical sense, and, moreover, why those inconsistent positions are considered sufficiently robust to enter the books of criminal law.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> The hon. Gentleman has been more than generous in giving way. There is one crucial difference between rabbits, which will be exempt under the clause, and hares, which will not. Hares are hunted by organised packs of hounds. Does that not demonstrate that the Bill has nothing to do with the rights or the welfare of animals, but is concerned with attacking those who choose to hunt animals, irrespective of their rights or other characteristics?
<P>
<B>Mr. &#214;pik:</B> I listed what I believed were the possible motives presented by hon. Members who support the Bill in the two months that we have debated the Bill. I entertain the possibility that those of us who oppose the Bill have missed such a compelling motive and powerful criterion for the Bill that we shall be forced to change our position. If, however, hon. Members who support the Bill cannot justify the inconsistencies thrown up by new clause 10, we are inevitably drawn to speculate that such motives as my hon. Friend has just highlighted could underlie some of the reasoning behind the Bill. In the spirit of fairness, I reserve judgment until I have heard responses to my points from hon. Members who support the Bill.
<P>
Why is it acceptable to permit some pursuits--such as angling--which have no foundation in pest control or in countryside pursuits that are clearly connected with agriculture? I highlight that in the context of new clause 10, because it is all related to the lack of intellectual rigour that underpins so much of what is under discussion.
<P>
It is problematic to attempt to legislate in a right and wrong way on an issue that simply does not lend itself to such analysis. New clause 10 gives rise to hopeless difficulties of principle because of the desire to perceive matters in a binary fashion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> I am not a lawyer, so will my hon. Friend explain the concept of binary?
<P>
<B>Mr &#214;pik:</B> It is a philosophical concept rather than a legal one. Hon. Members in favour of the Bill want to find good and bad in an absolute sense. They do not entertain the possibility that there are shades of grey. [Interruption.] I did not hear that comment, but I am happy to give way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> A disgraceful and frivolous remark was made pertaining to my surname, which is Gray. I am, therefore, one of the shades of gray.
<P>
<B>Mr. &#214;pik:</B> I apologise for holding up the Committee with that intervention, although perhaps I should not pour scorn on an effort to lighten my rather serious contribution.
<P>
We need to reassess the Bill because it has been changed so much. Its binary aspect reflects the assumption that it is possible to legislate in a right and a wrong way without allowing for shades of colour--I hope to avoid causing consternation to my temporary hon. Friend. We have a recipe for disaster because new clause 10 fits in uncomfortably with the rest of the Bill. It would be more sensible to recognise the intent of hon. Members who want to introduce an element of humaneness and responsibility in the management of the countryside, but those hon. Members should not ban something wholesale because they do not like it.
<P>
The hare and rabbit are very similar. Those who support the Bill owe the public an explanation of why the Bill treats the hare and the rabbit in fundamentally different ways. The absence of the definition of hunting is yet another example of the lack of intellectual rigour with which the Bill has been compiled. There was something of a definition before the dramatic and monumental changes to the Bill, but the main definition will now come from precedent set in the law courts. It does not help to say to people who want to make sense of the Bill that hunting will be defined by precedents set in the law courts.
<P>
The new clause will make it more difficult to find a logical definition of hunting. I am not a lawyer, but any self-respecting, reasonable member of the public who is charged with hunting hares will be able to say, in the spirit of natural justice, that he does not understand why he would not be accused of a criminal offence had he hunted rabbits. I implore the hon. Member for Worcester to explain that.
<P>
The arbitrary line is unavoidable. In one debate, I was challenged to say whether I would ban bear baiting. I said that I would ban that and stag hunting with hounds. For me, the arbitrary line falls somewhere between swatting a fly and bear baiting. The difficulty is not that we have to define the arbitrary line but that the arbitrary line shifts in various clauses, which undermines the Bill's credibility. New clause 10 underlines in stark, black-and-white words the fact that the arbitrary line has shifted.
<P>
Slightly aside from the main thrust of my philosophical point is my concern about permission, which was also referred to by the hon. Member for Banbury and the hon. and learned Member for Harborough. It is not clear how much permission an individual must get in order to steer clear of a criminal prosecution. In Montgomeryshire, there are many smallholdings, many of which are in deep trouble at the moment for other reasons. The last thing a smallholder will want to do is to enter into an enormous paper-chase to get written permission from the 50 farms that a hunt may cross in pursuit of its quarry.
<P>
I implore the hon. Member to explain the mechanics of what he expects from smallholders, who did not enter farming to fill in bits of paper on rabbit hunting or anything else. It is not a good piece of legislation if people feel that the expectations that it places on them to do things which they genuinely and sincerely feel are important to their business are inherently unfair.
<P>
The changes that we have discussed in recent weeks have altered the Bill beyond recognition and have sought to change some of the principles in it too. It is not just a question of detail, but of principles. No clause highlights the difficulty of that shift as well as new clause 10, which goes much further than new clause 5 in underlining the concerns that I had from the outset. We are dealing with criminal law. It is not just a philosophical debate. I use that phrase a lot because we must be confident that we are creating a Bill with philosophical and intellectual consistency--which it does not have at the moment.
<P>
The new clause concerns an important exemption and I understand the motive. Questions have been raised about the motive of the Bill as a whole, but I do not question the motive of the new clause. However, I implore the hon. Member for Worcester to explain how it is consistent with everything else that he has proposed. He has shown himself willing to listen. I cite flushing from cover with hounds as an example of an inclusion that he made following emphatic representations.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman should not feel that he must defend himself or make an emotional attack on the Opposition, but he must respond to the points that I and others have made in the spirit of settling so many unanswered questions. He must explain to the Committee and to all who might read Hansard how new clause 10 fits in consistently with the rest of the Bill.

<P>

<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> I rise to speak, Mr. O'Hara.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I had already noted that the hon. Member for Worcester wished to speak when the previous speaker rose.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael J. Foster:</B> On the question of the motive of the Bill, the hon. Member for North Wiltshire hit the nail on the head when he said that the Bill aimed to stop people deriving pleasure from hunting wild mammals. That is the idea.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> On a point of order, Mr. O'Hara. As I did not catch your eye earlier, will I be able to speak after the hon. Member for Worcester?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I cannot say. The hon. Member for Worcester wishes to speak and may do so until one o'clock. We shall have to wait and see.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael J. Foster:</B> In interpreting the new clause, hon. Members should note that it does not state that it is necessary to hunt using dogs, that it is the most humane method, or that hunting can take place only with dogs.
<P>
<B>Mr. &#214;pik</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> Please sit down.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> That was not very nice.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I did say please.
<P>
With regard to the interpretation of the word ``hunt'', it is clear that when people go hare hunting, there is an intent to do so. That was clear in new clause 3, which we have already debated.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> No, I will not.
<P>
It will be for the courts to decide what is neighbouring land. It could be immediately next to a person's land or a little further afield.
<P>
The word ``commission'' managed to sneak into the contribution of the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire, but I cannot find the word anywhere in the new clause. There is the word ``request'', which is slightly different, but it will be for the courts to determine what would be a normal request. I imagine that they would apply the normal interpretation of the word as their test.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way on that point?
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> No.
<P>
Using dogs to control rabbits and other rodents does not involve a long chase, as it does with other wild mammals. That is why so much pleasure is gained in hunting and why people do not organise rat hunts as a sporting spectacle on Boxing day.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way? This is a debate, not a rant.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> No.
<P>
There are about 37 million rabbits in this country, but only 800,000 hares. Hares are officially recognised as a declining, or threatened species. That is why there is a distinct difference between the treatment of a rabbit and of a hare in the proposal.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caplin rose in his place and claimed to move, That the Question be now put.</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> On a point of order, Mr. O'Hara.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I cannot take a point of order while I am putting the question. I shall take it later.
<P>
Question, That the Question be now put, put and agreed to.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> On a point of order, Mr. O'Hara. I merely wanted to draw your attention to something that you already knew. Although you are perfectly within your rights to allow the Question to be put after two and a half hours, on a previous occasion we spent six days debating one clause and only managed to get to the second line of the Bill. Did you notice that minor inconsistency in dealing with the matter, Mr. O'Hara?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> There is no inconsistency. The important difference is that at no point during those deliberations did anyone request a closure.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I am grateful for that explanation, Mr. O'Hara.

(c) of protecting sheep or other livestock, fowl or game birds from attack by wild mammals.

 (2) Subsection (1) applies to a person only if he takes reasonable steps to ensure that the wild mammal is shot as soon as possible after it is located or emerges from cover.

Brought up, and read the First time.
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Michael J. Foster:</B> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss the following: New clause 17--Terrier work--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `--A person does not commit an offence under section (Prohibition of hunting, &c.) (1) if he uses a terrier for the purposes of digging out and shooting a wild mammal for the necessary management and control of the wild mammal or of wild mammals of that species.'.

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `A person shall not be guilty of an offence under this Act if he causes or permits a dog to enter any structure or place, whether subterranean or not, used or likely to be used by a wild mammal for shelter or protection.'.
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Foster:</B> New clause 21, which replaces clause 5(2)(c) of the original Bill, would allow stalking and flushing from cover. Stalking could be interpreted as a form of hunting and that is why it should be exempted. I do not want the stalking of deer to become a criminal offence.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> No. I am sorry.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> No. I am sorry.
<P>
The new clause refers to flushing out, which was also dealt with in the original draft of clause 5, as the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire pointed out. There are certain circumstances in which dogs might be used to flush out wild mammals from cover. One such instance might be when a wild mammal--for example, a deer--is to be dispatched by a person; a second might be to control the numbers of a particular species to protect it from its own population growth--that might also apply to deer; and a third would be to protect sheep and other livestock from potential attack by wild mammals such as foxes. It is important, however, that persons who use a dog for those reasons must ensure that the wild mammal is shot as soon as possible. Flushing out should be done not to enable a long chase, but to allow pests to be controlled more humanely.
<P>
I use the word pest and not vermin, as I can distinguish the difference between the two--unlike some right hon. and hon. Members who oppose the Bill.
<P>
The exemption in new clause 21 does not extend to the use of dogs to flush out wild mammals from underground. Terrier work, as it is practised, will not be allowed to continue. We think that setting a dog down a hole to make the fox bolt out is cruel and unnecessary.
<P>
I urge the Committee to vote in favour of new clause 21, but to oppose new clauses 17 and 8. In previous sittings of the Committee, certain members said that they wanted terrier work to continue. I shall leave the Committee to guess the names of those members. However, on 17 December one hon. Member said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``I shall return to the matter, which is why I am a little reluctant to discuss terrier work in too much detail now.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In a further contribution, the hon. Member said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``I shall bring the details to a future sitting so that the Committee can see them.''--[Official Report, Standing Committee C, 17 December 1997; c. 30.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
On 14 January he said, with regard to terrier work:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``As a matter of interest, I intend to move amendments at a later stage.''--[Official Report, Standing Committee C, 14 January 1998; c. 64.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Last week, amendment No. 39 was proposed by the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire--in case hon. Members had not guessed to whom I was referring. The amendment was withdrawn at the request of the hon. Member, after a note had been passed to me asking
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Will you give me amendment No. 39?''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I will not give amendment No. 39. I am against terrier work.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Ballard:</B> Does my temporary hon. Friend agree that that is consistend with the actions of right hon. and hon. Members who oppose the Bill, who debated a clause for two and a half hours this morning, which they then did not oppose?
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> It is certainly consistent, but also somewhat inconsistent with the statement that they would not play parliamentary games. However, hon. Members must consider their own actions in this matter.
<P>
<B>Hon. Members:</B> Give way.
<P>
<B>Mr. &#214;pik:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way on that point?
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> No.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> On a point of order, Mr. O'Hara. Is it not a convention that if a member of the Committee is named, he has a chance to intervene?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> It is entirely at the discretion of the hon. Member who is speaking whether he accepts interventions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> Thank you, Mr. O'Hara. I referred to previous contributions about terrier work because the relevant amendments were clearly intended to protect farming interests. However, when the time came, the hon. Member concerned declined to proceed. That says something about the opposition to the Bill. It is all words and no real action--and very long words at that.
<P>
I ask the Committee to reject new clauses 17 and 8, which would permit terrier work and associated activities.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I could not resist allowing a smile to cross my lips when the hon. Member for Worcester criticised hon. Members for tabling amendments and not moving them. Outside the Committee, I might say that such a description of the behaviour of my hon. Friend the Member for Montgomeryshire was disingenuous, coming from a very honourable Member of the Committee who, having tabled and spoken to an amendment earlier in our proceedings, voted against it. If we are looking for muddle and confusion we need look no further than the hon. Member for Worcester. Nothing demonstrates better his own tactics in promoting the Bill than his resorting to childish and personal attacks on the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire.
<P>
New clause 21 has been tabled in the name of the hon. Member for Worcester, without any of his hon. Friends, who will no doubt want to explain why that is. It is yet another attempt to replace a defective provision of the Bill. The hon. Gentleman has mentioned clause 5(2)(c) and confessed again the defective nature of the Bill--which he praised so vehemently and in such glad-hearted speeches on Second Reading and earlier in the Committee's deliberations. New clause 21 demonstrates the poverty of the hon. Gentleman's and his hon. Friends' understanding of the Bill's nature and effects. If the hon. Gentleman had taken the time to discover more about routine countryside management and practice, he would not have tabled the new clause. Subsection (1) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``A person does not commit an offence under section (Prohibition of hunting, &c.) (1) if he uses a dog to stalk a wild mammal, or to flush it from cover'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
for the purpose set out. The hon. Gentleman needs to get his head round the things that might happen under the Bill. The exception provided by the new clause would apply to a man or woman using a dog. However, that person might be accompanied by someone else with another dog, engaged in the same permitted activity. The dogs might be owned by one person but in the control of two people. Does the reference in the new clause to using ``a dog'' mean use of one dog on one occasion, or one dog per dog handler? What would happen if someone who owned two dogs took them to the woods, whereupon one dog--without having been told to--began doing something impermissible under the Bill? That would leave the owner or keeper in the difficult position of not knowing whether he was within or without the exception. Would the owner of two spaniels find that, under the Bill, the dogs could not work together in a wood? Many gamekeepers, and others who live in the countryside, own two or three dogs, which often work together. Dogs will encourage each other, and seek out game or other quarry by working together in a wood, a section of undergrowth, or while going through rough country.
<P>
Under the new clause, will flushing out a wild animal by two dogs be exempt from the new offence, but not flushing out by three, four or five dogs? If only one dog is allowed in a wood, let alone a large forest, one is likely to lose track of the dog, and the possibility of flushing out would be remote.

<P>

<B>Mr. Gray:</B> In addition to the inconsistencies that my hon. and learned Friend points out, there is an even greater inconsistency, which he has not yet mentioned. In most areas of deep cover--for example, Salisbury plain--where most mammals are likely to be found, hunting or flushing them out with one or two dogs would be hopelessly inadequate. Only a pack or large number of dogs would be effective in deep cover across wide areas.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I am most grateful for that intervention. I gave up trying to work out what was in the mind of the hon. Member for Worcester long ago. The difficulty increases as the hon. Gentleman produces extraordinary new clauses.
<P>
I do not mean to be offensive, but the hon. Member for Worcester showed a huge lack of courtesy in failing to deal with the points that we made in the earlier debate. He spoke for a few minutes and refused to take interventions. He failed to tackle the arguments against new clause 10. I hope that he will make a better job of responding to arguments against new clause 21, not least the case that I am about to make, which deals with the burden of proof.
<P>
New clause 21 states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``A person does not commit an offence under section . . . if he uses a dog to stalk a wild mammal, or to flush it from cover, for the purpose--''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and several examples follow. Does the burden of proof fall upon the prosecutor or the defendant? What standard of proof is required?
<P>
Another inconsistency that my hon. Friend the Member for Montgomeryshire may care to consider is that the Bill will make it lawful to stalk red deer as long as it is done to obtain food for human consumption. Therefore, each member of the Quantock staghounds could stalk a red deer for human consumption by using a dog. The hon. Gentleman has not explained his views on common purpose or independent purpose. Despite his best endeavours, he may allow red deer hunting to continue in the same way as it does now. If that is the case, I am happy, but I do not think that that is what he intended. Under subsection (1)(b), a person is exempted from criminal penalties if he uses a dog to stalk or flush out a wild animal for the purpose of
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``controlling the number of a particular species in a particular area, in order to safeguard the welfare of that species in that area''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We have already heard arguments about the need to move deer across country rather than allow them to congregate in particular areas, to damage local crops or forestry or to their own detriment. I wonder whether the hon. Member for Worcester or any of his hon. Friends who wish to see an end to deer hunting as we have known it would consider paragraph (b) to permit farmers to hunt as they have always done in Devon and Somerset--to control red deer numbers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> Does my hon. and learned Friend agree that there is a significant deficiency in paragraph (b)? Do the words
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``in order to safeguard the welfare of that species in that area''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
refer to that species in that area and, if so, to the natural prey of that species? Does paragraph (b) allow the hunting of foxes with hounds for the protection of chickens, lambs and piglets in that area, or does it refer to the protection of the foxes themselves? The wording is extremely unclear.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> Judging by his performance in responding to the debate on new clause 10, the hon. Member for Worcester will be able to deal with those points. I hope that he does so with rather more courtesy than he showed on the previous occasion. The issue that my hon. Friend the Member for North Wiltshire raises may be covered by paragraph (c) rather than paragraph (b), although he is right to point out the difficulty of comprehending the intentions behind new clause 21. I hope that the hon. Member for Worcester will find the time to enlighten us on those matters.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> As I am not a lawyer, and not familiar with legal language, I would like to know whether there is any particular significance in the use of the words
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``particular species in a particular area''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Does the phrase ring any legal bells for a clear definition?
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> The whole Bill rings a huge number of alarm bells, but that particular phrase did not ring any legal alarm bells in my mind when I read it. New clause 21 is as shot full of holes as the original Bill, which we discussed on the Floor of the House in November. It is up to the hon. Member for Worcester--who has responsibility for the carriage and conduct of the Bill--to sort the Bill out. He has singularly failed to do so, even with the Home Office's assistance over the past eight weeks. I hope that the House will be given the opportunity to try to put right in a larger forum what the Committee has unfortunately failed to do in a much smaller forum. None the less, we intend that if the Bill becomes law, new clause 21 shall be drafted so that members of the public who are not lawyers--or who are not all lawyers--are able to understand at a glance whether they are committing an offence or acting within the exemption.
<P>
The hon. Member for Worcester failed to deal with the burden and the standard of proof, and to say whether paragraphs (a) or (b) would permit the hunting of red deer, and he has now failed to enlighten the Committee as to whether the hunting of foxes would be permitted under paragraph (c). He touched on that issue briefly, but I hardly think that his explanation was competent. He stressed subsection (2), which requires that exemptions shall apply only if the hunter or individual with a dog
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``takes reasonable steps to ensure that the wild mammal is shot as soon as possible after it is located or emerges from cover.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The word ``reasonable'' is one with which the courts have to come to terms day in, day out--a reasonable man, reasonable steps, and so forth. The farm is not foreign to the law of England. I trust that the hon. Member for Worcester will enlighten us on what he means by it.
<P>
The shooting of the wild mammal must be done
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``as soon as possible after it is located or emerges from cover.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>Cover is delineated by subsection (3), which says that cover
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``does not include cover below ground level.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>I assume that that is intended to prevent putting terriers underground or digging out. However, the Bill does not say clearly whether a form--the hollowed out area in a field where a hare seeks shelter--would fall within the definitions in subsections (2) and (3). Would that constitute cover from which it would be impermissible to pursue a hare?
<P>
Many more points are in need of our attention.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> Does my hon. and learned Friend agree that one of those points is whether a fox or mammal has been properly shot after emerging from deep cover? A drain may be within deep cover. If a fox goes into the drain--into deep cover--then emerges and is shot, would one have to prove that one did not know that there was a drain in the deep cover? Is evacuation from deep cover enough to justify avoidance of prosecution?
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> The Bill and the new clause are shrouded in deep cover. It is impossible to penetrate to the minds of the hon. Member for Worcester and those who drafted the new clause. Were the Bill and the new clause clearer, my hon. Friend would not need to make such interventions. I trust that the hon. Gentleman will, if he replies, cover yet another point.
<P>
<B>Mr. &#214;pik:</B> Will the hon. and learned Gentleman clarify a legal question? How would the law interpret the point raised by the hon. Member for North Wiltshire? Is there some precedent?
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> As with so many of the questions raised, that will fall to a mixed batch of law. The courts will have to deal with questions of law, so it behoves the hon. Member for Worcester and those assisting him to make the law as clear as possible. The factual matrix will vary from case to case but, as the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire and my hon. Friend the Member for North Wiltshire have animadverted, deep cover will raise factual questions for the magistrates courts.
<P>
<B>Mr. George Howarth:</B> Or the prosecutor.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> Indeed. The defendant, too, has as much interest in establishing his innocence under the facts as the prosecutor has in establishing dispassionately the defendant's guilt.
<P>
The Bill seems to be in a continuing process and any reasonable Member of Parliament--there are such people--who studied the Bill in November would be amazed to find that we are dealing with new clause 21 and others. We should urge the hon. Member for Worcester to apply his mind between 1 pm and 4.30 pm so that he can come back and argue against the arguments that we have raised cogently, logically, sensibly and in a way that the wider public can understand.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> A new precedent has been set in the Committee in that the proponent of the Bill is not answering specific questions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cawsey:</B> And you do not vote.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> I am not a lawyer, but my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Harborough understands the law and I ask him to address his legal mind to one question. New clause 21(1) mentions a ``wild mammal'' and paragraph (b) refers to ``a particular species''. Do we understand those to be the same?
