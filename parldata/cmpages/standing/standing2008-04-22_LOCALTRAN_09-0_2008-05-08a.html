						<b class="B">
							<a name="08050848000264"></a>Stephen
Hammond:
						</b> In this part of the Bill, we shall be considering
integrated transport authorities, their new powers, how they might come
into being, several ways in which their powers may be exercised and
restraints on those powers. We shall be looking to probe the Minister
in a number of areas for clarification of exactly how the system will
work. Amendment No. 273 is grouped with four amendments tabled by the
hon. Member for Manchester, Blackley that are not dissimilar to mine.
They would result in a position whereby a new integrated transport
authority can be established only with the consent of the local
authorities that make up the new integrated transport authority, and
that consent could be judged in two ways.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column312" />Column number: 312</div>
					<a name="08050848000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">First, the
elected members of each local authority could agree a resolution. That
would make perfect sense to the elected officials who will serve on the
new ITA. It would be wrong if the Secretary of State decided that
several local authorities would benefit from being amalgamated into an
integrated transport authority, but the elected people&#151;those
sitting on the bodies&#151;disagreed. Each and every local authority
should agree an affirmative resolution before they are made part of an
integrated transport
authority.</div>
					<a name="08050848000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
I understand the hon. Gentleman&#146;s amendments correctly,
amendment No. 10 states that an ITA would not be created if all the
constituent councils pass a resolution opposing it. It is slightly
different from my amendment, but it is motivated by the same concerns.
Under amendment No. 12, an ITA cannot be created even if a majority of
councils oppose it, which again is similarly motivated. The second way
in which each local area must approve the creation of an integrated
transport authority is through a referendum, which is echoed by
amendment No. 13. The proposal is motivated by the simple factor that
local people are hugely concerned with local transport in their areas
and they should, or could, be given a direct say in how their local
transport is managed. I look forward to the Minister&#146;s agreeing
to establish democratic consent for an integrated transport
authority.</div>
					<a name="08050848000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="08050848000265"></a>
							<b class="B">Graham
Stringer</b> (Manchester, Blackley) (Lab): I will not repeat
what the hon. Gentleman has said. I tabled four amendments to elucidate
the Government&#146;s thinking about the changes in the local
democratic process brought about by the Bill. I support the motivation
behind the Bill, which is to improve integrated transport in an area.
However, I tabled the amendments because I am worried that, with that
drive, the integrated transport authority does not run roughshod over
the electors or the local authorities in its area. There is the
potential for transfer of real highway authority powers to a body that
will not be directly elected and if a local authority is to lose those
powers, it should have some say in that matter. Three of the amendments
provide that a local authority should have a veto, that it should not
lose those powers if it does not want to, or that there should be the
agreement of a majority of or all the authorities. The amendments aim
to probe the Government&#146;s
thinking.</div>
					<a name="08050848000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B"></b>The
final amendment addresses the change that removes power from the
electorate. At the moment, if the electorate want to dispute a bus lane
or if shopkeepers want to ask for better parking, they can do so, or
they can vote out the people responsible for such things. If those
powers are transferred to an integrated transport authority, the
electorate will no longer have a direct power to vote out the people
making the decisions. The final amendment provides that if those powers
are to be changed, it should be done after a referendum. Really, I am
speaking to the amendments to probe the Government&#146;s thinking on
the relationship between improving public transport, which I think we
all want to do, and the democratic
process.</div>

							<a name="08050848000266"></a>The
Minister of State, Department for Transport (Ms Rosie
Winterton):
						</b> It might help if I explain a little bit of the
background to setting up a new integrated transport authority. As
clause 73 makes clear, the Secretary of State can make an order
establishing a new integrated 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column313" />Column number: 313</div>transport authority and an integrated transport area where the local
authorities in that area have carried out a review of existing
governance arrangements in their area and have published a scheme
proposing that an ITA be set
up.</div>
					<a name="08050848000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">Where
a new ITA is to be established, it can usually cover only those
geographical areas included in the proposals for a new ITA made by two
or more local authorities&#151;county councils, metropolitan district
councils and unitary councils. The authorities themselves, having
decided that they want a new ITA, would carry out a review of the
governance for transport in their area and put it to the Secretary of
State. It is very much a bottom-up
approach.</div>
					<a name="08050848000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="08050848000267"></a>
							<b class="B">Norman
Baker</b> (Lewes) (LD): Could the Minister help us by
explaining what the situation would be in a city council area that is
to go ahead with an ITA where there are, say, five other councils
surrounding the city council in a kind of doughnut arrangement? If
three or four of those councils wanted to go ahead and one did not,
would that one effectively have the opportunity to scupper the scheme,
which would become unviable if it did not
participate?</div>
					<a name="08050848000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08050848000268"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> Councils would not have the right to veto
schemes. We would look for evidence that there had been thorough
consultation and that the proposed changes would improve transport in
the area. What we found during the consultation was that many
authorities said that they found it difficult, for example, to
introduce bus lanes, because one particular area might say, &#147;We
do not want to
play.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08050848000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
it is obvious that public transport requirements cannot be met, we
would want a thorough review of the governance procedures. The only
exception to the bottom-up approach would be where the Secretary of
State had actually directed authorities not only to undertake a review
of all or part of their area, but also to prepare and publish a scheme
for the establishment of a new ITA in that area or part of an area.
However, we think that would be quite rare. It would have to be very
obvious that the provision of transport in the area had
failed.</div>
					<a name="08050848000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">By and large,
we expect that local authorities would say that they wanted to improve
public or integrated transport in their area and would, therefore, want
to carry out their own review and come forward with proposals to the
Secretary of State. Furthermore, there is the procedural safeguard in
the Bill of consulting representatives of appropriate authorities and
the fact that any governance order would be subject to affirmative
resolution in the House.</div>
					<a name="08050848000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">With the
safeguards in the Bill and that explanation of how we believe that this
would happen, I do not feel that we should be requiring a local
referendum when establishing a new ITA. The approach we have taken is
the correct one. It is very much a bottom-up approach to improving
integrated transport in the area, so I ask my hon. Friend the Member
for Manchester, Blackley and the hon. Member for Wimbledon not to press
their
amendments.</div>
					<a name="08050848000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08050848000269"></a>Norman
Baker:
						</b> Like the hon. Member for Manchester, Blackley and
others in the Committee, I am in favour of the construction of ITAs and
believe that they will deliver benefits to public transport users in
the communities 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column314" />Column number: 314</div>they serve. However, there is a need to balance the creation of a more
streamlined arrangement with the democratic views of people in the area
concerned.</div>
					<a name="08050848000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">The parallel
in my mind, to which we might return later, is the issue of congestion
charging and road charging in Manchester, in which a number of local
authorities wish to participate and a number do not. There has been an
interesting debate as to whether or not the majority can outweigh the
minority on the imposition of such a scheme should they wish to do so.
The question that applies in that case, and in the provisions we are
discussing, is whether, for the greater good, the views of a particular
area can be overridden to deliver a comprehensive and sensible scheme,
or whether authorities can have a veto.</div>
					<a name="08050848000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
says authorities do not have a veto. I understand that they do not have
a veto in the formal sense of being able to stop the scheme. However,
if there is a key geographical component that must be included to make
an ITA work, because of the transport arrangements&#151;the transport
corridors&#151;and if the implementation of the scheme would be
scuppered by the area not participating, the issue is whether it is
right in those circumstances to compel that area to be part of an ITA,
whether or not its local elected councillors wanted to participate. The
other side of the argument is whether if individuals asserted their
right for the local communities not to participate, they would be
thwarting the weight of other democratically elected councillors in
other areas who want a comprehensive scheme. There is a
balance.</div>
					<a name="08050848000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have looked
at the four alternatives proposed by the hon. Member for Manchester,
Blackley. There is not quite one that I would ideally like to vote for.
I would not vote for the proposal that there has to be a simple
majority&#151;that is a dangerous arrangement&#151;nor is it right
that one authority should be able to thwart the implementation of the
scheme. There needs to be a higher threshold than one, but less than a
majority, whereby perhaps a third of local authorities would need to be
opposed to a scheme to exercise an effective veto on
it.</div>
					<a name="08050848000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08050848000270"></a>Stephen
Hammond:
						</b> Is the hon. Gentleman suggesting that if the
proposal were structured in such a way that it required say, two-thirds
consent, that is what he is looking for in terms of the consent for
procedures?</div>
				
					<a name="08050848000236"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.15

					<a name="08050848000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08050848000271"></a>Norman
Baker:
						</b> There is no perfect answer to this, but that is
roughly where I am.</div>
					<a name="08050848000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
talks about reserve powers whereby a scheme may be imposed, if
necessary. It is probably necessary to have those powers for the
reasons I have given, so it is important that we fully understand
exactly when those powers will be exercised and what opportunities
local councils and individuals will have to make their views known. I
am uncomfortable with the idea that the views of local areas may be
overridden for the greater good, particularly if there is no public
referendum or other expression of
support.</div>
					<a name="08050848000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
referendum may seem over the top, but on the other hand town and parish
councils, or town areas, are given the opportunity to have a referendum
on all sorts of stuff. We had a referendum in Lewes about three or 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column315" />Column number: 315</div>four years ago on a not terribly important matter because the local
authority powers allowed that to occur. Local referendums are already
established as a concept and are exercised by communities up and down
the
country.</div>
					<a name="08050848000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
we are to have a referendum, the question is whether it will work on
the basis of a simple majority across the proposed ITA area, or whether
there will be a referendum in each particular constituent authority,
which will also provide a veto. If we have a referendum only on the
whole area, that will be no different from having the constituent local
authorities. On the other hand, if we have a referendum only in one
area, we will have the same problem with the veto that I referred to a
moment ago. There is no simple solution to the problem, but it is an
important matter to get right from day one. Otherwise, there will be a
danger of having complaints further down the line about lack of
democracy.</div>

Stringer:
						</b> The amendment tries to deal with the problem we
have just discussed, but from the other end. The reason we do not have
integrated transport authorities goes back to the abolition of the
metropolitan counties in the mid-1980s. What the Bill is trying to do,
in many ways imperfectly, is put right some of the problems created by
the deregulation of buses and the democratic deficit left by the
abolition of the met counties.</div>
					<a name="08050848000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">I listened
carefully to my right hon. Friend&#146;s reply on the previous
amendment, dealing with how to create ITAs. I believe that, although it
is not her intention, it will be possible on controversial issues to
repress the strongly held wishes of both the electorate and councils in
those policy areas. This is about more than bus lanes&#151;there are
good and bad bus lanes and not all proposed bus lanes are right, but at
the heart of the debate in Greater Manchester, as the hon. Member for
Lewes said in the previous debate, is a new tax for going into the
centre of
Manchester.</div>
					<a name="08050848000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is proposed that, before that happens, Bolton council will hold its own
referendums. That council is under no overall control, but its elected
representatives feel so strongly that this is a difficult issue that
they will put it to their own people. Bury&#151;now a Conservative
controlled authority&#151;motivated by concern about this new tax,
has sufficient signatures to trigger a ballot to decide whether to have
an elected mayor. There is no doubt that behind that is dissatisfaction
with the position previously taken on the congestion
charge.</div>
					<a name="08050848000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
was not totally satisfied&#151;I think we shall return to this issue
on Report&#151;with all the parliamentary mechanisms that involve the
local electorate, but there is another way of dealing with it, which
used to be there and is now here in London, whereby direct elections
are allowed. I have not yet heard the argument&#151;if one is going
to create these powerful ITAs&#151;in favour of secondarily elected
members rather than directly elected
ones.</div>
					<a name="08050848000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
opposed very strongly the abolition of the metropolitan county
councils, but there is an opportunity now to ensure that&#151;in the
best possible way, which is by having direct elections&#151;if the
electorate do not like the transport schemes, the bus lanes or the new
taxes, they can throw the rascals
out.</div>
					<a name="08050848000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government need to give a serious response to this probing amendment
and explain why it is not currently their view that we should have
direct elections. There are three issues: how to get to an ITA while
consulting the people&#151;I worry about the consultation process and
the repression of electorates and councils; having direct elections;
and, finally, the parliamentary process, which we will come to later.
For what is a local government reorganisation, having one affirmative
resolution as the procedure is not good enough.</div>

at which end of the process the matter is tackled from, but there is
insufficient balance between the generally good idea of having ITAs and
the democratic process, either in this place or with the electorate or

Baker:
						</b> I rise to speak to amendment No. 238,
which relates to another clause but is tangential to the points just
made. It is very important that the ITAs are as democratic and
accountable as possible. It concerns me that we might have individuals
on ITAs who are not elected, but appointed, and exercising perhaps
disproportionate power. It is possible for an ITA&#151;theoretically,
at least&#151;to have members appointed who are sympathetic to its
views, in order perhaps to thwart the result of a forthcoming election,
which may change the political balance in any particular
area.</div>
					<a name="08050848000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
that reason, my amendment No. 238 suggests that, while there should be
no restriction on those who are added to an ITA who may have relevant
experience, the only people who should exercise votes are those who are
elected members of the ITA&#146;s constituent councils. The vote
should not be extended to those who are simply
appointed.</div>

consultation the and establishment of ITAs and about the need to ensure
democratic accountability and proper democratic representation on these
bodies.</div>
					<a name="08050848000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will not repeat what the hon. Gentleman said about the possibility of
having separate elections. Although we have them in London, as he said,
those people fulfil more than a function of the authority of the ITA.
My amendments Nos. 275 and 288 go to the same point, but through a
different way. They would ensure that an ITA reflected the political
make-up of the underlying councils. Again, that would protect the
public&#146;s wish to see proper accountability and
representation.</div>
					<a name="08050848000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments would also offer protection in that a political party, of
whatever hue, with a slim majority on a local authority could appoint
only its members to an ITA. Ensuring that there is political
proportionality in the representation on the body would protect the
views of the electorate in an area and, indeed, views
overall.</div>

Hammond:
						</b> Potentially, but I am not absolutely certain.
What we have is local people voting for their councillors; it is an
open and democratic process. This time last week, all of us were
heavily involved in that process in various parts of the country. In
areas where there is no ITA, local people elect their councillors, who
go on to implement local policy such as that on transport authorities.
Therefore, in ITA areas that process, or something similar to it, is
preserved. My amendments would achieve that by ensuring that the
members of the ITA who make and implement the transport policy were
drawn from a pool of locally elected councillors. I question the need
for direct elections, although I understand that that process would
have even greater direct linkage.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column318" />Column number: 318</div>
					<a name="08050848000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have a
process whereby elected officials can sit in a democratically
accountable way on an ITA, but unless the ITA reflects the political
proportionality, democratic representation and democratic consent are
removed. The issue boils down to democratic
accountability.</div>
					<a name="08050848000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having
seen the range of amendments on the issue, the Minister will be aware
of the concerns among members of the Committee. I look to her for
reassurance, but I give notice that if I do not feel that she has
reassured us, I shall push amendment No. 275 to a

Winterton:
						</b> It is important that ITAs are properly
accountable to local people. Clause 73(8) requires a majority of the
members of each new ITA to be elected representatives from the councils
that make up the ITA area.</div>
					<a name="08050848000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
authorities were carrying out a governance review in their area, they
could propose that all members of the ITA should be local authority
representatives, if that is what they desire. I know from discussions
that I have had around the country that some people in some areas with
existing passenger transport executives&#151;which, by the way
already work under a system of, in a sense, indirect
representation&#151;might want to have a passenger representative
sitting on the transport authority. Through the Bill, we are trying to
give that flexibility, but also to say that the majority must be
elected members.</div>
					<a name="08050848000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">In terms of
political balance, existing PTAs are already subject to section 15 of
the Local Government and Housing Act 1989, which requires that the
political balance of the local authority representatives who sit on a
PTA reflect the political balance of the constituent councils, which
make up the passenger transport area. Any governance order establishing
a new ITA could apply section 15 to the
ITAs.</div>

					<a name="08050848000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">There has
perhaps been some expression of feeling that each transport authority
should be represented on the ITA. I am prepared to look at whether we
might require that in the Bill. I am happy to consider the issue and
perhaps return to it on Report. Overall, however, I feel that the
current provision allows for that democratic representation and for the
majority of members to be democratically elected people from
constituent councils. Therefore, I feel that the amendments are
unnecessary.</div>

to have 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column319" />Column number: 319</div>voting rights. However, we are clear that the majority must be
democratically elected councillors from the constituent councils. If
local authorities suggest in the governance order that they want to

Stringer:
						</b> I am listening to the Minister&#146;s
comments. In local government there is a lot of experience of having
co-opted or non-elected members on police authorities and education
committees and, in the past, on social services committees. How can
political balance be maintained if the ITA has non-elected members who
may well have political allegiances, but those have not been put to the
test with the electorate? That has been the experience of police
authorities: magistrates have had political allegiances and have
changed the political balance on those
bodies.</div>

							<a name="08050848000286"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> The people drawing up the governance order may
wish to maintain political balance under section 15 of the 1989 Act,
but again that is up to individual authorities to decide. They may
decide that they want to co-opt other people on to the authority, and
they may say in their governance order that they want a political
balance in those co-opted members. There are ways to achieve that
through the public appointments process, as I know well from the
national health service. However, we want that flexibility so that
local authorities considering governance in their area can decide for
themselves the best approach.</div>

						</b> I am sorry to press the point, but it is important.
Let us suppose that one party has a slim majority over another on the
ITA but believes, because of the national situation or whatever, that
it will lose support at the next local elections, thus changing the
political balance on the ITA. What in the Minister&#146;s
arrangements would prevent the ITA from appointing a large number of
co-opted members who are, in effect, party stooges, to thwart the
wishes of the electorate at the forthcoming local
elections?</div>

Winterton:
						</b> Obviously, there are PTAs where political
balance may change&#151;I think we have that in our own area, in
South Yorkshire. It comes back to the drawing up of the governance
order in the first place. I am sure that there would be discussions
during the drawing up of a governance order, because the process is
that the local authorities concerned decide how they feel governance
could best be improved. The proposal goes to the Secretary of State and
then to Parliament for a decision under the affirmative resolution
procedure. I am sure that if, during that process, it was felt that
there was an attempt to try to skew things for the future, that would
be reflected in the debates in the House. It is not necessarily always
possible to prevent some of the problems that we are discussing. It may
be that, as a result of that, those coming forward with governance
orders might not want co-opted members to have voting rights, for
example, although they might wish them to sit on the authority. Our aim
is to achieve what people feel is the best approach for their own
area.</div>

							<b class="B">Mr.
Clive Betts</b> (Sheffield, Attercliffe) (Lab): To pick up the
point that the hon. Member for Lewes made, the police authority is in
some ways a model for how things should work, or how they could work
badly, for an integrated transport authority. The elected members from
the various constituent councils are put on the police authority in
proportion to the political balance of those councils. That balance
changes after an election, and the council will then review membership.
However, the so-called independent members of police authorities are
elected for a period of time and could, therefore, alter the political
balance of that authority, irrespective of what happens at local
elections for constituent councils. Therefore, if an ITA co-opted
members, stuffing it full of members of one political party, that could
negate the effects of elections in the constituent councils in coming
years.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08050848000290"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> What we have done with safeguards in the Bill
is to say that the majority should be elected members. It is difficult
to anticipate further down the line. We have to accept, as
democratically elected people, that sometimes the political balances,
even on existing PTAs, may change. We have to accept that. We cannot
get away from that, nor should we necessarily want to. However, section
15 of the 1989 Act requires appointments to be reviewed as soon as
practicable after any occasion on which changes in political balance
occur. There are some safeguards, which emphasise the importance of the
democratically elected side, saying, in a sense, that if the political
balance changes within councils, then that should be reflected at
integrated transport authority level.</div>
					<a name="08050848000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are, of
course, no easy answers. My hon. Friend the Member for Manchester,
Blackley believes that there should be direct elections to all the
authorities, but we do not think that that is appropriate. We are
trying to devolve decision making to local level and to enable local
authorities to decide what is best in their area. There is no
requirement for authorities to co-opt if they do not want to, nor is
there a requirement to give co-opted members voting rights. The only
requirement is that the majority should be elected members. I hope that
with that reassurance my hon. Friend will withdraw his
amendment.</div>

Stringer:
						</b> I am not particularly wedded to any of the
remedies proposed here or in later amendments, be they referendums,
which I am normally sceptical about, or direct elections, which create
two tiers&#151;there are real problems with that. I am not against
having co-opted or appointed members on those bodies. What I am
concerned about is that, throughout the Bill, the balance between the
electorate, constituent councils and the need to make really quite
difficult decisions is not correct. I hope my right hon. Friend will
reflect on that, particularly when we come to consider the
parliamentary process
later.</div>
					<a name="08050848000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
was also concerned by the answers to these problems of political
balance. If four or five parties are represented on a council, it would
be difficult to reflect that if there were only one or two elected
representatives on an 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column321" />Column number: 321</div>authority. It may actually be quite difficult to ensure that
representation is proportionate.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08050848000293"></a>Stephen
Hammond:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman is, of course, exactly right
that there may not be absolute proportionality, but there are, as we
both know, accepted proportionality rules already in place for
appointments of councillors to outside bodies, and those rules could
apply equally well to ITAs.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08050848000294"></a>Graham
Stringer:
						</b> I accept that point and I think that those rules
should apply to ITAs. I was really making another point&#151;that
even in that system, for instance, 10 per cent. of every council in an
area such as Greater Manchester could agree that it would never get
representation on the overall body because that is how it works. So it
may end up with some unfairness within the system that is difficult to
see how to correct. I think that should be looked at.</div>
					<a name="08050848000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
concerned that, once a structure has been set up that allows appointed
members, they could change that political balance. I hope my right hon.
Friend will look seriously at this. There is the possibility, as my
hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Attercliffe said, of an outgoing
administration trying to load the authority, which would be
reprehensible. I suspect we would quickly pass primary legislation to
stop it, if that happened, whichever political party was responsible.
Politicians are in the business we are in to win power, and these
things happen&#151;I have seen it happen.</div>
					<a name="08050848000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
rather than the stooges of the Labour party, the Conservative party or
the Liberal Democrats being appointed to ITAs, it is much more likely
that &#147;experts&#148; will be appointed, on the model of
Transport for London. Those experts, as we discussed on the first day
in Committee, may well have very strong views about the levels of bus
fares and taxation, on the congestion charge, and on the level of
investment, and it seems to me that that could change the balance. It
seems wrong to me&#151;I would be grateful if my right hon. Friend
could reply to this, or cogitate on it&#151;for those appointed
members to be able to vote on the levels of taxation, congestion charge
and bus fares, which they would have the power to do in quality
partnerships and quality contracts, and the level of investment. All
those issues have direct consequences for council tax payer&#151;and
income tax payers for that matter, given where most of the money comes
from. Overall, the balance of packages to make the good measures in the
Bill work, is wrong, and I hope my right hon. Friend will think hard on
that before
Report.</div>

					<div class="hs_AmendmentLevel2">&#145;(aa) the Public

					<a name="08050848000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">Consultation
is a recurring theme in my amendments. It seems to me that there is
real inconsistency throughout the Bill when it comes to consultation.
In some areas, the Government have produced a relatively long and
complete list of people who should be consulted. In other areas, the
list is extremely short and we have the catch-all phrase, &#147;as
the Secretary of State sees fit&#148;. This clause falls into the
second category.</div>
					<a name="08050848000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">The creation
of an integrated transport authority is an extremely important move. We
have all agreed that it could present some laudable benefits for the
local area. It will have a wide-ranging effect on the provision of
local public transport and thus on the everyday lives of thousands. As
for whom the Secretary of State is obliged to consult, it strikes me
that</div>
					<a name="08050848000232"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;such
representative of the appropriate
authorities&#148;</div>
					<a name="08050848000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">as
she sees fit is again extraordinarily loose wording. I think that
representatives of some organisations should 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column323" />Column number: 323</div>be statutory consultees, which is why my amendment would insert into the
clause the Public Transport Users Committee for England and the Rail
Passengers Council. It is only fair that the users of public transport
should also be
consulted.</div>
					<a name="08050848000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those
two organisations were set up specifically to represent the views of
users, and they are ideally placed to provide useful, sensible and
constructive input into the decision-making process. I accept that the
amendment would put a further obligation on the Secretary of State to
consult not only local government, but the new Public Transport Users
Committee for England&#151;which will become Passenger
Focus&#151;and the Rail Passengers Council, but the burden would not
be particularly onerous. It would not be a problem for her. The
amendment is uncontroversial. It is utterly sensible and I am sure that
the Minister will agree with
me.</div>

his campaign for consultation. Obviously, passenger representative
bodies have a valid interest in the setting up of the new ITAs, but as
I explained, the problem with specifying individual bodies in
legislation is that naturally many other important organisations will
consider that they, too, should have been
included.</div>

Hammond:
						</b> This large group of amendments deals with the
reason why an integrated transport authority might be created, why the
boundaries of an existing one may be changed, changed, and why review
of existing arrangements might be carried out. Currently, such a move
must satisfy two criteria: first, it would improve the exercise of
statutory functions relating to transport in the area; and, secondly,
it would improve its effectiveness and efficiency. There is no dispute
about that; they are important criteria and I support them. However,
one criterion is missing.</div>
					<a name="08050848000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">Local
authorities have a responsibility to provide transport and other
services to local people cost-effectively. Local people will be paying
for those local services and the idea behind the amendments is a
variation on a theme, perhaps not surprisingly. The amendments provide
that when deciding whether to change the structure of local transport
governance, due consideration must be given to the ability to provide
local transport in a cost-effective manner. My plea is simple. Can the
Minister reassure us that the cost implications of provision will be
part of the decision-making process of the establishment of the ITA?
When creating an integrated transport authority, the burden of cost
should be a factor of consideration.</div>

of State is able to issue statutory guidance which will set out the
matters which could and should be the subjects of a review and which
authorities will need to take into account. I reassure the hon.
Gentleman that cost-effectiveness will also be one of the series of

happen if there were, for example, indications that the delivery of
transport in an area was failing and that governance issues meant that
what the local authority might be trying to achieve through its local
transport plans was not happening. I am thinking of when there might be

Stringer:
						</b> The purpose of the amendment is to probe the
Government&#146;s thinking on reviews and how vexatious reviews are
stopped. In an ideal world, one council calling for a review might be
completely sensible, but as we have discussed previously,
occasionally&#151;more than occasionally
sometimes&#151;relationships between councils and bodies can become
very bad. There could be a vexatious review with a lot of associated
costs.</div>
					<a name="08050848000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
provides that two councils need to co-operate and agree before a review
can take place, and that the review must include the ITA. If
relationships were very poor there could be a situation where a local
authority employed a group of consultants at large cost, held a review
and did not consult and involve the integrated transport authority. I
want the Minister to reassure the Committee that such a situation could
not happen, but the amendments are to probe the Minister&#146;s
thinking on how vexatious reviews would be
stopped.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08050848000329"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> As I have said before, the approach we have
taken in the Bill is that there should be flexibility in undertaking a
review. For a new ITA area the Bill says that any review would need to
be undertaken by two or more authorities; obviously it would be a bit
silly for an authority to carry out a review of itself.</div>
					<a name="08050848000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">In existing
ITA areas, however, the Bill says that any review would need to be
undertaken by one or more authorities. That is because authorities in
an existing ITA area might wish the ITA itself to carry out the review,
so it would be possible for that to be the one body that was
undertaking the review. Where a review is vexatious and does not have
the support of other authorities in the area, it is unlikely that a
Secretary of State would bring forward a governance order.</div>

that sometimes it may not be possible.</div>

reassure my hon. Friend by saying that there are safeguards to protect
the interests of individual authorities. The Secretary of State will
want to take into account the views of affected authorities in deciding
whether to make the necessary secondary legislation to implement the
proposals for change that areas bring forward. Indeed, the Bill
requires her to consult them on any draft order that she introduces.
She would also have to be satisfied that the order is likely to improve
the exercise of statutory transport functions or the effectiveness and
efficiency of transport within the area concerned. Moreover, in making
an order, the Secretary of State must have regard to the need to
reflect the identities and interests of local communities. We are
trying to strike a balance between flexibility and ensuring there are
safeguards for individual local
authorities.</div>

Hammond:
						</b> Clause 78 provides that the Secretary of State
may by order make provisions about the constitutional arrangements of
ITAs, and we have been exploring some of those aspects. It also allows
her to make provisions regarding executive arrangements and their
functions. With the amendments, I seek some clarity about the role of
the executive and the orders the Secretary of State might anticipate
making in relation to the executive. Passenger transport areas already
have passenger transport executives, which have their own set of
statutory powers in part II of the Transport Act 1968. However, it
would be possible, as I understand it, to set up a different executive
body reporting to the ITA through secondary legislation if the area
proposed to do so.</div>
					<a name="08050848000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">The executive
arrangements mentioned in the clause do not have a specified form.
Section 11 of the Local Government Act 2000 sets out certain specific
forms for such arrangements, but section 11(5) also allows the
Secretary of State to specify other forms. It will, therefore, be for
each integrated transport authority to make its own proposals about
what form executive arrangements should take in its
area.</div>

functions of the ITA...which may be discharged by a committee of

					<a name="08050848000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am testing that definition. I am unsure how executive arrangements can
include functions that fall outside the remit of the executive body.

manner? The amendments are intended to probe and gain clarity about the

Winterton:
						</b> In essence, when the Bill refers to an
executive body, it refers to the passenger transport executive for the
area in question. At present, each PTA area has a passenger transport
executive and a passenger transport authority. The PTE is the body that
delivers the transport policies of the PTA. However, when the Bill
refers to an executive of an ITA rather than an executive body, it
refers to something different.</div>
					<a name="08050848000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman was quite right to refer to the 2000 Act, as amended by the
Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Act 2007, under which
local councils were generally required to establish executives with
responsibility for certain of their functions. In other words, a
council with 30 councillors, for example, could have an executive of
perhaps half a dozen councillors responsible for day-to-day decision
making. At the moment, it is not possible for a PTA to adopt similar
arrangements, although it is possible that an area might 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column329" />Column number: 329</div>see benefits in establishing an executive along similar lines. That is
why the Bill refers to an executive and executive arrangements. Clause
78(5) goes no further than the equivalent provision made in relation to
local councils in the 2000 Act. I hope that is helpful in clarifying
what the Bill means by
&#147;executive&#148;.</div>

there will always be the full support of the authorities involved, but,
as I have said, in certain situations a small minority of authorities
might wish to oppose reforms that are seen to be in the wider interests
of the conurbation or the city region as a whole. We are trying to
account for the fact that, in such a situation, the Secretary of State
could proceed with a governance order, if that was felt to be in the
wider interests of the area, without every authority having to agree
every aspect of that order. There are requirements to consult each
authority and to have regard to the identities and interests of local
communities, and a governance order would be subject to parliamentary
scrutiny under the affirmative procedure. I hope that that explanation
re-emphasises our points about allowing enough
flexibility.</div>

Hammond:
						</b> The clause confers on an ITA or a local transport
authority a power to give a direction to a metropolitan district
council, a county council or a unitary authority. Such a direction will
take the form of an instruction as to how those bodies should exercise
their functions as a highway authority or traffic authority. The
principal uses of the power would seem to be in the areas of the
ability to install traffic management measures and traffic calming
measures, and the carrying out of maintenance measures. In theory, all
that is fine, but the practice is often rather
different.</div>
					<a name="08050848000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsections
(8) to (11) offer conditions so that the exercise of the power is, in
some ways, constrained at times, because they say that the directed
body would have to do certain things or obtain consent. Conditions
would be imposed on the directed body&#146;s power, and powers could
not be used in certain circumstances. The directed body must use the
power if the directing authority meets the cost of
compliance.</div>
					<a name="08050848000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
question, yet again, is that of local versus regional. I shall cite a
couple of examples from my constituency in which what the directing
authority does is not in tune with what the local authority, or,
perhaps more importantly, local people, want. In my constituency, the
directing body is Transport for London. It wanted to impose a regional
cycle network. There was little dispute over the objective, but what
was in dispute&#151;and is always in dispute&#151;was some of the
routeing.</div>
					<a name="08050848000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">At
one point, TfL decided that the route through Wimbledon should come up
one residential road, cross a local main road and go on to another
residential road, before proceeding on to another main road and on to
Raynes Park. On paper, that looked like a simple exercise, and no one
disagreed with the aim of a cycle route. The point at issue was that it
involved coming up a local road, skewing across a main road and then
going down another local road on a blind bend. That was a death trap
for local cyclists, and that point was made in representations by the
local residents association, the local cycle group and local
councillors. However, the directing authority continued to insist on
the route, despite the fact that it was proven to the authority that a
similar scheme could be enacted 100 yd up the road without the death
trap for
cyclists.</div>
					<a name="08050848000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
route was imposed, and consequently there was an accident, and now
almost no one uses that part of the cycle route. That illustrates that
the caveat that the Minister appears to have put into subsections (8)
to (11)&#151;that of obtaining consent&#151;needs to be
reconsidered. Local authorities and residents often know more than the
regional integrated transport authority. Although its wishes and aims
might be laudable, unless it takes 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column331" />Column number: 331</div>account of the local context, it is very likely that, in a number of
cases, it will do more harm than good.</div>
					<a name="08050848000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">Wimbledon
hill provides a similar example. It is a three-lane&#151;one up, two
down&#151;road connecting Wimbledon village to the town centre.
Transport for London wanted to insert a bus lane and a new set of
traffic controls. We were told that that would speed up the buses,
after which TfL would re-engineer its lighting system so that the
lights at the bottom of the hill would go through the town in a green
wave. If that were to have happened, it would have been entirely
laudable and no one would have opposed it. Indeed, no one opposed it
initially. However, when TfL came back with its detailed model, a
number of consequences of the proposal became apparent, the first of
which was that it could not re-engineer the lights for more than two
years. Even with the introduction of the bus lane, that would actually
slow down bus
journeys.</div>
					<a name="08050848000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">Once
again, TfL was asked to reconsider, but four years on, it still has not
been able to re-engineer the traffic lights, so we now have not only
bus journeys taking longer than they did four years ago, but cars
idling, increasing CO<span class="Sub">2 </span>emissions all the way up the hill.
Although I fully accept the need for regional traffic strategies and
the benefits that integrated transport authorities can bring, a
question mark remains: are we clear that subsections (8) to (11), and
particularly the caveat about obtaining consent&#151;the question
mark is that the powers cannot be used in certain
circumstances&#151;could be used to protect very local, but highly
important,
circumstances?</div>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column332" />Column number: 332</div>that very often those with these regional powers exercise them with
arrogance and the attitude, &#147;We know better than local

						</b> That might well be my right hon. Friend&#146;s
experience. It might be arrogance, but it might just be that they wish
to push ahead with their strategy because they believe that it is
right. All too often, unless local circumstances are brought into a
strategy, it will not bring the benefits that we all seek. I hope that
the Minister will confirm how she expects the caveats in subsections
(8) to (11) to work. I am concerned about the need to obtain local
consent, or if not consent, at least a proper local consultation so
that the appropriate examination takes place and local circumstances
can be built in to the regional strategy. I am concerned that
subsections (8) to (11) do not deal with that.</div>
					<a name="08050848000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">We had this
debate earlier when we were talking about the constituent parts of the
integrated transport authorities. If they take account of proper local
representation, there is a chance that local circumstances could be
built in to the regional strategy. However, if that local
representation is not there, it cannot be built in. I want the Minister
to reassure us that subsections (8) to (11) will ensure that the degree
of power that must be given to the integrated transport authority can,
in certain circumstances, be restrained by local consent. I am not
convinced that those subsections necessarily do that. Without those
constraints, an authority&#146;s good intentions might be entirely
negated.</div>
