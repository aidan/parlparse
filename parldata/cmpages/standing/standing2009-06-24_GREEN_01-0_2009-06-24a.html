Peter Ainsworth</b> (East Surrey) (Con): May I begin by saying
what an enormous pleasure it is to be serving on a Committee under your
chairmanship, Miss Begg? It is quite a pleasure to be serving on a
Committee at all; I have not checked the record, but I have a nasty
feeling that the last time I served on a Public Bill Committee was in
the 1990s. For one reason or another it has passed me by, but I fear
the Committee of Selection will not be so lenient in
future.</div><a name="090624118000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">Thank
you, Miss Begg, for chairing these proceedings on what is a beautiful,
sunny afternoon. I am extremely grateful to all hon. Members who have
come here hopefully to move forward the Green Energy Bill in a positive
way when they could be participating in all sorts of things, including
an interesting debate on the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column4" />Column number: 4</div>Iraq inquiry. If all goes to plan this afternoon, to outside observers
and the uninitiated we may be looking at rather a strange situation. It
is not my intention that clause 1 be passed; in fact it is not my
intention that many of the clauses be passed into legislation. To the
uninitiated, this may look as if I am trashing my own Bill. Unlike the
Government, who axiomatically take the view that all legislation that
appears for Second Reading is by definition perfect&#151;except when
they later table vast numbers of amendments&#151;I have taken the
view that this is not perfect legislation, but it is a perfect way of
advancing a very important
agenda.</div><a name="090624118000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
that effect, I make no secret of the fact that I have worked with
Ministers and their officials to try to move this forward. I am
grateful to the right hon. and learned Member for North Warwickshire
(Mr. O'Brien), who, before the revolving doors in the
ministerial corridors revolved once more, was the Minister responsible
for these matters. I am also grateful to the current Minister for the
support and encouragement she has shown in the course of developing
these thoughts. I am particularly grateful&#151;I do not know whether
it is appropriate to say so, but I am going to anyway&#151;to Rachel
Crisp, the civil servant in charge of work on Bills at the Department
of Energy and Climate Change, who has worked extremely hard,
particularly on developing the new clauses but also in a liaison
capacity. I thank her very much. I know she has been burning the
midnight oil on more than one occasion&#151;not that a civil servant
at DECC has any business burning oil at all; I hope she was using
energy-efficient light
bulbs.</div><a name="090624118000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
do not intend to proceed with clause 1. I am very content with new
clause 4, tabled by the Government, which concerns the interpretation
of the terms of the Bill, and I am happy to support its provisions.
They contain a very clear definition of an energy-efficient measure and
also make it clear that the term &#147;dwelling house&#148;, though
inelegant, includes flats. I therefore commend new clause 4 to the
Committee.</div><a name="090624118000036"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090624118000325"></a>The
Minister of State, Department of Energy and Climate Change (Joan
Ruddock):</b> May I also say what a pleasure it is to serve
under your chairmanship, Miss
Begg?</div><a name="090624118000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">First,
I congratulate the hon. Member for East Surrey on having reached this
stage with his private Member&#146;s Bill. Many fall by the wayside,
but his has made it into Committee. We have been pleased to work with
him and he has been extremely co-operative, which we appreciate. I also
thank him for his kind words about our civil servants who, as he
rightly said, have worked extremely hard to get us to this
position.</div>
<a name="090624118000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am rising
to oppose clause 1 and to explain why we wish to substitute new clause
4 for it. The changes proposed by the Government are necessary to align
some of the definitions in the current clause 1 more closely with
existing legal definitions, and to reflect other proposed amendments to
the Bill. Given the changes required to clause 1, I hope that hon.
Members will agree that removing the clause in its entirety is a better
way of dealing with the situation than amending it bit by
bit.</div>
<a name="090624118000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause 4
inserts additional definitions as a result of other amendments that are
made to the Bill. Let me highlight a particular change for the
Committee&#151;that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column5" />Column number: 5</div>made to the existing definition of &#147;energy efficiency
measure&#148;. The purpose of this change is to bring the definition
into line with that in section 41A(2) of the Electricity Act 1989,
which states:</div>
<a name="090624118000275"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In
this section &#145;energy efficiency target&#146; means a target
for the promotion of improvements in energy efficiency, that is to
say&#148;&#151;</div><a name="090624118000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">and
this is the relevant
phrase&#151;</div><a name="090624118000276"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;efficiency
in the use by consumers of electricity, gas conveyed through pipes or
any other source of energy which is specified in the
order.&#148;</div><a name="090624118000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
do not intend to discuss energy efficiency targets, but I hope that
hon. Members agree that that definition is much broader than the one in
clause 1 as drafted. Making that change is important, given the role
that energy efficiency has to play in any long-term energy strategy. It
is therefore essential that, in seeking to define and promote green
energy&#151;the intended purpose of the Bill, of which energy
efficiency forms an integral part&#151;the definition of
&#147;energy efficiency&#148; should be as broad as
possible.</div>
<a name="090624118000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">Aside from
that, amendments to clause 1 only reflect changes made to the wider
Bill. I do not propose discussing in detail those changes now, since
that discussion is best had in the context of debating the policy
issues and questions arising from each clause. Suffice it to say that I
will ensure that the definitions in the clause reflect any further
amendments made to the Bill as a result of the Committee&#146;s
consideration of
it.</div><a name="090624118000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
summary, the Government oppose clause 1 standing part of the Bill and
we seek to substitute new clause 4 for it.</div>
<a name="090624118000044"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="090624118000326"></a><b class="B">Martin
Horwood</b> (Cheltenham) (LD): It is a pleasure to serve on
the Committee with you in the Chair, Miss Begg, especially as you have
recognised the progress of global warming in this building and allowed
us to remove our jackets.</div>
<a name="090624118000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
congratulate the hon. Member for East Surrey on having got the Bill
this far and for pragmatically not opposing the complete deletion of
all the clauses in it. I am not sure what that does to increase
openness and transparency to the public in our processes, but it is
certainly a pragmatic and sensible move.</div>
<a name="090624118000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will
comment in due course on some of the losses that I think we may suffer
as a result of changes to the Bill, but in the case of clause 1 we are
not losing a great deal. The clause says that &#147;small-scale
low-carbon local sources&#148;
means</div><a name="090624118000277"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;renewable
sources of a capacity not exceeding 10 megawatts, the energy from which
is consumed within a 30 mile radius of the source of
generation&#148;.</div><a name="090624118000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
definition of green energy is being lost in the process that we are now
being asked to accept. The shift from 10 MW down to 5 will perhaps make
the Bill consistent with other legislation and is, in any case,
possibly a sensible measure, as 10 MW is a pretty big figure when it
comes to wind turbines.</div>
<a name="090624118000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have
suggested a different definition. Amendment 2 contains the
phrase:</div><a name="090624118000278"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
generation of electricity or heat from renewable or low-carbon sources
by the use of any equipment, the capacity of which to generate
electricity or heat does not exceed the capacity specified in
subsection
(2A)&#148;.</div><a name="090624118000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
definition is quite loose. There is a risk in redefining green energy
as anything that might be low-carbon. For example, on a larger scale it
opens the door to nuclear  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column6" />Column number: 6</div>being defined as &#147;green&#148;, which we Liberal Democrats would
obviously dispute. It is useful to have these tighter definitions,
including the definition of green energy as &#147;small-scale&#148;
and
&#147;low-carbon&#148;.</div><a name="090624118000050"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090624118000327"></a>Mr.
Ainsworth:</b> The hon. Gentleman has made the point before
himself, but I must remind him that, as yet, no form of nuclear energy
is &#147;small-scale&#148;.</div>
<a name="090624118000051"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090624118000328"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> The record will show that I was careful to say
that, on a larger scale, such a definition could lead to greenwashing,
but who knows? There may be other forms of smaller-scale generation
that, on closer examination, turn out not to be quite as green as they
first seem, and which may create pollutants. However, we are happy to
proceed on a pragmatic basis and to accept the Government&#146;s
amendment.</div><a name="090624118000052"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="090624118000329"></a><b class="B">Charles
Hendry</b> (Wealden) (Con): May I say what a pleasure it is to
serve under your chairmanship, Miss Begg? May I also congratulate my
hon. Friend the Member for East Surrey, who is my constituency
neighbour, on getting the Bill this far? There is nobody more
appropriate for proposing such legislation; his track record in the
area is in a league of its own in terms of work in Parliament,
particularly on our side of the House. I congratulate him on what he
has done so far, particularly on securing broad Government support for
the Bill. I have never heard a Government say that they like a Bill so
much that they want to delete clauses 1, 3, 5 and 6, but keep a little
bit of clause 7, which is only two lines long. Nevertheless, it is a
great step forward to have achieved that and I welcome it. It is also
right, as the Minister said, to tighten up the definition, so we
support the
changes.</div><a name="090624118000053"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090624118000334"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> The Government believe that clause 2 should stand
part of the Bill&#151;members of the Committee will recognise that as
the first exception to our proceedings&#151;subject to a number of
amendments. Clause 2 is important because it defines the
term &#147;green energy&#148; for the purposes of the Bill.
Amendment 2 seeks to align better the concept of green energy with the
existing scales and definitions that are already familiar in
legislation. The amendment makes two key changes. First, in the
definition of &#147;green energy&#148;, it changes</div>
<a name="090624118000279"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;small-scale
low-carbon local&#148;</div>
<a name="090624118000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">to simply
&#147;low-carbon&#148;. Secondly, it adds capacity limits in
relation to the generation of electricity and heat. References to
renewables and energy efficiency remain in the
clause.</div><a name="090624118000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
reason for the change in terminology to &#147;low-carbon&#148; is
that the explicit introduction of capacity limits obviates the need to
require green energy to be small-scale, which answers the question
asked by the hon. Member for Cheltenham. Following the change,
subsection (2) is left with the phrase</div>
<a name="090624118000280"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;renewable
or...low-carbon...sources&#148;.</div><a name="090624118000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
reflects the definition outlined in new clause 1, which will take the
place of clause 3, on the microgeneration strategy. That approach not
only gives consistency to the Bill but creates certainty, because new
clause 1 links the
term</div><a name="090624118000281"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;renewable
or low-carbon
source&#148;</div><a name="090624118000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">to
the sources of energy or technologies specified in section 82(7) of the
Energy Act 2004, which is the parent legislation for much of the
Bill&#146;s
policy.</div><a name="090624118000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">Setting
capacity limits gives greater certainty still. It also removes the need
to set those capacity limits in the original clause 1. In setting
limits, the amendment achieves better alignment with existing
legislation. For example, the 5 MW limit is the maximum capacity for
small-scale low-carbon electricity generation set out in the feed-in
tariff powers in section 41 of the Energy Act 2008. The 5 MW upper
capacity cap was debated at length by Parliament in considering that
section of the 2008 Act. While it is recognised that the limit is
greater than that of, for example, the definition of microgeneration in

<div class="Column"><a name="Column8" />Column number: 8</div>section 82 of the 2004 Act, we concluded that the 5 MW upper capacity
cap was appropriate in the context of small-scale generation. The
setting of the specified maximum capacity, which is required by the
2008 Act, will be done through secondary legislation and is subject to

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090624118000335"></a>Charles
Hendry:</b> In the course of the Energy Act 2004, there was a
proposal that the maximum capacity for small-scale combined heat and
power as a low-carbon technology should also be set at 5 MW. The
Government rejected that and it was kept as 50 kW. Will the Minister
clarify how that ties in? Combined heat and power systems are
specifically included within the Government&#146;s definition of
microgeneration. There will now be some doubt in people&#146;s minds
about where the 50 kW limit and the 5 MW capacity come
in.</div>
<a name="090624118000066"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090624118000336"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> The hon. Gentleman will be aware that I was not
the Minister at the time of the 2004 Act and I do not have an immediate
answer. However, I am sure that by the time I have finished this page
of my brief, I will have one and he will get it.</div>
<a name="090624118000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">The proposal
removes the need to define the term &#147;small scale&#148; in the
context of this Bill. Moreover, the higher limit also allows for
consideration of plant of a size that could be used for community-scale
generation and buildings, such as schools and hospitals, which I am
sure the hon. Member for East Surrey intended to include when he
drafted the
Bill.</div><a name="090624118000068"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="090624118000337"></a><b class="B">Dr.
Alan Whitehead</b> (Southampton, Test) (Lab): I hope that the
Minister will have an response to my minor point. The question of the
amended definition, which is important, relates also to the new clause
4 definition, which has a meaning that in turn relates to
microgeneration strategy. That appears to be outside legislation. I am
not clear whether that line of definition eventually ends up outside
legislation rather than inside it, and therefore could be capable of
being challenged on the grounds that it is within a document and not
within legislation, where it would be clearly
defined.</div><a name="090624118000069"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090624118000338"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> I do not think that I have any chance of
answering my hon. Friend&#146;s complex query. Only those who have
been involved in detailed drafting and are familiar with the other Acts
will be able to provide an answer. I hope they will be able to pass me
a note.</div>
<a name="090624118000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">The note I
have been passed in relation to the question asked by the hon. Member
for Wealden does not answer his question. I am told that the Energy Act
2008 sets 50 kW limits for micro-CHP, but he told us that in
posing his question. So the question remains. I hope that we will get
an answer, but if we fail to do so, I will write to him, as I will to
my hon. Friend if we cannot clarify his point either.</div>
<a name="090624118000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">The higher
limit would allow the consideration of projects that could be in
schools and hospitals. I think that we would all want that to happen.
However, no precedent exists in law in relation to a small-scale limit
on the generation of heat. For the purposes of symmetry, and because I
believe it is sensible, we have therefore included an equal limit of 5
MW thermal in relation to the generation of heat.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column9" />Column number: 9</div><a name="090624118000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 3
is a technical amendment which is necessary because the Secretary of
State is the only person who can perform functions under the Bill.
There is, therefore, a need to make it explicit that he or she is the
only person who can be put on the face of the Bill.</div>
<a name="090624118000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subject to
the amendments outlined above, which are important for reasons of
consistency and certainty and to align the Bill better with existing
legislation, the Government are content that clause 2, as amended,
should stand part of the
Bill.</div><a name="090624118000074"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090624118000339"></a>Mr.
Ainsworth:</b> It is becoming increasingly clear, to me at
least, that one of the many advantages of allowing the Government to
make the running with their new clauses is that the Minister has to
answer all the really difficult
questions.</div><a name="090624118000075"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090624118000340"></a>Charles
Hendry:</b> Or
not.</div><a name="090624118000076"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090624118000341"></a>Mr.
Ainsworth:</b> Indeed. I hope that the Minister will, in due
course, have answers to the questions that have been posed on the
amendments, which I support. Amendment 2 offers a definition of green
energy that is clearer than the one in the Bill on Second Reading. The
definition of course includes heat, which the Bill originally
overlooked. I am delighted about that. It is important progress and a
vindication of the co-operative approach that we have
adopted.</div>
<a name="090624118000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also
welcome the capacity limit, which is about the right level. There is no
perfect way of determining what the right level is, but that should
enable local communities and community-based organisations to take up
initiatives in green energy. We want communities to become involved in
solving the problems of climate change in all sorts of ways. Amendment
2 supports that
agenda.</div><a name="090624118000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
the Minister rightly said, amendment 3 is purely a technicality. Only
the Secretary of State can perform functions under the Bill and the
amendment makes that abundantly
clear.</div><a name="090624118000079"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090624118000342"></a>Charles
Hendry:</b> I want to return to the point that I raised
earlier because it is important to have a clear understanding of what
is intended. We completely support the purpose of amendment 2, which is
to provide greater simplicity and clarity&#151;so that there is one
general threshold at 5 MW. Is it the case that, within the definition
of the Bill, CHP of up to 5 MW would be allowed, yet it would only
benefit from the feed-in tariff up to 50 kW? Is that the difference? Or
is the Minister proposing that there should also be a change to the
feed-in tariff regime to provide clarity and
uniformity?</div>
<a name="090624118000080"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090624118000343"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> I apologise to the hon. Gentleman for not being
provided with a clear answer to his
question.</div>
<a name="090624118000081"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090624118000344"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> Will the Minister give
way?</div><a name="090624118000082"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090624118000345"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> I hope that the hon. Gentleman is not about to
tell me what I should know.</div>
<a name="090624118000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the
feed-in tariff, I am certainly not aware of any proposals to make a
change. When he posed the question, the hon. Member for Wealden said
that the limit on micro-CHP was set at 50 kW. I will endeavour to
provide him with an answer in due course.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column10" />Column number: 10</div><a name="090624118000084"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090624118000346"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I would not dare to presume to tell the
Government what to say in response&#151;not yet, anyway. Is one of
the potential problems with combined heat and power that it is not
technically and strictly a renewable energy source? It is certainly an
energy-saving one and it would be interesting to discuss in more
detail&#151;perhaps I can buy the Minister a little
time&#151;whether it will come within the definition of a low-carbon
energy source.</div>
<a name="090624118000085"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090624118000347"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> I am being told that I was correct in saying that
we are not using the Bill to change the details of feed-in tariffs, so
there is nothing more to be said on the matter. I have already repeated
that the limit of 50 kW on CHP will remain for those tariffs. I am
going to stick my neck out, but as the questions were posed, it seemed
to me that CHP did not fall within the definition of green energy. I am
trying to get that checked; I have just come to the Bill and do not
have the background to it. I need to be sure whether we are covering
that matter.</div>
<a name="090624118000086"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="090624118000348"></a><b class="B">David
Howarth</b> (Cambridge) (LD): I think the point that is
causing some discussion on the Liberal Democrat Benches is that the
definition of &#147;energy efficiency measure&#148; in new clause 4
is</div> <a name="090624118000282"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a
measure to improve efficiency in the use by consumers of electricity,
gas or any other source of energy&#148;.</div>
<a name="090624118000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is at least
arguable that CHP is a measure that improves efficiency in the consumer
use of gas.</div>
<a name="090624118000088"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090624118000349"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his
assistance. My concern is that I need clarity; I need to be absolutely
certain. I am being told that CHP is included. However, nothing in the
Bill changes anything that I have said about feed-in tariffs, or about
the levels that we have made obvious in terms of the generality for the
5 MW in cases of both heat and electricity.</div>
<a name="090624118000089"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090624118000350"></a>Charles
Hendry:</b> CHP would absolutely be included because new
clause 1 says that &#147;renewable or low-carbon
source&#148;</div><a name="090624118000283"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;means
a source of energy or technology specified in ... the Energy Act

heat and power
systems&#148;,</div><a name="090624118000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">so
it most definitely is included. I am not seeking to make the
Minister&#146;s life more complicated, and I hope that she accepts
that with good intent. I am happy for her to write to us. If, on
further reflection, there is any confusion, she might want to table a
further amendment on Report. We do not want to disrupt the course of
the Bill, but there is a lack of clarity that it would be helpful to
clear up.</div>

happens&#151;both to write to the hon. Gentleman and to see whether
there is a need for greater clarity. As I have demonstrated, he has
raised a number of questions on which I was not briefed. They were
clearly not anticipated and I have insufficient background knowledge to
give him a proper answer. Let us admit it; he has
confused  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column11" />Column number: 11</div>me, but we will deal with those matters and have certainty in a written

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090624118000353"></a>Mr.
Ainsworth:</b> Clause 3 is yet another victim of the accord,
and I very much welcome the Government&#146;s new clause. It covers
everything that seems necessary  at this stage to update and
improve the current microgeneration strategy, and includes in
subsection (2) a duty to consult the microgeneration industry before
preparing the strategy&#151;a wise move&#151;and to
consult</div><a name="090624118000285"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;any
other persons whom the Secretary of State thinks it appropriate to
consult&#148;.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column12" />Column number: 12</div><a name="090624118000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">When the Minister
replies&#151;I hope that this will be an easier question&#151;will
she say whom might she include in &#147;any other persons&#148;?
For example, will it include non-governmental organisations concerned
with environmental matters or with fuel poverty? We all know&#151;it
was mentioned on Second Reading&#151;of the potential identified by
National Energy Action for air source heat pumps to make a huge
difference to fuel bills and to benefit the fuel-poor. Will she assure
us that organisations concerned with fuel poverty will be properly
consulted?</div><a name="090624118000298"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3
pm</div><a name="090624118000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection
(5) of the new clause also improves the original draft by requiring the
Secretary of State to take other relevant strategies into account. That
should help with joined-up thinking, which we always like to see more
of, and with keeping the strategy up to date.</div>
<a name="090624118000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection
(7) amends and improves the definition of microgeneration in the Energy
Act 2004. Section 82 of the Act produced the current strategy, which
has generally worked well, but the new definition of 300 kW thermal is
a great improvement on the previous definition of 45 kW
thermal, which has turned out to be far too small to make any
meaningful difference. We want to help not just single properties but
groups of properties, and subsection (7) will help. Again, I commend
the Government on their amendments, which I intend to
support.</div>
<a name="090624118000102"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="090624118000354"></a><b class="B">Colin

steps to secure the implementation of the strategy&#148;</div>
<a name="090624118000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">means as set out in

not always implemented as fully as the people who legislate for them

steps&#148;?</div><a name="090624118000104"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090624118000355"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I have a couple of questions and a few comments
to make. My first point concerns the timetable for consultation. The
12-month timetable set out in the original measures has been replaced
by one lasting, effectively, six months to the beginning of the
consultation and six months beyond the end of the consultation, to
final publication. We worry at times that this Government are better at
producing wind through consultations than wind through turbines. It
would be nice to know, in an aspirational sense, when the Minister
expects the revised strategy to be
published.</div><a name="090624118000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
there are a few losses from the original wording that relate, as the
hon. Member for East Surrey pointed out, to the issues to be addressed.
Specifically, the original wording mentioned that the review would
include a focus on existing buildings, the cost-effectiveness of
different technologies, and the active promotion of feed-in tariffs and
how they could be achieved. It would be interesting to hear from the
Minister whether those things could be planned as part of the review as
well.</div><a name="090624118000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
terms of who is to be consulted, the original drafting contained
specifics relating to farmers, for instance, and countryside
campaigning organisations, albeit in a roundabout way. Again, it would
be nice to think that such groups would be specifically consulted. I am
not clear why officials saw the need to remove them from the drafting.
Parish councils, too, are in the same category. They were explicitly
mentioned before but are now only implied under other categories of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column13" />Column number: 13</div>people that the Secretary of State might see fit to consult. Will the
Minister specify whether she intends to consult parish
councils?</div><a name="090624118000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
I am afraid that the Committee will have  to suffer the loss of
an opportunity to vote on our amendment (a), as we will not be pushing
it to a vote, in the interests of the smooth progress of the Bill.
However, it raises the issue of whether consultations that have been
completed will be acknowledged as having been part of the process, or
whether the Bill will necessitate further consultations on top of
those. If so, we might enter an endless cycle of consultations. I hope
that the Minister can clarify that point as
well.</div>
<a name="090624118000108"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090624118000356"></a>The
Chairman:</b><b class="B"> </b>I must clarify that amendment (a) is
associated with new clause 2, and we are discussing new clause 1. We
will come to new clause 2
later.</div><a name="090624118000109"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090624118000357"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> On a point of order, Miss Begg. I should have
clarified that I was referring to amendment (a) to new
clause 3.</div>
<a name="090624118000110"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090624118000358"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Right. We will come to new clause 3 as part of
the debate on clause 4 stand part. There is also an amendment (a) to
new clause 2. It does get a bit
confusing.</div>
<a name="090624118000111"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090624118000359"></a>Dr.
Whitehead:</b> I would like to pursue the point I raised in
respect of this clause in my intervention a moment ago. It may well be
that I am utterly stupid and have misunderstood the effect of the
various new clauses cumulatively on each other in the Bill, and I do
agree that it is rather difficult to follow the new status of various
clauses relative to how they appear, so that new clause 1 will become
clause 3 of the Bill, should it be accepted, and new clause
4&#151;which has already been effectively accepted&#151;will become
clause 1 of the new, revised Bill. If that is the case, then the
definition in new clause 4 of &#147;renewable or low-carbon
source&#148; applies to the whole of the new Act. However, the
definition to which it refers, which is in new clause1&#151;which
will become section 3 of the Act&#151;only refers to that clause. The
&#147;renewable or low-carbon source&#148; in this section
means,</div>
<a name="090624118000287"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a source of
energy or technology specified in section 82(7) of the Energy Act
2004.&#148;</div><a name="090624118000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">as
the hon. Member for Wealden has pointed
out.</div><a name="090624118000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">What
therefore appears to be the line of reference seems to be something
which does not define where the legislation is as far as the whole Act
is concerned, but refers to something which does refer to the
legislation as far as one section of the Act is concerned. This appears
to be a problem.</div>
<a name="090624118000114"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090624118000360"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I think that that is okay because  the
new clause 4 definition talks about &#147;renewable or low carbon
source&#148; having the meaning given to it by section 3(7) of the
Act. It does not just say section 3; it says section 3(7). If one looks
at section 3(7), one does not look at the words in the section but
merely for the words being referred to, which are in inverted commas:
&#147;renewable or low-carbon source.&#148; It then
says:</div><a name="090624118000288"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;means
a source of energy or technology specified in section 82(7) of the
Energy Act 2004.&#148;</div>
<a name="090624118000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not think there
is a problem here at all, because of the reference to what will be
section 3(7).</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column14" />Column number: 14</div><a name="090624118000116"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090624118000361"></a>Dr.
Whitehead:</b> But it is contingent on the words &#147;In
this section&#148;. There are two sub-clauses, and one of them is a
definition of what low-carbon energy means.</div>
<a name="090624118000117"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090624118000362"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> The hon. Gentleman might find that is not
actually correct. I think the definition as he finds it in new clause 4
simply explains the definition of &#147;renewable or low-carbon
source&#148; using the wording of new clause 1. Only in new clause 1
is the definition contingent on the words &#147;In this
section&#148;. Will he accept that?</div>
<a name="090624118000118"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090624118000363"></a>Dr.
Whitehead:</b> May I suggest that there are three options
here. Either I am completely wrong, or
alternatively&#151;<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> That may be
so.</div>
<a name="090624118000119"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090624118000364"></a>Mr.
Ainsworth:</b> It will not help future generations to
understand what is going on, not that any of us in the room seem to
understand either. It really will not help if the hon. Gentleman
silently reads notes passed to him by officials and then does not refer
to what they say.</div>
<a name="090624118000120"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090624118000365"></a>Dr.
Whitehead:</b> The hon. Gentleman is right. What I would like
to place on the record is my concern that a definition in the
Bill&#151;and hopefully soon, an Act&#151;which ensures that
low-carbon sources of energy are included, works for the whole of the
Act&#146;s purposes. Low-carbon sources of energy means combined heat
and power and other low-carbon sources within the definition of the
size. It is being suggested that the definition works by
interpretation. I might say that at the very least, it appears to be
drafting for these purposes which needs an interpretation, rather than
giving a clear line right through the original definition which should
be in clause 1. In any event, that is a clause which relates
to the whole of the Act. Without wishing to delay the progress of this
legislation, I would appreciate a note which exemplifies why that is
sound in law. I would also like to know why as far as the Bill is
concerned, the fact that the definition appears to be in the wrong
order may not be, in any way, subversive of the purpose of including
low carbon sources properly within the overall definition. I hope that
is clear.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090624118000366"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> I must say to my hon. Friend the Member for
Southampton, Test that I was glad he ended up confusing himself. He
certainly confused all of us and I am grateful to the hon. Member for
Cambridge and the hon. Member for Cheltenham for their assistance in
trying to sort him out.</div>
<a name="090624118000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">I fear at
the end of the day, we are all still deeply concerned about this
matter. I would like to say to him that he will get a note, and we will
clearly check carefully and see if we need to do anything in order to
create greater clarity. I can offer him that guarantee.</div>
<a name="090624118000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">Returning to
the business in hand, the Government opposes clause 3 for similar
reasons that we have given in the case of other clauses. We have laid
new clause 1, which would replace clause 3 in its entirety. I hope by
way of setting out the provisions of clause 3 which are problematic, I
can explain to Committee members why the Government cannot support the
clause as it stands.</div>
<a name="090624118000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
originally drafted it sets out a requirement to revise the
microgeneration strategy under &#147;section 82
(microgeneration)&#148; of the Energy Act 2004, in relation 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column15" />Column number: 15</div>to England. The purpose of the revised strategy would be to promote
microgeneration, defined as the use of plant for the production or
generation of heat and electricity, where that plant has a generation
or production capacity of less than 50kW in respect of electricity and
45kW in respect of
heat.</div><a name="090624118000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government is keen to promote microgeneration but believes that the
45kW thermal limit for heat technology does not go far enough. The hon.
Member for East Surrey has acknowledged that. We want to ensure that
the new strategy adds real value to work that is already underway, for
example, to allow consideration for larger-scale heating systems. We
believe giving scope in the strategy to consider wider developments
will be beneficial in ensuring that microgeneration plays its part in
meeting the challenging 2020 renewable target and contributing to the
80 per cent. reduction in carbon emissions to which we are
committed.</div>
<a name="090624118000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
also includes specific reference to matters that the Secretary of State
must include within the revised strategy, such as financial and fiscal
measures which in his opinion will ensure the cost-effective promotion
of microgeneration. The Government cannot support unspecified
commitments to fiscal and financial measures as this would lead to
confusion and undermine important work already under way to support
small-scale on-site energy technologies, which I will come to
later.</div><a name="090624118000299"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3.15
pm</div><a name="090624118000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will attempt to set out the intentions of new clause 1,
which seeks to replace the current clause 3 of the Bill. Let me begin
by acknowledging the work that has already been done to move forward
microgeneration in the UK. The Government published a microgeneration
strategy in March 2006 following the Energy Act 2004. We made
significant progress in implementing that strategy and reported in June
2008 on the actions set out in that document. I am sure Committee
members will agree that it is important to go further and build on what
has been achieved to date in the development of microgeneration
technologies. Let me make it clear that stakeholders, and hon. Members
themselves, have played their part in those achievements.</div>
<a name="090624118000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new
clause sets out clearly the Government&#146;s intention to prepare,
consult on and publish a new strategy to promote microgeneration. The
new clause also requires the Secretary of State to take reasonable
steps to secure its implementation. We must ensure that the new
strategy adds real value and takes account of work that is already in
progress. With that in mind, the new clause makes it clear that the new
microgeneration strategy should have regard to strategies relating to
the generation of electricity or heat from renewable or low-carbon
sources to be published by the Secretary of State after 1 July this
year. This is designed to ensure that the strategy takes account of the
renewable energy strategy and the heat and energy savings strategy. We
want to ensure that we do not duplicate work that is already under way.
Nor do we want to treat microgeneration in isolation from policy
development in other areas. It must be integral to our long-term plans
to increase the use of low-carbon energy.</div>
<a name="090624118000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new
clause requires the Secretary of State to consult producers and
suppliers of the equipment for microgeneration in preparing the
strategy. We believe 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column16" />Column number: 16</div>this is important and we want to involve industry and other stakeholders
in that process. We are already talking to industry and, indeed, this
has confirmed the need to do more than revise the previous
microgeneration strategy. We need to bring forward a new strategy able
to take account of the live and relevant developments taking place in
this
area.</div><a name="090624118000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
would just like for the benefit of the Committee  to raise some
of the issues that are already current.  We know that more
needs to be done on information provision to inform consumers and build
confidence in microgeneration technologies. Those consumers who want to
install microgeneration technologies require easy access to relevant
information to inform their purchasing decision.</div>
<a name="090624118000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">Similarly,
we need to look at supply chain issues, and work is already in progress
to develop industry skills in relation to microgeneration. I understand
that SummitSkills is doing excellent work in developing the required
standards and qualification units for both new entrants and existing
workers. We want to reduce some of the current confusion in the
marketplace and make it easier for designers and installers of
microgeneration technologies to know what training is required and how
to go about it. We believe the strategy may be able to help facilitate
work in this
area.</div><a name="090624118000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
has been suggested that the strategy should consider a systems approach
as opposed to a technology approach, which is clearly an important
issue. This looks at how microgeneration technologies interface and
integrate with each other and within systems rather than focusing on
individual
technologies.</div><a name="090624118000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">Certification
also has an important role to play in providing assurance on the
performance and quality of microgeneration installations. We have made
some  progress on certification despite numerous challenges.
The microgeneration certification scheme is now making good progress,
although there is still more work to do. It has been opened up to new
certification bodies, which should help to create a competitive market
for certification services. We might also be able to do further work on
the strategy on grid connections and smart grid
developments.</div><a name="090624118000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
we could review the standard assessment procedure&#151;the
SAP&#151;to ensure the tool aligns with our policy objectives to
deploy renewable and low-carbon technologies in new buildings and for
retrofit. Those are the issues&#151;quite a significant
number&#151;that we could consider, but as I have said, the
consultation will cover them in greater detail.</div>
<a name="090624118000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new
clause sets out a clear timetable for the preparation of the new
strategy. It will require&#151;and this is a response to one of the
questions posed&#151;the consultation to commence within six months
of the Act coming into force and for the Secretary of State to publish
the strategy within six months of the end of the consultation. I
believe that that offers clarity and means that we need to publish the
revised strategy before the summer of 2010. We will need to publish the
revised strategy before next summer.</div>
<a name="090624118000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">In terms of
microgeneration as it relates to this clause, the new clause refers to
section 82 of the Energy Act 2004. I know that the hon. Member for East
Surrey is keen to see the strategy maintain that link with section 82.
However, new clause 1 gives scope to consider the contribution of the
production of heat above 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column17" />Column number: 17</div>45 kilowatts thermal. We believe that it is important to
align the strategy with, for example, recent changes to the eligibility
criteria for funding for heating technologies for the low-carbon
buildings programme. The Government have recently extended that
programme with an additional &#163;45 million, as hon. Members will
know, and a specific change to allow support for heat technologies up
to 300 kw thermal. We know from experience&#151;and,
again, this has been referred to already in the debate&#151;that the
45 kw thermal limit is restrictive for schools and community projects
that could otherwise make use of microgeneration heat technologies at
those larger
scales.</div><a name="090624118000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">Raising
the limit to 300 kw thermal will also allow us to consider, as part of
the microgeneration strategy, the important role of small scale
community heating networks and what further work is required to ensure
greater deployment of these networks in local communities. More
broadly, raising the limit gives scope to consider a wider range of
issues that may be usefully included in the new strategy than might
otherwise have been the case under clause 3, as originally drafted. The
new clause does not include a specific reference to the financial and
fiscal measures that I have indicated, which appeared in the previous
clause. It is important that we are specific about what we intend to do
in terms of financial measures. Anything vague only creates confusion
and unnecessary uncertainty. The Energy Act 2008 provides for the
introduction of the feed-in tariff and the renewable heat incentive. We
therefore already have the powers to bring forward effective incentives
to encourage the take-up of microgeneration technologies. We plan to
consult on feed-in tariffs this summer and on the renewable heat
incentive later in the
year.</div><a name="090624118000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
was asked about our various consultations and the form that they might
take. It was put to me that we were losing some of the named persons
who might have been consulted. I was also asked specifically about
whether there would be consultation with green non-governmental
organisations. We would, in approaching the consultation, do what we
did with the previous microgeneration strategy, which included setting
up a steering group with industry participation and wider stakeholders.
All actions in the previous strategy were completed with that approach.
It is a common approach taken across Government and it would be very
appropriate, for the whole range of consultations, but the particular
one we referred to on the microgeneration strategy.</div>
<a name="090624118000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Cheltenham implied that we consult too much. That is not the
view of those consulted. That is not the view of those consulted. They
wish to be consulted. They press us to be consulted. It takes time to
make proper consultations. We must then properly examine our returns
from consultation, and we shall continue to do so. I assure him and the
hon. Member for East Surrey that we shall be consulting in the broadest
range possible on matters that will meet the questions that they
asked.</div><a name="090624118000140"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090624118000367"></a>Mr.
Ainsworth:</b> I am grateful to the Minister. I understand the
problem of consultation overload, and I recognise that, for
understandable reasons, some people think that consultation is often an
excuse for inaction. I particularly asked not only about green NGOs,
but organisations concerned with fuel poverty. It is not my experience
that either of those groups resent being consulted, and I hope that she
will confirm that they will be consulted in this
case.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column18" />Column number: 18</div><a name="090624118000141"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090624118000368"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> As I was referring to green NGOs, I recalled that
the hon. Gentleman had asked about fuel poverty. He mentioned the NEA
and air source heat pumps. Since I have been responsible for the fuel
poverty strategy, I have looked at its delivery, particularly how we
might do better for those who are in fuel poverty in the hardest to
treat properties. I have made it clear that new technology offers a
solution to those problems. The warm-front scheme has been piloting
both solar and air source heat pumps, and we have now made changes in
the scheme to allow the delivery of those new forms of technology. We
are completely with him. That approach offers a potential solution. We
shall need to get on with it. We have made the provision, and we are
already piloting it so there is no question, but that the particular
consultation will be available to those who are concerned about fuel
poverty. I hope very much that they will
respond.</div><a name="090624118000142"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090624118000369"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I am certainly not against consultation, but
having been consulted three times about flooding during the past two
years since my county flooded, I know that sometimes one good
consultation might be better than three not so good ones. My specific
question was not so much about green NGOs, but that the phraseology in
the original draft was about persons interested in preserving visual
amenity in the appearance of the countryside and also parish councils
and the farming community. Will the hon. Lady specifically reassure the
Committee on each of those counts and confirm that those groups and
bodies will be
consulted?</div><a name="090624118000143"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090624118000370"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> I was, in fact, responding to the hon. Member for
East Surrey directly about the green NGOs and I was about to come to
the point made by the hon. Member for Cheltenham about those whom he
believes are missing from the strategy. All of those who he named
obviously have an interest in such matters, and I assure him that we
shall endeavour to make all parties aware of the consultation and
encourage their responding to
it.</div><a name="090624118000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
was about to conclude, but I must say first that, in preparing the
strategy the Government will have to have regard to the promotion of
energy efficiency, meaning efficiency in the use by consumers of
electricity and gas conveyed through pipes or any other energy source.
Energy efficiency plays an important and central role  in our
long-term energy goals. In the context of microgeneration policy, work
has taken place to demonstrate the benefits of combining energy
efficiency and microgeneration technologies in reducing the carbon
footprint of buildings. In summary, and for the reasons that I have set
out, the Government oppose that clause 3 should stand part
of the Bill and wish to replace it with new clause 1 in due
course.</div><a name="090624118000145"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090624118000371"></a>Mr.

the issues raised by the hon. Member for Southampton, Test, my
understanding for what it is worth is that the hon. Member for

would be enormously helpful if the Minister wrote to all members of the
Committee with clarification at the earliest opportunity. As I have
already made clear to the Committee, I am very content with the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090624118000373"></a>Mr.
Ainsworth:</b> This is becoming rather hair-raising. Clause 4
and new clause 3 concern microgeneration on non-domestic land. The
original Bill referred specifically to considerations about permitted
development orders and permitted development rights in relation to
agricultural land. This new clause refers to non-domestic land, which
includes every piece of land that is not within the curtilage of what
is inelegantly called a &#147;dwelling house&#148;. That includes
agricultural land and therefore addresses the issue originally raised
by organisations such as the Nation Farmers Union and the Country Land
and Business Association. The clause also allows sufficient flexibility
for objections to be taken into account through consultation while
stopping short of conferring an absolute duty to consult. I welcome the
Minister&#146;s comments on that
approach.</div><a name="090624118000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
(a) was tabled by the hon. Member for Cheltenham. I think he said
during an earlier debate that he did not intend to press this, and my
view is that it is unnecessary as the provisions are included in new
clause 3(5)(a). It is good news to hear that the Government are already
consulting on these matters&#151;or, if not already, are very shortly
to do so. I think the Liberal Democrat amendment is unnecessary for
those reasons and I hope that they withdraw
it.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column20" />Column number: 20</div><a name="090624118000153"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090624118000374"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> As has been anticipated by the hon. Gentleman, we
are seeking to remove clause 4 in order to substitute new clause 3 in
its place. I shall come to the merits of new clause 3 later, but I
shall quickly explain why the Government cannot support clause 4 as it
stands. Finally, I am afraid, I will have to explain why the Government
oppose amendment
(a).</div><a name="090624118000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
previous Energy Minister, my right hon. and learned Friend the Member
for North Warwickshire (Mr. O'Brien), outlined at Second
Reading that the Government support the intention behind clause 4 and
already plan to fulfil the commitments placed upon them by that clause.
Clause 4 require the Government to review the effect in England of
development orders made under section 59(2)(a) of the Town and Country
Planning Act 1990. Subsection (2)
outlines:</div><a name="090624118000289"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
purpose of the review is to provide information to assist the Secretary
of State to form an opinion as to what provision such development
orders should make to facilitate development in England consisting of
the installation of equipment, apparatus or appliances for
microgeneration.&#148;</div><a name="090624118000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection
(2) prescribes the scope of the review with reference to particular
types of land,
namely</div><a name="090624118000290"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;agricultural
land or within the curtilage of an agricultural
building&#148;</div><a name="090624118000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">or</div><a name="090624118000291"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;within
the curtilage of non-domestic
premises,&#148;.</div><a name="090624118000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
Members may know, as the hon. Gentleman has just said, the Government
intend to consult on proposals for permitted development rights for a
range of microgeneration equipment on non-domestic land later this
summer. We would like the review to be able to take account of all
non-domestic land and do not want the review to be constrained by
consideration of the types of land specified in clause 4. Our
consultation may include proposals to restrict the scope of permitted
development rights to install certain types of microgeneration
equipment on particular categories of land, but that is something that
should be the subject of consultation and should not be constrained at
this stage. We are also concerned that clause 4(3) places a requirement
to consult persons appearing to represent a number of specified
persons. We want our consultation to be as open as possible and
inclusive of all groups and individuals who may have an interest in the
proposals. We are concerned that by specifying individual groups,
particularly when some of the categories may be open to interpretation,
may send the wrong signals to stakeholders, who may feel excluded if
they are not specifically listed in the Bill. Finally, subsection (6)
defines agricultural land and agricultural holdings with reference to
the Local Government Finance Act 1998. As we propose to remove
references to specific land types&#151;for example, agricultural
land&#151;subsection (6) is superfluous if new clause 3 is accepted
in place of clause 4.</div>
<a name="090624118000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government have consequently laid new clause 3 to replace clause 4 of
the existing Bill and I will outline its key aspects. New clause 3
requires the Secretary of State to consider amending the Town and
Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 1995, the GPDO,
for the purposes of granting permitted development rights for
microgeneration equipment on non-domestic land. As I said, the
Government  already plan to consult later this summer on
proposals for permitted development rights for a range of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column21" />Column number: 21</div>microgeneration equipment on non-domestic land. Non-domestic land is
defined as buildings or other land that is not a dwelling house or
within the curtilage of a dwelling house. That is a very broad
definition which will allow us to consult on proposals for permitted
development rights for microgeneration equipment on a wide range of
land uses. While our consultation proposals may restrict the scope of
particular types of microgeneration equipment to particular types of
land, it should be the subject of consultation and not be constrained.
The clause requires that the Government must begin consideration of
potential amendments to the GPDO within six months of the Act coming
into force. We are already in the process of preparing consultation
proposals and we hope to show demonstrable progress within the
six-month time frame specified in the clause. New clause 3
requires the Secretary of State to lay before Parliament a report
setting out the outcome of the Government&#146;s consideration. That
requirement is similar to those contained in clause 4 of the current
Bill.</div>
<a name="090624118000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection
(5) of new clause 3 requires the Secretary of State, when considering
what amendments to the legislation might be necessary,
to have regard to the results of any
relevant consultation in relation to the GPDO. The provision is
included because consultation on potential amendments to the GPDO is
likely to be underway, or may even be completed, by the time the Bill
may come into force. Subsection (5) ensures that the Government will be
able to take account of any relevant consultation exercise they have
undertaken if the Bill gets Royal Assent. Subsection (5) grants a power
to allow the Secretary of State to carry out further consultation if
appropriate. That has been included as a safeguard, as we cannot
prejudge the outcome of the consultation and, I am sorry to say this,
further consultation may be necessary.</div>
<a name="090624118000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, I
turn to amendment (a). The Government fully support the intention
behind the amendment but we do not think it is necessary because of
provisions already contained in proposed new clause 3. I am grateful to
the hon. Member for Cheltenham for already indicating that he is not
going to press it to a
vote.</div><a name="090624118000161"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090624118000375"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I am grateful to the Minister and I will
certainly stand by my promise to the Committee. There is one specific
reference in amendment (a) which does not appear in new clause 3, which
is to a consultation having been</div>
<a name="090624118000292"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;undertaken
before the day on which this Act is
passed&#148;.</div><a name="090624118000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will be even more content if the Minister could be absolutely clear
that a consultation completed at the time this Bill passes will be
taken into consideration&#151;because that is not explicit in new
clause
3.</div><a name="090624118000163"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090624118000376"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> I can indeed. I am absolutely certain of that. I
was about to say to the hon. Gentleman and the Committee that the
amendment is intended to ensure that any consultation undertaken before
the day on which the Act is passed is as effective as if it had been
carried out after the Act is passed. We very much support that. The
consultation document we plan to issue later this summer will set out
our proposals for permitted development rights for microgeneration
equipment on non-domestic land and clearly we do not want to have to
repeat a consultation exercise in the light of the Act being passed, if
we can achieve the same 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column22" />Column number: 22</div>outcome by consulting on proposals this summer. I hope that that has
made the matter absolutely clear to the hon. Gentleman. That is why
subsection (5) of new clause 3 deals with consultation and requires the
Government to take account of
consultation:</div><a name="090624118000293"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;which
has been carried out...in relation to the
GPDO&#148;.</div><a name="090624118000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">Arguably,
subsection (5) covers everything that the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
proposed amendment would have achieved.</div>
<a name="090624118000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection
(5) places no time limit on consultation and it can be read as
requiring the Government to take account of the results of any relevant
consultation that might have taken place prior to or after the Bill is
passed. It provides a power to carry out further consultation, if
necessary, although I understand that members of the Committee hope
that it will not be necessary; indeed, I also hope that it will not be
necessary.</div><a name="090624118000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">Therefore,
I believe that subsection (5), which has been proposed by the
Government, meets the intention of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
amendment and I ask the Committee to reject that
amendment.</div><a name="090624118000167"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090624118000378"></a>Mr.
Ainsworth:</b> Again, it seems to me that new
clause 2 does exactly the same job that I set out to do,
only it does it rather more elegantly. The Climate Change and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column23" />Column number: 23</div>Sustainable Energy Act 2006 enabled permitted development rights to
apply to some microgeneration installations, such as solar
installations. It did not extend to air source heat pumps or to
microwind technology. As was discussed on Second Reading&#151;I know
that the Liberal Democrats have an interest here&#151;that has proved
to be a real impediment to the development of those technologies. In
fact, the Government have long promised to do something about that and
clear away the bureaucratic blockages that are standing in the way of
the development of air source heat pumps and microwind.</div>
<a name="090624118000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">I said on
Second Reading and I will say it again now that I am not in favour of a
complete free-for-all; there must be proper consultation and proper
safeguards. So I seek the Minister&#146;s assurance on two points.
First, I hesitate to ask for it, in the light of what has recently been
discussed, but there should be consultation. Secondly, as far as
potential noise nuisance is concerned, the consultation will focus on
the noise level of 45 dB at the nearest property. That was agreed with
the Minister&#146;s predecessor and I think that that agreement is
still secure, but it would be very good indeed to hear confirmation
that it is secure from the present Minister.</div>
<a name="090624118000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">Therefore,
new clause 2 moves things on for air source heat pumps and microwind.
However, just to prove that nothing is ever perfect in life, there
remains unfinished business. I am certain that amendment (a), which was
tabled by the hon. Member for Cheltenham, derives from representations
made on behalf of proponents of the micro-hydro industry and in
particular from Mr. Anthony Battersby, chairman of the
Mendip Power Group. I warmly commend Mr. Battersby for his
work on behalf of the micro-hydro sector, which I strongly support.
However, I very much regret to say that I believe that there are
technical reasons why the Bill is not the appropriate vehicle for
taking this matter forward. It should be completely straightforward to
take it forward, but it is not. I understand that there are EU
environmental regulations to consider, along with Environment Agency
licensing considerations and abstraction licences, as well as consents
and processes to take into account. There are other Government
agencies, such as Natural England, that have a remit in this area and
their views need to be taken into account too.</div>
<a name="090624118000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is not
just that Mr. Battersby, sadly, made his points to me rather
late in the day. Even if he had made them to me slightly earlier, it
would still have been enormously difficult to have included provision
for micro-hydro in the Bill. Furthermore, it is not as if the obstacles
that micro-hydro faces are only related to the planning process. Of
course, it is the planning process that new clause 2 is principally
concerned with.</div>
<a name="090624118000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although I
would encourage the hon. Member for Cheltenham to withdraw his
amendment, I hope we will hear some encouraging news from the Minister
about the Government&#146;s future plans to unblock these obstacles
to the development of micro hydro power. I know that Mr.
Battersby is aware that Conservatives have pledged to reform the
licensing system as soon as is practicable. I hope we will hear again
from the Minister that there is all-party agreement about the need to
move forward on this potentially very exciting form of micro
power.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090624118000379"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I am grateful for the fairly supportive comments
from the hon. Member for East Surrey. He speculates as to who
approached me in relation to hydropower. He is wrong&#151;it was my
hon. Friend the Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath),
who is a great champion of hydropower in this House and who is very
proud of telling me that his constituency may have no escalators, but
it has lots of rivers.</div>
<a name="090624118000178"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090624118000380"></a>Mr.
Ainsworth:</b> I am prepared to take what the hon. Gentleman
says at face value, but I know where Mr. Battersby
lives.</div>
<a name="090624118000179"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090624118000381"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> That sounds rather
threatening.</div><a name="090624118000180"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090624118000382"></a>Mr.
Ainsworth:</b> It was not intended to be threatening. If you
visit him, I am sure he will tell you all about
micro-hydropower.</div>
<a name="090624118000181"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090624118000383"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> It is an important point. As the hon. Member for
East Surrey says, it is true that there are genuine difficulties with
incorporating micro-hydro in the same way that other energy sources
have been included, mainly because of extraction licences and their
environmental and European implications. These are, however,
frustrating and irritating impediments and it is very important that we
set a timetable for trying to remove them. It is important to have
extraction licences where large amounts of water are being taken into
the general water supply and being returned a few hundred yards further
down the river. This is nonsense. Some encouraging news, as the hon.
Member for East Surrey called it, from the Minister would be rewarding.
We framed the amendment trying to take account of that. That is why it
has rather more open phraseology and also a two-year timetable. If the
Minister could take up that level of ambition, it would be very
encouraging. Under the circumstances, and in anticipation of the
encouraging news, I am happy to withdraw the amendment.</div>
<a name="090624118000182"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090624118000384"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> The Government have tabled new clause 2 to
replace clause 5. Before explaining the merits of that, I will briefly
set out why we cannot support clause 5 as it stands. I will then deal
with amendment (a), where I hope my news might be
encouraging.</div>
<a name="090624118000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 5
requires the Secretary of State to bring forward legislation to grant
permitted development rights to small wind turbines and air source heat
pumps on, or within the curtilage of, a dwelling house within three
months of the day on which the legislation is passed. First, let me
assure the Committee that we intend to consult shortly on the
introduction of permitted development rights for these technologies on
domestic premises, with a view to introducing the necessary
legislation.</div><a name="090624118000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">Committee
members may be aware that we consulted on the principle of extending
permitted development rights to wind turbines and air source heat pumps
in domestic properties back in 2007, but there were some outstanding
issues to resolve, particularly in relation to noise. We have now moved
further forward on that issue and I can confirm, as I was asked to do
by the hon. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column25" />Column number: 25</div>Member for East Surrey, that we have agreed to test out a higher noise
limit&#151;45 dBA&#151;through the consultation
process.</div><a name="090624118000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
plan to issue the consultation document later this summer; it will set
out our detailed proposals for permitted development rights for wind
turbines and air source heat pumps on domestic premises. The Government
generally consult for 12 weeks on policy proposals, following which we
will need to analyse responses and decide on the appropriate way
forward. Once we have decided on final proposals, we will need to draft
the secondary legislation that will implement the permitted development
rights. The draft legislation will prescribe the technical
specification of the technology and method of installation. This places
a requirement on us&#151;I am sorry to say this&#151;to refer the
amendments to the order to the European Commission, so as to allow
other member states to consider the proposals and ensure that we are
not creating barriers to entry into the market for European companies.
This process takes a minimum of three months. If other member states
raise objections, the time scale is extended.</div>
<a name="090624118000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
therefore a number of hurdles for us to overcome before introducing the
legislation, and we cannot go through all those processes within three
months, which is why the new clause proposes to extend the period to
six months. Finally, the changes to the general permitted development
order will automatically be subject to negative procedure by virtue of
section 333 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990;
clause 5(3) is therefore
superfluous.</div>
<a name="090624118000187"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090624118000385"></a>Charles
Hendry:</b> I should be grateful if the Minister clarified a
couple of things. In my constituency, as in that of the hon. Member for
Cheltenham, there are a significant number of listed properties. Will
she ensure that the consultation exercise will look at the development
issues in relation to such properties? It is not simply a planning
issue, but a question of whether there may be a need for listed
building consent, as
well.</div><a name="090624118000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will
the Minister also look at the pressure that the air source heat pumps
put on the electricity infrastructure? I am a great supporter of such
pumps, but there is no record of where they are being installed. The
local electricity network will need to be upgraded to accommodate the
extra electricity demand, and it would be helpful to have a system in
place whereby somebody actually knows the number of pumps being
installed, so that necessary upgrades can be carried
out.</div><a name="090624118000189"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090624118000386"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman for those two
important points. I share his concern about listed properties. I
recently spoke at a meeting organised by the Church of England, which
owns many listed properties. We talked about whether new technologies
could be installed, and the difficulties faced. He is absolutely right
that we need to look at the issue. He is also right about the pressure
on the supply from air source heat pumps. The piloting that has
occurred has been brought to our attention, and the matter clearly
needs to be addressed. The consultation will have to look at both those
matters.</div><a name="090624118000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clause 2 will replace clause 5 and requires the Secretary of State to
amend the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development)
Order 1995 in relation to England to introduce permitted development
rights for wind turbines and air source heat pumps on, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column26" />Column number: 26</div>or within, the curtilage of a dwelling house. The term &#147;dwelling
house&#148; is defined in the interpretation clause of the Bill, and
reflects the broad concept of what constitutes use as a dwelling house
for the purposes of planning legislation. Adopting that broad
definition will allow us to address concerns about the treatment of any
particular buildings that would naturally fall within the definition,
but which may need to be treated differently in respect of any of the
rights proposed. We may then make appropriate amendments to the GPDO to
take account of those
concerns.</div><a name="090624118000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amending
the GPDO for the technologies is a natural follow-up to the legislation
we introduced in April last year, when we extended permitted
development rights to various types of domestic microgeneration
equipment, such as solar panels, ground and water source heat pumps,
biomass flue systems and combined heat and power system flues. The
Government have always planned to extend permitted development rights
to domestic wind turbines and air source heat
pumps.</div><a name="090624118000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
consultation that we will issue later this summer will set out our
proposals for permitted development rights for wind turbines and air
source heat pumps. The consultation will propose that the installation
of those technologies should, among other criteria, be subject to a
noise limit of 45 dBA at the window of a habitable room in any
neighbouring property, as the hon. Member for East Surrey has
suggested.</div><a name="090624118000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
new clause specifies that amendments to the GPDO must be made within
six months of the Act coming into force. That should allow sufficient
time to assess the consultation responses, finalise the legislation and
then go through the necessary clearance procedures with the European
Commission, prior to introducing the legislation, which is planned for
April
2010.</div><a name="090624118000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
new clause places a requirement on the Government to review the
effectiveness of the amendments to the GPDO as soon as practicable
following two years of the amendments having been made. That provides
an opportunity for the Government to assess how well the permitted
development rights are working, and in particular to assess the
appropriateness of any noise limits that might be contained in the
legislation. In conclusion, the new clause is an important driver for
the work we are doing to introduce permitted development rights for
wind turbines and air source heat pumps on domestic properties. I
therefore ask Committee members to support the new
clause.</div><a name="090624118000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
I need to explain why the Government cannot support amendment (a). The
amendment requires the Secretary of State to bring forward proposals to
introduce permitted development rights for micro-hydropower in a
domestic setting within two years of the Act coming into force, as the
hon. Member for Cheltenham said. The Government have considered the
introduction of permitted development rights for micro-hydropower
already and we have rejected it. I shall explain why.</div>
<a name="090624118000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Department for Communities and Local Government, in conjunction with
the Welsh Assembly Government and the Planning Inspectorate,
commissioned Entec UK Ltd to review the operation of development orders
surrounding permitted development rights for householders to install
microgeneration equipment  within the curtilage of a dwelling
house, and to make recommendations for improving those development
orders.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column27" />Column number: 27</div><a name="090624118000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">As part of that work,
the consultants examined the potential for hydro schemes to benefit
from permitted development rights. The consultants undertook extensive
discussions with the industry and local authorities, and examined case
studies to inform their work. They found that domestic hydro schemes
were very rare and that very few would fall within the curtilage of a
dwelling house, which is the accepted extent of permitted development
rights for householders. Participants in the workshops, including the
British Hydropower Association, shared that view. The consultants
concluded that domestic hydro schemes are so rare and potentially
complex&#151;including engineering and construction works, as well as
watercourse abstraction&#151;that changes to permitted development
rights are not required or appropriate.</div>
<a name="090624118000198"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090624118000387"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I am rather disappointed by the Minister&#146;s
emerging response and&#151;given the number of dwelling houses that
are converted water mills, where the drop in water height is and has
been sufficient to generate energy&#151;surprised. Surely that is a
common occurrence. At the risk of going against my previous advice and
suggesting that further consultation is required, I urge the Minister
to look more carefully at this matter in
future.</div>
<a name="090624118000199"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090624118000388"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> I appreciate that what I have said so far is
deeply disappointing to the hon. Gentleman, but I will come on to
something that may improve his mood. I do not think that we need to
consult because this was clearly a thoroughgoing and properly
constructed consultation and the results were very negative. However,
the hon. Gentleman and the hon. Member for East Surrey will be aware
that there are factors that make getting permission for such
microgeneration facilities very difficult. We need to address those
factors, which I intend to do in a moment.</div>
<a name="090624118000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
consultants recommended that above-ground pipelines might be permitted
development, provided they were up to 0.5 m in height. However, the
Government concluded that such a small change would not really achieve
much in practice, given that the rest of the scheme had to get planning
permission anyway. The proposal not to include permitted development
rights for hydro schemes was the subject of a consultation&#151;the
second consultation&#151;from April to June 2007. Of those who
commented on the hydro proposal, 84 per cent. agreed that it should not
have permitted development
rights.</div><a name="090624118000302"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4
pm</div><a name="090624118000201"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090624118000389"></a>Mr.
Ainsworth:</b> Is that not possibly because 84 per cent. of
the people who responded were promoting different
technologies?</div><a name="090624118000202"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090624118000390"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> I am tempted to say that the hon. Gentleman could
be right. I have not read the responses to that particular
consultation, which happened several years ago. However, when looking
at responses to consultations and coming to a judgment, the Government
are careful to consider whether it is a fair response, or whether it
might be otherwise motivated. I am relying 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column28" />Column number: 28</div>on what I have been told, and one might consider the consultation from
the point of view of the previous consultation, after which all that
the consultants could come up with was, &#147;We&#146;ll let them
have a few pipes above ground.&#148; We are looking now at a second
consultation, which was based on the conclusions of the first, and I
have to believe that it is a fair representation and that the first one
was not the way forward.</div>
<a name="090624118000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">In summary,
the Government&#146;s view on the matter has been informed by the
consultations, but also by discussions with the industry, local
authorities, and environmental and professional bodies. Our view has
been the subject of public consultation and we have found that there is
little appetite for permitted development rights in a domestic context
for hydro
technologies.</div><a name="090624118000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
take this opportunity to assure Committee members that we are aware of
concerns relating to the environmental permitting systems for
micro-hydro power. When I was a DEFRA Minister I had to deal with
environmental permitting and I know what a nightmare it is. The
Environment Agency is already working on implementing a good practice
guide for small-scale hydro, which will be published by the end of next
month. Those who are interested will undoubtedly wish to get hold of
that good practice guide, to see if it complies with their
needs.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090624118000391"></a>Mr.
Ainsworth:</b> I am grateful to the Minister and apologise for
interrupting her again. I vividly recall visiting the hydro project in
New Mills, Derbyshire recently. There was a plan to install an
Archimedes screw into the river there, which was going to power the
local primary school. The plan ran into all sorts of problems with the
Environment Agency, which insisted that an abstraction licence was
required, even though the water was simply going to be deviated a few
yards, turn through a screw, and be put back
in.</div><a name="090624118000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
accept that it might be rather a white-knuckle ride for local
fish&#151;if they had knuckles&#151;to go through the Archimedes
screw, but I cannot believe that any serious environmental damage was
going to be done. That is the sort of problem that people encounter,
and I hope that the Government will take these issues seriously and get
some reform in place.</div>
<a name="090624118000207"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090624118000392"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> Let me assure the hon. Gentleman that we have
taken this seriously and that we believe, as he does, that the system
could be very much improved. I am pleased to tell Committee members, on
behalf of DEFRA, that we can commit to a complete review of the
environmental consent process for micro-hydro power. Hon. Members will
be delighted to hear that the aim of the review will be to develop
recommendations for a streamlined system that is quick and easy for
developers, but which maintains a high level of environmental
protection.</div><a name="090624118000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
review will be undertaken by the Environment Agency&#151;working in
co-operation with DEFRA&#151;within a year of the Bill coming into
force. It will take account of any ongoing, or future, work. While the
Government cannot support amendment (a), I hope that hon. Members will
accept the Government&#146;s commitment to this important sector. I
hope that the hon. Gentleman will feel able to withdraw the
amendment.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column29" />Column number: 29</div><a name="090624118000209"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090624118000393"></a>Charles
Hendry:</b> That is a welcome proposal and we are keen to
support micro-hydro power. However, can the Minister clarify for the
Committee what, exactly, will be delivered within a year? Is it the
policy that will be put in place, a document for consultation, or a
review? Exactly what will have happened within 12
months?</div><a name="090624118000210"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090624118000394"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> I cannot do more than repeat what I said to the
hon. Gentleman, which is that the review will be undertaken by the
Environment Agency, working in co-operation with DEFRA, within a year
of the Bill coming into force. The review will take account of any
ongoing and future work. This is a review which is directed at getting
a new system, so that developers have a streamlined system that is
quick and easy for them. It will provide the recommendations for that
to happen. That is as much as I am able to tell him at this stage; it
is a DEFRA lead, and, having worked in the area of environmental
permitting, I know that there is no doubt this is a very complex
matter. My words are on the record as to what we seek to achieve, and
that is to get improvements into this area so that these technologies
can be put in place much more easily and quickly&#151;clearly having
to use planning permission, but dealing with some of the barriers and
frustrations that hon. Members have raised here
today.</div>
<a name="090624118000211"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090624118000395"></a>Mr.
Ainsworth:</b> I am most grateful to the Minister for her
response to what has been a worthwhile debate. I wholly agree with her
analysis that this new clause is potentially a very major driver,
putting real weight behind air source heat pump technology and micro
wind, and that offers very exciting opportunities for job creation,
carbon reduction, and cost reduction as well. So I warmly support the
new clause, and I thank the Minister also for her response to the
Liberal Democrats&#146; amendment, which I think has some nuggets of
hope contained within it.</div>

<a name="090624118000215"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090624118000396"></a>Mr.
Ainsworth:</b> No nuggets of hope here, I am afraid. The
purpose of clause 6, as originally drafted, was to end the anomalous
position whereby people or businesses who improve their properties
through the installation of micro power technologies may suffer on
revaluation an increase in their tax. It strikes me as logically the
case that this acts as a disincentive to people and businesses who want
to do the right thing. It therefore struck me that this Bill was the
right vehicle in which to raise this matter, to test the
Government&#146;s thinking on it. I confess I had no great hope of a
positive outcome. An unseen hand drafted me a speaking note on this
issue, and the fact is that I have conceded that clause 6 will probably
not form part of the Bill.</div>
<a name="090624118000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">The unseen
hand drafted the
following:</div><a name="090624118000294"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;This
deletion is clearly the idea of counter-revolutionary forces in the
civil service. However, who am I to oppose the forces of
reaction?&#148;</div>
<a name="090624118000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister, I am
afraid, finds herself in the position of the forces of reaction this
afternoon.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column30" />Column number: 30</div><a name="090624118000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do accept
that where households are concerned&#151;because revaluations are,
thankfully, pretty rare&#151;a relatively small number of people
might be affected by this. But there may be consequences for small
businesses, particularly where revaluations are rather more common. So
I do remain concerned about the principle at stake here: we should not
be penalising people who are doing the right thing. For the sake of the
rest of the Bill, however, I am reluctantly prepared to ditch clause 6,
but not until I have heard the Minister produce a halfway decent,
plausible excuse for the Government&#146;s approach to this important
matter.</div>
<a name="090624118000219"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090624118000397"></a>Colin
Challen:</b> It is a slight matter of regret that that little
speech had to be made, but I will go along with the proposer of the
Bill in his conclusion on that. I do hope that we will get a very
positive reply from the Minister, because we are considering&#151;at
the same time as we are looking at this Bill&#151;other possibilities
for changing council tax to recognise energy efficiency measures, and
some local authorities and British Gas and others have participated in
pilots where people have been rewarded for energy efficiency in their
homes with reductions in council tax. This proposal is exactly of that
order. If people are going to go out spend money on good things, they
should be rewarded for it. I hope that the Minister will be able to
tell us how the Government are going to approach this in the absence of
this clause.</div>
<a name="090624118000220"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090624118000398"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I have always wanted to stand against the forces
of reaction and I am happy to join the hon. Member for East Surrey on
the barricades in favour of many revolutionary measures, but this one
in particular, any day. It seems like an eminently sensible measure to
introduce. I have heard the Government&#146;s excuses and none seems
very convincing. One such excuse is that energy efficiency and
mircrogeneration is unlikely to sufficiently increase the value of a
property to push it beyond a particular council band boundary. I cannot
see how the Government could possibly know that, because if it had only
been marginally below it to start with, the prospect of buying a
property with much lower energy bills than its neighbour seems to be
eminently likely to push it over a small marginal increase that would
take it into a higher band.</div>
<a name="090624118000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another
excuse has been that the council tax system already disregards
improvements until a property is sold. This is a long-term piece of
legislation and one that not only applies when a property is first
sold, but in subsequent sales as well. As the hon. Member for Morley
and Rothwell quite rightly said, we ought to reward and incentivise
such improvements and not, potentially, punish
them.</div>
<a name="090624118000222"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090624118000399"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> There is no challenge there then, is there? I
just say to the hon. Member for East Surrey that, as well as the unseen
hand, this will not be the first time that he has accused me of being
the forces of reaction, but I remain named as such because of what I
have to say.</div>
<a name="090624118000223"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090624118000400"></a>Mr.
Ainsworth:</b> I do not know who the hon. Lady is referring
to. I was very careful to read out a redacted version of what the
unseen hand had written.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column31" />Column number: 31</div><a name="090624118000224"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090624118000401"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> Let me just say that my colleague, the former
Minister of State for Energy and Climate Change, my right hon. and
learned Friend the Member for North Warwickshire (Mr.
O'Brien), made it clear on Second Reading that the Government could not
support the inclusion of this clause in the Bill. I guess that the hon.
Member for Cheltenham may be, in listing the so-called excuses, quoting
from my right hon. and learned Friend. I will, I am afraid, have to
make the same arguments today that were made by right hon. and learned
Friend on Second Reading, because of course these matters have not
changed. Therefore, we have to oppose, as the hon. Member for East
Surrey anticipates, that clause 6 should stand part of the
Bill.</div>
<a name="090624118000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 6
requires that an increase</div>
<a name="090624118000295"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;in the value
of a property arising from the installation of an energy efficiency
measure or a microgeneration system after the day on which this Act is
passed shall be disregarded for the purpose of assessing council tax or
non-domestic rates payable on that
property.&#148;</div><a name="090624118000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">Council
tax, as we all know, is a property tax based primarily on the value of
a person&#146;s home. There are no plans to link the level of council
tax that a person has to pay to how energy-efficient their home and
property is. At present, making changes or improvements to a property
that increases its value cannot result in a higher council tax band
until the property is sold, as the hon. Member for Cheltenham said. An
increase in the band will take place only if the alterations add
sufficient value to the property to move it into a higher band. He
disputes that that is likely; the advice that we have from the
Department for Communities and Local Government is that that is the
case.</div>
<a name="090624118000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">The value of
a dwelling depends on a number of factors, including its size, lay-out,
character and locality. Generally, any improvements made to a property
will not be taken into account for banding purposes unless, as I said,
the property is sold. Even then, the alterations will not necessarily
mean an increase in the council tax band. That will happen only if the
alterations have added sufficient value&#151;reflecting 1991
values&#151;to push the property into the higher
band.</div>
<a name="090624118000228"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090624118000402"></a>Colin
Challen:</b> If somebody were to consider purchasing a house
that may fall into a higher property band, then that would act as a
disincentive&#151;a perverse disincentive, in fact&#151;because
they might choose another property which may not fall into that
category. This needs careful
re-examination.</div><a name="090624118000303"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.15
pm</div><a name="090624118000229"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090624118000403"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> The argument is that people choose properties for
a huge variety of reasons. Location is normally a prime issue and, as
the hon. Gentleman rightly suggests, people will be influenced by have
a whole list of subsidiary factors. If they have the prospect of buying
an energy-efficient home, they might well way weigh in the balance the
comparison between the cost of their energy and the cost of their
council tax. They might still favour the more energy-efficient home,
even though there might be a slight difference in the council tax band.
It is a relatively small factor. I do not think we can anticipate its
being such a major one as to determine council tax banding, as opposed
to energy-efficiency being a significant factor in people&#146;s
choice of home. Clearly, we are not going to agree.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column32" />Column number: 32</div><a name="090624118000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will say to
all hon. Members, that, having worked on a variety of issues across
Government to try to apply positive measures to homes, there is always
the call to use the council tax system as a means of rewarding people.
I understand that people who have to deal with financial matters are
reluctant to pile more and more factors into how council tax banding
should be set. It is extraordinarily complex and there can be rewards
that are quite different and separate.</div>
<a name="090624118000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
that said, if local authorities want to incentivise the use of
microgeneration in homes, they can use their own existing powers. Those
are the council tax discounts powers, under section 13A of the Local
Government Finance Act 1992, for properties with higher standards of
energy performance. The council would set a level of council tax
reflecting that, which would then be revenue neutral to the authority.
Taxpayers not qualifying for the discount would, effectively, subsidise
those that do, providing a further incentive for people to
act.</div><a name="090624118000232"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090624118000404"></a>Mr.
Ainsworth:</b> I hope that the Minister will come to the issue
of non-domestic rates, where what she has said will not
apply.</div>
<a name="090624118000233"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090624118000405"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> I will conclude on the matter of local
authorities and the scope they have. We are aware that, already, some
local authorities, with assistance from British Gas, have provided a
one-off rebate on council tax bills to council taxpayers who have taken
certain measures to improve energy efficiency in their homes. So there
is some scope&#151;there is a means of councils incentivising, and,
consequently, encouraging other home owners to do the same as those
being rewarded.</div>
<a name="090624118000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
non-domestic rates, microgeneration equipment is already ignored in the
assessment of rateable value until the next revaluation. The exemption
was introduced on 1 October 2008. It will also apply to any 2010 rating
list, so that equipment fitted between 1 April 2010 and 31 March 2015
will not be assessed for rates until
2015.</div><a name="090624118000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am told it is unlikely that fitting microgeneration equipment at
business premises would lead to a reassessment of their rateable value.
Nevertheless, the exemption was introduced to remove uncertainty, and
provide clarity and reassurance to businesses working to reduce their
carbon
footprint.</div><a name="090624118000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
know that what I have said will not meet with favour in the Committee,
but that is the position of the Government, it will not change. We are
opposed to clause 6 standing part of the
Bill.</div>
<a name="090624118000237"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090624118000406"></a>Charles
Hendry:</b> I am very uneasy about what the Minister has said.
I should have thought that one of the reasons people install
microgeneration, and the sort of technology under discussion, is that
it will increase the value of their homes&#151;and not just because
they want to do the right thing. What the Minister proposes could be an
absolute block on the sale of such houses. Even if it were a small
minority of houses, it might become known that they have moved into a
higher council tax band. That extra payment in council tax might negate
the feed-in tariff benefits that the householder derives. Therefore,
many people choosing between two houses&#151;one that has been
equipped with these technologies and one that has not&#151;will say,
&#147;I will go for the one that has  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column33" />Column number: 33</div>not, because there is no risk that I will then be put into a different
council tax band.&#148; We could put a black mark on houses which
have done the right thing. That seems a peculiar situation to be
in.</div>
<a name="090624118000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">The other
thing&#151;and this is a practical point&#151;is that the Minister
talks about the council tax being based on the 1991 valuation of those
properties. It is therefore expected that a valuation from 1991 will be
required, based on technology which was not invented until 10 years
later. What is the 1991 value of an air source heat pump? There cannot
be one because it was not invented. How, in practice, is this going to
work?</div><a name="090624118000239"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090624118000407"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> In posing the last question, he has answered the
case. It will not be possible for them to put a value on it and that
would preclude raising the council tax level. The hon. Gentleman spoke
about people having a block on doing the right thing and doing what we
would want them to; that is, installing microgeneration and making use
of feed-in tariffs where possible and appropriate. I believe that the
major motivation is that it will save people money on their energy
bills in the long term. Given the very high price of energy and the
unlikelihood of energy prices ever returning to previous levels, that
will be the motivation. People looking at property will see that and
when they buy it, they will know what the council tax band is. They are
not going into a risk situation because the council tax band is
established and the microgeneration is in place. The savings to them
will be obvious.</div>
<a name="090624118000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is a
matter of opinion. There are no absolutes. It is a small part of what
is going to influence people in their purchasing patterns. For other
reasons which I have just hinted at, I have to say that the fact that
there are so many demands to link so many policies to reductions in
council tax means that the Government will continue to resist, I am
afraid.</div>

Begg, may I thank you very much indeed for your chairmanship and
assistance to the Committee in our moments of need? I thank the
Minister very much for her courteous and thoughtful responses, and all
colleagues who have participated in moving the Bill forwards. No doubt,
we will look forward to meeting again on Report in due
course.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090624118000416"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> My thanks to you, Miss Begg, for presiding over
this Bill Committee. If all Public Bill Committees were as complete in
their consideration of amendments and were as quick as this, we should
all be very much happier. Perhaps we should recommend it to Mr Speaker
Bercow. The Government&#146;s amendments have, clearly, made many
technical improvements to the Bill and it is right to thank the
Minister for her support of it, in principle, and to thank her and her
team for the obvious hard work that has gone into those
amendments.</div>
<a name="090624118000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">It may be a
slightly more wishy-washy shade of green than the original Bill from
the hon. Member for East Surrey&#151;I repeat my congratulations to
him for bringing  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column37" />Column number: 37</div>his Bill this far&#151;but it is obviously a welcome step in the right
direction, and it is encouraging that all parties have agreed to
support this new legislation. We wish it well in its next
stage.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090624118000417"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> I cannot possibly agree that this is a less green
Bill than it was when it started. We intended to work with the hon.
Member for East Surrey to improve the Bill, to get it into a state
where it is more accurate, wider and deeper. We ran into some confusion
early on, and I will seek to make sure that that is clarified and that
we are able to proceed from here to the next stage of debate. Let me
again congratulate the hon. Gentleman and thank everybody concerned
with the Bill. I recognise that this is a Committee made up of people
who take these issues very seriously and work on 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column38" />Column number: 38</div>them a great deal. I have to say that, with some exceptions, we often
find consensus and I am pleased that it has happened
today.</div><a name="090624118000270"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090624118000418"></a>Mr.
Ainsworth:</b> And finally, Miss Begg, my thanks to all hon.
Members who have taken part in this Committee and especially to
you.</div><a name="090624118000271"></a>

enjoyed it. It has been my first private Member&#146;s
