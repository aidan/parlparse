<B>Mr. Malcolm Moss </B>(North-East Cambridgeshire): I beg to move amendment No. 73, in page 6, line 18, at end insert—<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>‘(8) The Police Authority shall require the Chief Constable to consult before using any part of the grant for police purposes to procure novel or contentious equipment or services and to provide at such intervals as it may reasonably specify details of all such expenditure incurred or funds committed within a specified period.’.<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take new clause 1—Novel or contentious equipment—<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>‘The Chief Constable shall consult the Police Authority before using any part of the grant for police purposes to procure novel or contentious equipment or services and shall provide the Police Authority at such intervals as it may reasonably specify with details of all expenditure incurred or funds committed since such details were last furnished.’.<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> Welcome back to the Chair, Miss Widdecombe. With your experience at the Home Office, you will be especially adept at making sure that we stay in order at all times.<P>
The amendment would insert a new subsection—(8)—in clause 9. Clauses 9, 10 and 11 relate to financial accountability and control. They also raise questions about efficiency and the reduction of bureaucracy.<P>
Who will be primarily responsible for the financial rectitude of the police service? Clauses 10 and 11 state that the Police Authority must provide estimates of receipts and payments; it must keep proper accounts and records relating to the accounts. It is required to submit those documents not only to the Secretary of State, but—perhaps, more importantly—to the Comptroller and Auditor General.<P>
The clauses place a heavy and important responsibility on the Police Authority. The members of the authority recognise that and take their responsibility seriously. It seems to them that if anything were to go wrong, the Police Authority would have to carry the can. For example, if there were irregularities in the accounting procedures, or if the Chief Constable’s spending decisions were seen, with hindsight, to have been slightly or fundamentally irresponsible, the authority would be pilloried in the press and accused of not providing proper oversight. Clauses 10 and 11 make it clear that the Police Authority has a serious and responsible task relating to these matters.<P>
It is important, in order to be reasonable and fair, that the Bill gives the Police Authority the power to command effective control and reporting systems without which it would be extremely difficult for the authority to do its job. That is the reasoning behind amendment No. 73.<P>
The amendment relates to the procuration by the Chief Constable of novel or contentious equipment or services. The Police Authority merely asks that it be fully consulted before such purchases are made.<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office (Mr. Adam Ingram):</B> It will be.<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> The Minister says that it will be, but that is not yet provided for in the Bill. The Police Authority wants written into the Bill the statutory requirement that it be consulted. That is not at all unreasonable: it is important so that the authority can cover its back. After all, the opprobrium of the community will fall on the Police Authority if anything goes wrong or equipment is purchased without its knowledge or agreement. In the context of the heavily charged political atmosphere in Northern Ireland, the purchase and use of certain types of equipment must be highly contentious. Therefore, to consider allowing purchase, and use in certain circumstances, without the Police Authority’s knowledge or agreement would be to invite considerable protest. I am thinking of plastic bullets, stun guns and similar equipment that would not ordinarily be on the purchasing list of chief constables in shire countries. Northern Ireland is unique, particularly on account of the threat from terrorism, so obviously the Chief Constable would be involved in the purchase of any special equipment. Amendment No. 73 also relates to<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“expenditure incurred or funds committed within a specified period.”<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
We ask that there be proper accounting on a quarterly basis—which seems reasonable regularity—to show not only how funds have been used but to make it clear to which services or equipment funds are being committed in the future. To achieve that, the Chief Constable would have to set up proper management accounts. Plenty of packages are available off the shelf for management accounting, but in this case proper procedures, possibly on an accrual accounting basis, would be required. I read this morning that the Chancellor is to introduce resource accounting, a new form of accounting for Government expenditure.<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland (Mr. Tony Worthington):</B> The truth.<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> That is interesting. Perhaps the Minister will tell us whether the Chancellor’s intentions in that respect have filtered down to the Northern Ireland Office, or beyond the Minister’s desk to the Chief Constable. A whole new vista is opened up by this new term. What does resource accounting mean? I think that it means making the best use of assets and resources.<P>
The amendment would simply require the Chief Constable to account to the Police Authority for the purchase of equipment—or, certainly contentions equipment. Not only equipment already purchased but any that he was thinking of purchasing would be covered. Accounting systems should be established to enable the relevant information to be produced and relayed to the Police Authority at short notice.<P>
The amendment would be an important addition to clause 9. It is not a probing amendment. The Police Authority would welcome such a wording. Proper consultation would be fair and reasonable in the context of the responsibility that the Bill— particularly clauses 10, 11 and 12—gives to the Police Authority. That is particularly true in relation to contentious equipment, which, in the Northern Ireland political context, is a hot potato. I am sure that, as the Minister agrees that consultation should take place, it will not take him long to accept that the amendment is reasonable and helpful.<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I have no quarrel with the intention behind the amendment, which makes sense in principle. I agree with much of what the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Moss) said when he moved the amendment.<P>
The Government have made it clear that we intend to require the Chief Constable to consult the authority should he wish to purchase novel or contentious equipment or services. However, “novel” and “contentious” are terms without meaning in legislation, and it would be inappropriate to put such a requirement on the face of the Bill.<P>
I appreciate the issues that were raised by the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire and in representations by the Police Authority and I intend to include the requirement in the financial instructions that will set out the details of financial management arrangements under the Bill. That matter was touched on in our debate on clause 3 at column 129, when I made my intentions clear. The amendment also deals with financial reporting arrangements. Once again, while I have no quarrel with the principle, the detail is not appropriate for primary legislation. Detailed arrangements might be required and they would be better worked out within tripartite working groups, involving the RUC, the Police Authority and the Government, over coming months. I have previously spoken about how we are trying to engage in that process. Statutory provision for reporting arrangements between the RUC and the authority is in any case contained in clause 48. The reporting mechanism is set out in some detail.<P>
I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept that the amendments are defective because of the problem of defining novel or contentious. If those terms were built into the Bill they would make it restrictive. It is better to treat financial arrangements separately from the primary aspects of the Bill, which would make it easier to amend in the light of new circumstances. If the financial aspects are included in the Bill, we will need to change primary legislation in order to amend them. It is usually impossible to achieve that.<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
We have tried to put in placed a mechanism that will take account of the Police Authority’s role in purchasing novel and contentious items, goods and services. Financial arrangements should be laid down but they should be properly examined separately from primary legislation. We are well aware of the importance of the Police Authority’s role in that respect, but it should not be included in the legislation because, as I said, it would make subsequent amendment difficult.<P>
The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire also spoke about resource accounting. I do not want to lecture him on that issue but it will be in place in the Police Authority and the RUC by the year 2000. The evaluation process is already in progress. We are moving forward towards effective accounting of financial arrangements. We recognise that financial rectitude is important so I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.<P>
<B>Mr. James Cran </B>(Beverley and Holderness): As my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Cambridgeshire made plain in his eloquent speech, considerable responsibility is placed upon the Police Authority, which is why we tabled the amendment. I shall not repeat all my hon. Friend’s points as the Minister has moved some distance towards us. I would like him, however, to clarify a couple of further points.<P>
First, the Minister said that it would normally be “inappropriate” to put an amendment such as amendment No. 73 “on the face of the Bill.” I understood his reasons, but for clarity and to assuage the Police Authority’s fears, will the Minister let us know when it would normally be appropriate to include in legislation the obligation embodied in our amendment. In other words, is the specific amendment wrong, or would it never be appropriate for such an obligation to be included in the Bill? I know that the Police Authority wants an answer to that question.<P>
Secondly, the Minister told us—quite responsibly—that the financial instructions will make it clear what the Chief Constable’s obligations are in this regard. But are the financial instructions merely passive—so that they may or may not be taken notice of—or do they amount to a legal obligation? If the Minister answers those two points—of course I cannot speak for my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Cambridgeshire—I would be satisfied.<P>

<P>

<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> If I used the word normally, I was expressing my innate cautiousness. such phraseology may be appropriate in other legislation. I have learnt in politics never to say never, and I am surprised that the hon. Gentleman has not learnt that; therefore, I hesitate to use the word “never”. Although my instinct tells me that it is appropriate in the context of the debate, the House is responsible for a range of legislation and I do not want to be held hostage by saying “never”, because I am not familiar with every measure that has been passed. I would hate to be told at some stage in my future career that I was wrong about the important Bill that we are considering.<P>
<B>Mr. Cran:</B> That is a political answer, which I did not want—I wanted a factual answer. Does the sort of provision that the amendment proposes never appear in legislation? I appreciate that the Minister may not be able to answer for other Departments, but he can answer for the Northern Ireland Office. Would the provision never be incorporated in a Northern Ireland Bill? It is a simple question.<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I do not now know what the hon. Gentleman is asking about the words “novel and contentious”. Those words would appear only in policing legislation. They would be unlikely to appear in health service legislation, because the tripartite relationship that the Bill describes does not apply to such measures. If we went through the legislation that applied to all Departments under the Northern Ireland Office, we would not find the specific phraseology, “novel and contentious”. Therefore, I shall use the word “never” in that context.<P>
The hon. Member for Beverley and Holderness (Mr. Cran) makes a political point by raising the matter. It may be one of his customary quiet filibusters, as he is not backed by supporters.<P>
The financial instructions have a legal dimension. Working arrangements that are set out in the Bill would have some status in law and would be cited in the case of a dispute about the actions of one element of the tripartite structure. The hon. Gentleman knows as much about the law as me—I am not a lawyer. However, an agreed set of operating instructions could be called in aid by parties to a dispute about their implementation. I do not want to provide a full legal explanation because I am not an accountant or a lawyer.<P>
<B>Mr. Cran:</B> It is shameful of the Minister to claim that I was filibustering—I made two small points. Like the Minister, I am not a lawyer, but I like to know the meaning of words, especially when they are put together. I want to know what it would mean if our proposal was incorporated in the financial instructions.<P>
The Minister used the phrase “some status”. That could mean something or nothing. As the Minister conceded, the amendment has a point. The Opposition need to be totally convinced about the status of the financial instructions. I am sure that my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Cambridgeshire has other points to make. However, if the Minister says that the parties are bound to the financial instructions, we will have achieved our end. The Minister cannot get away with saying that they have “some status”, because that is meaningless.<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> The hon. Gentleman asks me to prejudge the way in which a court would determine a matter. I cannot do that. Clause 39 specifies the Secretary of State’s power in publishing guidelines. They have a legal status, but every examination would always return to primary legislation. That is the nature of the way in which such matters are examined.<P>
I cannot prejudge what weight a particular judge or jury would place on various aspects, if they were to be considered in a court of law. We are talking as though there will always be points of conflict, but that has never happened. It has been the tenor of our debates that points of contention exist between the Police Authority, the Secretary of State and the RUC, but that is not the way in which it has worked in the past, nor, I suggest, is it the way in which it will work in future.<P>
Principles are included in the Bill, attached to which are guidelines—in this case, financial instructions—by which matters would operate. If issues are included in the Bill, how can they be changed easily at a later stage, if that is necessary? The Bill gives power to the Policy Authority, with financial instructions. The working groups will agree the correct parameters of the financial instructions and they will be given to the Police Authority. The three legs of the tripartite structure will then build on that, if I may use such a description. That is the way in which legislation would normally work; there is nothing new in dealing with the issue in such a way.<P>
If Conservative Members believe that there is a justification for altering the way in which the Government should govern—not only in Northern Ireland, but across all areas for which they have responsibility—I would be interested to hear that argument. They never advanced such an argument when they were in power. This is a normal and effective way of delivering good governance in any Department: the broad parameters are set in primary legislation and then guidelines, working practices and financial instructions accompany that primary legislation, which are easily amendable if necessary. That is the underlying principle: it is about good governance of the relationship between the RUC, the Chief Constable and the Secretary of State. I commend the clause to the Committee and I oppose the amendment.<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I am delighted that, within a few years, resource accounting will be introduced in the RUC and, no doubt, the Police Authority. It will be interesting to see how many police stations are closed or opened as a result of that, since the basis of resource accounting is to ensure that every asset and facility yields the appropriate and most efficacious return.<P>
We are not far apart on the issue. The Minister indicated that he recognises the important role of the Police Authority in its responsibility to present accounts of expenditure to the Secretary of State and, eventually, as a result of a latter clause, to the Comptroller and Auditor General. He expects proper consultation to take place and he does not expect a future Chief Constable, off his or her own bat, to purchase any equipment, let alone novel and contentious equipment. I accept the fact that the words “novel” and “contentious” are unsuitable in the Bill. <P>
<B>Mr. ingram:</B> Why does the hon. Gentleman seek to do it?<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I am not a lawyer. Until the words appeared and advice was given to the Minister, I presume that he did not know that they were off limits either.<P>
<B>Mr. Cran:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that it is rather strange for the Minister—at the end of his panegyric—to tell us that all we did in 18 years of Conservative Government was include broad principles in Bills, with details being elsewhere? Is my hon. Friend surprised that the Minister does not understand that amendments are tabled to tease out the Government’s intentions? Does he agree with me that we have achieved that aim this morning, but we still do not know what the words were in respect of my second question to the Minister?<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I agree. We are debating the problem of who talks to whom about the purchase of equipment, especially equipment that is politically sensitive in the context of Northern Ireland. There is no disagreement; by including in the amendment the words “novel or contentious” we hope to persuade the Minister to clarify the matters that will be covered by the guidelines issued by the Secretary of State under clause 39. When members of the Police Authority read the Hansard report of our debate this morning, they will want the comfort of a promise from the Minister that those matters will be attended to. If the amendment is accepted, in whatever form the Minister thinks is appropriate, there is no dispute. It will be in the Bill for all to see and if there are difficulties in the future between a Chief Constable and the Police Authority there will be no argument. We want clarification. <P>
There have been, to use the word, contentious Chief Constables in Northern Ireland and there may be others in the future. If we are to give police authorities additional powers we and the Police Authority must be certain of the boundaries between its responsibilities and those of the Chief Constable. Clauses 9, 10, 11 and 12 place massive responsibilities on the Police Authority. If the accounting system goes wrong and money is spent on equipment about which the Police Authority knows nothing, or if controls are not seen to be in place, the Police Authority is in the dock and carries the can, not the Secretary of State or the Chief Constable. Given the problems involved in purchasing equipment, it is important and not unreasonable for the Police Authority to want something a little firmer in the Bill.<P>
I am prepared to help the Minister. We can delete the words “novel or contentious” and leave the word “equipment” in the amendment. I assume that “equipment” would be acceptable in the Bill as it appears in plenty of other clauses. If the purchase of equipment by a Chief Constable is something about which he has to consult the Police Authority, the guidelines can specify how that consultation and reporting should take place. The guidelines could state that the Chief Constable must isolate new purchases of novel or contentious equipment in his quarterly account of the money that he or his committee spends on equipment. Thus the Bill will state that he must consult and report on the purchase of equipment. That is all we are asking for. As the Minister seemed to agree, in principle, with our aims, it is something that he might happily accept; whether our suggestion is included in clause 9 of clause 10 is up to him.<P>
I shall not press the amendment to a Division. We have taken up an important issue and made our point. The Police Authority wants the matter to be clarified. The Minister has already acknowledged the importance of consultation and, therefore, of financial reporting, as the two go hand in hand. It is no good the Chief Constable simply sending in his quarterly report, which shows that he has purchased highly contentious equipment, without first consulting. The accounting and reporting systems are the only control that the Police Authority and, subsequently, the Secretary of State and the Comptroller and Auditor General have to give them the required assurance that only equipment that has been agreed to has been purchased. <P>
We are not far apart on this issue and I would be more than happy to seek a form of words for clause 9 or possibly clause 10. The important point is that it should be a duty of the Chief Constable to consult the Police Authority and report on equipment purchases. In the context of Northern Ireland that should be in the Bill rather than just in guidelines which may or may not result from further discussions between the tripartite members.<P>
The Police Authority may push for such consultation and be overruled by the Secretary of State and the Chief Constable. Must there be mutual agreement on everything or can there be a two to one vote on such issues? That is not clear from the Bill? After this morning’s discussion the Police Authority will be no wiser; it will just have an assurance from the Minister that the issue will be looked at generally as the meat is put on the bones of the legislation.<P>
I am more than happy to accept the Minister’s assurance: he is an honest Minister and would not say what he did not mean. I am sure that he can see the merit in getting this sorted out, but he not be in post. He may be promoted or moved. It may be someone else who gets down to the nitty gritty. <P>

<P>

<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I may be on that side.<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I am relieved to hear it. What time scale is he thinking of before he swaps sides? Ministerial assurances have been known to fall foul of time and events.<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> Give names.<P>
Mr. Moss: No. That would take at least another hour and a quarter and we want to make some progress. We have made a reasonable point but we will not man the barricades on it. A simple agreement to use the word “equipment” and drop “novel or contentious” does not seem unreasonable. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<P>
Clause 9 ordered to stand part of the Bill.<H4><center>Clause 10</center></H4>
<H4><center>Funding of Police Authority—ancillary provisions</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 72, in page 6, line 29, leave out from ‘to’ to end of line 31 and insert ‘the Police Authority’.<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 40, in page 6, line 30, leave out from ‘Authority’ to end of line 31.<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> The amendment is fairly straightforward. It seeks to make a fundamental change to the status and power of the Police Authority. As I have already said, the Police Authority is responsible to the Secretary of State for the accounts for police purposes and its own administrative purposes. That comes in paragraphs (a)(i) and (a)(ii). Under clause 12 it must report on these matters in more detailed accounts.<P>
It is important that expenditure by the Chief Constable is reported in the first instance to the Police Authority. Clause 10(1)(a)(i) says that the Police Authority is responsible for submitting accounts to the Secretary of Sate “for police purposes”. The Police Authority has a duty to send estimates, receipts and payments to the Secretary of State for both police purposes and “general administrative purposes”. I am puzzled why subsection (2)(b) requires that the draft estimates must also go to the Secretary of State. The Minister will doubtless clarify why there is this replication within the Bill. <P>
Why are there three substantial clauses and a related clause about grants and financial probity whereas in the Police Act 1996 for England and wales there is just section 14 which has three subsections? Why are financial probity and accounting so much more difficult to control in Northern Ireland? In the 1996 Act there is no requirement to send accounts either to the Secretary of State or to the Comptroller and Auditor General. Why is it deemed necessary to do so in Northern Ireland?<P>
If the Police Authority has to submit directly to the Secretary of State its estimates of receipts and payments for police purposes, why must those draft estimates also be sent by the Chief Constable to the Secretary of State? Surely all that he needs to do is send them to the Police Authority, which will in time report them up the line to the Secretary of State.<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I thought that we would have had a longer debate on this issue. It is clear that the hon. Gentleman does not fully understand the differences between Northern Ireland and England and Wales in these matters. The hon. Gentleman can obviously correct me, but I am taking these as probing amendments.<P>
Clause 10, like clause 9, is unique to Northern Ireland because the funding arrangements are completely different there. In England and Wales the police grant is made up of two elements, one from the Home Office and the other from local authority funding. Police authorities in England and Wales function as local authorities and are subject to local authority finance arrangements. In Northern Ireland the position is entirely different. The Police Authority functions as a non-departmental public body and is subject to central Government financial arrangements.<P>
The Secretary of State determines the annual police grant as part of the public expenditure survey exercise. The amount of the grant for policing is allocated after consideration of all the competing demands from other Departments. That is why the 1970 Act differs from the Police Act 1964 on which it was based and why the provisions in this Bill are different from the Police Act 1996.<P>
The amendments are on a specific point. They seek to stop the Secretary of State seeing a draft of the estimates. They seek to allow the Secretary of State to see only the final authority approved estimates. I have a couple of comments on that. First, clause 10, subsections (1) and (3), safeguards the authority’s strategic financial role by giving it the right to submit the final estimate for the police grant.<P>
Secondly, the timetable for the processing of public expenditure bids within Government is extremely tight. As an ex-Minister, the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire should be aware of the pressures relating to the conclusions of public expenditure bidding procedures.<P>
The Secretary of State requires an indication of the police estimate—and all other major public sector spending programme estimates—as early as possible. That makes it possible for arguments to be advanced on behalf of particular budgets, so that various balances can be achieved. At present, Government officials work with the Police Authority and the RUC to arrive at an agreed bidding position before the official estimate is submitted.<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Clause 9 seeks to regularise that position, but takes account of the changes resulting from the Chief Constable’s new responsibilities. It seeks to ensure that the Secretary of State continues to receive an early indication of the police bid by seeing the draft estimates. The Police Authority raised that matter with us and the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire has also referred to it.<P>
It was explained to the Police Authority that the reason for sending the draft to the Secretary of State was purely to provide an indicative run of figures for use in preparing for the public expenditure round. That is an extremely complex exercise, carried out to tight time scales, and it is essential that an early outline of the likely police bid is received, especially given its substantial effect on the totality of the Northern Ireland block.<P>
However, as we explained to the Police Authority, it is not an attempt to dilute its role—far from it. Only the final estimates, forwarded by the authority, can be used in determining the allocation of public funds. Changes to the clause would significantly impede the smooth functioning of the financial machinery within government in Northern Ireland, and would leave the Secretary of State—who has to consider the bid against competing bids from the various Departments—in an impossible position.<P>
We should not forget that the Secretary of State sets the overall priorities for public funding in Northern Ireland and is ultimately accountable to Parliament; it is not the Chief Constable or the Police Authority.<P>
The amendments are not practical; they fly in the face of good governance and I ask, therefore, that they should be withdrawn.<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> It is the word “estimates” that clouds the issue. Clause 10(1)(a)(i) states:<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“The Police Authority shall prepare and submit to the Secretary of State, at such times and in such form as the Secretary of State may direct, estimates of the receipts and payments of the Authority for police purposes.”<P>
<P>
<P>
Does that not permit the Secretary of State to ask the Police Authority not only for details of current expenditure, receipts and payments, but also for estimates of future expenditure? The Secretary of State could ask for such details in good time for the round of discussions about public expenditure that would take place. There would be plenty of time for the Secretary of State to obtain that information. The clause replicates matters that have already been covered.<P>
I shall not press the amendment to a vote, even though it would strengthen the Police Authority’s arm. In one part of the Bill, the authority is asked to submit estimates of expenditure of all kinds—at any time and in any form required by the Secretary of State—and yet, in another part, it is by-passed because the draft estimates are supposed to go to the Chief Constable as well as to the Secretary of State. It looks as though the Police Authority cannot be trusted to do its job properly.<P>
Perhaps my interpretation of the word “estimate” differs from the dictionary or legal definition, but an estimate is not a factual expenditure figure. I understand an estimate to be an amount that one would expect to spend—the approximate expenditure—which would usually include estimates for future expenditure. That would meet the point in the amendment I shall not press the amendment to a vote. Perhaps the Minister will consider it on Report.<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Ingram:</B> To try to avoid unnecessary matters cluttering up Report stage, I draw the hon. Gentleman‘s attention to clause 10(1)(a), which covers the final position regarding assumptions about the requirements to be met for estimates, assuming that there is agreement. Clause 10(2) deals with the draft.<P>
We have tried to facilitate examination of the bid so as to reach the best possible position. If we were to leave matters until the last possible moment, as the amendment suggests, difficulties would arise when the Chief Constable, the Police Authority and the Secretary of State attempted proper debate and examination of a substantial part of the total Northern Ireland block that is linked to police expenditure. In a sense, clause 10 is a facilitation clause that tries to ensure maximum consideration and progress towards a conclusion. The hon. Gentleman said that he would not push the amendment to a Division but said that he might return to the subject on Report. After my further explanation of the meaning and purpose of the clause, I hope that he will not.<P>
<B>Mr. Cran:</B> As I understand it, the Police Authority made those comments to the Government and to others. It is interesting that although the authority was well aware of the nuances that the Minister properly spent some time outlining, it nevertheless encouraged the tabling of the amendments. What I also find interesting—I, in common with other hon. Members, do not have the technical expertise to argue with the Minister—is that the Police Authority remains unhappy, notwithstanding the fact that it knows as much as the Minister about its accounting procedures.<P>
Although the Minister was no doubt factually correct in what he told the Committee, I am left with the lingering worry that there is still opposition on the part of the Police Authority. Perhaps this goes to the heart of the comments of many of my hon. Friends, who recognise that the Government have to do much continually to assuage the concerns of members of the authority about their role in the new regime when the Bill becomes law.<P>
I heard what the Minister has said, but I also hear what the Police Authority say, and the two do not meet, notwithstanding that both know the accounting facts better than I do. We may therefore return to that lingering worry.<P>

<P>

<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> Clause 10(4) relates to<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“moneys received by the Police Authority other than by way of grant under section 9(1).”<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
Can the Minister provide some examples of moneys that a Police Authority might receive other than those provided directly by the Government under clause 9(1)?<P>
Subsection (5) reads:<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“The Police Authority shall in each financial year put at the disposal of the Chief Constable an amount equal to the amount of the grant for police purposes received in that year by the Authority”.<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
I should like clarification of the words “put at the disposal”. The Police Authority receives from the Secretary of State a grant, which, I assume, is ring-fenced. Part of it will be used for police purposes and part of it for general administrative purposes. I assume that the ring fencing constitutes a Chinese wall, and that it will be impossible to transfer money from one part to another.<P>
Under subsection (5), the Police Authority will put the ring-fenced money for police purposes at the disposal of the Chief Constable. Does that mean that the Police Authority will act as a bank account for the Chief Constable, who will draw out money as required? Or does it imply that an annual budget will be agreed beforehand by the Police Authority and the Chief Constable and that, as the money is drawn out, proper management accounts will show how it is spent under the agreed budget headings? If that is not the case, there will be problems at the end of the year, when spending is questioned.<P>
If monthly or quarterly management accounts are to be kept, it would be sensible to set items of expenditure under various headings against an agreed budget. Subsection (5) does not provide clearly for that. Perhaps the guidelines, or a subsequent clause, deal with the matter. I seek clarification about the way in which expenditure will be monitored. It is important that that happens; otherwise the Police Authority will act as a bank account for the Chief Constable. What is the point of giving the Police Authority money if it simply hands it over? It is responsible for the way in which the money is spent. Therefore a monitoring system should be established.<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire asked detailed questions about clause 10, especially about subsection (4).<P>
When the hon. Gentleman tabled earlier amendments, he was in close contact with the Police Authority. He intimated more than once that he spoke with its full authority and articulated its concerns. I am therefore at a loss as to why the hon. Gentleman does not understand subsection (4). The Police Authority could have told him about the sort of moneys that it receives, apart from Government grants. They include the rent for telecommunications masts, pension receipts and sales of land. Those items are not covered by the grant and cannot be predicted. Therefore a method of controlling the disbursement of that money needs to be established.<P>
Let me deal with clause 10(5). The Police Authority will set a budget on the foot of the annual plan. Expenditure will be monitored by the authority against its plan and budget.<P>
We return to the concept of working groups. We are trying to consult the Police Authority to work out the detail of how exactly those groups will work out in practice. If we could reach that point of engagement—every effort has been made to do so—we could make considerable progress and many of the questions raised by the Police Authority and others would not need to be raised again. We would be able to work out all the practical arrangements.<P>
The hon. Gentleman also asked about clause 10(5) and whether “an amount equal” can be<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“put at the disposal of the Chief Constable”.<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
The Chief Constable is responsible for the day-to-day management of the police grant but the authority sets the broader budget heads in the estimates it submits to the Secretary of State. Nevertheless, the Chief Constable must have some power over operational demands and some freedom to deal with the unexpected. That is what clause 10(5) seeks to achieve.<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
There are two key aspects. First there is the working groups and establishing the operational relationship between the Chief Constable and the Secretary of State. Secondly, we must take account of operational demands on the Chief Constable that cannot be predicted—and often are not predicted. We all know about the unique circumstances of Northern Ireland, which can create exceptional demands. I hope that the hon. Gentleman, having heard my explanation, will now accept that the clause should stand part of the Bill.<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for that clarification. However, it is obvious that the Government do not know at present exactly how the provisions will work out in practice. The words “put at the disposal” do not tell us how the arrangements will work in this new area of responsibility for the Police Authority and the Chief Constable. It would be better if we had rather more meat on the bone at this juncture. After all, the Bill could be enacted within a few weeks.<P>
We are not told exactly when the new arrangements will come into force, but it will obviously be fairly soon after the Act is passed and more work needs to be done about the practical arrangements. It is not surprising that the Police Authority is concerned: it does not know how the provisions will develop in the final analysis. It has fears of the unknown, which is why it is so important to work out the arrangements sooner rather than later because that is critical to developing a harmonious working relationship between the Chief Constable and the Police Authority, especially regarding expenditure. Both will need to know where the boundaries lie to avoid disputes arising as a result of uncertainty.<P>
The Minister spoke earlier about the fundamental difference between running a police service in Northern Ireland and running it in England and Wales. He intimated that four sections of Northern Ireland legislation were necessary for every one section of legislation for England and Wales.<P>
I have looked carefully at the legislation dealing with both areas—I am going back one clause, but I hope that I will be allowed to develop my theme. Clause 9(1) states:<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“The Secretary of State shall for each financial year make to the Police Authority . . .a grant for police purposes”<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
Of course, the grant for “general administrative purposes” is dealt with under sub-paragraph (ii). Clause 46 of the 1996 Act states, under the heading “Police grant”:<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“Subject to the following provisions of this section, the Secretary of State shall for each financial year make grants for police purposes to—<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) police authorities for areas other than the metropolitan police district”—<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
which is covered by a later section. The grant money in both cases comes to the Police Authority from the Secretary of State, so I see no fundamental difference.<P>
I know that in the old days police authorities were different. The local county precept was used. However, now a direct grant from the Secretary of State goes to police authorities, and virtually all the moneys now expended by police authorities in England and Wales come, I believe—though I should be happy to be corrected—from central Government. Very little is raised from local resources at county level. I disagree about there being a fundamental difference in the instance that we are considering. The Bill has many clauses relating to financial accounting and control, whereas the corresponding Legislation for England and Wales is just one section and three subsections.<P>
It is not clear what is meant by the words “put at the disposal”. I share the Police Authority’s concern about that. The Minister should clarify as soon as he can how the arrangement will work. The matter is just one of many points of uncertainty.<P>
<B>Mr. Cran:</B> The Minister earlier made a rather tetchy response to the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Cambridgeshire. He forgot that hon. Members are in Committee to ask questions. The Minister’s attitude was improper. I do not want to chide him too much, but I stress that the Opposition are nobody’s mouthpiece. We have an obligation, should we consider matters unclear, to probe the Minister. The present debate is in that category, and so were my hon. Friend’s questions.<P>
I am uneasy. The Minister—whose words I did not take down this time—said that he hoped the Bill would be on its way to being an Act in a few weeks. Who knows? It might be—though there could be an awful lot more to talk about. It is a surprise to some of us that many aspects of the key relationships between the principals—the Police Authority, the Chief Constable and the Secretary of State—are languishing in a certain lack of definition.<P>
I acknowledge the assurance from the Minister—who has been very fair minded, and who I hope will agree that we have been fair minded too—that all will become clear when the working groups begin to meet and talk to one another. That is a fair point to make and I agree. However, I am moderately surprised, given the scale of the proposed changes—they are pretty considerable, requiring some adjustment of the relationship between the principals—that, because the working groups have not, for reasons that I understand, begun their work, no other talking has gone on at all.<P>
The Minister, or his officials—goodness knows, he has plenty of them—could have done what any normal person would expect them to do, which is to tell the Police Authority, for example, what is included in the Bill. Referring to the last point that was raised, I am surprised that the Minister did not tell the Police Authority that details of the financial memorandum would be included in the Bill. Also, I am surprised that the Minister has not responded to the points made by my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Cambridgeshire. His and his officials’ ability to communicate to the Police Authority and others seems somewhat deficient.<P>
As soon as our debate finishes at 1 o’clock—assuming we finish then—the Minister should consult his officials back in the Province and make a few appointments with various other principals to discuss several issues. If he does that, I am convinced that he will have his wish that the Bill be passed within a few weeks.<P>
Conservative Members are worried at the lack of definition in the Minister’s statements, particularly in response to the questions asked by my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Cambridgeshire. If the Minister does not take that point into account, we shall return to it in other amendments, which I know he does not want.<P>

<P>

<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I certainly do not want that. I shall try not to be tetchy because I understand that the hon. Member for Beverley and Holderness (Mr. Cran) is a sensitive wee soul and gets a bit upset if I say the wrong thing in the wrong way. <P>
I shall try to explain again so that there is a clear understanding of the process. The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire said that the Government do not seem to know to what the following phrase in clause 10(5) alludes:<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“put at the disposal of the Chief Constable”.<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
There is a clear understanding of that phrase and its impact: the money is put at the disposal of the Chief Constable because he has day-to-day management of the police grant and it is the responsibility, role and function of the Police Authority to set the broad budget heads.<P>
It is not the Police Authority’s role to involve itself in detailed operational decisions of the Chief Constable or the RUC; it has a different role and a different function. Perhaps that is where the difficulty has arisen. It may be thought that the Police Authority runs the RUC on a day-to-day basis and that it should be involved in the minutiae of every penny that the Chief Constable spends and should be second-guessing and determining the Chief Constable’s every decision. That is not the way it works, nor should it be. I hope that that message can be brought home elsewhere. There are different roles to be played by the two agencies in policing Northern Ireland.<P>
I shall explain the other point made by the hon. Member for Beverley and Holderness. He said that officials in the Northern Ireland Office have not been trying to engage in the process of consulting the Police Authority. The very opposite is the case. Time and time again, I have told the Committee that we have tried to start that process. We last wrote to the Police Authority on 4 February, asking it to make its nominations for the working groups to start studying the details. We have not yet received the nominations.<P>
The Police Authority has received a full explanation—both in writing and in other points of contact—about the various aspects of the Bill and the way in which it should work in practice. We need detailed working out to ensure that there is a smooth application and implementation of the Bill. As the Minister, acting for the Secretary of State and in conjunction with police service officials, I could say, “This is the way it is going to be done.” However, that does not make good working practices.<P>
We have tried to get through the process of meeting round the table for discussion and consultation so that we can define in greater detail the minutiae of the way in which the Bill will work in practice. That we have not yet done so is not because of any reluctance to reach that point on the part of the Northern Ireland Office, myself as Minister or the Chief Constable. If there is to be a public plea, I ask that the Police Authority engages in the tripartite structure of the working groups so that we can make progress.<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> For my part, I shall encourage the Police Authority quickly to accede to the Minister’s reasonable request and engage in that tripartite structure. It is all very well to be critical of legislation but the Police Authority is an important leg of this three-legged stool. It should do what is required and co-operate quickly in the best possible way.<P>
I did not say that I wanted the day-to-day running of the RUC to be overseen by the Police Authority. However, if the Bill states that it is responsible for accounting for expenditure at the end of a financial year and for sending accounts to the Secretary of State and to the Comptroller and Auditor General, and there are problems in the accounts, the Police Authority will take the responsibility. That is pretty much the requirement in the Bill.<P>
The Minister can achieve his aim, with which I do not disagree, of the Chief Constable having operational control of expenditure on a day-to-day basis. Of course, the RUC cannot budget for everything that comes its way in a given year, especially in the circumstances prevailing in Northern Ireland; but there should be a contingency fund into which the Chief Constable can dip for operational matters.<P>
I am no expert—I have not seen a set of accounts from the Chief Constable—but I imagine that 80 to 90 per cent. of expenditure is on salaries, especially pay for overtime. The Chief Constable must react to deteriorating security situations, when expenditure on overtime increases at an astronomic rate. We have not discussed how such matters will be monitored in future.<P>
We certainly could not give the Police Authority a finite figure for policing purposes and say, “That is your budget for the year in the context of Northern Ireland,” unless the Bill stated that the Chief constable and the Police Authority should have recourse to contingency funds in a deteriorating security situation, when more money is needed to pay overtime. Where in the Bill is allowance made for such an important contingency? It is germane to the financial relationship between the Police Authority and the Chief Constable. Is the Chief Constable, through the Police Authority, allowed to ask the Secretary of State for additional funds in a given year? I presume that that facility is available, but I do not know where it is stated in the Bill. Perhaps we have not yet come to that clause. However, financial matters should be in clauses 9 to 13. The Minister must respond quickly to my point.<P>
I do not want the day-to-day operation or control of expenditure by the police force to be overseen by the Police Authority in the way suggested by the Minister. However, monitoring that expenditure against the budget is important. It is important, too, to establish how it will work in practice. In addition, how will the Police Authority and the Chief Constable apply for extra funds, over and above what may be set aside as a contingency, to meet the increased threat of a deteriorating security situation?<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> Under subsection (1).<P>
<B>Mr. Cran:</B> Am I correct in saying that we are considering clause 10 stand part, Miss Widdecombe?<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Yes, we are.<P>
<B>Mr. Cran:</B> We have fenced back and forth on a number of aspects of the clause. More than principles are involved. Conservative Members are unhappy about the answers that we have been given about the Government’s intentions. Even when those intentions are clear, we still experience a certain amount of dissatisfaction.<P>
The Committee on the Administration of Justice made a submission to the Government. [Interruption.] I think that the Minister should be listening to this.<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I have two ears.<P>
Mr. Cran: The Minister may have two ears, but I do not think that he can conduct a conversation and listen to me at the same time. One of those things will not be done well, and we will have to repeat ourselves to ensure that the Minister has heard and that we receive an answer.<P>
Before I am accused of being a mouthpiece for the Committee on the Administration of Justice, I want to make it clear that I have never met any of the people who prepared its submission. It has simply been sent to me, as I presume it has been sent to all other members of the Committee. I do not know if my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Cambridgeshire has received a copy.<P>
The comments about article 10 in the committee’s submission show clearly that its members are not happy bunnies. The committee states: “This article”—[Interruption.] The Minister is not listening. He must listen. He can speak outside at 1 o’clock after our sitting. This is listening time.<P>
The committee’s comments are clear:<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“This article appears to transfer financial responsibility to the Chief Constable from the Police Authority, in that the Police Authority submits to the Secretary of State either the draft budget the Chief Constable submitted to it for that purpose, or that draft with such amendments as have been a matter for consultation with the Chief Constable.”<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
That is a statement of the facts as the committee sees them<P>
The committee’s submission continues:<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“The authority conferred on the Chief Constable thereby suggests that a potentially very poweful tool of control may be being withdrawn from the Policy Authority.”<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
My hon. Friend the Member for North-East Cambridgeshire—with far more knowledge of such matters than I—has been trying to suggest that that possibility exists. He and I are open minded and would, no doubt, accept that the Police Authority has an axe to grind. Of course, the Police Authority would say that. Some of its authority would be diluted. It would be unable to exert financial and budgetary control over the Chief Constable and his officers. The Minister is thus entitled to say that because the members of the authority are interested parties, we should consider what they say against that background.<P>
However, the Committtee on the Administration of Justice say the same thing. The committee is a respected cross-community organisation, dedicated to the protection and promotion of human rights in Northern Ireland. It is not deeply involved in the financial aspects of running police services in the Province, yet it is asking more or less the same questions as the Police Authority and is reaching similar conclusions.<P>
The committee’s views add another dimension to our comments. I repeat its statement, in case the Minister was not listening to me earlier. It said:<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“The authority conferred on the Chief Constable thereby suggests that a potentially very poweful tool of control may be being withdrawn from the Police Authority.”<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
Those are stark words. The committee is not mealy-mouthed in its views. The CAJ’s report states:<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“While this body accepts that PANI has not used this financial tool much in exercising its wider oversight role, this is in our opinion a criticism of PANI’s ineffectiveness to date”—<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
the Minister must address that respected body’s opinion that PANI has been at fault in performing its role in budgetary matters—<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“rather than a reason to withdraw this power.”<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
The report continues:<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“The proposed change serves to undermine the potential authority of PANI further, and there is no obvious attempt to replace this reduction in authority by increased authority in other areas.”<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
The starkest comment of all is:<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“It is the clearest signal that the Chief Constable, and the police, are to have their evident power within the tripartite structure . . . enhanced rather than diminished.”<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
Again, I am not sure that the Minister has paid adequate attention to the CAJ’s views on what it described as a criss-community organisation. Perhaps he will now comment on one of those points. The CAJ opposes any dilution of the Police Authority’s budgetary powers, and it has no axe to grind. I could go on, but I will not, because the Minister is getting restive. I want him to address those points logically, coolly and determinedly, to satisfy me and, much more important, the CAJ.<P>

<P>

<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I think that I have explained and that we have heard merely a regurgitation of the same argument. The hon. Member for Beverley and Holderness asked me to listen more. Will he now do the same, as this is perhaps the third time that I have given this answer? The grant still goes to the Police Authority, which can hold the Chief Constable to account for his deployment of it. As regards the day-to-day management and disbursement of the grant, the Chief Constable’s operational independence requirements mean that that responsibility devolves to him. Precise functions and roles are therefore performed.<P>
On the financial arrangements, if we can get the working groups up and running and the co-operation of the Police Authority by getting it to talk, we hope to put in place a practice similar to what pertains in England, Wales and Scotland. That is not a new model but one that has been tried and tested. We hope that it will ensure proper relationships among those with the right of operational independence, the Secretary of State, who is accountable to Parliament, and the people with responsibility for the relationship with the community, who represent its role and are its interface and who set objectives. We want a separation of powers and a clear integration of the relationship among the three parts of that tripartite structure. Although I respect the views of the CAJ, I hesitate to say that they are experts on the financial arrangements applying in such matters.<P>
The hon. Gentleman said that the CAJ claims to be an upholder of human rights in Northern Ireland. The Government are the upholder of human rights in Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom. We are putting the European convention on human rights on to the statute book to ensure the maximum guarantee of human rights, not only in Northern Ireland, but throughout the whole United Kingdom.<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Cran:</B> I would not contest that at all; I hope that the Minister would agree that we hold similar views. That is not the point we are getting at at all. The Minister, quite fairly, has spent a long time explaining these things—he said he had done so three times.<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> In this debate.<P>
<B>Mr. Cran:</B> Indeed—good for him. However, that is not the point. Some organisations and bodies have listened to his arguments ad nauseam. They may even have heard them four times, but they are still not satisfied. It is no good the Minister saying that he has said it three times, so it must be okay and we must simply accept it. Our reply is that we have heard it three times and will perhaps hear it another three times, but that does not change the fact that he has not convinced those other bodies. One is therefore entitled to ask—<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman is intervening on the Minister and I remind him that his intervention is getting a bit long.<P>
<B>Mr. Cran:</B> quite right, Miss Widdecombe. I shall therefore sit down.<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I thought that I had concluded my remarks when I sat down.<P>
<B>Mr. Cran:</B> In that case—<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order.<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I understood that the hon. Gentleman  was not the mouthpiece of that organisation, yet now he is able to tell us how it will react to the remarks I just made. That seems strange. If he is not the mouthpiece, how is he getting the information? Is it being transmitted to him through the ether? Is he getting messages via a pager, which we are not supposed to use in Committee? How can he say that it does not understand when I have only just explained the circumstances? I will undertake to write to the Committee on the Administration of Justice to set out the detailed explanation, which I hope will give it a better grasp of what we are trying to do in the Bill. I do not know the date of the document—the hon. Gentleman is not listening and it would help if he did. It may predate much of our discussion in Committee.<P>
<B>Mr. Cran:</B> There is no doubt about it: the Minister is not only tetchy he is becoming moderately mischievous. The letter was dated 22 February 1998 and it was sent to me and others. I am astonished that Labour Members have not quoted from it and made speeches about it. It was sent by Maggie Beirne, the research and policy officer. If the Minister does not have a copy I would be happy to provide one.<P>
The Minister was thoroughly disingenuous in making a totally political point; as a non-politician I was rather shocked by that. He tried to say that I was second-guessing that organisation. That is not the point. The point is that I assume, I think with some authority, that like all the other organisations it has seen the legislation and discussed it. It may even have talked to the Government and officials. I guess that it must have done.<P>
On the basis of having read the Bill and talked to the officials, the CAJ—not I, as I have not talked to them—has reached a conclusion. The conclusion, which I must repeat lest the Minister has forgotten it, is that the CAJ opposes any dilution of the Police Authority’s budgetary powers. The Minister cannot slide from under this by making a little attack on me and saying that I am acting for it and receiving messages through the ether or on this dreadful pager. None of that is true. The fact is that it has read the Bill and spoken to whomever—I want to know whether it has talked to the Minister or his officials—yet it is still dissatisfied. All that my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Cambridgeshire and I can do is attend the Committee and set that on the record.<P>
I do not agree with everything in the document—far from it. However, the Minister cannot get away with saying that the point has been repeated 15 or more times so everyone had better sit down, shut up and accept it. He must accept that some organisations, having had the same treatment, are still telling the Government the same thing—“No, we disagree”—and the Minister must tackle that problem.<P>
At the end of a slightly tetchy speech, the Minister may have got round to the point by saying that he would write to the body. That is a dashed good idea; he and his officials should certainly write or even talk directly to that body. If he did that, we would not receive documents from those “irritating” people who disagree with the Government.<P>
The Leader of the Opposition once accused the Government of being drunk on power. I have certainly seen some of the same thing this morning. The Minister has been too impatient and too willing to argue that no view other than the Government’s is acceptable and that all opponents should simply fall into line. I ask him again to consider the points made by the Committee on the Administration of Justice and to respond to them in detail.<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> The hon. Gentleman says that I repeated my explanation several times—“ad nauseam” was the phrase he used—yet the organisation was still dissatisfied. That was why I asked him how he knew, because we are debating the issues only now. If the Committee on the Administration of Justice writes subsequently saying that our explanations are unsatisfactory, we will then need to consider the issues further.<P>
The organisation is not irritating but helpful in advancing its critique of the Government’s proposals and providing a wider perspective on Northern Ireland. My officials are scheduled to meet the body on 13 March, I believe, though I am not absolutely certain. In offering to write, I meant that I would reflect on any criticisms that emerged from our debate. The authoritative view was expressed by the hon. Member for Beverley and Holderness that the organisation is still dissatisfied, but I do not know that. He is the expert with the intimate knowledge of the organisation. All I can do is to say that we will try to take its concerns into account.<P>
The truth is that the budgetary responsibilities of PANI have not been diluted. Time and again the responsibilities of the Police Authority and the Chief Constable are set out in the Bill in relation to the powers of the Secretary of State. It may not be possible to satisfy every organisation and every individual in Northern Ireland. We are likely always to find someone who will disagree with what we are doing, but we shall do our best to engage with criticisms.<P>
<B>Mr. Cran:</B> Excellent.<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> The hon. Gentleman says, “Excellent,” as if he had achieved something. However, he has not achieved anything more than had already been arranged. A meeting with the Committee on the Administration of Justice is due to take place in mid-March.<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I must ask the Minister a simple question. We received the deposition of the Committee on the Administration of Justice with a letter dated 22 February—some days ago. It details the organisation’s views extensively. The committee does not recommend many specific amendments; it sets out its views forthrightly—<P>
<B>Mr. Cran:</B> And it is entitled to.<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> Of course it is. I want to ask the Minister a question. I assume that his officials have received the submission, so has the Minister seen it?<P>
<B>Mr. Cran:</B> Good question.<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> The answer is yes. I see everything that comes through my office, but I cannot be expected to remember every detail, every word. You, Miss Widdecombe, will know from experience, that it would not be possible for me to remember what was on page 7 of the document, should I be asked.<P>
It is only days since the document was received. A meeting has been arranged with the Committee on the Administration of Justice to discuss the concerns that it has raised. I have said, and I repeat, so that the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire will understand—I think that the hon. Member for Beverley and Holderness understands—that I shall write to the hon. Gentlemen about the specific point that they have raised. I hope that they will then be less worried.<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> If the Minister does not answer in this debate I shall return to the matter on the next clause. The important part of his response was his assertion that he sees everything that goes through his office. I did not for a moment suggest that he did not. I know that he is a thorough and conscientious Minister. the question was whether he had read the document. Did his officials show it to him, or keep it to look at themselves? We are considering clause 10 of the Bill and shall probably deal with many more clauses this morning and this evening. We have dealt with nearly a third of the Bill, yet nothing has permeated—<P>
Mr. Ingram: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?<P>

<B>Mr. Ross:</B> In a moment. It is not good enough for the Minister to say that he sees everything that goes through his office. Did he read the document? I am not saying that he should be able to remember everything in it.<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I try to read every piece of paper that comes in, either in my Box or as constituency mail. I received the document on 26 February. My recollection is that I read it, but I would not have read it in great detail, knowing that my officials would also be receiving a copy and providing advice on detailed aspects of it. Yes, I did read it—quickly, for a grasp of the issues, as I do with a range of documents. My officials did not receive it until yesterday, so it is hard to deal with it in detail.<P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> Clauses 14 to 17 deal with accountability, setting objectives and performance targets, and policing plans.<P>
In view of our discussion a moment ago on the Committee on the Administration of Justice, I shall read out its comments on the clauses:<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“This whole section of the Bill is supposed to improve the accountability of policing by establishing a clear framework for the setting of objectives and performance targets, and the establishment of strategic plans. CAJ found this section somewhat confused and we may therefore not have understood the proposals well enough. It would appear that the Secretary of State is to set objectives and performance targets for a 3-5 year timeframe”.<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
That refers to clause 14. The passage continues:<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“the Chief Constable is to issue a strategic policing plan for a similar time period”.<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
That will happen under clause 16.<P>
The submission goes on:<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“The Police Authority, however, is to determine policing objectives and performance targets”—<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
under clause 15—<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“and issue a policing plan”—<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
under clause 17—<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“on an annual cycle. If this is the correct interpretation, it would appear to offer the Police Authority a limited consultative role only as regards longer-term policing objectives. Given our contention that democratic oversight mechanisms such as police authority should have its powers enhanced rather than curtailed, any emphasis on short term planning mechanisms to the exclusion of longer term policy oversight is misguided.”<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
That is how the Committee on the Administration of justice views the matter.<P>
There has been no time to consult the Minister about the views of the Committee on the Administration of Justice, but they are explicitly set out in the passage from which I quoted. I, too, had noticed a discrepancy. I do not understand the reason for the various time periods, which partly overlap but do not satisfactorily clarify who does what, where and when.<P>
Clause 16 relates to section 8 of the Police Act 1996. It deals with local policing plans. However, there is a fundamental difference between section 8 of the 1996 Act and clause 16 of the Bill. The statutory duty to establish a policing plan in England and Wales is placed on police authorities, albeit that their chief constables are responsible for preparing the draft.<P>
Section 8(1) states:<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“Every police authority established under section 3 shall, before the beginning of each financial year, issue a plan setting out the proposed arrangements for the policing of the authority’s area during the year (‘the local policing plan’).”<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
Subsection (3) states:<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“A draft of the local policing plan shall be prepared by the chief constable for the area and submitted by him to the police authority for it to consider.”<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
Subsection (4) states:<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“Before issuing a local policing plan which differs from the draft submitted by the chief constable under subsection (3), a police authority shall consult the chief constable.”<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
I appreciate that, some of those issues are tackled in clause 17, which covers the Police Authority’s annual policing plan. However, I cannot understand why, under clause 16, the Chief Constable is required to prepare a plan for three to five years. It is not replicated in the legislation for England and Wales. The Police Authority is supposed to deal with an annual policing plan for the first year, with the overlapping three-to-five year period of the so-called strategic plan.<P>
<P>
My amendments would give consistency. If the Police Authority is to produce a policing plan for the following year, it should be responsible for setting the strategic policing plans for not only that following year, but the two or possibly four subsequent years. It makes sense that the authority should be involved in both plans. Instead of giving the Chief Constable the statutory responsibility for producing the strategic policing plan, my amendments would give that responsibility to the Police Authority. I have taken wording from the 1996 Act: amendment No. 112 still gives the Chief Constable the responsibility of drawing up the plan. It states:<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“A draft of the strategic policing plan shall be prepared by the Chief Constable and submitted by him to the Police Authority for it to consider.”<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
I recognise and agree with the Government’s intention in clause 16 that the Chief Constable should have an important role to play in drawing up not only the annual policing plan, but the strategic policing plan. However, I question where the emphasis comes in the Bill. Who is really responsible? My amendments would ensure that the Chief Constable draws up his plan—he is already planning the policing plan for next year, which he submits to the Police Authority—but that he would study separately the three-to-five year strategic plan, in which his first year would be incorporated.<P>
Amendment No. 112 continues:<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“Before issuing a strategic policing plan which differs from the draft submitted by the Chief Constable under subsection 2(A) the Police Authority shall consult the Chief Constable.”<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
Those words are lifted from section 8 of the 1996 Act. I am not seeking to do anything that is markedly different from the legislation that applies in England and Wales. On many occasions, we are told that much of the Bill is drawn from the 1994 and 1996 legislation for England and Wales. However, nothing in the legislation for England and Wales refers remotely to the Chief Constable compiling a strategic plan.<P>
Clause 16(1) states that the Chief Constable submits the plan,<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“after consultation with the Secretary of State and the Police Authority”.<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
Surely, it is important for the Police Authority to head up such an important responsibility, rather than making the Chief Constable the prime instigator.<P>
Amendment No. 79 refers to the Police Authority’s setting of performance targets under clause 15. I have incorporated those into clause 16 as it would be amended, so that any objectives or performance targets that the Police Authority determines for the financial year shall be incorporated into the consideration by the Chief Constable, when he draws up his policing plan.<P>
Amendment No. 80 deals with a similar issue and refers to duties imposed on the Police Authority in clause 15. Many of the amendments are consequential because they make grammatical changes. Because amendment No. 107 would replace “Chief Constable” with “Police Authority”, the word “him” must be replaced by the word “it”, and soon.<P>
As I said earlier, the amendments would achieve consistency. If the clause is accepted as drafted, there might be conflict between the Police Authority, the Chief Constable and, possibly, the Secretary of State. Under clause 17, the task of the Police Authority is to draw up the annual plan. The Chief Constable is required to submit a draft which the Police Authority either accepts or amends. The Bill’s intention is that the Police Authority will stand over the annual policing plan, but if the Chief Constable stands over the strategic three to five-year plan they may not agree on the following year’s annual plan. Thus there may be conflict. I am attempting to introduce a consistent approach.<P>
As I said at the start of our debate, the CAJ also finds the clause confusing. There is an overlap, and no clear definition of roles and responsibilities. In the context of policing in Northern Ireland such definition is as important as, if not more important than, anywhere else in the United Kingdom.<P>
In the England and Wales legislation, police authorities are required only to send a copy of the plan to the Secretary of State and to bear in mind any policing objectives determined by the Secretary of State under section 37 of the appropriate Act. However, under the Bill, the Chief Constable must consult the Secretary of State in drawing up the plan. That is evidence of the Secretary of State’s more direct, hands-on control over a matter in which he or she is not involved in England and Wales. In the 1996 Act, a police authority is central to the formulation and issue of the policing plan; the Secretary of State is not involved. The opposite will be the case in Northern Ireland.<P>
In discussions with the previous Government, which have no doubt continued with Ministers and officials of the Northern Ireland Office, the Police Authority was led to believe, and agreed, that the bottom line for the changes implicit in any new legislation for Northern Ireland would be the Police and Magistrates’ Courts Act 1994 and the Police Act 1996. But the clause is not replicated in the England and Wales legislation. It is new, specific and unique to Northern Ireland—and I want to know why.<P>
We are discussing the powers of a police authority and its status in the community. Whatever may have been said, the details of the proposal reveal that it is hedged in many respects. It seems that the Bill’s draftsmen do not trust any police authority—especially, probably, the Police Authority, because of its stance in the recent past. But the Bill should not be coloured by those who hold the office of Chief Constable or by those who serve as chairmen or members of the Police Authority.<P>
We are attempting to formulate the best possible legal framework for the operation of police services in Northern Ireland. We need a strong and confident Police Authority, with a clear sense of its role in the tripartite structure. The Secretary of State should not be continually looking over the authority’s shoulder. The amendments are designed to provide consistency in the setting of policing plans. It will not be good enough for the Secretary of State—I mean the Minister; I nearly promoted him—to say that Northern Ireland is different and we have to do things differently there. I disagree with that. The Chief Constable will take an integral part in all the discussions about the policing plan and it makes sense for the Police Authority to oversee not only the annual plan but also the three to five-year strategic plan.<P>

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> This is an important issue and the Government recognise that, just as the Opposition do. We want to establish roles within a tripartite structure. [Interruption.]<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I understand that members of the Committee will occasionally wish to talk to one another, but they should not hold prolonged conversations that are audible to the rest of the Committee.<P>
<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> I have never bored anyone so quickly in my life.<P>
We are considering the tripartite structure. Totalitarian regimes do not have problems about who has responsibility for what. They would simply give operational control to a unified authority, probably a chief of police. In a democracy there needs to be a tripartite structure, which mixes central Government, who are accountable to Parliament for expenditure, The Police Authority, with local accountability, and the Chief Constable, who has operational responsibility for the police force. However, that leads to difficulties about clarity of role. We all recognise that and the Government are trying to deal with the matter.<P>
The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire said that the provisions that we are discussing were unique to Northern Ireland. That is true. The Bill does not follow English and Welsh legislation, although it is interesting that Her Majesty’s inspector of constabulary is encouraging chief constables in England and Wales to draft strategic plans, and that he supports the Bills’ provisions.<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> But that is exactly what I am saying. According to my amendments, the Chief Constable would issue a draft of the three to five-year strategic plan. He would design that plan and bring it to fruition, and would submit it to the Police Authority. I am not at loggerheads with the Minister on that matter.<P>
<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> The point is that the Chief Constable—the chief executive of an organisation that is a major employer and is central to the life of Northern Ireland—should be given the clear-cut operational responsibility to produce a draft strategic plan. That is common sense. It would be an executive responsibility, needing professional expertise, and it should not be mixed up with the responsibility of the Police Authority.<P>
If that happened, the result would be to unify two legs of the tripartite structure, part of whose purpose is to have three legs—if I may put it that way. The amendments would create a two-legged stool—[Laughter]—perhaps I should not pursue that analogy too far—and that would not be wise. A three-legged stool would be more stable. I hope that that has cleared matters up. <P>
The aim of amendments No. 80 and Nos. 107 to 119 is to remove the power to produce a strategic policing plan from the Chief Constable and to give it to the Police Authority for Northern Ireland. We should recognise that the Chief Constable would have to do the work on it: otherwise one would simply be creating two bodies to run the police in Northern Ireland and giving the resources to the Police Authority.<P>
Let me delight the hon Member for North-East Cambridgeshire by saying that we intend to accept amendment No.—[Interruption.] Perhaps I should make him guess. We intend to accept amendment No. 79. It recognises that the authority is keen to become more involved in strategic planning and accordingly requires the Chief Constable to take account of the objectives and priorities of the authority established under the provisions of clause 15 in the strategic plan. We invite the Committee to resist amendments No. 80 and Nos. 107 to 109 for reasons that I shall explain.<P>
The strategic plan aims to be the culmination of the RUC’s planning framework, drawing together the planning of the different parts of the organisation and setting the direction of the force over a three to five-year period. I do not see the difficulty in one part of the organisation working on a one-year time scale and other parts working on a three to five-year time scale. There are short and long-term planning matters that we should look at and which any organisation would take into account.<P>
The strategic plan is a vital part of the overall planning process, with the annual plan, which we shall deal with on the next clause, being the conclusion of that process. It allows the Chief Constable to set out publicly—this is a major step forward—how he sees Northern Ireland being policed over the next three to five years in the light of the priorities that are being set by the Police Authority and the Secretary of State. It tells the public what policing services and standards they can expect.<P>
If the public have concerns about the content of the strategic plan, and it is written into the Bill that there should have been consultation between the Police Authority and the Secretary of State to do all that can be done to avoid conflict, they can be reflected by the Police Authority in its annual plan. The strategic plan will ensure that the public and the Police Authority can make informed judgments about the choices available in making amendments to the annual plan. That could not be achieved if the Chief Constable had no means of setting out openly and publicly his professional vision of policing. However, the authority will retain the final say on how it is intended to police Northern Ireland through its role in approving and publishing the annual plan.<P>
The Bill will give the Chief Constable responsibility for the day-to-day management of all the resources that are required to deliver a police service to the people of Northern Ireland. It is also therefore entirely appropriate that he should be required as the chief executive to produce a long-term plan explaining how, as the professional head of police, he intends to deliver that service. To do otherwise would muzzle him. It should be remembered that we are setting up a tripartite structure with three voices. We do not want to muzzle the Chief Constable who will be the source of valuable information on the future development of policing.<P>
The plan will be compiled in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Police Authority and it is right that the responsibility for it should rest with the Chief Constable. It is for that reason that we ask hon. Members to resist these amendments and I ask the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire not to press them. I said that we would accept amendment No. 79. It is right to make it absolutely clear in the Bill that the Chief Constable, in his strategic plan, must have regard to the objectives and performance targets that are set by the Police Authority. This matter was raised with my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State by the Police Authority and we have taken note of that.<P>
My right hon. Friend was pleased to note the authority’s willingness to become involved in assisting in the development of the Chief Constable’s strategic plan. She assured the Police Authority in writing that the Chief Constable would be required to take account of its objectives and performance indicators. Therefore I am pleased to accept the amendment.<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I am grateful that one amendment has been accepted. It would be—<P>
<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> Churlilsh.<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> Churlish, yes—I was thinking of “mealy-mouthed” but it did not sound right—not to welcome that. The Police Authority asked for it, and the fact that there have been discussions with the Secretary of State about it and that the Government have moved on it will, I am sure, please the Police Authority.<P>
I come back to a point that the Minister has not answered. He read out what he was told by his officials to say, but there is an illogicality here. I am not suggesting that the Chief Constable is not fundamentally involved in drawing up not only the annual policing plan but the strategic policing plan. He is the chief executive, and knows better than anyone what he needs to put into the plans, and the inclusion of what he wants will go practically the whole distance in defining what it covers. Subsection 16(1) refers to <P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“consultation with the Secretary of State and the Police Authority”.<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
There is no mention of agreement between the three. There is the assumption that after consultation would come agreement, and that the plan that was issued would be embraced by the tripartite structure. But sometimes there are disagreements and that is more likely to happen if three people, rather than two, are around the table.<P>
Under clause 17, the Chief Constable will submit a plan to the Police Authority. The authority can change that, but there is no provision for a right of appeal by the Chief Constable. In the final analysis, the policing plan belongs to the Police Authority. It is responsible for it, and takes ownership of it. If anything goes wrong and there are subsequent questions and criticisms it is the authority that must stand and be counted. I cannot see the difference between the provision in clause 17 that it will be so written, that the Police Authority will take responsibility for issuing the plan and take ownership, and the Government’s not being prepared to allow, logically, the authority to take ownership of the three to five-year strategic plan.<P>
As I read the provision, the Chief Constable could issue a strategic plan for, say, three years, to include the first year of the annual policing plan that the Police Authority will stand over. What conflict can arise between the two parties in that context? If there were consistency, the Police Authority would take ownership of both the annual and strategic plan—in any event, the former is the first year of the latter.<P>
Most of the next part is lifted from the Police Act 1996, which covers England and Wales, but somebody has decided to add clause 16, which is unique to Northern Ireland. Among other things, it elevates the Chief Constable to be the prime mover behind the strategic plan. I would expect him to be the prime mover; my amendments would require him to draw up the plan and submit it to the Police Authority. However, because, it is a strategic plan and because it is for Northern Ireland, perhaps the Police Authority needs to have greater influence.<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
As we have said on several occasions, the police force in Northern Ireland, because of the security situation, is far larger than its equivalents in England and Wales for the size of the population. We accept that, and no one argues that police numbers should be diminished. However, I have heard no one argue that Royal Ulster Constabulary numbers should remain the same if there were to be a settlement—as we all hope—and a lasting peace. Of course they would not.<P>
During the first ceasefire, the previous Government discussed ways in which the RUC would downsize. We talked about the peace dividend, and money being released because there would be less police overtime. Unfortunately, the dividend is no longer available, but we discussed recycling the money into what we might consider more important social areas such as the health service and education, where extra spending would be welcome.<P>
There is a different ingredient in Northern Ireland. No one argues for any police force in England and Wales to be downsized—far from it. Most of the shire counties, particularly Cambridgeshire, which contains my constituency, are constantly arguing for an increase in police numbers. Cambridgeshire has the second lowest ratio of police to population of any shire county in England and Wales—I say that so that the Minister might put in a good word for me with his colleagues. We need more police in England and Wales, not fewer.<P>
In Northern Ireland, however, the context is different. If there were to be a lasting peace, there would be downsizing and we would need to make massive changes in the employment of members of the RUC and the affiliated civilian employees who work in the police service, as defined in clause 2. A strategic plan looking three to five years ahead may consider not only how one polices in the normally accepted sense of that term, as in England and Wales, but something much more fundamental.<P>
A massive downsizing of the RUC and all the associated problems that we may face would afford opportunities to change the way in which policing is done, as well as opportunities for different sides of the community to make their views known about what kind of police force they would want after the changes and the period of uncertainty. The Policy Authority is the body, as defined in the Bill, that represents public opinion. In the event of a massive change in Northern Ireland’s policing and in the RUC, the public will undoubtedly have a view. They have a view now, although it has not yet been expressed consistently by members of the Committee. No doubt the hon. Gentleman who would represent the opposing views from his side of the community will do so—and rightly so—when he finds time away from the talks process to speak to his later amendments.<P>
Strong views are held about the future of policing. Some people believe that the legislation does not go far enough in a particular direction. We all have views about that. I am suggesting changes that would put the Police Authority at the top, and at the forefront, of the policing plans. If there are to be massive changes in personnel, in numbers and in civilian back-up, there will be enormous upheaval in Northern Ireland, and large numbers of redundancies. Such changes will cause great difficulties, and will be one of the most important subjects of conversation and discussion in Northern Ireland when they are implemented.<P>
No chief constable should be placed in the political sense that is at the heart of plans that deal with many of those issues. I do not see how discussion or mention of the issues can be avoided, if we look three to five years ahead, and to a context very different from today’s<P>
My proposals are logical. I am supported by the Committee on the Administration of Justice, which finds the relevant legislation somewhat confusing because of its inconsistency. I do not wish to undermine the Police Authority or the importance of the Chief Constable in submission of the plans. That is clearly stated in two amendments that I have tabled, and to which I have alluded, and it is not an issue of contention. It is agreed that the Chief Constable has to submit his draft plan. I suggest, however, that he should submit it to the the Police Authority, which should take ownership of it. There must be agreement between the two parties, otherwise there will be conflict and disagreement.<P>
It is no good to say that there is a three-legged structure. Why must there be three legs to everything? I do not disagree with the tripartite structure, but it does not have to come into every clause. The Secretary of State does not have to stand over everything in the Bill, as appears to be the case. The Secretary of State does not stand over everything in the 1996 Act, for example. Police authorities and chief constables are left to get on and do their own thing because they are accountable to their public. The Secretary of State has power to intervene as and when it is necessary, but it is not necessary in every case, and not as in the Bill, in every clause, where he—or she—is overseeing matters.<P>
The matter is important enough to press to a vote. The Committee will return to it later, as it is important to get it right, and to ensure that there is no confusion. A number of bodies have expressed their confusion to me and to others. It behoves the Minister and his team to think carefully, and to offer some hope that more changes will be forthcoming. The Minister’s arguments do not convince me that the Bill is correct, or that it is the way forward. I shall press the amendments to a vote.<P>

<P>

<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> The hon. Gentleman asked why everything has to be three-legged. The clause has to be three-legged because it is a key part of the Bill. It defines the role of the Police Authority, of the Chief Constable and of the Secretary of State. Following the hon. Gentleman’s analogies would create a very unstable structure.<P>
The hon. Gentleman said that he did not want to demean the Chief Constable—I think that was the gist of his remarks. The Chief Constable, although I use the parallel of the chief executive, is distinct from other public appointments and he must have a separate and distinctive public role. He has to be independent of the Police Authority and the Secretary of State. That is the whole point. We are seeking to make it the responsibility of the Chief Constable to produce the strategic policing plan, so that the Chief Constable owns it.<P>
In an ideal situation—which is, of course, what we aspire to—we would build in consultation between the Secretary of State, the Chief Constable and the Police Authority because those three parts of the structure should move ahead as one, in agreement. When disagreement occurs, as it has in the past between chief constables and police authorities, it is damaging and undermines the process. One cannot fuse the roles of the Chief Constable and the Police Authority without damaging and undermining the structure.<P>
The hon. Gentleman does not seem to understand that point. He spent much of his time talking about downsizing and the distinctiveness of Northern Ireland, but it is in that downsizing process that there clearly needs to be a three-legged structure. Northern Ireland is unique in that there is no local element of fund-raising for the police; all the money is provided by the Secretary of State. If, as we hope, there is a much more stable situation, the police will have to bid for funds in the public expenditure round alongside everybody else. That will be the Secretary of State’s role.<P>
Clearly, the dimensions of downsizing would extend beyond the Police Authority because it would entail public policy issues outside the Police Authority’s remit. For example, the question would arise of how people who had been in the police could have a valuable role in society, so retraining issues would have to be taken into account. The Secretary of State would have a role, and the Chief Constable and the Police Authority would have complementary but distinct roles. They would have to consider how they needed to change to police a peaceful society.<P>
We have been trying, successfully, to consider those three distinct roles and resist the temptation—as the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire clearly has not—to fuse them and meld the Chief Constable with the Police Authority, which would undermine the Bill’s strength. We need a tripartite structure and I believe that we have got it right. I urge members of the Committee to support our proposals.<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> In the 1996 Act, the local policing plan, which is the responsibility of the Police Authority working on the draft plan as submitted by the Chief Constable, must take into account objectives determined by the Secretary of State in another section of the Act. That, too, is replicated in the Bill, in clause 16(2)(a), which refers to <P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“any objectives determined by the Secretary of State under section 14”.<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
The Chief Constable and the Police Authority will, therefore, have to take on board the Secretary of State’s views because under clause 14 they can be set on an annual basis or whenever he or she wants to set them.<P>
If there were downsizing and a different role for the police were perceived, that would be incorporated in the objectives set by the Secretary of State. I do not want to rule that out and the amendments would not delete that from the clause. That is an important ingredient and I do not wish it to be diluted or deleted. It is important that the strategic plan, like the annual plan, takes into account the objectives set in earlier clauses.<P>
The Secretary of State has a role and his input would not in any way be devalued by the amendments. Why is it acceptable in clause 17 to give the Police Authority ownership of and responsibility for the annual plan, but not the three-year plan? I do not understand.<P>
