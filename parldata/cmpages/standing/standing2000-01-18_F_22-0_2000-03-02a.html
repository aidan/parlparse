<P>
<B>Mr. Eric Pickles </B>(Brentwood and Ongar) rose--
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Department of Social Security (Mr. Jeff Rooker):</B> I thought that the hon. Gentleman had finished his speech at the end of our previous sitting.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I was about to remind the Committee where we were at the end of our previous sitting. I am sorry that the Minister thinks that I want to engage in some sort of filibuster.
<P>
At our previous sitting, I had tabled a series of amendments and spoken principally to amendment No. 331. I was arguing that the Government were imposing additional taxation of more than 12 per cent.--although it will be considerably more in practice--on various items, ranging from the office Christmas party to rape alarms. There is no logic in that. It is simply an attempt by the Government to increase their grasp on stealth taxation--a phrase that was virtually unheard of a few years ago but is now part of the taxation language.
<P>
<B>Mr. Desmond Swayne </B>(New Forest, West): As my hon. Friend is aware, I am willing suspect a conspiracy anywhere, but I think that the provision is a bit of a cock-up. If it were the Government's intention to maximise the tax take, surely the free sandwiches to the entire work force would be chargeable, whereas only the sandwich given to individuals would attract national insurance contributions. [Hon. Members: "What about fruit?"]
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I thank my hon. Friend. He made that point at our previous sitting but, unfortunately, I did not have any time to elaborate on it. Such matters do not relate only to sandwiches. As has been suggested, fruit could also be affected.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Jacqui Lait </B>(Beckenham): And water.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I am not sure water could be affected. I think that my hon. Friend is taking the matter too far. I must warn her that she should not give the Government ideas. If sandwiches, fruit, fish and chips or take-away curries are available in a canteen, taxation and national insurance contributions do not apply, but if they are taken to people who must stay at their desks, taxation will come into play, as will national insurance. When we consider the mixture and the grossing up, which we shall come to in a while, the burden will be considerable. Given the various categories outlined in amendment No. 331, I hope that the Government understand that we regard the clause as an extension of stealth taxation. It has nothing to do with being just or sensible, or cutting back on luxurious perks; it is simply a way to grasp more money. Given the Prime Minister's pledge not to increase taxation, it is not sensible for us to mug the public in some back alley and to introduce such stealth taxation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Laurence Robertson </B>(Tewkesbury): During the previous sitting, my hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. Pickles) gave us a detailed account of why we should not support the clause. He went through a great range of items that would become subject to national insurance. I tend to start from a slightly different position from most people in that I never use the words "tax loophole" or talk about a way of escaping tax, because I believe that tax is wrong. [Hon. Members: "Oh."] Let it be put on the record that that provoked laughter from Government Members--I suppose that they have an alternative view. I start from the position that tax is wrong. I recognise that in order to fund vital services, we have to find a way of taking money.
<P>
I am now going to make another provocative statement: the taking of money should be as painless as possible--what a terribly revolutionary thing to say. Any form of taxation is painful for the people who pay it. I am amazed that Government Members find that objectionable because it was not one of my controversial points. However, any taxation--[Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. If conversations are loud, Hansard staff cannot hear what is going on.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Social Security (Angela Eagle):</B> The hon. Gentleman should speak up.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robertson:</B> I thought that I was speaking up. I was provoking Labour Members. As my hon. Friend said, we have been as helpful as possible, but there are aspects of the Bill to which we cannot agree, and clause 57 is one such area. Taking tax is painful, so extending tax must be even more painful. We must remember the people who will pay the taxes. The people who have been hit hardest by taxation are not the rich--even under a Labour Government--although they were hit hard; it is the people who are above benefit levels, who are not wealthy, but who just qualify to pay taxation. Those vulnerable people will be hit by the measures, as my hon. Friend said.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I do not want to keep interrupting, but people will not be affected by the measures. They will apply wholly and exclusively to employers, not employees. The whole tone and thrust of the hon. Gentleman's speech is that employees will be affected, but that is not the case.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robertson:</B> I am pleased that the Minister was also able to put that on the record. He seems to disregard the fact that employers might be hit hard by the measures, as they always are.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> They are not people.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robertson:</B> As my hon. Friend says, employers are not people. [Interruption.] I am pleased with the start that I have made, because I am drawing some good socialism from Labour Members, who seem to be saying that the fact that employers are hit hard does not affect ordinary people--we are going back to the great days of the 1970s. Where was new Labour when we really needed it? If employers are hit, employees are also affected. If an employer is put off providing rape alarms, for example, that might be detrimental to employees.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that increasing charges on employers will increase social wage costs, and that part of the problem encountered by continental Europeans is that, because of their high wage costs, they have had weak economies? They need to reduce social wage costs, while the Government are going in precisely the opposite direction.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Robertson:</B> My hon. Friend is right: if we hit employers, we hit employees. Employers are not a group of people who descend on the planet from outer space and provide jobs out of the goodness of their hearts. They are people who depend on a thriving economy. In another debate in the House, on how much money goes into health services on the continent, the Prime Minister seemed to feel that it was a problem to give that extent of funding because it would hit employers--he has obviously not spoken to Labour Members.
<P>
I am surprised that the Government feel the need to increase the money coming in from national insurance contributions. While I am new to the Social Security Committee, I recall that at one of our meetings the Secretary of State did not disagree that there is an excessive surplus in the national insurance fund. From memory, I think that the recommended surplus is something like £8 billion, whereas we have a surplus of something like £13 billion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> To save repetition later, I should point out that the purpose of the measure is not to raise extra money for the fund. The fund does not work that way. The purpose of the measure is to equalise taxation on benefits in kind so that there is no exploitation and there is fair treatment for employees. The extra money coming into the national insurance fund through the measure--£200 million plus--will probably be balanced by lower contributions elsewhere in the fund. The Government set the parameters of the fund.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robertson:</B> I am confused. I have not been a Member of Parliament for long, but I thought that the normal reason for taxing people was to raise funds. I am sorry if, from inexperience and naivety, I have got that wrong.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> Not in this case.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> It is a pleasant accident.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robertson:</B> As my hon. Friend says, it is a pleasant accident that funds will be raised. The Government say that they do not intend to raise money from what they euphemistically call the climate change levy, but it seems to go that way.
<P>
There seems to be a double surplus in the funds--a surplus on top of the surplus that the Actuary recommends. The Actuary also says that that surplus is likely to increase and the Government accept that. The Minister says that it is not about raising more taxation: in that case, I do not see the need for it. We do not have to hit employers and employees in the way that my hon. Friends have described. The measure will provoke many questions.
<P>
We have talked about sandwiches, fruit and Christmas parties. I do not wish to be frivolous, but if the value of a Christmas party to an employee is more than £75, that will be subject to the tax--because it is a tax. As I asked earlier, what if we provide lunch benefits to our secretaries? What if we go down to the Terrace Cafeteria and pay £3 or £4 a couple of times a day for our secretaries--which as my hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar said, would be a dangerous precedent to set and I am not suggesting that anyone would do it--would that be subject to the tax? If that is a trivial, frivolous point, it will be easy for the Minister to deal with. However, I do not think that it will be easy because it goes to the heart of what we are discussing, as do many of the other benefits that have been mentioned.
<P>
The Minister says that it is not about raising money, which I cannot accept. Even if we accept it, will the country incur another cost, in different ways? If, for example, we are dissuaded from providing rape alarms--or attack alarms--will we find that the cost of treating people builds up in another way? Again, that might seem a small point but we have to look at taxation as a whole.
<P>
I will be in real trouble with my hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar in a minute, but I repeat that there seems to be a lack of thought about all this. The Minister wants to equalise the way in which people are treated, but the provision will make matters worse. I do not want to reiterate the points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar about private medical cover and the problem with check-ups and actual treatment. If we are dissuaded from giving such a service, a worse problem will face the country somewhere down the line. When my party was in government and introduced the charge for eye tests--wrongly, in my opinion--the Labour party said, "Okay, you may bring in some money in the short term, but such a scheme will cost the NHS more in the long term."
<P>
<H5>10.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
That was one of the few arguments advanced by the Labour party when it was in opposition that was right. Now it is going back on such philosophy, which is not a sensible decision. My hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar has covered many of the categories where the provision will cause problems. It is unjust. I am pleased that we shall be opposing it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> The Minister gave the game away by saying that, despite more than £200 million that will be raised under the clause, it is the Government's intention not to raise that revenue and that they so drafted it for other purposes. We are entitled to ask what those purposes might be. If they are not primarily to raise £200 million, it is just a matter of pure viciousness. If the amendments serve any purpose at all, the best thing that they will have achieved, if accepted, is to have restrained the new puritans on the Government Benches who wish to tax Christmas. [Laughter.] If our deliberations were taking place later in the year, it would concentrate their minds a little better. The outturn of the proposals is that the Christmas party will be subject to a tax.
<P>
We have hit a raw nerve. When the matter was first raised in Committee, the Minister leapt to his feet and said, "Oh, no, only extravagant Christmas parties would be affected. Only a party that cost more than £75 per head would be penalised." I do know not when the right hon. Gentleman last organised a Christmas party, but a party for less than £75 per head would be pretty thin. [Laughter.] Hon. Members may laugh, but they forget that here, in the nation's capital, employees are increasingly expected to work long hours, much longer hours than many of our European partners are accustomed to working, and employers, as a recompense, generally lay on a pretty good bash at Christmas. At that time of year, the mere cost of the premises in which to hold a party will be close to £75 per head and that is before money is paid out for a band, food and all the rest.
<P>
If the cost of the party is more than £75 per head, national insurance contributions will be attracted on the entire amount. For the Christmas party to be a modest party, a pretty big fence will have to be put around it. We are talking about a puritan proposal; it is a taxing measure to restrain festivities at Christmas. I could understand that if the purpose of the provision was to raise revenue, but that is an important preoccupation and will often be to the detriment of people's pleasures and enjoyment. I could understand that, but the Minister says that the provision is designed not to raise revenue but merely to inflict misery. He will no doubt tell us about all the market distortions created by income in kind--
<P>
<B>Mr. Robertson:</B> To be fair to the Minister, he said that the provision was designed to equalise misery for everyone.
<P>
<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> My hon. Friend is correct. The provision is designed to remove the distortions that arise from the payment of income in kind. Given that no great public good will result from the provision, what is the public evil to be avoided by the so-called removal of those distortions? Is it genuinely worth £200 million?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I am fascinated by the discussion, because it smacks of the mean-mindedness of the Labour Government of the 1970s. The Minister--who introduced the Rooker-Wise amendment--made a fascinating point that may explain why the Government have introduced the provision. That explanation differs from those offered by my hon. Friends the Members for Tewkesbury (Mr. Robertson) and for New Forest, West (Mr. Swayne).
<P>
If I understood him correctly, the Minister said that the provision did not constitute taxation because the proceeds will go into the national insurance fund. The national insurance fund is in surplus--and as the Liberal Democrats are desperate to spend that surplus, it would be interesting, to hear their views on the provision.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paul Burstow </B>(Sutton and Cheam): The hon. Lady gives credit to my hon. Friend the Member for Northavon (Mr. Webb) for having revealed the exceedingly high surplus in the national insurance fund--[Interruption.]--through parliamentary questions. Does she agree that the figure outlined in our proposals is about £500 million?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I am sure that you, Sir David, will prevent us from going down that interesting track, but the figure is about 50 per cent. of the fund's surplus.
<P>
The Minister said that the proceeds will not constitute taxation but will go into the national insurance fund. If the national insurance fund is in surplus and, as the Under-Secretary, the hon. Member for Wallasey (Angela Eagle), said from a sedentary position, the Government Actuary has published that fact, the need for the money must have arisen because the Government have lost £200 million-worth of income. Reducing national insurance for the low paid--a laudable exercise--and increasing national insurance for employers in various Budgets, which is, I accept, a Treasury measure rather than a Department of Social Security measure, has created a shortfall of £200 million. The provision is being slipped in to try to make up that £200 million gap on the income and expenditure balance sheet of the national insurance fund. If that is the reason for the provision, the Minister should make that clear. If it is not, my hon. Friends have exposed all the mean-mindedness behind it, which has more to do with old Labour than with encouraging an active, flexible and successful economy.

<P>

<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I shall do my best to respond to hon. Members, but if anyone ever felt himself to be in the box, facing trumped-up charges based on myths and prejudice, it is me. Anyone would think that the provision was a surprise. I take exception to the term "stealth", because no one is supposed to be told about things that are done by stealth, whereas the measure was announced by the Chancellor in the Budget a year ago.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> So was ACT, two years ago.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> Well, the provision was announced. It has been fully discussed with the industry, and it arose partly from the Taylor report, which was published at the time of the Budget, so we cannot talk about stealth. The Bill is accompanied by a regulatory impact assessment, to which no Opposition Members have referred. It gives chapter and verse on the number of firms that will be affected and the amount of money that will be raised--I mention that at the risk of upsetting hon. Members.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Leigh </B>(Gainsborough): A true stealth tax, according to the Minister's definition, is a tax imposed by the Chancellor, which is not announced or written down.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> No, clearly it is not. Opposition Members are falling into the gutter of tabloid headlines, implying that we are doing something underhand and that we are not telling the public or Parliament about it. I want to make it clear that we are telling Parliament and the public, and that we have told them more than once.
<P>
Opposition Members have also flatly refused to accept that the measure is part of a package of changes that involves reductions as well as increases to national insurance. I do not expect the cavaliers on the Opposition Benches to admit that we puritans in the Government are reducing taxes. The hon. Lady and her colleagues have implied that only increases will be made, which is not correct, as they well know.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> No. In the next financial year, there will be a reduction in national insurance revenue because of the changes to the primary threshold. The upper earnings limit will be raised, but the net effect will be a reduction of £687 million. That means a reduction for employees. I will not go into the details of the changes for the self-employed. In the financial year 2001-02, employer charges will be reduced from 12.2 per cent. to 11.9 per cent., and class 1A contributions will also be reduced by that amount.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> Hang on, I want to make my point. The package raises £225 million, but its prime purpose is not to raise extra revenue through tax, national insurance or other means. In this part of the package, there are increases; in other parts, there are decreases.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> The right hon. Gentleman must acknowledge that the employer's rate of national insurance was 11 per cent. in May 1997. The Government raised that to 12.2 per cent., and they are now trumpeting the fact that they have brought it down by 0.3 per cent. In fact, I think that the rate may have been 10 per cent. when the Government were elected, so they can hardly talk about a reduction when they have put the rate up considerably more than they have reduced it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> There have been many changes in national insurance during the past few years. National insurance has worked against low-paid employees. Many exploitative employers have kept employees at a set wage below the level at which national insurance is applied, thus depriving them of contributory benefits in future. The minute that employees go over the threshold, national insurance must be paid on all earnings. Aligning national insurance with the tax system is beneficial all round to low-paid employees.
<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The change is part of a continuing process of closing loopholes in national insurance through which income has been lost from the fund. Extra money has had to be added to the fund by employers or employees, causing the rates to stay high. I shall not discuss the issue of the surplus, but the fund has a specific purpose. It is not like general taxation.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> We know that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> That is what the comments of Opposition Members suggested.
<P>
I shall not speak for long, as there will be other debates on the clause, but I would like to remind hon. Members of some of the changes that have taken place in national insurance in only a few years. When the hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire (Mr. Heald) was at the Department of Social Security, he was asked about
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the application of employers' national insurance contributions to benefits in kind designed to eliminate avoidance of national insurance contributions on bonuses and other one-off benefits.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He replied in a written answer, saying that measures had been introduced
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>to prevent national insurance contribution . . . avoidance by paying employees in their own company's shares and share options.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He listed measures that had been introduced to combat national insurance contribution avoidance before 1996, stating:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In 1991 . . . a. . . range of financial instruments<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
was brought in
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>other than own company shares . . . In 1993 payments by way of commodities capable of being sold on . . . the London bullion market . . . became subject to<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
national insurance. People were being paid in bullion simply to avoid national insurance, which was thought to be quite legit by Conservative Members until their Government stopped it. The answer continues, saying that in 1994, national insurance was brought in on
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>payments by way of alcoholic liquors on which no UK duty had been paid, gemstones and any vouchers.--[Official Report, 11 February 1997; Vol, 290, c.171-72.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The catalogue of wheelers, dealers and spivs who did not want to pay their fair share is incredible, and I am pleased that it was stopped by a Tory Government.
<P>
In another written answer, the hon. Gentleman said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We are committed to acting against exploitation of the national insurance system by employers who undermine the contributory principle by avoiding paying their proper share of contributions on the earnings they pay to their employees.--[Official Report, 4 December 1996; Vol. 286, c.715.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is what it comes down to.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robertson:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> No. I would like to make progress, but I shall give way to the hon. Gentleman in a moment. Benefits in kind are part of earnings. It is as simple as that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robertson:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> Obviously there is a dispute about that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robertson:</B> I plead innocence about what the Minister has quoted, as I was not in the House at the time. Some of the things that he mentioned may have been considered as payments, but others--personal alarms, secretaries' lunches, Christmas parties, and certainly medical cover--might be viewed as things that benefit the employee rather than as payments. Is that a difference?
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> The difference is that they are all taxable for income tax purposes, as are all the benefits covered by the measure. Like everyone else, I have no knowledge of what will be in the Budget that will be delivered in a few weeks' time--Ministers in my Department will be the last to know--but any relaxation in taxation of benefits in kind would automatically transfer to national insurance. If benefits are not taxable, the employer will pay no national insurance on them.
<P>
So the change is in no way radical; it does not bring additional benefits into taxation. National insurance, not taxation, is the issue. It covers only benefits in kind that are not already subject--unlike cars and fuel, for example--to national insurance.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I am sure that the Minister will confirm that the measure will impose additional taxation on employers, so that they will pay sums that they do not currently pay through the headline rate of 12.2 per cent., which in some cases will rise significantly because of grossing up and mixed use.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> Yes, the measure does involve a cost to employers, but that cost is incurred because employers have chosen to give part of a remuneration package as benefits in kind. I repeat that benefits in kind that are not taxable are not affected. I stand by what I said earlier: the measure merely equalises the present system for a group of benefits. Those benefits are quite legitimate; no one is arguing that there is anything wrong with them, although they are provided mainly by big rather than small employers. They are cheaper to provide than other remuneration because they involve no national insurance costs. They, therefore, create an imbalance of fairness in the benefits that different employers give employees. We seek to introduce greater fairness so that if an employer chooses to give part of the package as benefits in kind, the cost will be the same for all employers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robertson:</B> I understand that a benefit that is taxed should be subject to national insurance, but that philosophy does not run through the system. Over a certain level of income, people are taxed, but not subject to national insurance.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> No, because there is a basic set of rules for P11D. Only employees earning more than £8,500--and probably all directors, whatever they earn--are covered. That level of £8,500 has existed for many years. I recall when, a long time ago, the figure was a lot lower; it was stuck at £2,000 for donkey's years. Do not ask me to explain the figure--it is a matter for Treasury Ministers. The point is that the employer is required to report on benefits in kind for employees who earn more than that. So if I said that all employers are affected, I withdraw that. The employers affected are those who are affected by the rules on taxation of benefits in kind. Those rules are separate. I have sent hon. Members the documentation that has gone to employers--it is obviously subject to the passage of the Bill and was just to give employers an idea of what is coming. Clearly, Royal Assent to the Bill will occur after the start of the new financial year.
<P>
So the position is nowhere as bad as it may appear, once one has found out a bit more about how the system works. I shall not argue with the hon. Member for New Forest, West about the quality of the Christmas parties that he throws. They make my private office party look rather mean. I did not think it was mean at the time, but it cost considerably less than £75 a head. As for the jibe about one's secretaries in the House, I wonder why the hon. Gentleman is using his office costs allowance to pay for lunches for his secretary.
I must inform the Committee of the progress of the Bill and the reason for this change, so that hon. Members can relay the information to their colleagues. They should not worry about it, because the class 1A charge will arise only when there is a tax charge. If hon. Members feel strongly that a particular benefit should not carry a tax charge, they could address that by volunteering for service on the Finance Bill Standing Committee, where they would have the opportunity to raise the matter.
<P>
The trigger for the change is the taxation of the benefit in kind, not the other way round. The national insurance does not cause the tax to be paid; the tax causes the national insurance to be paid. We are seeking to equalise the arrangements. Hon. Members can read the regulatory impact assessment and see our analysis of the firms and benefits involved. The biggest single benefit that is not already subject to national insurance--the biggest ones, such as cars and fuel, already are--will be medical insurance. That is no secret; we have issued estimates of what the figures would be. However, that applies to circumstances in which it is already taxable. Some of the examples given by hon. Members might raise a laugh. I hope that they do not cause too many headlines; it would be misleading if they did, because some of them are so tiny. The employer pays what might be called a global package--I have forgotten the technical term for it.

<P>

<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> Grossed up.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> It is not grossed up, There is another term to describe that deal with the Inland Revenue. It is the PAYE settlement agreement. It was on the tip of my tongue. An overall assessment is carried out and a one-off payment is made to the Revenue to cover a global sum from the employer. That may cover some of these small items.
<P>
There are other items, and I shall deal with an important one that was raised earlier. An argument was made for people who are given transport home after working unsociable hours in offices. That is a legitimate matter for debate. That benefit is taxable if it is provided as a general rule, as part of the norm. However, if it were provided, for example, up to 60 times a year, or only after nine o'clock at night, there would be an extra statutory concession on it, and it would not be included in the framework. The system, while rigorous, is not unreasonable. Bearing in mind some of the examples hon. Members gave, one would think that anything that moved was taxable. That is not the case. However, if something is taxable--whether it moves or not--it will be the trigger for bringing in national insurance for the employer, but not the employee. I am not dismissing employers as non-people. The companies will be paying this.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> It is a cost.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I realise that it is a cost, but it will in fact lower the cost of employing someone because they are receiving the benefit-in-kind anyway, perhaps as an alternative to a wage increase. [Interruption.] That does happen. Benefits are offered as carrots to keep someone in a company, because they may not be easy to transfer as part of one's remuneration package if one is negotiating with another employer. The employer will say, "Do you get that every year?" and if the answer is no, they will respond, "Then it's not part of your package". If the carrots are to be maintained as part of a pay package, all employers should carry the fair costs of that package. If the carrots are taxable, that is fine; if not, they will be off the system.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> My language always verges on the politically correct.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> Broadly.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I am a little hurt by that remark.
<P>
Let us not beat about the bush. The Minister claims that the measure deals with a loophole, but what is it really about? Take the example of a young girl who has been asked to work late, leaves at 8.30 pm, when it is dark, wet and miserable, has to go on the tube when people who are the worse for drink are wandering about, and then has a 20-minute walk home in the dark. That is not a perk. The Minister is saying that a caring employer who does not want their employees to do that will be taxed--because they are caring.
<P>
<B>Several hon. Members:</B> Not taxed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I used the word tax loosely. When the Government have their hand in my pocket and are taking money out of my moth-ridden wallet, I cannot tell exactly what kind of money it is.
<P>
The Minister said that the money will come out of the company, not from real people, although he went some way towards withdrawing that afterwards. Real people are involved in companies, and the measure is an additional cost on companies. Employers who do not give a hoot and throw young lasses out on the street to let them find their own way home will not pay anything; those that do not want to do that will pay. Additional costs will be placed on employers who want to do the right thing.
<P>
I do not know what the Minister thought that the quotation from the pre-election Hansard would prove, other than that the Government have lost their sense of proportion. Having started off with people being paid in bullion and gemstones, and all the riches of Arabia, we now find ourselves taxing Christmas parties, rape alarms and sandwiches. My hon. Friend the Member for New Forest, West made a hit with the Government with his advocacy of more fruit in our diet.
<P>
The Minister said that the measure is about equalisation, closing loopholes and putting matters on a level playing field. Apparently, administrative convenience is the watchword of the Bill. However, that was not his attitude when he intervened on my speech on Tuesday afternoon. We are served extremely well and ably by the Hansard staff, and we are all grateful for their accurate reports, which put our mad ramblings into recognisable English. However, I am sorry that we do not have the Hansard report of Tuesday afternoon's sitting--although I recognise that that is due to pressure of work. I had been on my feet for barely 30 seconds and, as soon as I said the word "Christmas", the Minister jumped up and said--I paraphrase--"Do you know how 677 678 many drinks you can get for £75?" He was clearly measuring the number of lukewarm half shandies and mince pies that could be bought for that kind of money. The Government seem to be on a crusade that started by hammering fat cats and spivs who receive gemstones and bullion, and has ended up looking at the quality of the curling sandwiches. My hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh) asked the Minister of State for a definition of a stealth tax, We were told that a stealth tax is something that nobody knows about, and that the Govemment's actions have been completely above board. The Minister of State is an experienced parliamentarian, but perhaps he needs to be told that a debate on a rainy Thursday morning in Committee Room 12 is not the equivalent of broadcasting to the nation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Dismore </B>(Hendon): Why is the hon. Gentleman going on about it?
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> The reason is democracy. We also want consistency from the Government. I had the opportunity of listening to the Prime Minister twice this week.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> Poor you.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I enjoyed it. It was nice to see him yesterday on the Floor of the House. On the previous night, I saw him talking about medical insurance on "Newsnight". Somebody asked the Prime Minister why the use of private hospitals was being stopped, at which he looked shocked. He said that that was terrible, and that active co-operation with private hospitals and private health provision was desirable. An employer who listened to the Prime Minister and wanted to become part of a stakeholder society by offering private health cover would have additional burdens imposed on him. Good employers who look after their staff and resist the temptation to pay them in gemstones and bullion--offering sports facilities, private medical cover or other security--instead will be penalised. That does not seem right.
<P>
However, the Minister of State said a number of interesting things, on which I would like to reflect. I therefore beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 316, in page 58, line 42, after '(2)' insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'Subject to section 10ZA below,'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 318 and 320.
<H4><center>New clause 23</center></H4>
<H4><center>Third party providers of benefits in kind:</center></H4>
Great Britain
<H4><center>New clause 24</center></H4>
<H4><center>Third party providers of benefits in kind: Northern Ireland</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> The amendments and new clauses concern the provisions of benefits in kind to employees by somebody other than their own employer--third party. That might arise if, for example, a manufacturer of cameras wanted to reward or give a greater incentive to retailers' sales staff who sell its cameras. Alternatively, a car manufacturer might wish to incentivise dealers' staff to sell particular models of car. Such incentive schemes are often short-term and reward the best sellers in the form of holidays, goods or non-cash vouchers.
<P>
The provisions are designed specifically to address the concerns third party incentive providers and employers about the difficulties that they anticipate in meeting class 1A national insurance contribution liabilities. They asked us to allow third parties rather than employers to pay the national insurance contributions, as in the case of tax. We listened to them carefully, and the amendment provides what they asked for. It moves the liability for class 1A national insurance contributions on such benefits from the employer, who has had no hand in their provision, to the third party.
<P>
From 6 April 2001, the third-party provider's liability for class 1A national insurance contributions will become compulsory. On Royal Assent, the provision will take effect from 6 April 2000. We recognise that there is little time for forward planning in the first transitional year. The third party may choose whether to meet the class 1A liability on benefits that he provides. He must notify the Revenue in writing whether he will be paying. If he decides that he will meet the liability, we expect him to tell that to his employer. That will help employers who would otherwise have to pick up the bill for national insurance contributions on benefits that were given to their employees, possibly without their knowledge.
<P>
Switching the liability to the third-party provider should mean that employers will be glad to hear that their employees have received incentive awards, and that they will not resent the cost and hassle for themselves. It will also make life easier for manufacturers who want to incentivise salesmen and saleswomen to sell their products, and it will benefit the workers who receive the awards.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I seek clarification of a matter of fact. Will the third party have access to the employee's pay details in order to pay the relevant rate of national insurance?
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> No. Class 1A liability will not affect the situation of the third-party provider or the relevant liabilities. Class 1A national insurance will be paid on the benefits that are provided, as incentives, to the employee. There is therefore no need to give third-party individuals or companies access to an employee's pay details, which are, frankly, nothing to do with them. We need to establish how a third party can incentivise someone else's employee to sell their products.
<P>
To ensure that the national insurance fund receives all the national insurance contributions that are due in such cases, the new clause includes arrangements for the premises of third party providers to be open to inspection by Revenue officers. Late payment or non-payment will attract interest and penalties in the normal way.
<P>
New Clause 24 mirrors the UK provisions for Northern Ireland. Amendment No. 320 will merely add new clause 24 to the list of sections, which relate to Northern Ireland.
<P>
Moving Class 1A liability on to third parties who provide benefits is a sensible deregulatory measure that has been introduced at the request of the parties involved. I urge the Committee to accept the amendment.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I hinted on Tuesday and during our debate on the previous amendment that I wanted to discuss two matters in this context: the effects of the reduction in relation to the mixed cost rule and the relevant grossing up consequences. Although some of the amendments relate to a later clause, in your wisdom, Sir David, you rightly grouped them with amendment No. 332--that will improve our debate.
<P>
When we draft amendments, we do our best with the limited resources--they amount to virtually nothing--that are allotted to the Opposition. I readily concede that our amendments may not be perfect, but if the Government agree with their spirit, I should be happy if they advanced alternative amendments.
<P>
The clause deals with the mixed cost rules. Proposed new section 10(7), which will amend the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992, involves employees who provide benefits that are partly for business and partly for private use. National insurance will be applied to the full cost. National insurance will not arise only if the whole benefit is used for business purposes. In an effort not to provoke the Minister, I shall try to find a non-Christmas example. Let us suppose that a company decides to provide an employee with a fax machine because it frequently needs to send or receive from him information late at night or at weekends when he is at home. It may now be looking for more modern e-mail facilities. We have probably all seen the advertisement with ET, where one chap goes home, works through the weekend and e-mails a report to his employer on Sunday evening, while another employee stays at work and works hard through the weekend in his office. Both are working, one providing the information to the other.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The company may allow the employee to use the fax machine, or the e-mail facilities, for private matters, but that may represent only 5 per cent. of the use of the machine. The cost of the machine is, in the example that I have supplied, £500--rather an expensive fax machine--and annual call charges total £1,000. For income tax purposes the employee is taxed at 20 per cent. of £500 plus the cost of private calls--£150 in total per year. That is probably excessive in any case. But for national insurance purposes the amount on which tax arises will be 20 per cent. of £50 plus £1,000--and all for a fax machine which, for 95 per cent. of the time, is being used for business purposes. That is the problem that the amendments try to address.
<P>
I do not intend to spend much time on the clause, but I want to deal with the grossing-up point. The previous examples dealt with income tax, and employers often pick up the tab themselves rather than expect employees to pay. For example, while most employers throwing a Christmas dinner dance would expect to spend more than £75 a head--unless they work for the Minister--they virtually never let the employees suffer the tax. The effect on staff relations would be dreadful, as everyone expects the Christmas "do" to be free, as my hon. Friend the Member for New Forest, West said. Where the employer pays the tax, it is grossed up. I think that my hon. Friend referred to that earlier. The fact that the employer is paying is regarded as a benefit in kind. It is not bullion or gems: it is simply a Christmas party.
<P>
If, for example, a company provides a taxable benefit of £60 to a higher rate taxpayer but decides to pay the tax itself, the tax is not 40 per cent. of £60, equalling £24, but 40 per cent. of £100, equalling £40. Effectively tax is paid on the tax. All those calculations must be meat and drink to my hon. Friend the Member for New Forest, West.
<P>
From April, when national insurance kicks in, there will be a third tier of tax, because national insurance will apply to grossed-up amounts. Therefore, tax will be payable on tax. Not only are we taxing, we are taxing tax, and we are about to tax the tax that taxes the tax, which strikes me as excessive. [Interruption.] I do not know what has happened in the Whips' office. There was a time--you will know this, Sir David--when they loyally served their Government. It is refreshing that the hon. Member for Doncaster, North (Mr. Hughes) should 681 682 suggest that the measure is barmy. He is absolutely right. Not only do I agree with him; I shall personally, when Hansard is printed, take a copy to the Chief Whip, if I can find him, and present it to him.
<P>
<B>Mr. Kevin Hughes (Doncaster, North):</B> I did not say that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> The hon. Gentleman is too late. He has said his bit and we are grateful for that.
<P>
We are well away from Christmas and we all remember that happy time, so let us return to Christmas and talk about the Christmas party. Let us take someone on basic rate tax. The event costs £80. That is grossed up by 22 per cent. to £102.56. Income tax at 22 per cent. is £22.56 and national insurance at 12.2 per cent is £12.51. That is tax upon tax upon tax, which, as the Labour Whip rightly says, is a barmy idea. As a proportion of the cost of the benefit, the tax is 44 per cent.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> That is barmy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> My hon. Friend is right. Indeed, that might be our watchword for the day.
<P>
The equivalent figure for a higher rate employee is £149.60. As a proportion of the original cost, the tax is some 87 per cent. The true national insurance rate is 15.6 per cent. for a basic rate employee and 20.3 per cent. for a higher rate employee. That should be compared with a headline rate of 12.2 per cent. Again, we are back in the realms of social adjustment. As my hon. Friend the Member for New Forest, West said, the provision is giving rise to a new puritanism. [Interruption.] The hon. Member for Doncaster, North appears to want to intervene, but he has already done more than enough today to further his career.
<P>
I hope that we will be spared the Minister's Christmas speech. At one point, I thought that he was going to say, "When I was a lad living in Brum, I used to get two satsumas, a bag of monkey nuts and a Danny Blanchflower football annual for Christmas." That would be a dangerous road to travel. During our proceedings, he, my hon. Friend the Member for Tewkesbury and I have tried to outbid each other in respect of our working class credentials. During my childhood, I would have said that two satsumas and a bag of monkey nuts was rather a lot, and anyone who received a Danny Blanchflower football annual would have been regarded as middle class. No doubt my hon. Friend the Member for Tewkesbury could top that assertion.
<P>
Given that there is bipartisan agreement that layering tax upon tax upon tax is barmy, we should try to avoid doing so. We admit that the amendments may not be perfect; only a highly paid taxation lawyer could produce perfect amendments to such a clause. However, they illustrate our intention, and if the Government can find a way to avoid layering taxes, I will be happy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I think that I can respond positively to the hon. Gentleman's speech. Given one of the examples that he used, I thought for a moment that he had a copy of my speaking notes, but I have taken off my Roundhead helmet and we shall not go down that road.
<P>
The thing to have during my childhood was a Christmas log--
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> What size was the log? [Laughter.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The problem with discussing Christmas logs is that Hansard cannot properly report what is going on.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I shall be interested to read the Hansard report of the hon. Gentleman's speech when he waxed lyrical about taxes on taxes on taxes.
<P>
There are several reasons for asking the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment. I do not want to go over the list that I have read out previously. By and large, employers have found loopholes. To their credit, the previous Government closed those loopholes, but were shamed into doing so because they had existed for a long time. Loopholes have been closed over the years, but some gaps remain.
<P>
Only large companies, and perhaps some high tech companies with a small number of employees but huge potential, provide large benefit packages, and they can take account of all the tax relief. We have aimed for simplicity in the system, and I hope that that is apparent from the draft form that has been sent to employers. Hon. Members will see that it is not onerous to fill in. It is as easy as completing a self-assessment form for tax. I have never used an accountant and I have sometimes had problems, but the Revenue's newly designed forms are a fantastic improvement on previous forms. Simplicity is important and there has been no loss to the Revenue.
<P>
The forms that we sent out are a model of their kind. Employers have to enter a single figure on form P11D for the value of each benefit provided. That figure suffices for the employee to sort out his or her self-assessment and for the employer to calculate the class 1A liability.
<P>
We must ensure that the scheme is fair, and some items provided by the employer wholly for business purposes must be reported by the employer as benefits for tax. It is up to the employee to claim a deduction for business use. One example is the cost of membership of a professional body which is necessary to allow the employee to perform the duties of his employment. The new provisions exclude such benefits when the whole amount would be deductible for tax from class 1A. There would be no liability if the item provided is wholly for business use.
<P>
We are going further. My hon. Friend the Paymaster General announced in a press release on 19 November last year that easements will be made to the tax rules in the forthcoming Finance Bill. That is the antidote to accusations of stealth. It is an innovation for the Government to say in November what will be in the forthcoming Finance Bill. The easements will apply to class 1A national insurance contributions. When an employer provides items for business reasons and an employee occasionally makes personal use of them, those items will be free of tax and class 1 national insurance contributions. Wait for it--my brief then uses the example of a fax machine. I did not want to destroy the speech of the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar by interrupting him. A fax machine may be provided so that the employee can work at home on some days, but it could also be used to book a holiday or even to make Christmas party arrangements. In the past, a fax machine would have counted as a taxable benefit, but under the new rules it would not have to be reported. That is a sensible deregulatory measure, but if the spivs in the City attach the fax to the works' yacht or Roller, a few further problems could arise, so we must be on our guard. In that respect I hope that I have satisfied the hon. Gentleman. The deregulatory proposals and easements in the forthcoming Finance Bill will make much more sense.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> The Minister's statement clearly deals with mixed use. The other amendments deal with the grossing up point. Will the grossing up point be subject to the easements announced by the Government?
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> If the employer provides benefits and pays taxes grossed up in a PAYE settlement, class 1B contributions are paid. That is not the same arrangement. Otherwise the tax should be put through the payroll and class 1 contributions paid. Therefore, it is not quite so bad. If employers are doing what the hon. Gentleman said, they should be following other rules. I hope that I have satisfied the hon. Gentleman on that.
<P>
I do not deny that there are still some problems--I asked about this point when we were in our thinking mode some weeks ago--if the employer pays the tax on the benfit that is levied on the employee. That is an extra emolument, and, in theory, tax and national insurance contributions would be payable on that. Hon. Members must remember that taxable benefits to which section 10(7)(a) of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 will apply are those where there is a significant amount of personal use as well as business use.
<P>
Before the employer could calculate his class 1A liability, he would have to know exactly what the employee was planning to claim on his self-assessment form in relation to the business use of those benefits. Legislation would be needed requiring the employee to tell the employer about his personal tax affairs. I am certain that nobody in this Room would wish that to happen. The employer would also have to keep more records to justify the amount that he was deducting from the value of the benefit. That would be onerous and costly; we do not wish to put further unnecessary burdens on employers.
<P>
There would also be a timing issue, because the timing of the class 1A scheme is linked to the completion of the P11D forms rather than to the later completion of the self-assessment forms. There is a gap of several months between the two. It would be difficult to ensure that the employer had the necessary information from his employee in time to meet his--the employer's--class 1A obligations. The amendments have been useful in stimulating debate, but I hope that Opposition Members will accept that they would create many burdens while helping only a small number of people.
<P>
Amendment No. 334 seems to suggest that, if the employer meets his employee's tax bill on a benefit in kind, the amount of tax paid should be ignored for national insurance purposes. As I said, strictly speaking, there is a class 1 charge on such an amount, as it is an increase in gross pay. Under the clause, a class 1A liability will arise only if there is not already a class 1 national insurance liability, so the amendment would have no effect.
<P>
On small or irregular benefits the class 1 payment due can be subsumed into a PAYE settlement agreement if the employer pays class 1B national insurance on the value of the benefit and the tax on the benefit. That is a fair and accepted principle, which there is no reason to overturn, as proposed by the amendment. There will be some easements in this area in the forthcoming Finance Bill which, like all Labour Budgets, will be full of goodies for everybody.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> And I thought levity was over for this sitting. What the Minister said, especially on mixed use, was most helpful. Clearly, Parliament will scrutinise what the Chancellor says on the Floor of the House and--as we learned in relation to IR35 and the previous Budget--what is contained in various press releases.
<P>
The Minister said that the self-assessment form is becoming much easier, which I hope is the case. However, there is still a suggestion that people are benefiting from loopholes, and that the previous Government allowed payments in bullion and gems to linger on in terms of common practice. A number of people just happened to find a way around the system. To the best of my knowledge, the last person who was paid in bullion and gems was Captain Kidd, who was hanged a few miles down the river.
<P>
We are not closing loopholes, but we have done well in two respects. First, the Government have recognised that the mixed ruling is wrong. Secondly, given the Minister of State's remarks about the costs of the Christmas party, I am prepared to predict that the next Christmas bash at the Department of Social Security will be a much jollier event than it would otherwise have been. Although I expect the Official Secrets Act to be adhered to, if there is any slacking on the Christmas punch, I hope to be informed straight away. In view of the Minister of State's comments, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 317, in page 59, line 42. at beginning insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'any enactment contained in the Income Tax Acts'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to consider Government amendment No. 319.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> These are minor drafting amendments. Proposed new section 10(7) sets out a list of sections in the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 under which individual taxpayers may claim deductions or relief  from tax, but which are not appropriate for the calculation of class 1A national insurance contributions due from an employer. As originally drafted, the proposed new section 10(8) allows the Treasury to add further existing or future deduction or relief sections from the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 on to the list by regulations. The amendments widen that provision to include any similar sections from other Taxes Acts, including Finance Acts, should that be necessary.
<P>
Section 50 of the Finance Act 1989 is an example of that. It provides a deduction in relation to security assets and services. The amendments enable sensible adjustments, which lead to the deduction of tax liabilities and avoid the need for further primary legislation. They do no more than tidy up a list of sections.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 335, in page 60, line 30, leave out from 'beginning' to 'and' in line 31 and add
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'on 6 April of the year after the date of commencement of this Act, or, if the Act comes into force on various dates, the earliest of these dates,'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss the following amendments:
<P>
No. 336, in page 60, line 34, leave out from 'made' to end of line 36.
<P>
No. 342, in clause 59, page 63, line 35, leave out from 'beginning' to 'and' in line 36 and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'on 6th April of the year after the date of commencement of this Act, or, if the Act comes into force on various dates, the earliest of these dates,'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 343, in clause 59, page 63, line 39, leave out from 'made' to end of line 41.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> The amendments are straightforward and deal with a simple point. The Minister emphasised that the Bill would come into effect after the Budget, and that there would be a wait for Royal Assent. However, the liabilities are retrospective--they come into effect before the Bill receives Royal Assent.
<P>
As a special vote has to be held before each Budget debate to enable the collection of revenue through duty on cigarettes and alcohol, why should a social security measure not be subject to the same rigorous assessment? After all, we are most careful in this country about retrospective legislation, and about ensuring that we do not give to either House of Parliament the right to arbitrarily raise revenue until the proper process has been completed and Her Majesty has had the opportunity to give her assent. That is why the civil war took place.
<P>
It being twenty-five minutes past Eleven o'clock, The Chairman adjourned the Committee without Question put, pursuant to the Standing Order.
<P>
Adjourned till this day at half-past Two o'clock.
