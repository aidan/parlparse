                           </span> I welcome you to the
Chair this afternoon, Mr Weir. Perhaps I should repeat what I said on
clause 60 this morning. Clauses 60 to 62 deal with the same issue but
in relation to different benefits, so I am sure, Mr Weir, that you
would prefer me to speak once, at this point, about all the benefits
encompassed in those
clauses.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000021">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">This
morning, I was explaining my concern about the situation in which
someone has made national insurance contributions in an earlier period
of legitimate employment but is not entitled to work at the time the
benefit claim is made. Under the clauses, they would be penalised,
despite having legitimately and correctly been in work in an earlier
period and made financial national insurance contributions. There is a
clear injustice inherent in the clauses, because they remove the
limited entitlement to benefit built up through contributions made when
working and paying national insurance contributions and tax. We can
confidently expect to see families suffering considerable financial
hardship because of the removal of that
entitlement.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000022">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Currently,
persons subject to immigration control who have a
no-recourse-to-public-funds requirement as a condition of leave to
enter or remain in the UK are not usually able to claim means-tested
benefits should they lose their job, become unable to work due to
illness or injury, or need to take leave because of caring
responsibilities for a new child, and their sole protection is often
entitlement to non-means-tested benefits and statutory payments, such
as the maternity payments covered in clause 62, based on their work
history and their contributions to the national insurance fund and UK
taxes. That protection itself is currently limited. In the case of
contribution-based jobseeker’s allowance, it is paid for a
maximum of only six months, and the limits vary between 28 and 39 weeks
for the statutory payments, offering cover for only basic living costs
and no provision to meet housing and other needs that arise due to
illness or to having a new
child.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000023">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Clauses
60 and 61 would add additional conditions, for entitlement to JSA in
the case of the former, and for entitlement to employment and support
allowance based on the right to be employed in the UK in the case of
the latter. People whose leave to remain in the UK is dependent on
having employment or on working for a particular employer, and people
whose leave has run

                           </div>out and has not been renewed during the period of the claim, would no
longer be entitled to receive the benefits, despite their contribution
history. Although regulations could prescribe exceptions, the
explanatory notes suggest that it is not the Government’s
intention to use such a power, and as such the clauses appear to
undermine the principle of entitlement based on contributions and to
remove the incentive to regularise
employment.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000024">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It
would probably make more sense, Mr Weir, if I addressed as part of this
debate a couple of extra points in relation to clause 62, rather than
coming in again in a couple of clauses’ time. Would you like me
to do
that?<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000025">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I can assure you, Mr Weir, that I have absolutely
no wish to cover the ground again, but the points, in relation to the
benefits encapsulated in the different clauses, are very
similar.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000027">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Clause
62 links entitlement to maternity allowance, statutory maternity and
paternity payments, statutory sick pay and statutory adoption pay to
the right to be employed in the UK in the prescribed relevant week
before the expected childbirth, date of adoption or start of sickness,
as appropriate. The clause seems unnecessary, given that someone needs
to be working legally in the UK for an employer who is liable to pay
income tax for them in order for them to benefit from the payments,
except for maternity allowance, which can be paid to the self-employed
or to people with interrupted periods of employment. However, the
insertion of subsections allowing for variation by regulation from
those conditions into each relevant section of the Social Security
Contributions and Benefits Act 1992, and the intention indicated in the
accompanying explanatory notes, suggest undermining the statutory
rights even for those who remain employees and especially for those who
are self-employed or erratically employed, as might be the case with
maternity allowance claimants. The clause is either unnecessary, as it
does not change the position regarding legal employment, or it
undermines the principle of employees’ rights and entitlements
based on earlier contributions through the national insurance fund for
those who are vulnerable as a result of childbirth, adoption or
illness.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000028">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Although one
can understand, if not necessarily support, the Government’s
intention of preventing people from claiming on the basis of
contributions during working periods that were themselves illegitimate
at an earlier period, the problem with the clauses is that that is not
in fact what they penalise. They penalise people who work legitimately
and have made legitimate contributions at an earlier stage of
employment, but are now not legally entitled to work. That does not
seem fair, and it undermines the contribution principle. Because those
in such a situation would not necessarily be able to access
means-tested benefits, it risks leaving at least some people
destitute.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000029">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> That is not the point at all. It is about people
who might be making a further claim for leave to remain, who might be
entitled to be here but not to work here any longer, or who might have
arrived here in a relationship before the spouse or partner left or
deserted them but are still legally here in their own right. I would be
grateful for clarification from the Minister on that point in
particular. It is not right to assume that they have no right to be
here at all. The issue is simply that they are not entitled to
means-tested benefits at the time of making a claim for benefits, but
they would have been entitled to contribution-based benefits because
they made contributions legitimately at an earlier stage of employment.
It is an unjust undermining of the contribution principle that someone
pays in legitimately but then cannot withdraw what they have
contributed to, and that is the point I would like the Minister to
address.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000031">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Let me start by providing a little reassurance
to the hon. Lady before providing her with much less. She suggested
that the clauses could have an adverse impact on those who were
applying for a renewal visa, but I can assure her that that is not the
case. If somebody applies for a renewal visa, the previous visa
criteria continue to apply until a renewal decision is taken by the UK
Border Agency. If they had a previous entitlement to work, had built up
the contribution entitlement and sought permission to renew their visa
to stay in the UK, if it was a bona fide original visa, their status
would be treated as ongoing pending the visa renewal decision.
Therefore, it will not be a problem for them.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000032">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Let us be
clear on what clause 60 is really all about. Current legislation
already ensures that someone subject to immigration control cannot
qualify for means-tested, non-contributory benefits. The existing
conditions of entitlement for contribution JSA do not explicitly
specify that a claimant must be entitled to work in the UK and the
existing conditions for contributory ESA, maternity allowance and other
statutory payments do not prevent people who are working or who have
worked illegally from qualifying for the benefits or measures of
earnings replacement. It is entirely feasible under the current rules
that a claimant who has worked illegally and paid national insurance
contributions—we know that national insurance numbers were
issued to illegal immigrants under the previous Government—could
be entitled to contributory benefits, maternity allowance and other
statutory payments. Similarly, individuals could have worked legally,
but made a claim for one of those benefits or statutory payments when
they were no longer entitled to work in the UK. We think that it is not
right that a person who has no current entitlement to work in this
country might be able to receive work-related benefits. This clause and
those which follow close the loophole in the social security system
once and for all to achieve these required policy intentions.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000033">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The hon. Lady
said that these clauses will impact upon those who have paid into the
system while working legally, but whose immigration status has since
changed, leaving them with no call upon the contributions they have
made. That is true. I know that there are many new Members on this
Committee. On many occasions over the years, people have come to see me
with a clear ruling from the UK Border Agency that they do not have a 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 672<a class="bkMark" name="Column672">&#160;</a>
                           </div>right to stay in the UK. You would be surprised, Mr
Weir—or you probably would not be surprised from your own
experience—how frequently those people pop up again two or three
years later with a further issue. Despite the fact that they have been
told that they have no further right to stay in the UK and that they
need to make arrangements to leave the country, they are still
here.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000034">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We do not
believe that somebody in that position should be entitled to receive
contribution-based benefits, whether or not they were legally employed
when they first made those contributions. If they are not legally in
the country, they should not be able to receive those
benefits.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000035">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There is
nothing unusual about that. It is common with the treatment of other
existing entitlement provisions. Anybody who does not meet any of the
other required entitlement conditions to a contributory benefit would
be refused, irrespective of previous payments of national insurance
contributions. In particular, we are talking about people who are
overstayers. We do not want to send a message that people can overstay
a visa, get away with it and subsequently receive money from the
state.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000036">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I am clear
that this is a loophole that needs to be closed. I hope that the hon.
Lady feels reassured that somebody whose status has
changed—somebody who entered the country perfectly legally under
a spouse visa, who had been working previously but whose partner had
left—can re-apply and maintain their existing visa status. I
think that that is right. However, somebody who has simply ignored a UK
Border Agency decision, has been to appeal, has had their appeal turned
down, yet has still managed to stay in the country, should not be able
to pop up a few years later and say, “I want contribution-based
benefits based on what I paid when I was legally here”, when
they are currently illegally here. That is what we are seeking to do
with these changes.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000037">&#160;</a>

under your chairmanship, Mr Weir. Just for clarification, I have some
questions about the clauses that the Government have introduced under
the heading of industrial injuries. I am far from an expert on
industrial injuries law, but this seems to make some degree of sense.
It looks as if it is pegging up the legislation, and it would appear
that the clauses in relation to trainees and under-18s give new rights
to those groups of workers. That is to be welcomed.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000042">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">May
I ask the Minister one or two questions for reassurance? First, it is
indicated in the legislation that there are different regimes in
different parts of the UK, particularly in relation to skills and
training. Have the implications of the legislation for the
devolved Administrations been fully addressed? Have discussions 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 673<a class="bkMark" name="Column673">&#160;</a>
                           </div>with the devolved Administrations taken place to ensure that the rights
of trainees have been properly addressed and are consonant across the
different Administrations in the UK?<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000043">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">More
significantly perhaps, perhaps what we are looking for most in this
legislation is clarification that there is no loss of rights for
workers suffering accident or injury during the course of their work. I
can see the argument for moving on from the declaration of accident and
the status that that special declaration gives. I would like
reassurance that that abolition does not involve any loss of rights for
workers who suffer injury in future.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000044">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Let me reassure the Committee, the hon. Lady,
and indeed those in receipt of compensation payments under these
schemes that this is very much a tidying-up measure. It repeals the
legislation that maintains the existence of two separate schemes for
providing state no-fault compensation for work injuries occurring
before 1948. These schemes have been in place for many years. When this
provision comes into force, existing payments and claims for state
no-fault compensation for work injuries will be dealt with as claims
under the main industrial injuries disablement benefits scheme,
regardless of when the disease or accident occurred.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000046">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">To be
absolutely clear, the Government are committed to providing support for
those people who find themselves in this kind of very difficult
situation. We believe that everyone injured through their work should
be treated equally, which is one reason for abolishing the pre-1948
schemes and transferring responsibility to the main industrial injuries
disablement benefits scheme. The provision simplifies and rationalises
the scheme, reducing the complexity caused by multiple schemes and
making it easier for everyone, claimants and staff alike. Most
particularly, it is important to say that no one loses out financially.
In fact, the opposite is true; there are 120 people who will
be £5 a week better off as a result of these changes. New claims
under the pre-1948 schemes are now extremely unlikely, and there will
be a slightly higher rate for some existing
claimants.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000047">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
terms of the devolved Administrations, yes, we have had those
conversations. One of the benefits of these changes, if I may trespass
ahead Mr Weir, is that clause 65 abolishes the separate trainee status,
meaning that young people are treated as adult workers. In my view that
is the right thing to do; if one suffers a long-term injury it really
does not matter whether one is 19 or 25. It is sensible to have a
similar status for everyone. The trainee status is there for historic
reasons that we do not believe apply anymore, so that anomaly is also
tidied up. We end up with a streamlined system that has been discussed
across the United Kingdom with all the devolved Administrations, where
no one loses—in fact, a few people gain—and that is
simpler, cleaner, and easier for everyone involved. On that basis I
commend the clause to the
Committee.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000048">&#160;</a>

the Government’s intention is to subject some 720,000 households
to a penalty for under-occupying their socially rented homes, with a
reduction of 13% of total housing benefit entitlement if they are one
bedroom under-occupied, or 23% if two bedrooms or more are
under-occupied. The principle on which that will be based is the same
as applies in the private rented sector with the local housing
allowance, which the Government also intend to uprate in line with the
consumer prices
index.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000055">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Some
of the things we do not know include why the Department for Work and
Pensions is applying a definition of under-occupation that does not
exist as far as the Department for Communities and Local Government is
concerned. For social housing, we have a whole mechanism for
determining under-occupation, but the DCLG simply does not recognise
that as applying in the private rented sector. It does not have that
level of definition. I am interested to know why the Government are
applying different
definitions.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000057">&#160;</a>

asked the DCLG a question about what definition it used to determine
under-occupancy. The Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local

                        <p class="tabbed">We
do not have any real sense of the scale of under-occupation, given that
the social landlords concerned do not recognise it—they do not
have their own definition and are not able to measure it. We do not yet
have any idea how landlords will be able to respond, given their
limited
options.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000060">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">In
a year’s time, in April 2012, when we expect the regulations,
the landlords will have even less time in which to prepare for a
radical—unprecedentedly radical—change to the social
rented sector. We do not know how many categories of tenants will be
covered. We do not know how people who are legally sub-letting,
students, pensioners who are not the lead tenant or their partners will
be treated. The Government have told us that pensioner tenants, or
pensioner tenants’ partners, will be excluded from the measures,
but they have said nothing about any other pensioner members of the
household. A great many people share their properties with one elderly
parent or more, and provide
care.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000061">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We
do not know the maximum that any tenant might lose. We know the average
impact on different household sizes, but in response to another
question the Department was unable to tell me the maximum level of
loss. We are, therefore, approaching the regulations with little
information. We do not know what assessment the Department has made of
the capacity in the sector to meet the legitimate need for downsizing,
or whether any transitional arrangements will be made. For example, two
children of different genders who are under 10 have been placed, quite
legitimately, in a property by their social landlord, each with their
own room. At the moment, such a household would be deemed to be
under-occupying for the purposes of the benefit cut by the Department.
In a year’s time, one of those children will turn 10, and they
will cease to be under-occupying. In the meantime, ludicrously, they
will either be required to move for 10 or 12 months, or their
parent—perhaps a lone parent on a minimal income—will be
required to lose we do not know how much, but on average in the region
of £20 a week.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000062">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We do not
know what measures the Department intends to take to ensure that at
least 30% of the private rented market is available, in line with the
30th percentile being adopted for that measure. We do not know what
measures will be taken to ensure that that level of property is
available for people in the private rented sector. I am quite shocked
by the thinness of the briefing on the regulations. Three quarters of a
million households will be affected in the social rented sector alone,
and 1 million in the private rented sector. That we are
approaching regulations of such complexity, where there is so great a
level of need, without knowing that there will be the opportunity to
discuss them through the affirmative procedure in both Houses of
Parliament is extremely unfortunate. I hope that the Minister will
reassure me that she will be sympathetic to ensuring that such an
opportunity is afforded by the affirmative
procedure.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000063">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I am disappointed by that intervention. Security
of tenure for council tenants was introduced in 1981 by the
Conservative Government under Margaret Thatcher. She presumably
understood that security of tenure is important to tenants. Prior to
that, in theory councils had the power of life, death and eviction over
their tenants, although I do not think that many operated in such a
way. Tenants’ groups fought hard for security of tenure. If
length of tenure is longer in the council and housing association
sector—although I think that is variable—that is often
because of people’s financial circumstances and their inability
to find anything else or move on. Many people in the owner-occupied
sector will be able to move on and climb the housing ladder that
everybody is talking about.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000067">&#160;</a>

is a huge mismatch in house size, and most of the small homes are in
either high-rise blocks or sheltered housing. It would clearly be
counter-productive to say, “As pensioners will not be affected
by the measure, we will put other people or families into the small,
sheltered houses, because those are the only small houses we
have.” High-rise housing is often seen by people as a step
backwards. Far from being on a housing ladder, in many respects people
would be put on a housing snake if they were forced to move. That would
be highly regrettable.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000068">&#160;</a>

number of tenants have approached me in the recent past to say that
they are still living in a much larger house than they need. Their
families have grown up and they have perhaps been widowed. They would
like to move, but the practical problem is that what they want and need
to move to is not necessarily available. Many want to live in the
community that they are used to, where their social contacts are, where
they may have family links and where they go to church or local clubs.
They do not want to be moved willy-nilly to wherever there happens to
be an available house. Unfortunately, that is often extremely difficult
to deliver quickly. I was struck by the evidence given by David Orr to
the Committee; he said that by using quite a complicated chain of moves
and transfers, a landlord or housing provider could achieve some of
those effects, but it is difficult. The really practical problem was
not that the tenants did not want to move, but that there was no
suitable housing for them in the area that they wanted. That is where
the mismatch occurred.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000071">&#160;</a>

I could wax lyrical about allocation policies for many hours, but I am
sure that that would be outwith the remit of the amendment. I agree
that there are things that need to be done in that respect. The great
pressure in Scotland to prioritise, for good reasons, those who present
as homeless has begun to squeeze out every other reason to move. There
are perhaps grounds for going back to some of the previous
arrangements, in which transfer tenants sometimes got priority in order
to release a property and get the movement going. That is a matter of
allocation policy, and things can be done about that. We should address
that. I am not convinced that it will be addressed by simply reducing
the amount of benefit that is paid to people who happen to need benefit
because they are in a low-paid job or have lost their job—they
may return to employment after a period.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000073">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Simply
reducing benefit will not solve the housing issue. I rather suspect
that the majority of people will simply take the hit on their income
and make it up from some other place, perhaps with difficulty.
Nevertheless, the reduction will be a loss of overall income, rather
than a means of resolving very tricky problems—problems that
have to be resolved with tact, sympathy and humanity, because these are
people’s homes. We are talking about people living in the
communities that they are used to, and it would be regrettable not to
take all that into account. That is not to say that we should not look
at some of those issues; I certainly think that we should.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000074">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I have argued
with my local authority and others in the housing field about who we
prioritise and why. Would it not be better to have two happy tenants
when we make the sort of arrangement that the hon. Gentleman suggested,
rather than only one person being housed and the other remaining
unhappy for a long period?

a delight to do so, and to start the discussions on housing benefit.

Member for Edinburgh East said that she was a little unclear about our
objectives in relation to housing benefit. Without straying too far
from the amendment, I thought it would be useful to underline for her
and other members of the Committee exactly what we are trying to do. It
is not straightforward; we are trying to do something quite complex. We
are trying to make better use of our housing stock, which all
constituency MPs must want. I speak as a Hampshire MP with many
thousands of people on a housing list. I understand the importance of
making better use of our housing stock for those with the greatest
need. We are also trying to strengthen work incentives, ensure that
people in social housing can transfer into work, and ensure that they
are not living in housing beyond their means without the subsidy that
they currently
receive.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000077">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Lastly,
but by no means least, we aim to contain spiralling expenditure. As I
am sure the hon. Member for Westminster North will know, housing
expenditure spiralled over the past 10 years under the Labour
Administration, from £11 billion to £21.5 billion a year.
If we are to ensure that housing benefit is there for the future to
support people who need it most, it is absolutely incumbent on us to
create a sustainable situation for the future. We have to remember that
housing benefit shapes the rental market. I do not need to remind
Opposition Members that a report conducted by the FindaProperty website
pointed out that between November 2008 and February 2010 private rental
sector costs reduced by 5%, while the local housing allowance sector
saw claims increase by 3%. There is a problem with the market being out
of kilter, and that has to be addressed.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000078">&#160;</a>

shall rigorously address amendment 174, which would make the
regulation-making provisions on appropriate maximum housing benefit
subject to the affirmative procedure. As the Minister of State said
earlier, housing benefit legislation is extensive, and deals with a
significant amount of detail. As Opposition Members will know, it is
amended frequently through regulations to ensure that procedures and
customer service are the best that they can be and respond to the
changes in housing provision. Housing benefit will need

			Column number: 679<a class="bkMark" name="Column679">&#160;</a>
                           </div>to provide support to a large number of people with very different
needs. The system also needs to maintain flexibility so that changes
can be made quickly without disproportionate demands on the
legislature. That is why I think that the regulation-making powers
should remain subject to the negative
procedure.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000081">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
the Minister of State said earlier, we are not intransigent. We have
said clearly that we would be willing to look at whether it would be
appropriate to use the affirmative procedure in some circumstances,
particularly early on, when new ideas are being discussed. However,
that will be difficult in practice, particularly for housing benefit.
We do not see housing benefit in the same light as some of the other
examples that we have talked about. As Opposition Members will know,
there are obvious ways that they can have the sort of debate that they
seek, covering the issues that they highlighted: by praying against
regulations that are subject to the negative resolution. We feel that
it would be disproportionate at this point to make all these provisions
for regulations subject to the affirmative procedure. I hope that the

Minister’s point that there is already extensive regulation on
housing benefit, but we are none the less dealing with changes that are
unprecedented in their ferocity, particularly in the area of social
housing under-occupation. Given the way in which the CPI uprating will
impact on the local housing allowance, significant
numbers—possibly hundreds of thousands—of people could,
over a relatively short period, become unable to access any
accommodation in large geographical areas. We certainly do not have the
safeguards that we
need.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000083">&#160;</a>

social housing, although I think that what I said will be true of
social housing. Research on the subject by the university of Cambridge
was extensive, and warned of the longer-term implications of the
application of CPI to the local housing allowance. I am sure that we
would agree that there are areas where we would, wherever possible,
want to bear down on rents in the private rented sector. Given the
increasing importance of that sector to the Government’s housing
policy, it is absolutely incumbent on Parliament to satisfy itself that
there will be, in all broad areas of the country, a sufficiency of
private rented accommodation that can be obtained by people on the
local housing allowance. Academic research indicates that there are
real concerns about whether that will happen. It is exactly for that
reason, as well as because of the social housing implications, that I
was seeking the affirmative procedure.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000085">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> These amendments concern two aspects of the proposed
penalty for social housing under-occupation as they apply to people
with disabilities and to adapted accommodation. What we know from the
Government’s own impact assessment is that, of the 750,000 or so
households that face a loss on their housing benefit for having one or
more bedrooms than is deemed necessary, there is a disproportionate
impact on people who are disabled. Some 66% of all the claimants for
housing benefit in the social rented sector affected by these cuts are
deemed by the Government’s own admission to be disabled. That is
quite an extraordinary thing to do—to bring forward a policy
that is so disproportionate in its impact on older and disabled people.
What we would expect, therefore, is for measures to be brought forward
by the Government that would mitigate the impact on those disabled
people.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000090">&#160;</a>

specifically looks at the extent to which those severely disabled
people who are entitled to the disability living allowance might be
protected from the worst implications of these cuts. Unfortunately, and
this almost helps to prove the point that I made in discussing a
previous amendment, the Government do not know how many people are on
disability living allowance in the social rented sector. What will
unravel so much of this measure is exactly how much the Government do
not know.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000091">&#160;</a>

asked a parliamentary question seeking information about how many
disability living allowance claimants will be affected by the changes.
I was told that that information was not available and that, if new
information becomes available, it is disproportionately expensive to
analyse it and present it to Parliament. We are therefore in something
of a dilemma in that we cannot answer a question to which I would have
thought it absolutely essential the Government know the

has not introduced any proposals to remedy the discrimination that the
measures imply against people with a disability. As has been the case
elsewhere, the only mitigation that is being brought forward by the
Government is the reliance on the discretionary housing
payment.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000093">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Discretionary
housing payments have fast become the philosopher’s stone of the
Government. In fact, to be honest, they make the loaves, the fishes and
the feeding of the 5,000 seem like a positively unambitious model of
social policy. Out of the £190 million total fund to be made
available over the coming years, only an extra £40
million—it is better than nothing—will go into the
discretionary housing payments pot. That money is expected somehow to
fill a gap left by the nearly £1.8 billion of housing
benefit that has been withdrawn in both the private rented and social
rented sector. I hope that I am not misleading the Committee, but
certainly in the impact assessments I have looked at, whenever a
question is asked of the Government about the disproportionate impact
of the measure, what will happen to protect people who are most
vulnerable and what transitional measures might be available to help
people, a reference is always made to the discretionary housing payment
pot. Yet that pot appears to provide only 10p in the pound
for every pound that is being
lost.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000094">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I absolutely welcome those measures and, of course,
I am pleased to do so. That is a welcome step, but it applies to a very
specific group: people who are deemed to require the services of a
carer. That is excellent, but it will have no impact at all on the
needs of people who are disabled and severely disabled. I am talking
about people who, in some cases, have obtained their social rented
accommodation precisely through the allocation procedures that rightly
give a degree of priority to people with high levels of medical need.
We know that, over the past decades, as social housing has become
increasingly residualised, it has become increasingly difficult to get
into social housing unless one falls into a needs category. Obviously,
by definition, the proportion of people in social housing who have high
levels of vulnerability including disability has gone up. That is
exactly the case
here.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000096">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
have an age profile of that particular group of people. Under-occupiers
by definition are likely to be older people. The hon. Member for Dover
commented on that issue and talked particularly about pensioners. Of
course, by definition, people who are older are likely to be
under-occupiers. They are people who, in many cases, got their
accommodation when they had children. Sometimes, they are still in
homes they have had for 30 or 40 years. As they get older,
many of those people naturally and inevitably will have a degree of
disability.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000097">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
know the level of disproportionality in terms of the impact of the
policy and that the discretionary housing payment is wholly inadequate
to this task. According to my calculator, the discretionary housing
payment pot would not be adequate even to help a proportion—an
assumed percentage—of people on disability living allowance in
the social rented sector if

to be elastic enough to offset virtually everything that is happening
in the private rented sector, as well as in the social rented sector.
Anyway, the problem with the discretionary housing payment, which is
being put forward by the Government as the panacea to the problem, is
that it is time limited. The whole point of the discretionary housing
payment is that it is meant only to be a short-term measure. That will
not be good enough for people who have severe disabilities and live in
homes that, in many cases, they have had for years and they are living
in with the support of family and friends who live in their local
communities.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000098">&#160;</a>

saying that moving along under those circumstances may not make that
much sense. Will she clear up how the disabled are a special group,
other than if an adaptation already sits in a house? Those who need
housing benefit and support for their rent need it whether they are
disabled or not. Taking account of the adaptations in a house under

According to everything that we know about people with a disability,
particularly those in social rented sectors—we have a reasonable
idea of their income profiles—often, they are the poorest. We
know how many people the cut in housing benefit is going to affect, and
we know from the Government that that includes 66% of
households—about 400,000—with people with
disabilities. Moreover, to stray into amendment 190, no one
knows for sure whether the capacity exists—in fact, we doubt
that it does—to move them to another property. We therefore know
that the Government’s proposal will affect some 400,000
households with people with disabilities—including a significant
but unknown number of people who are sufficiently severely disabled to
qualify for DLA—who will not be able to move and who will,
therefore, be required to top up their rent from their disability
allowances or their other very low income. That will be difficult for
very-low-income people, and to apply that penalty, which will in some
cases be unavoidable, to people who are disabled is, frankly,
disgraceful. I do not understand how it can be
justified.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000100">&#160;</a>

perfectly suitable for their needs. They may be ground-floor properties
or small houses, and the people may have had cancer or a stroke, or
they may have incurred some other disability or moved in with a
particular disability. The property might not be adapted but, for the
purposes of the amendment, those people are severely disabled and are
entitled to DLA. I am asking the Government to make sure that those
people are protected from the implications of this policy. Otherwise,

                           </strong> I am sorry, but that is what I said. David Orr said
in evidence to the Committee that an estimated 108,000 working-age
social housing tenants who claim housing benefit live in adapted homes
with one or more spare rooms. These are adapted homes, so if the
tenants move adaptations will have to be made to many new properties.
The average cost of a disabled facilities grant is in excess of
£6,500; a ramp costs at least £500 and a level access
shower costs about £3,500. The disabled facilities grant cost an
average of £100 million a year in recent years, so we have an
idea of how much money is being spent on bricks and mortar.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000107">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">By
definition, in the overwhelming majority of cases, the expenditure is
not portable. The money is invested in property for specific
individuals. However, as things stand, there is no indication that
these properties will be exempted from the cuts. Severely disabled
people, so severely disabled that the property has to be adapted, are
left with a choice. The first is to move, but the provider, who may not
be satisfactory for all sorts of other reasons, will have to incur the
expenditure of adapting the property. The second is that severely
disabled people, who are on low incomes and receiving housing benefit,
will have to pay an average of £13 a week, or £21 a week
in London. We do not know whether that will be the highest shortfall
that people will face in the employment and support allowance or the
disability living allowance in order to stay in their own
property.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000108">&#160;</a>

believe that the Government intend for that to happen. When the
Minister considered what was being proposed in last year’s
Budget, I doubt whether she expected severely disabled people with
properties adapted at public expense to be subject to either such a
penalty or an enforced move. It is essential that she assures us that
both categories of people and property will be protected in some way
from the worst impact of the cuts in housing
benefit.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000109">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">It was said
earlier that since there is recognition of the need for carers and that
that should be covered by housing benefit, it might resolve the issue
for many. However, many people require care on a fluctuating basis.
They may not have a 24-hour, live-in carer, because one is not funded
or because they do not need it, but sometimes, particularly when
poorly, they may need a relative to stay with them. Many people have
told me that that is exactly what happens: the daughter, the mother or
the sister may visit, perhaps only for a night or so, to help at times
of difficulty. However, if there is no bedroom for them, they have to
sleep on the sofa or its equivalent, which is not particularly
satisfactory.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000111">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Another
problem that sometimes arises for people with disabilities is storage.
Depending on the size of the house, it can be difficult to store the
equipment needed. That may include such things as additional
wheelchairs if different chairs are needed for different circumstances,
or hoists and other facilities. Some of this equipment may not fit into
certain rooms but have to be stored elsewhere, and many houses do not
have extensive storage space, which makes it difficult. Indeed, I know
of cases where people were allocated somewhere too big in recognition
of that need, to make their lives a great deal easier. There are
genuine circumstances in which it is helpful and correct that people
have additional space. Indeed, going back to my earlier point, they are
unlikely to move unless something is offered, but suitable property is
not always available and they will suffer a reduction in income as a
result.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000112">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">There
is also the issue of mismatch. If somebody needs ground-floor
accommodation that is easily accessible—in my city there is
ground-floor accommodation with a lot of steps to the front door, which
is unsuitable—having got the property that suits that need, it
may be extremely difficult to find something similarly suitable. Given
that many with what, in my authority, we call gold priority—or
top medical priority, as it was called—often wait for years for
suitable properties, even when they have the highest level of priority
offered by our housing provider, the problem is not that we cannot give
them any higher priority, but that the suitable property is not
available. Since that is the case already, if people have been
successful and moved into a property which technically has an extra
room, or a member of the family has moved away, it will be virtually
impossible in many cases to find a speedy solution for
people.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000113">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There are
several circumstances, short of adaptations, in which people need
additional space. Where they have such space—which may not have
been brought about because of their illness or disability—the
chance of

                           </div>getting them suitable property within the very limited social housing
stock that many of us have in our areas would be very difficult.
Regarding adaptations, it would certainly seem the opposite of making
best use of property to move somebody from an already adapted property
into one that requires adapting over again, and then to find somebody
who needs those adaptations to move into the house that has been
vacated.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000114">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There is a
risk of shifting the cost from the housing benefit bill to another
bill, which local authorities may have to pick up. The adaptations
budget of my council for its tenanted homes, the budget it holds for
adapting other sorts of property, and the budgets of housing
associations in Scotland for adaptations are always over-stretched.
There are always people waiting, and we must take that into account.
Sometimes, when we look at savings and do not look at the bigger
picture, we simply remove costs from one part of the public sector and
impose them on another.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000115">&#160;</a>

for Edinburgh East for their contributions. Hopefully, my comments will
offer them a little reassurance about the Government’s approach.
We have had many representations on the issue, as the hon. Member for
Edinburgh East knows, and about how we deal with people who have
particular needs, as she and the hon. Member for Westminster North
outlined. I understand their arguments. When somebody has been in a
property that has been adapted for their disability, does it make sense
to move them to a different property and have more spent on another set
of adaptations, particularly when the average cost of disabilities
facilities grants are about £7,000, and there were about 44,000
of such grants made in 2009-10?<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000116">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Many
adaptations can be quite inexpensive: from knocking on many front doors
recently—as I am sure the hon. Lady has—I have seen that
many adaptations can be as simple as putting in a handrail or a ramp so
that there is easier access. However, there are more extensive
adaptations, particularly, for instance, to kitchens and
bathrooms.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000117">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It is not the
Government’s intention, as the hon. Member for Edinburgh East
said, to shift the cost to another part of the budget. We want to make
sure that there is a sensible approach. I can see the sense in the
argument that has been presented, and we will explore the matter
further. Indeed, the National Housing Federation estimated during our
evidence session that around 108,000 housing benefit claimants
are living in adapted accommodation and could be affected by the
measure. The federation has kindly agreed to give us that data so that
we may consider further what it is saying. Providing an exemption for
all adapted accommodation would not be the right approach, because we
must ensure that we understand the degree of adaptation necessary to
ensure that, if an exemption is made, it is warranted and that it would
be more expensive to adapt another property rather than allowing
someone to stay where they
are.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000118">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
adaptation may relate to a previous tenant—we can all think of
examples of that—to previous members of the household, or to
people who may no longer need it. A blanket exemption for adapted
accommodation across the board could give rise to unintended
consequences. We would not consider that broad-brush approach, but we
will consider the matter further, and I assure the

understanding of the numbers and costs involved before the provision is
finalised. We will talk to experts, and I hope that that reassures
Committee members that the Government are in the same place as
them.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000119">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Member for Westminster North picked up on a few other issues that
I want to mention, including the impact of the measures on disabled
people. She asserted that there is a disproportionate impact on them,
but I want to take her to task on that. I am sure that she has read our
equality impact assessment, and she will have seen that two thirds of
those who may be affected by the measure could be considered disabled.
She will also know that throughout the social rented sector,
approximately two thirds of claimants are disabled.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000120">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We want to
minimise any adverse effect on people who may be in accommodation that
has been adapted, and we will look at ways of doing so, but not
everyone who receives disability living allowance has had adaptations
to their accommodation, and certainly it is not disproportionate for
the Government to put in place a measure that reflects the make-up of
those who are claiming rent in the social rented sector. Two thirds of
the people in the sector have disabilities, but the impact on that
group is not disproportionate. That is important. The Government take
seriously their duties under the equalities legislation, and will
ensure that it does not disproportionately affect individuals,
particularly disabled people. I hope that that clarifies that not only
is it not our intention, but it is also not the reality that the
measure will affect disabled people
disproportionately.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000121">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Lady also picked up on housing payments and said that
discretionary housing payments were seen as a panacea. I understand her
point, but they have been tripled to ensure that money is available for
local authorities to deal with the changes. We do not underestimate
them, and other changes are being made in the sector by my colleagues
in other Departments. There is a lot of change, but we are trying to
ensure that money is available locally for local authorities to deal
with he circumstances, and I hope that that will ensure flexibility in
the system to enable local authorities to respond
accordingly.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000122">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_ParaIndent">The
hon. Member for Edinburgh East picked up on some other points,
including the needs of people with fluctuating conditions. I assure her
that the measure on an additional room for carers, which will be
introduced in April, will apply to social sector tenants. That will be
helpful. When someone’s need for care and for equipment
fluctuates—she outlined that situation graphically—local
authorities may pragmatically use the discretionary housing payments to
cover such costs so that they have the flexibility to respond to
people’s
needs.</p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
now wish to direct my comments to amendments 175 and 190
because, based on the contributions made by the hon. Member for
Westminster North, I wonder whether the Opposition totally intended the
amendments to be tabled as they have been. Some of the points that I
made when I reviewed the amendments have not been picked up. The clause
reflects the Government’s intention to use methods other than a
local rent officer’s determination to restrict a person’s
appropriate maximum housing benefit, and we intend to steer local
housing allowance rates in a more appropriate direction and to take on
the problems that we have with housing benefit costs in the social
sector. That second intention is particularly important 
<div class="columnNumber">

                           </div>if we are to get the housing benefit bill down to a
level that the country can realistically afford and are to support the
most vulnerable groups—the people who really need social
housing—in

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
175 is curious because it would require us to base levels of housing
benefit, for people living in households where any occupant is in
receipt of disability living allowance, on actual rents paid, which
would, in essence, force the taxpayer into an open-ended commitment to
meet those claimants’ rental costs, no matter how high the rent
or how exclusive the area they chose to live in. I am not sure if that
was what the hon. Lady intended, but it could be the unintended
consequence of the amendment. The amendment would also send a clear
message to landlords that they could charge unlimited rents to certain
claimants, safe in the knowledge that the taxpayer would always foot
the bill. I do not think that that was the hon. Lady’s
intention, but perhaps she could clarify that
matter.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000124">&#160;</a>

for me whether it is the Government’s intention to exempt DLA
from the overall benefit cap that we will discuss later. I thought that

                           </strong> The hon. Lady knows that individuals in receipt of
benefits will not be subject to the cap, but that is separate from the
point that I am making, which is that the amendment would, to all
intents and purposes, leave us open to an unlimited bill for rental
costs, which I do not think is her intention. If it were, my next
question would be: how does the Labour party intend to pay for that?
The behavioural impact would be incalculable, but we estimate that,
based on current contractual rents for non-housing benefit cases that
would become eligible for support, there would be an annual cost of up
to £650 million. Perhaps the hon. Lady wants to think about how
her amendment needs to be amended to ensure that that was not the
case.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000126">&#160;</a>

have had several representations on the issue that amendment 190
covers, and I hope that, having listened to what I have said, the hon.
Lady and her colleagues will be content that it is not our intention to
put in place something that would have a disproportionate impact on
disabled people. If someone has had their property adapted because of
their disability, it makes no sense to move them to a different
property and spend more money on costly adaptations. Adaptations are
tailored to the individual and it is important, therefore, to look at
the issue locally. Many thousand such awards are made every year; many
are minor and relatively small but some are not, and it is important to
do further work to identify the latter and to ensure that we look at
ways of handling the issue in the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000127">&#160;</a>

would take, and I hope that the hon. Lady will think further about my
comments and about how we can best target the help at people, while

where accommodation has been adapted for someone, it is still
absolutely necessary to meet their
needs.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000128">&#160;</a>

Although the hon. Member for Westminster North says that we do not have
a great deal of time, two years is a considerable period to ensure that
the changes are implemented in the best way, so that things make good
sense both economically and as regards the well-being of the tenants
involved. We want to ensure that we consider all matters fully, so that

Minister of State’s analogy of the bookcase, this is very much
about building the structure before we add the detail. We have
certainly not ruled out an approach that would put in place a safeguard
for disabled people, as well as for other groups that may also require
a safeguard. Detailed secondary legislation will be the place to sort
that out, so, with those reassurances, I hope that the hon. Member for

on housing benefit expenditure if it were not for the fact that the
Department for Communities and Local Government, which is responsible
for setting rents in the social rented sector, is currently rampaging
down a route towards setting social housing rents at 80% of market
value. That will add hundreds of millions of pounds to the benefit bill

                        <p class="tabbed">In the
Minister’s remarks about the discretionary housing payment, I do
not think that there was any demurring when it came to my concern about
the extent to which the DHP is being asked to bear far too great a
burden. She said, rightly, that Government investment in the
discretionary housing payment had tripled, but she failed to remind us
that that happened because the cuts to housing benefit in the social
and private rented sectors total £1.8 billion. There is really
no point in talking about additional investment in the DHP unless we
talk about what it is being stretched to cover.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000132">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">My hon.
Friend the Member for Edinburgh East put some flesh on the bones of the
points that I made by giving good examples of the nature of the
property, whether adapted or not, that people with disabilities can
live in, and I am grateful to her for raising those issues. I recognise
and appreciate the Minister’s comments about the work that needs
to be done to look at adapted properties. That is welcome, but it
slightly worries me that it will require a massive assessment task. I
wonder who the final arbiter will be when it comes to making a decision
about what is, or is not, an appropriate property for a person who is
disabled to live in.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000133">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Obviously,
the example that my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh East gave of a
property that was adapted for a previous tenant is simple, and cut and
dried. I fear, however, that there may be a world of pain

                           </div>when it comes to social landlords. It would not actually be a social
landlord who made the decisions about the adaptation. A different
authority, such as a social services department or a contracted agency,
would have made the decision about adapting the property in the first
place. That prompts the question: who will decide whether the
adaptation is of a scale that requires an exemption, or whether it can
be easily moved to another property? I suspect that there will be a
whole bureaucracy set up in the next year or two to try to deal with
that particular problem.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000134">&#160;</a>

the Minister’s point about the nature of the amendment, and I do
not wish to press the amendments to a Division. I would have expected a
degree of consistency in Government approaches to the benefit cap and
housing benefit expenditure, especially given that so much of the
benefit cap, which we will discuss later, is driven by housing benefit
expenditure. I am not sure that I can see much consistency there. I am
also interested in her figures; perhaps she can write to the Committee
about the £650 million expenditure figure that she quoted,
because I wonder how she could come up with that when the
Government cannot tell us how many people receive disability living
allowance in particular accommodation

Government were approaching these issues to ensure some degree of
consistency across the piece, given that such a proportion of the
benefit expenditure cap will be housing benefit. I was looking to the
Minister to come up with some consistency. I accept that the amendment,
as drafted, could potentially affect other members of the household;
that was not my intention, which is why I am not pressing the amendment
to a Division. However, these are important points of principle that
try to establish the Government’s thinking and how they will
overcome the problems. I welcome the implied concession, in terms of
adapted property, but I remain extremely concerned. Probably everyone
on this Committee will feel the bite in a year or so, when it is
unlikely that people with severe disabilities on DLA will be exempted
from the social housing under-occupation penalty, whether or not they
are able to avoid it. That will cause people a great deal of

to accept quite a large cut in one’s basic benefit entitlement

that you would immediately intervene to cease it, Mr Weir—about
whether people who are in receipt of DLA are severely disabled. I would
argue, however, that if they are legitimately in receipt of DLA and
ergo severely disabled, they are amongst the people that we would most
seek to protect, either from a significant worsening of their living
standards, or potentially—not in all cases, but in
many—an enforced moved against their will away from their
communities and networks to places where they may not have support. If
we seek to protect anyone from the measures, although there is a sound
economic case for looking at protection of properties that have been
subject to adaptation, there is a clear moral case for those with
severe disabilities being among the people whom we would most want to
protect.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000141">&#160;</a>

intentions of the policy set out by the Minister today and in the

where possible, and to tackle under-occupation in the social rented

the discussion we had earlier, those two objectives are in creative
tension. It is important for us to unpack that and to find a way of
achieving the Government’s objectives without increasing
hardship or making the allocation of housing an
impossibility.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000146">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">As set out in
the note on the regulations, the Government intend to replicate in the
social rented sector the strategies that apply for determining the
entitlement to housing benefit in the private rented sector. They are
doing so on the assumption that the social rented sector operates in
the same way. Indeed, I suspect that the long-term, broader agenda
across Government and the Departments is to remove the last vestiges of
what makes social housing unique and a needs-based system. However, as
things stand and will stand for some considerable time, the two sectors
are fundamentally different, for reasons that everyone in Committee
will understand: by and large, social housing is not a
market.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000147">&#160;</a>

David Orr of the National Housing Federation told us in evidence to the

precisely because low-income, vulnerable households are unable to
secure decent, affordable and secure accommodation through other
sectors in the medium term. Given the inadequacy of social housing,
which has always been there but has intensified since the 1980s, we
have a sector that is inevitably
residualised.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000148">&#160;</a>

no extensive right to buy in the RSL sector, I am not sure about there
having been a fall in the number of properties. I would like to check

straying into the issue of wider housing policy, I completely accept
that we did not build enough social housing under the previous Labour
Government, although instead we spent billions of pounds on basic
maintenance of existing social housing stock because it had fallen so
far behind the decent homes standard. To be clear, the residualisation
of social housing, which means that we need a complicated, needs-based
allocation procedure, is rooted primarily in the right to buy and the
failure to replace right-to-buy stock over three and a half decades.
That is why we do not have enough
accommodation.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000151">&#160;</a>

to the amendment, we have insufficient social rented accommodation for
the number of people who need it. Obviously, we want to make the best
possible use of the stock, but we understand that there are legally
testable allocation procedures in place, which differ between local
authorities, between registered social landlords and in the RSL sector,
and there is a plethora of different allocation criteria to be
accommodated.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000152">&#160;</a>

agree with tackling under-occupation. Interestingly, however, the
Department for Communities and Local Government has a different
perspective on the issue from that of the Department for Work and
Pensions. A few weeks ago, the Under-Secretary of State for
Communities and Local Government, the hon. Member for Hazel Grove
(Andrew Stunell), was asked a question  
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 692<a class="bkMark" name="Column692">&#160;</a>
                           </div>about under-occupation, and he replied that a £13
million programme will help under-occupying social tenants who wish to
move. Importantly, he
stated:<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000153">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“While

months after the announcement in the June Budget of a £400
million cut in housing benefit for social tenants under the guise of
reducing under-occupation, which it does not do, it is odd that the
DCLG announcement on under-occupation does not mention that policy and
suggests a completely different strategy for tackling the issue, which
commits to nobody being forced to move. In reality, the cuts to housing
benefit proposed by the DWP are a de facto enforced move. People on
jobseeker’s allowance, employment and support allowance or
disability living allowance will face having to survive on an income
that could be £20 or more—we do not know the exact upper
limit—less than the amount the Government say is the minimum
that anybody should be required to live
on.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000154">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">This
measure is different from some of the others we have
discussed—for example, this morning, we debated employment and
support allowance being time limited. In that discussion, the Minister
responded by saying that people would have other forms of income, but
in this case they will not. The benefits people receive are their
income and the minimum amount the state says they need to live on. We
are asking them to cut that amount by a quarter, or sometimes even a
third. If that is not forcing people to move, what is?<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000155">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In many
cases, people are being forced to move. The next question is about
where they are going to go. We know from David Orr, the excellent
source of wisdom in this sector, and from others that accommodation to
allow those who want to move to escape the penalty is simply not
available. As he told the Committee, modelling has shown that 179,000
social tenants in England are under-occupying two-bedroom homes, but
only 68,000 properties became available for letting in 2010. That is
around one in three of the properties needed to meet the requirements
of those who need—and will be forced because of the scale of the
benefit cut—to
move.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000156">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
will not restate our discussion on clause 11, when we spoke about
geographical discrepancies and the availability of and demand for
property. In some areas, particularly the north-east, the supply of
smaller accommodation to allow people to downsize does not exist. In
particular, the supply of one-bedroom accommodation for single people
or couple households that seek to move from two or three-bedroom
properties is not there, and will not be for
years.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000157">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">What
makes matters worse—this goes back to the comments made by the
hon. Member for Dover—is that the largest category of people who
under-occupy social housing are pensioners, who, quite rightly, are
exempt from this measure. Nobody wants to penalise pensioners who have
lived in their homes for years. The consequence, catastrophically for
the Government, will be that none of the pensioner voluntary downsizing
will be possible, because every landlord will have to give priority to
people who are forced to downsize because of housing benefit cuts and,
therefore, the Government will be in a dilemma. They are going to lose
the large supply of voluntary under-occupation and, therefore, they
will put themselves in a difficult financial situation.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000158">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The hon. Lady refers to figures presented to the
Committee by David Orr. I have a problem with those figures. The
evidence shows that 70% to 80% of the accommodation built over the past
decade by those housing associations that have been building has been
one or two-bedroom units. Only about 30% or 20% has been three or
four-bedroom units. I believe I am right to say that in the housing
association sector there has been a massive expansion in smaller
places, in anticipation of the high divorce rate and family breakdown.
Here is an opportunity to use those units to avoid the disgraceful
situation of three children being stuffed in a room together, which is
what worries
me.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000159">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The hon. Gentleman is right to be worried about
overcrowding; it is a catastrophic problem. Why one would then seek to
stop voluntary downsizing by pensioners to accommodate enforced
downsizing by others is a moot point. Let us ignore David Orr’s
wisdom and turn instead to the Government and the supply of one-bedroom
properties available for general needs lettings. I received a
parliamentary answer on 26 April giving the number of
one-bedroom general needs lettings by region. It notes that in the
north-west just 5,000 properties were available in the whole year; in
the north-east 2,700; in London 5,800; and in England
31,300.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000160">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
do not have the figure in front of me to say exactly how many of the
under-occupiers need the one-bedroom properties, but David Orr’s
figure is that 179,000 people need to downsize to one bedroom. The
Government are saying only 31,000, so the Government’s figures
are significantly worse than those of the National Housing
Federation.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000161">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I find this extremely interesting, particularly as
an MP from the north-east, where there is a great shortage of
one-bedroom accommodation. In fact, the social housing people are now
boarding up pensioners’ one-bedroom bungalows near me to build
two-bedroom ones, because they say that is what people want. I guess
that, because of land prices and building costs, it is quite easy to do
that in the north-east. I am worried that people are going to be caught
in a trap. Lots of the pensioners who lived in the one-bedroom
bungalows were perfectly happy, but they have been moved out under some
grand redesign. I am interested in hearing more about the amendment.
However, I have studied the wording and the last line refers to the
person having “no reasonable alternative offer”.
“Reasonable” is a very broad word. I am interested to
know how the proposal would be
implemented.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000162">&#160;</a>

rightly draws attention to something important that is confirmed by the
figures in the impact assessment: huge regional and sub-regional
variations. We have one-bedroom properties being constructed in the
south, partly due to grant and the cost of land. There is quite a
different situation in other parts of the country. We have one-bedroom
properties being built in the south of England and a need to move
people from under-occupying two-bedroom places in the north-west. As I
said when we were talking about this issue under clause 11, that raises
the question of where people will move. On the figures, the flow has to
be from the north of England to 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 694<a class="bkMark" name="Column694">&#160;</a>
                           </div>London. Meanwhile, the overcrowded people have to leave Dover and London
to live in the north of England. That is not going to happen, for all
kinds of reasons, some personal and some due to allocation. None of the
allocation procedures is catching up with the demand that the DWP is
putting on. I doubt it is going to work; such grand plans rarely
do.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000163">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
gritty irony of all this is that the Government and the DWP do not need
the measure to work because, as the impact assessment has made clear,
the more it works the less they save. Therefore, it is essential for
the Government to keep people in their under-occupied properties and to
pay the shortfall, otherwise it does not save them money. This is a
difficult position. That was explicitly set out in the
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000164">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As stated in
the impact assessment, I asked a parliamentary question to find out
what modelling the Government had done of the possible savings if 10%,
20% and 30% of people downsized. Of course they were not able to tell
me. Although the impact assessment says that they would not be saving
money as people moved, those hard statistics do not appear to be
available. That leaves the Government in a very difficult position. A
desirable policy of matching under-occupation to need, which we all
agree about, does not appear to save the money that the Government want
to save, but saving the Government the money that they want to save
does not tackle under-occupation and does nothing to contribute to the
issues of wider housing policy.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000165">&#160;</a>

not believe that they want hundreds of thousands of people, who are by

to housing benefit, and are on JSA, ESA and disability
allowance—to have to face a cut in their benefit of £20
and £30 a week. There is therefore only one way

do not know, Mr Weir, whether you would allow me, if I gave a solemn
and binding commitment, to draw in the comments on amendment 192 about
phasing, because the two amendments go together. They are another way
of tackling this problem. There simply is not the capacity, as these
figures show, to be able in April 2013 to give everybody the choice.
Therefore, some form of phasing by category is essential to avoid
hitting the buffers. I hope that the Government will think it sensible
to agree to the amendment. The way around this, which involves a degree
of phasing, possibly by category, is to ensure that nobody is liable to
a shortfall in their housing benefit payment until they have been made
a reasonable offer of alternative
accommodation.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000168">&#160;</a>

did not seek to be more specific than that because in some cases people
will be quite content and might even actively want to seek a private

of the security of tenure as described by my hon. Friend the Member for
Edinburgh East. People regard security of tenure as extremely
important. These are, by and large, people in social rented housing who
have secured that

security is extremely important for their well-being. There is plenty
of academic evidence to support that, but it will not be true in all
cases.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000169">&#160;</a>

could be made to everybody of appropriately sized accommodation for
their household needs, which was on a comparable tenure and was
reasonable and consistent with the application of the reasonableness
test by local authorities in their current allocations
procedures—which are subject to judicial review and challenge in
some cases, so it is a fairly rigorous process—the Government
could be on their way to tackling the under-occupation of the
working-age population. If the Government believe that they will save
money by doing so, they can trust their own judgment rather than the
impact assessment. That would be fine. We want both those objectives,
but we do not want one of them to be achieved at the expense of the
other.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000170">&#160;</a>

accommodation because they are homeless or are being decanted for
regeneration purposes, there would be a definition of reasonability in
that context. Given my present amendment, I hesitate to say that this
is something that we can deal with in regulations. Clearly, a lot of
specific detail that would have to be legally watertight will be
required to define exactly what reasonability is. The patience of the
hon. Member for Redcar would have been worn thin had I come here with
several pages of that kind of legal judgment today. I do not believe
that it is beyond the wit of us to devise a text that is comparable to
that currently used by local authorities to define what a reasonable
offer is, provided that that reasonable offer gives, in the first
instance, the opportunity for people to seek a social tenancy if that
is what they so

suspect that there may be some form of challenge to the policy as it is
currently laid out. At the moment, we have a cut in people’s
benefit entitlement, which reduces their minimum income, and that comes
in now for everybody regardless of whether or not they have had any
offer of alternative accommodation in two years. We also have a set of
figures that shows that people who seek to downsize and avoid this
benefit cut cannot do so because there is not sufficient property
available. There are risks in this, but the risks of enacting this
policy now without the safeguards are catastrophic. The Government will
sleepwalk into a nasty surprise when this measure percolates out into
the wider consciousness.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000174">&#160;</a>

that many Government Members, possibly with some exceptions, do not
have constituencies with large numbers of people in social tenancies.
Given that 720,000 households will be affected by this measure in 23
months’ time, we will have people coming up to us saying,
“A quarter or a third of our total weekly disposable income is
being removed and nobody is giving us any opportunity of escaping that
penalty.” That will be something of an unpleasant shock for
Members to cope with. I suspect that some emergency measures and
mitigation will have to be brought in at that later stage.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000175">&#160;</a>

saying is that, while we have the time, before we get to crisis point,
let us work out a sensible and thoughtful alternative. A reasonable
offer of alternative accommodation, combined with a phasing in over a
slightly longer period, taking into account various categories of
need—people over 50, people who have been in their accommodation
for a longer period and people with school-aged children—would
be a way of managing that process and, potentially, achieving some of
the objectives of the Government’s central policy, without all
the downsides. I urge the Minister to regard the amendment
sympathetically, because it is in all our interests for her to do
so.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000176">&#160;</a>

debated clause 11 a few weeks ago, I said that there was one other
issue with housing benefit about which I was concerned, which is
under-occupancy. It is a difficult issue, which others have mentioned.
I am sure that we all have constituents who live in hugely overcrowded
homes, with lots of children in one bedroom, and we know the hardship
and difficulty that it causes. At the same time, we have constituents
living in properties that are too big for them. It is not an easy
problem to solve and other Members have mentioned that the problem is
different in different parts of the country, and in part depends on the
local authority housing allocation policy, as the hon. Member for
Westminster North mentioned.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000177">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I shall give
two examples that were raised with me by Liberal Democrat colleagues
who have particular concerns about the circumstances in their local
areas. The first is from Edinburgh, and the hon. Member for Edinburgh
East will probably know more about it than me, so she can intervene if
I get the details wrong. The second is from Manchester. The problems
are very different but they highlight issues that the Government will
need to take into account when they implement the policy.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000178">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">There are
very few one-bedroom properties in Edinburgh, and therefore a lot of
people who are entitled to one-bedroom properties have been put into
two-bedroom ones because there simply are not enough one-bedroom
properties available. If they are not available in the first place,
when those tenants are asked to move, there is nowhere for them to go.
The amendment mentions an appropriate alternative offer, but it is very
difficult to know what offer would be an appropriate alternative. Many
tenants do not have very much choice—there certainly is not
enough choice in the social rented sector—so the only
alternative is in the private rented sector, which a lot of people
would not think was an appropriate
alternative.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000179">&#160;</a>

is very different in a lot of ways. There is a conscious policy of
offering young and potentially growing families the choice of a larger
property in less favourable areas of the city. Trying to ensure that

areas of the city is a conscious part of the allocations policy. It
also means that a lot of families, particularly those with younger
children, are in houses that are too big for them now, but will
probably not be too big for them in future because they are growing
families, which is why they have chosen to live in those properties.
The council has made those conscious decisions as part of its
allocations policy, and those individuals who will find it very
difficult to work around the situation in which they find themselves
could be penalised.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000180">&#160;</a>

is attractive in some ways, although it generates problems for local
authorities in particular about who decides what is reasonable and how
they enforce and measure that decision in the appeals process. In my
area, it can take months and months for an appeal to go through the
local authority process. Creating a whole new work load for local
authorities by making them process these claims as well could set the
system back a very long way and make it even more difficult for them to
manage the

                           </strong> The hon. Lady has got ahead of my notes. I was
going to ask the Minister what discussions the Government have had with
local authorities. In many cases—although not in every
case—it is the local authority’s allocations policy that
has created what is seen to be a problem. As a result, the matter also
needs to be handled at that level. Ministers need to work with local
authorities and their colleagues in the Department for Communities and
Local Government, which I am sure they are
doing.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000184">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
issue needs to be handled extremely carefully because people’s
homes are a fundamental part of who they are, their communities, how
they live and so on. It cannot be an easy decision for people to move
when they have been living somewhere for a very long
time—perhaps decades—and their children have grown up and
moved away. It is a very difficult decision for people and it needs to
be handled carefully if we are to ensure that we do not create a
problem, with people living in temporary accommodation and potentially
facing homelessness or taking a financial hit and not being able to see
a way out of that for the foreseeable future. I hope that the Minister
will take those concerns on board and tell us a little more about what
work is going on to make sure that the issue is tackled from that
angle.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000185">&#160;</a>

starting point. All of us have been faced with a situation where there
is overcrowding in one area and under-occupancy in another. It is
important to try to sort that out because 7% of our properties are
overcrowded and 11% are under-occupied. We can tackle that problem and
we are absolutely committed to doing so but, as the hon. Member for
Cardiff Central said, getting to the solution is not easy. I understand
the sincerity of the comments made by the hon. Member for Westminster
North, but she really needs to look at the reality of how the housing
market is working. In her comments today, she has failed to do that. We
need to make sure that we move beyond simply looking at the way the
market is working now to addressing some of the failures that clearly
have come to

housing drives the rental market in a way that she has not articulated
in her comments today. Two thirds of social housing tenants are on
housing benefits, and 30% to 40% of people in the private rental sector
are. The level of housing benefit that we are talking about here and
that works within the social housing market will affect how that market
works. She needs to accept

when we look at housing benefit costs, social housing provides a floor
and the explosion of housing benefit claims and rising rents has meant
that housing benefit has been driving up the rental market. Is it not
key to bring down and rein in the excessive rises in housing benefit
not just for the benefit of people in social housing and people who
claim housing benefit in the private rented market, but for the benefit
of private renters whose rent has in turn been pushed up by the crazy
housing benefit increases we have

again, about the private rented sector, but the assertions that the
hon. Member for Dover has made are simply not factually correct. We are
talking about the social rented sector, in which housing benefit has
risen for only two reasons: first, Government rent setting policy,
which is a formula determined by the Department for Communities and
Local Government, and, secondly, the number of people who need housing
benefit as a result of their income, which is driven by the recession.
It is not market driven at all, and it has no relationship to anything
in the private rented market.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000193">&#160;</a>

two, which does not bear much examination. Many people in the House are
now aware that the relentless rise in housing benefit expenditure that
occurred during the past 10 years—from about £11 billion
to about £21.5 billion, which would continue to rise at an
alarming pace if we did nothing about it—shows that we have to

to tackle a number of different problems. First, we are trying to
tackle under-occupancy, because we want to try to achieve more
efficient use of our housing. Secondly, we are trying to tackle a
spiralling cost of housing benefit. Thirdly, we need to ensure that we
do not create any disincentives to work. All those things added

proposals are also about being fair. I have no doubt that the hon. Lady
has found it difficult to explain to some of her constituents the level
of housing benefit that some individuals will be able to claim, even
after the changes that we are making—some £20,000 a year
may be claimed, which is well in excess of what others might be able to
afford if they were in work. It is not right that families on benefits
have been able to live in homes that other families cannot afford. If
families on benefits were simply to pay the full rents, that would make
it difficult for them to move into work, which is the ultimate goal of
our housing benefit reforms.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000197">&#160;</a>

are not about forcing people out of certain areas, and I take issue
with the hon. Member for Westminster North on that. Even after the
reforms, people on housing benefit will still be able to live in most
areas in the country. Clause 68 is more than simply an exercise in
saving taxpayers’ money. It reflects our intention to introduce
alternative ways of ensuring that maximum housing benefit payments in
the private and the social rented sectors are not simply continued or
even reduced, but are better balanced in a way that

                           </div>will try to restore fairness in the state system of housing support
across the private and the social sectors, encouraging all landlords
and housing authorities to make better use of our existing housing
stock, help to increase mobility for people in the social rented sector
and encourage more people to seek regular employment. Those are two
really important objectives.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000198">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment 176
would be unlikely to have the intended effect of protecting claimants
who were under-occupying accommodation in the social rented sector from
any reduction in their housing benefit. The wording of the amendment
leaves us guessing, as the hon. Member for Redcar said, about what a
“reasonable alternative” might be. The wording is very
loose and not particularly helpful in trying to identify exactly what
that “reasonable alternative” might be. For example, it
could include accommodation in the private rented sector. That could be
the intention, but it is not clear from the amendment. What is the
definition of “reasonable offer”? What is reasonable for
one person may not be reasonable for another. We would end up needing
significant arbitration, which could become complex.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000199">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It is
certainly not the purpose to force people to move, but we would expect
them to make similar choices about affordability as those not receiving
housing benefit. The amendment seems to put the onus squarely on
landlords and others to find alternative accommodation, with claimants
having a passive role. That is not what the Government envisage. It is
important that claimants take responsibility for their financial
decisions, with support from others if necessary.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000200">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">On that note,
the changes to housing benefit will not happen in isolation. A number
of measures in the Localism Bill will give local authorities greater
control over waiting lists. That will start to address some of the
issues touched on by the hon. Member for Cardiff Central to do with
allocation policy and even the length of tenure in the social rented
sector, all of which will help to increase mobility and create more
opportunities for people to
move.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000201">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">As
part of our implementation policy, we will of course explore the impact
of clause 68 in different locations, so that we can fully understand
what support and advice tenants and housing providers will need leading
up to the changes. However, even if smaller properties are available in
the social sector, we believe that many people affected by this measure
will choose to remain where they are, meeting the shortfall in various
ways. A blanket exemption on such a broad base is not a reasonable
alternative, and it would not target those who would genuinely
benefit.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000202">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">It is
important to examine in more detail the points made by the hon. Member
for Westminster North. She spoke about a mismatch of supply in the sort
of housing that people might be looking for. The average reduction for
those under-occupying by only one bedroom—the vast majority of
those affected by the measure—will be about £11 a
week.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000203">&#160;</a>

are various ways in which individuals can choose to deal with that
change. We would expect most people to choose to remain in the existing
property, even if the option of a smaller one were available. That may
be a legitimate choice for a family or individual to make, with them
finding other ways to meet the shortfall. They will have time to
consider ways in which to do that and appropriate advice will be
available as part of our

                        <p class="tabbed">Individuals
could choose other ways to meet the difference in cost, such as taking
up additional work. We are investing in the largest ever back-to-work
project, under the Work programme, to ensure that people have the right
support to help them into work while we move out of recession and into
recovery. We are keen to ensure that disabled people, who were the
subject of a great deal of discussion under the previous group of

effect on pensioners downsizing their households, something that I have
heard her refer to before. It is important to reiterate a comment that
she has probably heard before. The measure will help to ensure that
people are in suitably sized accommodation before becoming pensioners.
That is obviously a long-term effect of the policy, but it is an
important one. Our expectation is that the proportion of pensioners
needing to downsize will be lower than it is now, allowing our housing
stock to be used in a way that still meets the needs of social housing
tenants.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000206">&#160;</a>

accommodation that accounts for some of the overcrowding
problems.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000207">&#160;</a>

comment from the hon. Lady, which she made during previous discussions,
referred to people moving to the right size of accommodation and
whether that would yield savings for the Government. It is true that if
a significant number of tenants wanted to move and did so, that would
reduce the direct savings, but indirect savings might offset
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000208">&#160;</a>

Government are hoping to achieve greater mobility in the social rented
sector not through this measure alone. The hon. Lady will be aware of
the wider planned reforms, particularly in the Localism Bill, led by
the Department for Communities and Local Government. It contains a raft
of measures that will help local authorities to make better use of
their housing stock and to increase mobility.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000209">&#160;</a>

Member for Cardiff Central talked about how the allocations policy may
have created some of the problems that we are trying to deal with
today. The Localism Bill will make it easier for tenants in the social
rented sector to move through the creation of national homes help
schemes and changes to the allocations system so that those who want to
move do not have to compete with potential new tenants. All those
changes are important and welcome to many of our constituents who find
the housing system difficult to navigate. Local authorities will be
given more control over their housing waiting lists, and it has been
shown in Portsmouth how that can cut waiting times, increase council
revenues

                           </strong> The Minister, in her opening comments, welcomed the
support from Opposition Members for the commitment to tackle
under-occupation. I welcome measures to tackle under-occupation, but
her later comments show that the cat is firmly out of the bag. The
policy is not about tackling under-occupation. As she said, she expects
the majority of people to remain in their homes and ways will be found
to meet the shortfall. We must be clear about that. It is not about
under-occupation, but in so far as it is, it will provide downward
pressure on tackling under-occupation elsewhere in the
sector.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000211">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
policy is purely and simply to impose a cut on the income of some of
the poorest people in this country from the minimum level on which they
are expected to survive. The Minister referred to work incentives. I
learned from a parliamentary answer that the cuts will apply to people
who are in work, as well as to those who are out of work, so we know
that this is not simply an attempt to encourage people into employment,
as with the benefit cap, because those in employment will also be
affected.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000212">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">What
about those in categories whereby they are not expected to seek work?
They will still be subject to housing benefit cuts if they are in the
support group. If they are on disability living allowance, they will be
expected to meet the shortfall from their income. That is what the
Government seem to want to happen, but it is not
acceptable.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000213">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
do not believe that Government Members want severely disabled people,
people who have been in their homes for 30 or 40 years and people in
their family homes to be suddenly confronted with shortfalls of up to
£21 a week or more. No one has yet told us what the maximum
deduction will be, but the average will be £11 a
week. The Minister makes light of these matters, saying £11 a
week will be the average, but I am confident that if local government
or a Labour Government proposed a tax rise of £11 a week,
Conservative Members would shriek about it being an assault on the
living standards of people with the lowest incomes. It is a lot of
money to those on a very low
income.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000214">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">My
amendment, imperfect though it is, would provide an opportunity to get
round the problem by allowing at least one reasonable option of
alternative accommodation to be offered to everyone before the penalty
applied. That is the least we could do for disabled people, lone
parents and others who, as things stand, have virtually no statistical
chance of avoiding that
penalty.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000215">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
take the point made by the hon. Member for Cardiff Central about the
definition of what is a reasonable offer but, none the less, I repeat
that a reasonable offer is recognised in current local government
housing policy. Although it is sometimes open to challenge, I suspect
that the alternative is a great deal worse. Drawing on the experience
of housing providers to draft a watertight definition of reasonableness
consistent with existing policy, which I have no doubt can be done,
seems to be a good compromise, allowing people the
opportunity—<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000216">&#160;</a>

Members know from their own constituencies the sorts of real and
tangible problems that they come across when ensuring that individuals
have the right homes to live in. If we do not start to get a grip on
how our social housing stock is used, we are not doing the right thing
by our constituents, by some of the most vulnerable members of our
community or by the taxpayers of this country. We must get a grip on
how the social rented sector is working. We have to ensure that it is
working in a way that is not driving up rents—which, again, the
hon. Member for Westminster North is dismissing out of hand. All of the
evidence suggests that she ought to take a much stronger look at
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000224">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The hon. Lady might have caught the example that I
gave earlier. The FindaProperty website has reported on a specific
example of how rent in the private sector dropped by 5% between
November ’08 and February ’10, while local housing
allowance rates of payment and payments went up. That is clear evidence
of a mismatch, which is what we are dealing

concluding remarks already, I will not bore the Committee further, but
I am disappointed by the Minister’s reply. There is, I think,
confusion between private and social rent policy, and between private
and social allocations policy and the role of choice in the social
sector, which is simply not a reality. Regardless of what might be done
in the future, other than within the purview of the Minister’s
Department, on changing allocations procedures while protecting the
vulnerable, the policy being introduced has nothing to do with that and
is clearly designed, by the Minister’s own explicit admission,
only to bring about a cut in the income of low-income people, rather
than to encourage under-occupation. I think that there is a way out of
that, and that we have a workable basis for a definition. The least we
can do for people in that situation is to offer them the choice of an
alternative home, and I intend, therefore, to press the amendment to a
vote.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000229">&#160;</a>

                           </div>being asked to pay in different parts of the country—and the
level of the local housing allowance, which has been created out of two
changes, one of which has been introduced and the other of which is
forthcoming. The change that has already been made is that the local
housing allowance will no longer be decided by reference to the median
but by reference instead to the 30th percentile, with
upratings linked to the consumer prices index rather than, as
previously, to the local rent in the broad rental market area. There is
considerable concern among those working in the field that the gap
between the rents that people are going to be asked to pay in the
private rented sector and the local housing allowance is going to widen
as a result of this process.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000259">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The Minister
has referred, twice at least, to a piece of work, not by housing
researchers but a property-finder website, that showed that over a
period between 2008 and 2010, local housing allowance rose faster than
average rents. It is well researched and understood that, if one takes
a longer and more representative period of what happens to rents, in
most of the past decade, if not longer, average rents have risen faster
than housing benefit. If the comments on that website are to be
accepted, in the period from 2008 we were in recession, and it is
potentially the case that rents have fallen. However, we are not seeing
that in the private rented sector in Scotland, certainly not in
Edinburgh. It would also appear not to be the case in London—at
least, my London landlord does not seem to have heard about it; he
thinks that 10% is the market increase in rents this year and was
totally unwilling to negotiate, presumably on the basis that it would
be easy to find new tenants at that rent. That is at least one landlord
who has not got the message. That may change, as the new rules come in,
if the Government are to be
believed.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000260">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
contend that history shows that rents continued to rise much faster
than inflation, whether of the RPI or of the CPI variety. As the local
housing allowance has been reduced by linking it to the 30th
percentile, there is a risk that year-on-year the gulf will open
further. That is what the amendment seeks to
address.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000261">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I am aware of the recommendation of the Select
Committee and the undertaking to reviews given in the other place more
recently. However, it is important to make this a specific provision,
given the substantial problems that are going to arise for people if
the gap opens up even further. It is not insignificant. Even with LHA
at 50%—the median—in recent years many tenants in receipt
of housing benefit have already been topping that up out of their other
income. It is estimated by many of the housing charities working in the
field that as many as 50% of tenants are already topping up payments in
order to secure accommodation in the area where they live of the type
that they need.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000263">&#160;</a>

particularly sensible way to resolve a problem. I have no doubt that it
is not a sensible way to run a housing policy to use housing benefit as
a way to fund housing. I would like to see strenuous efforts
to transfer from subsidising people through housing benefit to
subsidising rents and the bricks and mortar of housing—I argued
for that before I was elected and I would argue for it with my
party.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000264">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
slippery slope started when it was considered right not to subsidise
homes through a subsidy against the building cost, in order to push up
rents in the council sector, although not as much as in other sectors.
We are seeing that again. The solution to housing and building more
houses seems not to be to put more money into building homes, but to
put more money into the housing benefit system. If we fund new house
building by charging higher rents to tenants as is
suggested—fortunately that will not happen in Scotland in the
foreseeable future—that will not mean more Government investment
in new build. New grants are not going into housing; rents are being
used to create new housing. That will put rents up, presumably to as
much as 80% of the local average, which sounds higher than we want to
fund things in the private rented sector. It is slightly unclear at the
moment whether that rent will be paid in full, but if it is, the
housing benefit bill will rise again. The measure seems to be
completely in conflict with the direction in which we need to
go.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000266">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We must
address the fact that we have become too dependent on the private
rented sector to solve what in many places is a severe housing crisis.
In my city we increasingly use the private rented sector because there
is little else, but that is not particularly sensible. One constituent
asked me, “Why is the council paying rent for my home in an
ex-council property, which is three times what my neighbour—a
council tenant—pays, so as to keep me and my family in this
house? Why is the council not building new houses?”<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000267">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">That
constituent did not particularly want to be in private rented housing
and he did not live in a mansion in the leafier parts of the city. It
was an ex-council home in an estate that has some good parts and some
that are not so good. In Edinburgh terms, it would probably be regarded
as at the lower end of the pecking order. It was not a grand house; it
had three bedrooms but he had four children. It was slightly larger
than the average house, but it was not in a wonderful area. He thought
that the system was bonkers and I had to explain that we are dealing
with two different pots of money that do not communicate properly with
one another. The council’s view is that, since it does not have
the money to build homes, it can place someone such as my constituent
in a house and have that paid for by housing
benefit.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000268">&#160;</a>

building of new council houses to start.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000269">&#160;</a>

                           </strong>Building new council housing, or new housing
association housing, is extremely important. In Scotland we have made a
start on that by removing the borrowing controls on councils, and some
have built housing in a way they could not do previously because there
were controls on how much they could borrow. Under the prudential
borrowing regime, which has been in existence since 2003, new council
houses have been built. However, if we try to do that through borrowing
when rents are already high, we will end up raising rents. In my own
city, it has been proved difficult to do that, because we have high
rents. Interestingly, a neighbouring authority where rents have been
historically low—largely because it did not have to build a lot
of new housing during the 1960s and ’70s, which is to do with
the nature of the area—has been able to increase the rents of
its existing tenants in order to build new homes. Again, we find an
inexorable raising of
rents.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000270">&#160;</a>

cities or Cornwall, the policy may well deliver, but in other areas,

steeped in the effects of that funding mechanism on an area. If it does
not deliver new housing where there are difficulties, it will certainly
have failed. Even if it can deliver new housing but does so at the

                        <p class="tabbed">On
rents in the private rented sector, I agree that we have a problem that
has been created over a number of years, whereby the shortage of
affordable homes means that we are seeing an increasing number of
people on low incomes entering the private rented sector. In my
experience, they do not do so because they think, “Oh great, I
can move to an area like this and it will be wonderful. I need never
work again in my life and I shall live here a life of luxury.”
They do so because there is little choice. That is certainly the case
in Edinburgh. Many people want out of that situation, partly because of
its insecurity. Landlords might roll on six-month lets, but people know
that there is always a risk and insecurity in that. It is not their own
home, and it is not somewhere they can necessarily expect to be in the
future.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000273">&#160;</a>

houses—are those in work. They are not always the ones who end
up being offered it, but they are certainly the ones who benefit most
from it, because it helps them to be able to work. Constituents of mine
when I was a councillor and since I have been in this place have told
me, clearly, that they would love to get out of their homes in the
private rented sector and into the public sector. It would be more
affordable for them, because it would be more secure and give them a
long-term future. It would not be a property that the landlord could
decide at any time to withdraw from the sector and sell. Whatever the
reason—he might decide that it was going to be a home for his
son or daughter, or the family might want to move back in—there
is no certainty in the private rented sector that someone will be there
for an extended length of
time.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000274">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The answer is yes, because housing benefit is a
reserved matter, although its impact in terms of homes being built may
be different. People face different housing pressures throughout
Scotland and its local authorities. There are some marked differences
in terms of historical rents and the availability, size and
distribution of properties, particularly in places where housing
pressures are
greatest.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000276">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We
all agree that we must tackle the over-dependence on the private rented
sector. The fact is that rents in the private rented sector created a
position in which housing benefit payments had to rise, and no one
seeks to deny that. The crude measures in the Bill to deal with that
are not necessarily going to do anything but make it more difficult for
people who find themselves in this situation. I am not convinced that
the measures will necessarily reduce the rents. We have talked a lot
about whether landlords will respond to this. The measures will
doubtlessly have an impact in places, such as Blackpool and other
coastal towns, in which landlords heavily depend on the housing benefit
market. However, in the inner cities, such as Edinburgh and many other
places, where there is demand for the private rented sector across
different segments of the population, landlords are more likely to
decide that they do not want to deal with people on housing benefit
than they are to reduce their rents in order to fill their
properties.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000277">&#160;</a>

the hon. Lady’s long lament about the lack of investment in
social housing by the previous Government in a time of comparative
abundance. Just to come back to her specific point on the landlord
issue, having come across landlords in my past life, I have to say that
they are a fairly commercial lot. One thing that they covet more than
anything else is security of income. The fact that housing benefit is a
secure supply of income will invariably affect their commercial
decisions. Is she not persuaded by the argument that a real check on
housing benefit will provide a brake on rental levels? Her concerns
about there being a disconnect between the housing benefit allowance
and the rental market may actually shrink rather than
expand.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000278">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I am not convinced that that will be the case. We
will argue this point theoretically over the next few months and we
will see the proof as it comes through in the rents that are being
charged in various places. I will certainly be closely watching the
situation in Edinburgh. The local council, too, will be watching
because it has concerns that, if people cannot source homes in the
private rented sector because of the changes that have been made, the
burden on the council will be greater. The existence of the private
rented sector and the build-up of people moving into it who would
otherwise be coming to the council as homeless has been a huge safety
valve in Edinburgh and I suspect elsewhere for the system as a
whole.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000279">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We have
something like 1,500 properties in the city under the private leasing
scheme. Not everyone who is homeless is in the private rented sector.
The scheme was set up by the council to alleviate the problems
associated with the numbers of people in temporary housing. Rather than
take housing out of its mainstream stock to provide yet more temporary
housing, which becomes self-defeating, it developed a scheme, which is
also used in parts of London and elsewhere, whereby leases are offered
to landlords on a long-term basis. Some landlords were keen to get
involved in that, but the rents are still high, which means that there
are work incentive issues. If people want to work, it can be difficult.
Moreover, it means that the extent of real homelessness in the city is
concealed. These people are not homeless because they have a roof over
their head. They have a property in parts of the city in which there
are no council or housing association houses.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000280">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Another
element of the scheme is that it is confounding the position on
homelessness because these people do not appear in the temporary
housing statistics for the city. Quite a large number of people are
living in that situation, which is yet another pressure on the housing
benefit bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000281">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I am not
prepared to accept that the Labour Government did nothing on affordable
housing. They certainly did not do enough in my city. We were
constantly arguing with the Scottish Government about the needs of the
city, which is often seen as affluent but which also has a huge
affordability problem. I would certainly have wanted to see more, but I
saw an increased amount going into investing in building homes by
housing associations in Edinburgh over those years. I hope that that
will continue but I know that that is not the case in the coming year.
The housing association movement in Scotland is very concerned about
the reductions that there will be in housing
investment.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000282">&#160;</a>

buy and thought it the solution to housing problems, but who again want
to create new affordable homes by putting up rents and passing the

this situation. If those people remain in those homes where the gap
widens, they will subsidise it from other parts of their already
limited income or they will simply not be able to find those homes
because they will not be there. Then they will have to find housing in
some other way. I suggest that that will make things more expensive for
the public purse. Even a brief period in temporary accommodation is
extremely expensive. Periods of several months in temporary
accommodation are very expensive.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000284">&#160;</a>

week, I was talking to a man who has been in bed and breakfast for
eight months—six different bed and breakfasts in the
city—and we all know how expensive such provision can be. He
simply wants a home. If more people are unable to source accommodation
in the private rented sector because of all these changes, that
pressure will become even worse. He has no children and no overt health
problem—he has some health problems, but they are perhaps not as
great as those of some other people—so he does not have the
highest priority, which is why he has already spent eight months in
bed-and-breakfast accommodation. As far as he can see, that is likely
to continue, which is expensive for the state and bad for the
individual. If it worsens because of these changes, we will have more
people in his situation.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000285">&#160;</a>

suggest that the people who are affected by these measures will
necessarily be the ones who end up in bed and breakfast, but it becomes
a bit of a pecking order. People move down that order and we will
have more at that bottom end who cannot find anything other
than wholly unsatisfactory temporary accommodation because the better
temporary accommodation is being occupied by those who cannot find
private rented accommodation and so on. After making such big changes,
particularly tying the annual increase to the CPI, it is important to
look at this situation annually and then, if necessary, amend the
determination to correct it and ensure that people do not lose out in
the way that they otherwise

She gave the Committee an interesting example to think about when it
comes to price setting in the private rental market when she cited the
example of her own landlord, who was proposing that 10% would be a
sensible increase in rent. If the Independent Parliamentary Standards
Authority were to hear about that and did not think it a sensible
amount—I have no idea whether it would or not—and she
could fulfil only a 5% rent increase, would her landlord summarily
evict from the property? Alternatively, as my hon. Friend the Member
for Wolverhampton South West said, that landlord might take a slightly
pragmatic approach, perhaps just because he or she may have thought it
possible—the hon. Lady is drawing her rent from a third-party
source—that the increase did not matter. Perhaps that is a
similar issue to the one we are dealing with here

if there are issues, the hon. Lady should look to her party’s
13-year stewardship of and investment in this area for an answer as to
why more was not done to ensure a sufficiency of supply of affordable

other words, it is not an investment by the state in creating

affordable housing. If those tenants cannot afford higher rents, the

houses—our Government. If that had happened under the previous
Administration, perhaps we would not be in this situation. The area of
commonality here is that, across all parties, there is an understanding
of the need to ensure that money is spent in the most effective way. We
are trying to ensure that we take control of housing benefit
costs.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000292">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The intention
of the amendment is interesting. It is to probe the mechanism by which
the Secretary of State will review local housing rates to ensure that
they consider the changing patterns of rents, whether over time or in
different areas. That is an important thing to be doing and it is not
something we disagree with. I assure hon. Members that the Committee
should find the amendment unnecessary. The Secretary of State will be
able to adjust rates to ensure that the housing support available does
not become completely out of kilter or out of touch with local rental
markets. We will monitor the impact of these measures and make further
adjustments if it is right to do so, either locally or more
generally.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000293">&#160;</a>

that we will continue with that method of calculating local housing
allowance rates only for as long as it makes sense to do so. The hon.
Lady is absolutely right that it would not help anybody if things were
to become heavily out of kilter. That is not our intention. We will do
everything we can to ensure that that does not happen. I urge her to
consider some of the facts at play in the debate because they shed an
interesting light on what happened in the past. Since 2000, private
sector housing benefit awards have grown by between 70% and 80%, while
average earnings have grown by

than increases in income is driving housing benefit
upwards.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000294">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The hon. Lady is right to suggest the combination
of those two factors. I simply reiterate that the lack of control on
the increase in housing benefits tends to suggest that something needs
to be done to align them. Our main objective is to take control of
benefit levels, which, without reform, would have risen to some
£24 billion by 2014-15. Front Benchers would not want to embrace
a policy that left them further problems in identifying how to make
cuts in other areas, making up for the shortfall in housing
policy.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000296">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
reiterate to the hon. Member for Edinburgh East that we take getting
the policy right seriously. The measure will not be implemented until
2013. We have accounted for it lasting only two years, until the end of
the spending review. Future Governments can then consider the position
and, possibly, make a one-off
adjustment.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000297">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
areas where rents rise faster than inflation, there should be no
presumption that housing benefit will always pick up the bill.
Otherwise, I fear we could have a self-fulfilling prophecy. The measure
will ensure that housing benefit increases are more in line with rent
increases that working families can afford, which is one of the driving
forces of all the clauses in this part of the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000298">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">On
the fear voiced by Opposition Members of landlords leaving the market,
a more realistic view ought to be taken. It is important that landlords
understand their security of income and, yes, housing benefit
recipients provide a very secure income stream. However, despite
landlord reservations, more than 1 million claimants live in the
private sector, being paid the local housing allowance, so there is a
good relationship there. More than 400,000 new tenants are renting in
the sector and have claimed housing benefit since November 2008. They
are known to be a good set of tenants and to provide a secure income
stream.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000299">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Given
that housing benefit recipients account for such a large proportion of
the social rented and private rented markets, I suggest to the hon.
Lady that for landlords simply to walk away from such recipients would
not be rational. However, we share her concern that the measure remain
in touch with the realities of the market, and I hope that she finds
that reassuring. I see that the amendment is probing, so I hope she
finds my comments sufficient to enable her to withdraw it, given that
the safeguards are in
place.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000300">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> It is important to make it clear that it is not
true to suggest that there were no controls on housing benefit levels.

landlords taking advantage, but at all times there have been
controls.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000301">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> We have to look in depth at what has happened to
housing costs and rents over the period. A number of factors operate
here. One is the marked spike in housing benefit payments to people in
the private rented sector since the recession. There is no doubt about
it. It is at least arguable that it was due largely to the fact that
many people lost employment and found themselves having to claim
housing benefit as a result. Others are having to work shorter hours;
we know that many people have avoided redundancy by making such
arrangements, but that has brought them into a position where they can
claim housing benefit to help them meet their housing costs.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000305">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It is
undoubtedly the case that we have seen a spike, but not so much in the
public sector. I suspect that many people in the council housing
association sector are, for a number of reasons, already in receipt of
housing benefit because they are predominantly unemployed or on very
low incomes. The recession has caused a big increase in the number of
people in the private rented sector who are claiming housing benefit.
Whether it is a temporary spike remains to be seen. The recession is
one factor. The overall rise in rents is the major factor. The
explosion in the buy-to-let market in the last few years has made more
private rented accommodation available. However, those who went into
that market have to charge rents to cover their mortgage payments. The
fact that house prices have risen will have an impact on those who rent
such properties and claim benefit.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000306">&#160;</a>

consider the private rented sector carefully. We need to research it
properly, especially those factors that impact on rents. Research done
in 2007-08 shows that until the recession, the prevalence of housing
benefit claimants among tenants in the private rented sector was
sitting at about 18%. I concede that it has risen since then. The
figures would appear to suggest that it has gone up—that was the
spike that I mentioned earlier—but it seems to have been very
much the effect of the recession, and it may change.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000312">&#160;</a>

reductions that will impact heavily on people all over the country who
are not in fact paying these excessive rents, but whose housing benefit
will be pushed down still further, or who will be required to find
money out of their other income to top up their housing benefit
payments. The amendment is about the need to monitor what is happening
and to take steps to right that. I accept what the Minister is saying;
I welcome the commitment to review the situation, and I hope that that
leads to a willingness to change if it is proven that this has been a
problem. I particularly regret that the Government felt it necessary
not merely to reduce the local housing allowance to the 30th
percentile, but to then suggest in advance that annual upratings would
be in line with CPI. They did not wait to see the impact of one change

People in my constituency who do not claim housing benefit are

concerned if they really understood the potential link between the
previous Government’s housing benefit policy and the problems
that they have in affording rent without the support of housing

Those are two different opinions about how the situation has been
created. If the Minister is correct, and in the future we see that
overall rents are brought down by the measures, I would certainly feel
that the action had been a good thing. High rents are a problem for
people regardless of whether they are in receipt of housing benefit. It
is not helpful constantly to make the distinction between hard-working
people who have to meet the rents, and others who are not working. We
know that many people in work require housing benefit to meet the
rents, and I therefore disagree with the assertion.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000315">&#160;</a>

650,000 households facing the cut or a demand to move, and we know that
there will not be sufficient accommodation. I am interested to know
whether the Government have thought about minimising the pain that will
arise for people who are registered for a downsize, for example. There
will be people submitting applications to cash incentive programmes,
and applying to their local authorities or registered social landlords
for a downsize, and they are exactly the people Ministers say they want
to encourage in order to reach the objective of tackling
under-occupation, which is stated—slightly disingenuously, I
think—as an objective of the policy.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000320">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The simple
and decent thing to do would be to protect people who are now
registered for a move until the time when they can have one. Similarly,
there are households who, before April 2013, would currently be deemed
as under-occupying their property, but whose circumstances are likely
to change, making them not under-occupy it. As an example, I will use a
couple with two children aged nine and 10. At the moment, they would be
deemed as under-occupying their property according to the criteria used
by the Government, but obviously, in 10 months or a year, they would
legitimately occupy such a property. It seems rather bad to apply a
penalty that could, in London and the south-east, cost £1,000 or
so for a family caught in that
predicament.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000321">&#160;</a>

for Redcar who talked about households that were placed by their
landlords in property that would be technically
under-occupied—where there was a deliberate policy. We know that
there are social objectives to an allocations procedure that landlords
have been pursuing. We also know that, in parts of the country such as
the north of England, there are areas with a surplus of accommodation,
and there has been an active policy by local authorities to seek to
fill those

                           </div>properties. That is sometimes done through under-occupation, but it is
no fault of the households concerned, and it is not even necessarily
their choice.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000322">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I know of
several households where either the local authority or the housing
provider has agreed for a couple to have separate bedrooms. Such a
situation is unusual, but it is because one person, or both people,
have severe medical conditions which make it impossible for them to
sleep in the same room. That is recognised by the allocations
procedure, and there are, therefore, a number of different
categories.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000323">&#160;</a>

broadly—I have alluded to this in the past—in our
MPs’ surgeries we will soon find distressing cases of people who
have been in their family home for 30 years, or who have been recently
widowed, and who have immediately become liable for this very harsh
housing penalty. There is a way of mitigating the damage, while still
pursuing the aim of reducing under-occupation. I would have thought it
entirely reasonable—in fact, I predict that this will eventually
happen—for there to be a phasing in, or for there to be some
form of transitional protection. I would welcome the Minister’s
comments on that and on whether we can look, before we get to the
detailed regulations, at some means of managing what I predict will be
a policy car crash.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000324">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I thank the hon. Lady for explaining the
intentions behind the amendment. Her examples were useful, valid cases,
in which individual circumstances can vary so much. There may be an
individual who, as the hon. Member for Edinburgh East pointed out, has
a great deal of medical equipment associated with them; or there may be
two people who, as the hon. Member for Westminster North explained,
need separate rooms for legitimate reasons. It is exceptionally
difficult for the Government to legislate for those situations.
However, there are situations that we can legislate for. What we can
do, as I said in response to a previous debate, is look in detail at
how we can ensure that there are exemptions for individuals who are
disabled, where their homes may have been subject to extensive
adaptations to accommodate that. There are potential exemptions for
groups there. It is much more difficult, however, to try to legislate
for the very examples that the hon. Lady has talked about, which is why
we took the clear decision to triple the discretionary housing
payments. That would ensure that such flexibility is built into the
system at a local level. The very examples given by the hon. Lady would
be difficult for us to legislate for, but as she rightly said, they
might need to be addressed at a local level. I hope she will be
reassured to know that we will also be looking at the level of
discretionary housing payment to ensure that it addresses such issues
as she has
raised.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000325">&#160;</a>

measures will operate and how to communicate them on the ground to

able to do that effectively, and a great deal of effort has already
been put in by officials in our Department and local

the size criterion into a calculation of housing benefit is planned to
save around £0.5 billion in the first year alone. The savings
from the CPI measure will be around £140 million in the same
year. Such changes are of huge importance in making the benefit
affordable, and in addressing the country’s broader fiscal
problems. If the official Opposition are proposing the amendment in a
way that would put at risk those savings, I want to know how they would
recoup that and whether the proposal has the endorsement of their
leadership.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000327">&#160;</a>

amounts of money are pretty significant and, coupled with a number of
the other elements suggested by the hon. Member for Westminster North

expenditure. They might have tabled their amendments in the best
possible way and with the utmost integrity, but the Committee should be
asking, given the magnitude of the money, where they would fund the
measures from and what other things would be cut instead. The
Opposition have simply not been forthcoming about such issues, which
should concern many in the Committee, particularly Government
Members.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000328">&#160;</a>

and you, Mr Weir, that we recognise the importance of not working in
isolation. We will work with experts to ensure that we develop a clear
implementation plan, so that we can provide certainty about the changes
before they are introduced. As I have said, we are already meeting with
social housing providers, experts in social housing, local authorities
and others to ensure that the impact of the changes is well managed. We

                        <p class="tabbed">I
am encouraged by the Minister’s indicating that the Government
might look further at discretionary housing payments. I will be
interested to know when that might happen, and what indication that
gives us about the thinking on how a sufficient degree of discretion
would be built in for local authorities to make any kind of variation
to meet such circumstances as I outlined. Given what the discretionary
housing benefit is being asked to carry in the private rented sector,
to maintain people in employment and to prevent homelessness, there
does not seem the remotest chance of it doing anything of any
significance whatever in the types of cases I have outlined, and with
which the Minister has expressed some
sympathy.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000332">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">On
the question of the lead-in time, again, I fear a little for the
optimism being expressed. Officials might well be working extremely
hard—I do not doubt that they are—but they cannot do
anything about putting five into one: five times more people would need
to move in order to avoid the penalty, and the properties are simply
not available. We are now into the 2011-12 financial year, and local
authorities and housing associations have not changed their allocation
criteria to allow people 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 718<a class="bkMark" name="Column718">&#160;</a>
                           </div>to have priority for downsizing. That means that, if
a single person wishing to avoid the penalty it is to be assisted in
doing so, the entire burden will fall on a single financial year,
2012-13. That is impossible—it is simply not going to happen.
Only a tiny minority of people who wish to avoid the penalty would be
able to do
so.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000333">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
now know, however, from our previous amendment, that the measure is not
about tackling under-occupation. This is a probing amendment and we all
understand the financial pressures, but I am looking for a similar
degree of candour from the Government. However, we are getting not
candour but the explanation that this is about tackling
under-occupation, when it is not. The measure is simply about a cut in
income for vulnerable people, because it is the only way the Minister
can make the savings that she has again stressed are the priority. To
do so, I think I am correct in saying, for the first time we have a
deliberate policy that will cut, and is intended to cut, below the
minimum level of income that the state and her Government have deemed
acceptable for people to live
on.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000334">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">When
people have a legitimate claim to JSA, ESA, income support or the
universal credit, the Government have decided the minimum that they
have to live on. For the first time, we now have a policy explicitly
setting out that they wish people to live substantially below that
level. If the Government are not saying that—the Minister is
shaking her head—we must give people an opportunity to avoid
that situation, but we cannot. The properties that would allow people
to move are simply not available. If they were, the Minister would not
want it to happen because no money would be saved. She expressed that
fairly
clearly.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000335">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
thought of another way to mitigate the impact of the policy, but I will
not press the amendment to a Division. We voted earlier on an amendment
that would have allowed us the flexibility to meet the needs of such
highly vulnerable people. Sadly, but confidently, I predict that
Ministers will revisit the issue between now and 2013, because I still
do not believe that Government Members have properly understood the
sheer scale of what the Government are proposing and its impact. When
it is revisited, there will be urgent need for some form of phase-in,
transitional protection or mitigation to prevent some harsh and painful
decisions being inflicted on some of the most vulnerable people in our
country.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000336">&#160;</a>

for the opportunity to introduce the first of two or three amendments
on the social fund. All of us with an interest in the matter know that
it is not easy to make an unqualified argument in favour of no change
to the social fund. There have been many criticisms of it over the
years with well-informed and powerful reports from the National Audit
Office, the Public Accounts Committee and the DWP Committee. There is
certainly nothing wrong with looking at ways of responding to some of
the faults and failings in the system, and improving its
delivery.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000343">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Unfortunately,
what we have here is abolition of the discretionary social fund through
localisation, leaving us with a system that will not have statutory
force and will not, unless the Government see fit to accept my
amendment, have a ring-fenced budget. Whatever criticism there has been
of the system, both are systemic weaknesses in the Government’s
proposal. It is unfortunate that we are having this discussion in
Committee at a time when so much of the detail of the proposed
reorganisation is still unclear, and the DWP’s consultation
closed only on 15 April. It is unfortunate that we are having this
discussion with so little information about exactly how the Government
envisage the revised scheme operating, and most of my remarks will be
questions to the
Minister.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000344">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
know that the discretionary social fund, as it stands and with all its
flaws, is a hugely important source of assistance for claimants at a
time of acute need. In particular, it provides interest-free loans to
meet intermittent expenses and immediate short-term needs with
emergency grants for essential items such as cookers, beds, clothing
and footwear, and for equipment for disabled people. The need for such
assistance is likely to remain, and there seems no sign of its
disappearing in the immediate future. If anything, there is a strong
case for saying that demand is likely to increase in the coming years
as the cuts in housing benefit that we have discussed this evening and
elsewhere begin to bite. Overall, there will be significant reductions
in benefits with £18 billion of reductions in welfare benefits
between now and the introduction of universal credit. It is unlikely in
the context of those cuts and the immediate economic environment, and
with the continuing pressure on jobs that demand for emergency
assistance will
reduce.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000345">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
social fund provides an essential safety net for the poorest of the
poor, and the most vulnerable and most deprived at a time when they are
suffering the gravest hardship. That is why, despite the
Government’s willingness to challenge the previous Government on
the social fund, and for all their criticisms, their decision to
abolish de facto the social fund has been so heavily challenged by the
social welfare organisations. The Child Poverty Action Group,
Gingerbread, Crisis, Homeless Link, Barnardo’s, Scope, the
National Housing Federation, Save the Children, Citizens Advice, the
Disability Benefits Consortium, Oxfam, Family Action, Community Links,
and the Daycare Trust are just some of the organisations that have
lined up to say that the Government are taking the social fund down the
wrong path, and putting vulnerable people at
risk.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000346">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendment aims specifically to ring-fence the budget, and I will
explain why that is an essential safeguard for any form of localised
delivery.The critical point is whether there will be enough money, and
how we can safeguard any money that will be available 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 720<a class="bkMark" name="Column720">&#160;</a>
                           </div>through local authorities. We have been told repeatedly that the
localisation of the social fund is not a cost-cutting exercise, and I
am happy to accept that at face value. We shall return to some of those
questions when we discuss later amendments, but this measure is
designed, fairly explicitly, as a cost-containment exercise. We accept
that there must be a degree of cost containment under any system, and
we understand that the demand for social fund discretionary payments
rose dramatically over the past few years, largely, although not
exclusively, because of the recession. We must now look to see how the
available resources can be protected so that at least a minimal safety
net stands between people and destitution.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000347">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">My amendment
seeks to address two related problems. First, will any devolved grants
and loans from the discretionary social fund be protected by the local
authorities to which they are given? Secondly, what will those funds
be? I accept that this is not a cost-cutting exercise, and we believe
that the money now available through the social fund will be devolved
to local government. Critically, what will those funds be in the light
of recoverability? That question goes to the heart of the fund’s
future in local government. We also want to test how the measure will

                        <p class="tabbed">The
Government have said that they have no intention of placing any
statutory duty on local authorities to determine what kind of support
and services they intend to provide—hence the decision not to
ring-fence. Unfortunately, recent long-term experience, which is one of
the reasons ring-fenced grants were popular with the previous
Government, has shown a particular example that points the way and
raises a large red flag. That example is what happened to the
Supporting People programme. The Supporting People grant was
ring-fenced for local authorities to provide support for vulnerable
people such as the elderly and disabled. When that ring fence was
removed, the Government cut the budget for Supporting People by 2.7%, a
significant but not huge amount. However, local authorities also cut
the services funded by Supporting People by an average of
13%. The cuts that local authorities made to services funded
by a Supporting People grant were nearly fivefold worse after the ring
fence was removed, and that is a matter of grave
concern.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000349">&#160;</a>

cut, but I am confident that if he were to ask organisations such as
Save the Children, Barnardo’s, Oxfam, Age UK or Mencap, which
have been working on the front line, they will provide him with that
information. As always, there will be a mixed picture and examples of
where the hon. Gentleman’s point will be upheld. Regardless of
whether any reduction in services could be justified, the fact remains
that what we have seen is a fivefold worsening of the expenditure on
Supporting People services compared with the size of the cut in
grant.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000351">&#160;</a>

the analysis of the service providers—and I am sure it would at
least be a mixed picture—that is something to be concerned
about. In this case, when it comes to social fund
expenditure—the kind of discretionary payments through crisis
loans and community care grants—by definition, as we heard
extensively in evidence, they are front-line services at the point of
destitution and the most critical hardship. Finding other ways of
dealing with the problems that are presented by those clients is not
easy. That is my first concern. Obviously, the Government are only a
year into their mandate. We do not have that much experience to draw on
yet to see what has happened in local authority spending, as
ring-fencing has been removed from front-line local government
services.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000352">&#160;</a>

for my own local authority, as I suspect my hon. Friends can if they
are in authorities that are Conservative or otherwise controlled.
Unfortunately, it is often the services to very vulnerable people, not
those that necessarily attract the mass demonstrations, which have been
cut. I do not want to stray too far from the amendment but I can say
that, for example, in my local authority 3,000 disabled people are
being reviewed for the loss of their care services; a day centre for
people with disabilities is being cut, and we have cuts in
children’s services, youth services and many others. Those tend
to be services used by a minority of people and therefore not ones that
often manage to sway majority opinion.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000353">&#160;</a>

the process in my local authority, it has reviewed the services, so
that not every organisation that previously got, for example,
Supporting People funding, is getting exactly the same amount of
funding. However, through that process, it has identified new, better

This is an important point to which I will come back. The 3,000 people

they are not getting a service any more. The people with

some variations; of course it will. Sometimes when people have their
backs against the wall, they can come up with innovative solutions and
different ways of doing things. I completely agree that change is
sometimes necessary. However, we know that when the ring fence came
off, the cuts in the Supporting People grant were significantly deeper
than the cut in central Government allocation, which is a warning sign.

If lower level preventive services are not safeguarded, they tend to be
cut when local authorities face crises. In the long term, preventive
services save money, but in the short term, it is easier to go for the
urgent services rather than the preventive ones. That is what we have
seen over a three-year

                           </strong> That is absolutely right and I fear that we will see
that again. I will table further amendments on consistency of service
and the postcode lottery. On money and the resources that will be
available through a localised discretionary social fund, at the moment
we have a crisis loans system that is administered nationally. Those
crisis loans are repaid in significant part. Some 86% of the spend
coming in any one year from the crisis loans is from loan repayments.
The question that I am not sure about and that calls the whole funding
of a localised social fund into question is whether a devolved budget
to local government is predicated on local authorities being able to
make loans and get back repayments. If they cannot, simple maths
indicate that the fund will get small very quickly. The Minister is
shaking her head, which makes it easy for me because I was going to ask
her a couple of questions about how local authorities would even begin
to set up a mechanism for recovering loans. We now know from the
Minister that that is not the
case.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000363">&#160;</a>

assurance that this is not a cuts agenda and local authorities will

Minister could tell us how much money she expects to be available to
local authorities after three years of a fund that has been depleted
because of the absence of repayments on loans. This is a serious
problem. We have the pressure around ring-fencing and the fact that the
fund itself will be significantly depleted. Our expert witnesses made

these problems now compound each other. First, there is a lack of a
ring fence for a grant system that is, as we know, targeted at the most
vulnerable, so local authorities will not have to ring-fence the money
to provide for those individuals. Later amendments raise some serious
questions about how local authorities will provide for people who do
not have a local connection, which I think is one of the most worrying
aspects of the whole system. Secondly, there will potentially be a
depleted grant, because it will no longer be topped up by repayable
loans.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000371">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Then
we have, at the front line, local authorities being the gatekeepers for
a significantly reduced crisis and/or community care equivalent grant.
Councillor Steve Reed gave evidence to us that local authorities have
expressed a willingness to be involved in this process. In theory, I
think we can all see some of the attractions of local authorities
having that interaction at a more direct level than that provided by
the distant telephone advice system that the social fund operates.
However, Councillor Reed also told the Committee about his concern that
the localisation of the social fund should be fully funded and that
that needs to cover all the costs, including the administration cost,
which was £19 million in community

be covered in full and that that money will be devolved to local

whether the local councils have had a chance to reflect properly on
what it is likely to cost them to set up a proper apparatus for
decision making. I say that because if we go back to the impact
assessment for the social fund we discover one of the critical reasons
why the Government want to wash their hands of that
responsibility.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000373">&#160;</a>

the Government are saying—indeed, even the previous Government

responsible for both a higher level of demand and for making it more
difficult for officials at a distance to make proper judgments about

say that a more intensive assessment of the 3,645,000 people across the
country who applied for discretionary funds last year<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000374">&#160;</a>

we were interviewing our expert witnesses, some Government Members were
keen to stress the localism agenda and Councillor Reed
expressed—not unreasonably—a willingness, in principle,
to engage with that agenda. However, the impact assessment is telling
us that the very thing that is supposed to be the virtue of the

increased cost on local government. That rather attracts the words

                        <p class="tabbed">That is
compounded by the fact that we have an expectation that social workers
are the people who are engaged with the potential client groups, and
that because they are already engaged with all those groups they will
somehow be able to integrate an assessment for a crisis and/or
community care equivalent grant without that involving them in any more
work. Of course that is simply not true, because by and large social
workers are no longer engaged with whole swathes of the kinds of people
who apply for grants and loans under the discretionary social
fund.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000376">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It is
precisely because local authorities have been retrenching the service
that they provide—they now often engage only with people with
critical care needs in terms of disability—that they do not have
any connection with ordinary people whose principal and presenting
problem is a financial pressure, such as lone parents in financial
difficulty, and still less with people who are homeless or
ex-offenders. They simply do not have that relationship. Local
authorities, on a potentially frozen or depleting grant, will have to
deal with an expectation that they will provide an intensive,
face-to-face assessment for a cohort of people with whom they have no
relationship, and do it in a way that will somehow be almost cost-free
to local government. It will not be
cost-free.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000377">&#160;</a>

workers are, understandably, expressing a great deal of concern. The
consortium of community care stated recently that social workers are
anxious about having to deliver the social fund in the knowledge that
applications for community grants are turned down in nearly 60% of
cases. Some 640,000 people applied for

fantastic increase in the work load of social workers and which diverts
them from the core tasks for which they are employed by local
authorities. Social workers also have to face the fact that, instead of
being the advocates and champions of the people whom they represent,
they will have to turn down applications for grants in 60% of
cases.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000378">&#160;</a>

the whole system works well, but that is not the case. The previous
Government issued a Green Paper saying that there were a lot of repeat

take action on them, and the current Government have noted that the
budget has tripled since 2006. This is another case like housing

needs to get back to a sense of

perfectly reasonable point about understanding, which we do not do
particularly well, what has driven the increase in applications for
crisis loans and community care grants in recent years. It is worth,
however, referring to the success level of appeals against refusal
decisions and seeing just how many cases are awarded on appeal. It does
not seem likely, on the face of things, that grant applications are
being made in vast numbers by people who do not have any

are going to have to have a gatekeeping process and it will not be an
easy one, wherever it is applied. My point is that local authorities
may be in for a surprise, because they will be asked, according to the
impact assessment, to carry out an intensive, face-to-face process of
determining who will be successful and who will be unsuccessful out of
the millions of people who apply every year. That process will be
lengthier and more time-consuming than that which is currently provided
nationally by a telephone service. It will not be cost-free, which will
be deeply unpopular with the people on the front line, who often have
to make the decisions, because it is not their core task and because
they are not involved with many of the client groups anyway and it is
not necessarily a cost-efficient use of their

many visitors to her constituency surgery who are in that crisis

locally? I am able to signpost my constituents—I am sure that
she is, too—to a whole range of support that is available
locally, whether it is in the voluntary sector or with other people in

other than through local government. I can see that point. I did not
begin my comments by rubbishing in principle the idea of a degree of
localisation. My worry is that, by removing the ring fence from grants,
the Government are inviting those local authorities that do not have an
in-principle commitment to doing this to not spend the money

                        <p class="tabbed">The dilemma is
that some local authorities will not particularly wish to invest in
good quality signposting. We can tell who they are, because they do not
run a very good welfare rights service. Not all local authorities
provide high quality services, as the hon. Lady sort of implied. There
is a vast difference in the quality of service between local
authorities. If local authority A does not wish to provide other than
the most core minimal service under the fund, it will be able to not do
it, with the result—this leads me to later
amendments—that some individuals who do not have a local
connection will be encouraged to move between local authorities to seek
the authorities that provide a better service, so there are all kinds
of
risks.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000384">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
other problem is that there will be a potentially significant
additional cost in providing that quality level of local interaction,
which is not factored into the costings. I am not opposed to doing a
quality, local, face-to-face interaction and assessment; I think it has
a great deal of potential. But it is not costed and is not paid for.
Either it will not be provided at all or it will be provided out of the
package of money that is available for the kind of crisis financial
support that is available for destitute
people.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000385">&#160;</a>

They have never had interaction with social workers and have an

what do we mean by administering something locally? Either it will be a
new bureaucracy with new people delivering the service, or existing
staff will have to be diverted from other tasks, or additional

that a significant proportion of people who currently feel able to make

because that would not necessarily be through an interaction with

I have said, the absolute bottom-line safeguard in ensuring that there
is a proper level of funding in each local authority area, particularly
given what we fear about the depletion of resources because of the
absence of repayable loans, would be for those funds to be safeguarded.
We do not want to be in a situation where a local authority decides
that it is in its interests not to provide anything like an effective
service, and we do not want a bidding war down to the worst level of
service, which is a possibility. Such things can happen as local
authorities, understandably, seek to protect their own interests at all
times, and no local authority will want to be on the border of a local
authority that is providing a lower level of service and potentially
encouraging people elsewhere.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000390">&#160;</a>

accepting some of the merits of a localised agenda, but with a
necessary safeguard, if only for a transitional period, in order to be
absolutely sure that the most destitute people who rely on the loans
and grants that exist now through the social fund are not left
vulnerable at any point to local authorities that do not protect those
funding streams. As we have seen with Supporting People, that is a
genuine risk. Some safeguard must be built into the

support and supplement the points raised by my hon. Friend. I share her
concerns about what will happen if the funds devolved to local
authorities are not ring-fenced and how people in the direst straits
can be confident that their needs will be met. We know, as the hon.
Member for Truro and Falmouth said, that people in need are already
being forced by the insufficiency of social fund resources to turn to
other agencies for financial support.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000392">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We can expect
the demands on such agencies to rise anyway as a result of the
prevailing economic context and the planned benefits changes, but
people in at least some local authorities will also experience more
difficulty accessing statutory support than has perhaps been the case.
Agencies are concerned about how they will meet that need. For example,
Family Action, a charity that makes grants to people in financial
difficulties, is already finding itself unable to meet the need
presented to it, and it is concerned about the gap that it might be
expected to
plug.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000393">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
have three questions for the Minister. First, how will people know that
support is available from local authorities? How will they know how to
make an application or gain information about the local
authority’s criteria and access arrangements? Presumably,
Directgov will not be able to provide information about access to local
authority-managed emergency funds for every single local authority in
the country. I would be grateful if she could explain how the
information will be made available to potential claimants and how
Jobcentre Plus and other agencies will be able to signpost people to
local authority support.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000394">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Secondly,
what, if any, arrangements or expectations does the Minister have in
relation to review and appeal? It is concerning, as my hon. Friend
pointed out, that many of the appeals against social fund decisions are
successful. The social fund commissioner has reported that when he has
reviewed decisions to reject budgeting loans, he has found that many
who have applied would have been entitled to community care grants. We
can see that decision making has never been very consistent or
necessarily correct from the point of view of the applicant. I am
anxious to know whether the Minister intends review and
appeal mechanisms to be entirely at the discretion of local
authorities. I rather fear and expect that she does, but
will the Government issue any guidance on that?<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000395">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">My third
question relates to one particularly vulnerable group of people who
have accessed the social fund in time of need. I would be grateful for
the Minister’s comments on their position in future. They are
the people forced to turn to the social fund when fleeing domestic
violence. Such people are often forced overnight to leave their home
and all their goods and household items and set up elsewhere, with no
opportunity to remove anything from the family home or turn to family
members for financial support. They must often hide from the
perpetrator of the violence, losing all their social networks and
informal support.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000396">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Those people
are unlikely to be known to social services. Many victims of domestic
violence have had nothing to do with social services before—or
indeed, in many cases, after—the occurrence of violence.
Therefore, as my hon. Friend pointed out, they are a group of people
for whom social work decisions are unlikely to be particularly
effective or well-informed. Can the Minister provide any assurances
about guidance that will be put in place to urge local authorities to
take a thoughtful and coherent approach to victims of domestic
violence? That group makes substantial calls on the social fund at
times of acute need and desperation. Ministers have expressed concern
for that group in other debates during the passage of the Bill, and I
shall be interested to hear what the Minister says in Committee
tonight.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000397">&#160;</a>

particular, I thank the hon. Member for Westminster North for
acknowledging the shortcomings of the current system and agreeing about
the need to address them. I am sure that she did not intend to confuse
the Committee by saying that the measure was a default abolition of the
social fund, because that is simply not the case. Hon. Members who have
had the opportunity to review the excellent policy briefing that
members of the Department have pulled together will see clearly that
the summary of social fund reforms falls well short of the total
abolition that the hon. Lady has asserted. The regulated part of the
social fund remains very much as is. If she goes back and reviews the
<em>Hansard</em>, she will find that she has asserted, without making it
clear, in at least two points in her contribution, that the measure is
a default abolition of the social fund.

offered in the regulated part of the social fund. It is important not
to blur the matter and leave individuals feeling that were they in very
difficult situations, they would not get the support that they need. Of
course, budgeting loans, the crisis loan alignment payments, and so on,
will continue operating as they are—they will be centrally
administered, not devolved to local authorities. The measure simply
relates to some of the discretionary parts, which, as the hon. Member
for Westminster North has rightly pointed out, have caused a great deal
of the criticism that has come from independent organisations about how
the system is run. It is important that Committee members are aware of
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000399">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The social
fund was introduced more than two decades ago as part of the Fowler
reforms, and since then, welfare delivery has changed significantly.
The problem that we face is that that the discretionary parts of the
social fund are administered in an incredibly remote way. The
administrators do not have day-to-day contact with communities; they
cannot check that the money is being used in the optimum way, both for
the taxpayer and for the individuals concerned; and the remote,
telephone-based administration method has been heavily criticised. I am
told—I do not know whether I can verify this—that there
are even websites that give guidance to applicants on how to conduct
telephone conversations when they apply for the loans, to optimise
their success rates. All such abuses of the application process have
led to widespread criticism, to which the hon. Member for Westminster
North alluded in her opening comments. Such criticism has been most
recently seen in the National Audit Office report, but has also been
made through the Public Accounts Committee.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000400">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I do not
think that any of us in Committee are trying to say that those problems
are to be left as they are and that reform is not needed. The community
care grants and the crisis loans—other than those that are
currently available to applicants pending payment of
benefit, which are the most discretionary—are being
replaced by a new, locally based provision, which will be delivered by
local authorities in England and devolved Administrations in Scotland
and Wales. Perhaps the hon. Lady believes that we will in some way
simply take the existing structures and devolve them to local
authorities, but that is not the case. We will take the funding
thereof, and allow local authorities to determine how best to use it.
That sort of locally based support, designed to meet the needs of local
communities as different as my constituency in Hampshire and the hon.
Lady’s in central London, ensures that the richness of that
difference is reflected at the same time as the robust backstop of
national support is maintained. The many elements of the social fund,
including cold weather payments, funeral payments, Sure Start maternity
grants, winter fuel payments, budgeting loans and crisis loan alignment
payments, all stay centrally administered and are not subject to local
decision-making
processes.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000401">&#160;</a>

want to pick up on some of the comments that hon. Ladies have made,
particularly those of the hon. Member for Westminster North about the
ordinary financial pressures that parents face. They want loans for
items that are important to their families and which they could not
otherwise afford. This policy area is new, and it will take some time
for the hon. Lady to fully understand it, but I want to reassure her
that those are just the sorts of things that are dealt with, and will
continue to be dealt with, through budgeting loans—unchanged and
unaltered. We are retaining the loans at a national level through a new
system of payments on account, which—I hope this will reassure
the hon. Lady—will not be cash
limited.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000404">&#160;</a>

will be people—including lone parents—who are not known
to and do not interact with social services, as is well-documented in
the report on the experience of social fund customers that was produced
last year from an analysis of 500 claims. That there are those people
is the critical point—it is what I mean by ordinary—but
they none the less make applications for crisis loans. My point was
that there is a mismatch between an expectation that social services
departments will know all such people and the fact that there are
people in crisis who are not in that
category.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000405">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Perhaps I can help to clarify the point. Although
in previous discussions we said that once the money was devolved to a
local authority, social services might be involved in the
administration of the funds, that is by no means a prerequisite. The
local authority in receipt of the funds could decide to have any number
of solutions to address the issues identified. It is a particularly
good point that people do not necessarily want to go to social services
because of fears and perceptions to do with their children, but the
money could even be given to a voluntary sector organisation to
administer, so the continuing debate about social services is a bit of
a red
herring.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000407">&#160;</a>

this new way of doing things. However, I stress that my hon. Friend is
saying that it is down to local authorities to look for the best way to
access the necessary funding. If using social services is thought to be
inappropriate, there are many other ways to identify those in greatest

community care grant, they are cross-referred again. How will that

cross-referral on all sorts of things, and signposting will be
extremely important to ensure that individuals get access to the
support that they need. However, I urge the hon. Lady not to think that
we are going to take the present system of grants and interventions and
simply insist that local authorities do it. I reiterate the fact that
local authorities will have many ways to use this money.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000411">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I bring
myself firmly back to the amendment, Mr Weir, before you
insist that I do so. Clause 69 paves the way for the reforms of the
social fund that will replace the discretionary part of the social with
a mix of local and national provision. Our commitment to localism will
give local authorities the freedom to make the most appropriate
decisions for their areas. At the heart of what we are talking about is
a non-ring fenced fund; local authorities from north, south, east and
west will be able to decide how best to use that significant amount of
money in support of their local community to ensure that their services
meet local needs.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000412">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There is a
philosophical difference between the Government’s approach and
that taken by the hon. Member for Westminster North. When I consider my
local authority and local authorities throughout the country, I know
how committed they are to ensuring that they meet the needs of local
residents, and I know how hard local authority staff work to ensure
that they meet the needs of local residents. For the Opposition to
question that through their line of attack is unfortunate. We are all
knowledgeable about our local authorities, and we know that they will
be working at their hardest to take the opportunity better to meet the
needs of local residents rather than trying in any way to undermine the
support that is given.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000413">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We heard a
great deal of assertion from the hon. Member for Westminster North
about the cost of the measure. Again, I affirm that any new burdens
will be funded; there is no expectation that local authorities will
replicate the current scheme. We are not localising the discretionary
social fund. It is vital that the Committee understands that. The new
service may not necessarily be an application-based service. It may be
a referral, with no expectation that social services will administer
the new assistance, although they may of course be involved in
referrals if the local authority decides that that is
appropriate.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000414">&#160;</a>

is important to give local authorities the opportunity to ensure that
those extra bits of support, which can make a real difference to
families and to individuals when they are most in need, are delivered

                        <p class="tabbed">The hon. Lady
talked about a number of aspects of the current system. I just wanted
to ensure that the record was clear. The crisis loans recovery is
approximately 50% in-year, not 84% as I think she mentioned. Money does
not come back very efficiently at the moment. About £140 million
of the current social fund loan debt is five years or older, so there
are some real problems with the current scheme that I do not think that
we can simply skate over. As the hon. Lady rightly said, this is not a
measure around cost-cutting. Equally, it is not about cost-containment,
because the current scheme is cash limited and not updated as a matter
of routine. Payment on account will remove that cash restriction when
it replaces budgeting loans and alignment payments. Funding will
transfer with the function to local authorities, and any new burdens
will be funded—she can be assured of that.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000416">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
philosophical difference here is about the way that we view local
authorities, and their role in delivering services to our constituents.
Local authorities are public bodies that must act in a way that is
consistent with the law, and if they do not act in a fair and impartial
manner, they could be challenged. It will be the responsibility of
local authorities in England to determine appropriate arrangements for
reviews when it comes to that policy area, and to ensure that decisions
are fair and impartial. It will be the responsibility of the devolved
Administrations in Scotland and Wales, and the delivery organisations
there, to ensure that decisions are fair and impartial. I think that
local authorities will take this new duty obligation very seriously
indeed and make sure that they make the most of an incredibly good
opportunity to improve their local
services.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000417">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
question was: why not simply impose a new duty on local authorities? In
freeing up local authorities from top-down control from central
government, we will give them the opportunity to come up with better
solutions than simply a one-size-fits-all approach. They will, of
course, be open to scrutiny at local level for any decisions that they
make not only from the people living in their community, but from local
politicians and, if necessary, from the local ombudsman as well. There
are, therefore, many levels of scrutiny in place to ensure both that
the available funding is used in a proper way, and that decisions that
are taken are fair and as we would expect them to be.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000418">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Other issues
were raised by the hon. Member for Stretford and Urmston. How will
individuals know how to make an application? Will there be signposting?
The obvious answer to that is that it will be down to an individual
local authority to decide the best way, in their community, to put that
together. As the hon. Member for Westminster North said, it may be
deeply inappropriate in some areas to have social workers in that role.
In my area, social workers are highly respected and would be seen by,
and have fingers in, all aspects of the community and would be well
placed, in that instance, to be involved in the process.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000419">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">On review and
appeal, as I just said, the scrutiny that is open to local authorities
is very intense not only from local residents, but also from local
councillors, through scrutiny panels at local council level, and then,
ultimately, if individuals feel that anything has been dealt with in a
way that is not consistent with how it should be, through the local
government ombudsman as
well.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000420">&#160;</a>

domestic violence, as I am sure that the hon. Member for Westminster
North would expect, we will be taking extreme care to ensure that
individuals who are subject to domestic violence continue to receive
the sort of support that they need. Through the national loan schemes,
which continue to be in place, individuals who are in that kind of
situation will continue to be able to get the support that they receive
at the moment. I would imagine that it would be an extremely high
priority of local authorities to ensure that, as I am sure that most of
our local authorities do now, the services that support victims of
domestic violence view this as a beneficial move to augment further the
support that they are able to give directly, rather than them
potentially having to go through the Government to access
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000421">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Several
individuals have raised concerns about ensuring that we have clarity
about how people can access support, and that is an issue that we are
discussing with local authorities, the Local Government Association and
the devolved Administrations, because, as hon. Members have rightly
said, it is important that access to support through the new provision
is clear and that people can get that support as they need it. Indeed,
the problems of people fleeing domestic violence have formed a great
deal of the discussions that we have had with local authorities and
others to ensure that those people’s needs are still
covered.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000422">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
hope that those comments deal with all the questions that hon. Members
have asked and that they understand more clearly that the Government
are not in any way abolishing the social fund. I am sure that that was
a slip of the tongue from the hon. Member for Westminster North.
Indeed, a great deal of the regulated part of the social fund will
still be firmly in place, offering the sort of support that it needs to
provide. However, we are taking this opportunity to empower local
authorities to be able to give the right support to their local
community. With those reassurances, I hope that the hon. Lady feels
able to withdraw her

the next amendment—that some local authorities step up to the
plate, do an absolutely brilliant job and go above and beyond what is
required, but some do not. In some ways, there will be an incentive for
local authorities not to do that if there is no ring-fencing and no
protection. They will not necessarily go out and look for levels of
demand that do not necessarily present themselves through referral or
through interaction with social services and so forth at the
moment.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000426">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It
is interesting that the Minister said that the proposal is not a
cost-containment measure, as well as not being a cost-cutting measure,
which I completely conceded. The impact assessment refers to the policy
objectives and intended
effects:<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000427">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“To
transfer provision and responsibility of CLs to local
authorities… with an expectation that this will reduce
application

                        </p>
                        <p>We
are starting from the point of view that local authorities will be
required to bear down on demand. That is a difficult thing for them to
do. I am not entirely convinced that local authority associations have
read that as a policy objective, because it slightly contradicts what
the Minister has told
us.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000428">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Local
authorities will inevitably have to undertake an assessment process if
they are not to run the risk of some of the most vulnerable and
destitute people falling through the net. That assessment process has
been flagged up also in the impact assessment as being a cause for
concern if it is more intensive and more face to face. It is
unsustainable for the Department to do, because it costs too much
money, but we are asking local authorities to do exactly what the
Department says it cannot do. Some of those much vaunted desirable
elements of local authorities doing the work face to face, with which I
would agree, are not really feasible in the circumstances that we are
presented
with.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000429">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Minister corrected a figure that was given to me in one of the briefing
notes from one of the sector organisations—I will find it in a
moment. I apologise if that figure is wrong. She said that there would
be a 50% recovery of loans. That still prompts the fundamental question
that I put to her: if 50% of the crisis loan fund is effectively being
renewed with repayment along those lines, that inevitably means that a
little further down the line the availability of resources for local
authorities to invest in—the distinctions between the schemes
will obviously disappear—will be significantly lower. That, no
doubt, comes back to the stated policy objective of the impact
assessment.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000430">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
are looking at something of a poisoned chalice for local government,
and that places some very vulnerable people at risk. The only
reasonable approach, without investing large amounts of additional
money, is at least to provide a safety net so that when local
authorities get their allocation of resources and start working out for
themselves how they might meet the needs of those millions of annual
applicants, they know that there is a fund that must be protected and
used for that purpose. It may be that in a few years’ time we
will revisit that issue, but it seems that far too great a risk is
being taken and that such a risk is certainly one of the critical
concerns being flagged up by dozens of charities and

                        <p class="tabbed">I
wholly agree with the Minister—I am sure that we would all
agree—that there are cases where local authorities in rural
areas would seek to provide a service differently from those in an
inner-city area. For example, a Scottish local authority might see the
needs of its community quite differently from East Sussex county
council. However, the fact remains that, every year, we have around
3 million —I will check the figure
again—applications for crisis loans and community care grant
applications. Of those, a substantial minority, which is the key theme
of amendment 179, are people in motion. They do not have a fixed local
connection, and for them, a nationally accessible service is the safety
net that prevents them

                           </div>from falling into destitution and homelessness. As such people do not
have a settled local connection with a local authority, and in some
cases, are those who are at the greatest risk, there is a real danger
that a local authority-based system of assessment will lead them to a
difficult
position.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000462">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It
is right for local authorities to look at different ways of meeting the
needs of people in some aspects of their own local communities; that is
understood. However, it is wrong if vulnerable people who do not have a
local connection cannot access a service at all. It is also deeply
worrying if two people with absolutely identical needs, which present
themselves in many cases, though not all, in terms of discretionary
social fund applications, as a financial crisis, are treated
differently.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000463">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">What
we know from the discretionary social fund case analysis that was
produced last year is just how many people are applying for crisis
loans and, in some cases, for community care grants. Although they have
clear and difficult needs, they are not necessarily in a category of
person who is already involved with a local authority. My own local
authority runs a scheme that is increasingly popular. It is a small
localised scheme that works with highly dysfunctional families that
sometimes experience many different problems across generations, such
as alcohol and drug abuse, young people in prison or in trouble with
the law, and educational under-achievement. The scheme is small, but
works extremely well in many cases, because it is a highly focused
intervention that seeks to get, as far as possible, to the bottom of
problems that cause multiple difficulties and have multiple causes.
Such schemes are not run by agencies that interact with thousands of
people, let alone millions, and yet across local authorities, the
number of applications that are being made for financial assistance in
crisis runs into
millions.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000464">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It
may well be—particularly if, as I hope, growth resumes and the
economy starts to flourish—that the level of demand that has
risen since the middle of the past decade begins to flatten out.
However, it is not particularly likely that that will happen unbidden,
unless some other form of intervention takes place to bear down on the
level of applications. Therefore, local authorities will have to act as
much tougher gatekeepers than in the past for people whose presenting
crisis is
financial.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000465">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">That
leads us to ask a serious question about the extent to which it is
right to have people with comparable needs in different parts of the
country not having those needs met or their assessments undertaken
simply because of where they happen to live. It may well be that the
exact form of assistance given to them is tailored locally to meet
local circumstances but, none the less, will they be able to apply to a
local authority and will they be able to get a referral if they ask for
one? When they make an application to a local authority, will their
application be seen on its merits in a roughly comparable way,
regardless of where it is they happen to be living? That is a
fundamental matter of justice and is a particular advantage of having
some form of national
scheme.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000466">&#160;</a>

against that?<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000467">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> If there is no mechanism to deal with people with no
local connection, that is exactly what will happen. There has to be a
mechanism for dealing with local connection. This is the closest
comparison and we have talked about it a lot, but the homelessness
criteria for local authorities provide us with something of a template
in that respect. If somebody has been ordinarily resident in Glasgow
and they turn up in Camden, they will make an application there. They
might have moved quite legitimately—for example, they might have
been in Glasgow for only a few months because they were in a
relationship and that broke down. Camden council will simply refer them
back to Glasgow. However, if someone is in a particular needs category
or they had been in a local authority for a period of time, the council
cannot do
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000468">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Through
the homelessness legislation, there cannot be a pinball system, where
an individual who is homeless can simply be endlessly referred from one
local authority to another because they have no local connection
whatever. That is protected against in the legislation. I am slightly
leaping forward at the moment, but why not? The fact that we have no
such mechanism in this system means that the very people who are
possibly the bottom of the bottom in terms of their vulnerability are
the people whom local authorities will have no motive to help and they
will have no expectation that they will have to meet the needs of
people who do not normally live in the
area.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000469">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">On
categories of people, we talked a bit earlier about victims of domestic
violence. That is a very good example because often people fleeing
domestic violence will cross a local authority boundary. What will
happen to that person? The Minister assures us that the matter is under
consideration, but a mechanism will have to be put in place. We cannot
have somebody who is fleeing Brent because of domestic violence being
sent back to Brent council to make an application because that is where
their local connection is. In a way, domestic violence is almost the
easier example. There is a form of national structure that
exists—it is unsatisfactory but, none the less, it is
there—to recognise responsibilities for dealing with domestic
violence. There are much larger categories of people. Homeless people
are the obvious
example.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000470">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The hon. Lady is absolutely right. I could not
agree more that domestic violence is the easy case. The harder case is
that of the paedophile who was dumped into Dover district recently and
forced into housing. He had no local connection whatever. He was
released from prison into London and he was able to elect Dover and
stay in a family hotel, which has caused great concern to my
constituents.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000471">&#160;</a>

                           <em>]</em> It is a serious point.
Part of the difficulty is that we are always talking about a presenting
problem being the cost of housing people, or what happens when people
are inflowing into a community that is too expensive or where there are
challenges. We rarely complete the sentence and say where we want those
people to live. At any given time, we have hundreds of thousands,
possibly more, people who are in motion in the private rented sector,
including people with problems, and we have to decide where they 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 738<a class="bkMark" name="Column738">&#160;</a>
                           </div>are going to go. The only sensible way to do that is to have an
allocation system. We must have a system that says that, if it is not
reasonable—and it may well not be—for Westminster or
central London to provide a service to all the people who flow in to
the middle of the city, or for the seaside towns to do so owing to the
nature of their housing stock, the councils surrounding Dover must be
prepared to take their share of people in that situation.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000472">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">That will
also be true of the discretionary social fund applications. We must
ensure that individuals are not simply pinged from one place to
another. We also need to ensure that some local authorities, because
they are in seaside towns or inner-city communities, which are the two
most vulnerable to these pressures, do not end up taking a
disproportionate share of people who are highly vulnerable and present
a challenge. They need to be reasonably and fairly distributed in
different parts of the country.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000473">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The hon.
Member for Dover was going on about a paedophile, but ex-offenders are
a classic example. About 66,000 people leave prison every year; a third
leave without accommodation. The Prison Reform Trust contacted me about
its concerns about the discretionary social fund, and flagged up the
fact that ex-prisoners have a particular need for early financial
assistance to prevent debt, because that spiral of homelessness and
debt for ex-offenders is strongly correlated with
reoffending.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000474">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Few local
authorities will actively volunteer to provide financial assistance for
ex-offenders who do not have a local connection. What is the mechanism
to be to assist them? Similarly, with homeless households, we have a
structure in place with homelessness legislation, but not necessarily
in respect of how to deal with people in financial crisis making an
application to the discretionary social fund.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000475">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Those are
just sharp examples of a bigger problem. In my local authority, 30% of
the population changes every year: there is 30% annual turnover on
population every single year. A lot of those people will not have a
local connection; in fact many will not have a connection with any
local authority because the private rented sector churns very quickly.
A lot of people will stay for only six months or less than year. Where
are the people in that situation expected to make an application? I
asked that question of the Secretary of State when he gave evidence to
the Committee. I

tell us the meaning of the Secretary of State’s clear commitment
that local authorities have a moral duty. That seems to me to be saying
that a local authority—be it Dover, Westminster or
Redcar—has a moral obligation to consider and assess the
application of anybody and everybody who makes an application in that
local authority. Is that what the Government are saying? Because if it
is, those local authorities need to consider the implications. Dover,
Westminster and possibly Cornwall, with its highly mobile seasonal
population, will face challenges that many other local authorities
absolutely will not, and I do not think they are going to like it. I do
not think that it will be good enough simply to say that there is a
moral duty; it must be turned into a specific set of

                        <p class="tabbed">Councillor
Reed, on behalf of the Local Government Association, did not know what
information we have on the pattern of applications and patterns of
acceptance and refusal in different local authority areas. Nor did he
know the extent to which the pattern that arose in different
geographical areas actually represented people’s home addresses,
and what proportion of those people had no local connection. Local
authorities would be unwise to sign up to the new arrangements without
those data. I gather that local authorities are working with the DWP,
but it would be good to have an assurance from the Minister that that
information is now available, because I think the Committee would be
interested to see it. How do we know the exact geographical
distribution of all these applications, so that the distribution of
funding to local authorities can be robust? I look forward to hearing
back on that, as it is an issue of considerable
concern.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000486">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Before
being led off a little into the issue of local connection, I spoke
about the variability of service to people with identical needs, and it
is a concern. Local authorities will have to draw up their own
eligibility criteria, because we know from the impact assessment that a
downward pressure on applications is expected, and they will therefore
have to police their criteria. How will they do that? How will they
ensure that those decisions are transparent and accountable? How can we
be sure that some local authorities will not draw up

			Column number: 740<a class="bkMark" name="Column740">&#160;</a>
                           </div>criteria that will exclude people who we would all
regard as highly vulnerable, particularly when they do not have a local
connection?<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000487">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
am also concerned about some of the proposals for an alternative to
cash support that are being mooted as part of this package. I am not
necessarily opposed to that in principle, but it poses several
questions. I worry about the stigma attached to a stipulation that if
people happen to be in a financial crisis they should only be entitled
to second-hand cookers. My bigger worry, however, is the bureaucracy of
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000488">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Are we saying
that we would expect all local authorities to develop their own systems
for supplying second-hand electrical goods or clothing? Or are they
expected to come to some sort of deal? Given the millions of people who
make an application every year, how will that match with local
authority planning for different kinds of service? It is absolutely
right that the flourishing charitable and voluntary sector in local
communities provides a service. We should not say, however, that
because there is an excellent service providing second-hand goods and
services in Hertfordshire everybody who comes along only has that
service, even if their financial need is not for that service at all.
Or, if they are in a different local authority, we should not say that
they can only access second-clothing, rather than finance. It is just
not very well thought out. It sounds great rhetorically, but it does
not seem very well thought through, in terms of the quality of service
likely to be offered.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000489">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Critically,
it is not so much about ensuring that people have a great experience of
the social fund. It is about ensuring that people who are facing
destitution, homelessness or some other crisis—people who are
facing the difference between setting up home and not doing
so—are able to set up home. As we know, there are many social
and economic benefits of their being able to do that and do it swiftly,
such as their being able to get a job or have a better health
outcome.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000490">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
have been accused of not having a great deal of faith in local
authorities, which is not a fair accusation. I was a local councillor
for seven years, which I regard as a fantastic experience. Local
councillors are on the front line and provide superb and locally
tailored services, but I still do not think that it is necessarily the
recipe for a satisfactory national
service.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000491">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Local
authorities provide patchy outcomes, partly because they are so
different. People would not expect Northumberland county council to
develop a framework dealing with the same challenges as a council in
the south of England. When it comes to their share, which is
potentially tens of thousands of people applying for crisis assistance,
it is not going to help very much. Sir Richard Tilt made that point in
his
evidence:<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000492">&#160;</a>

do not have a lack of trust in local authorities. Many of them do very
well, but my experience is that you get a very patchy service. Some
local authorities provide a good service, but others do
not.”<em>––</em>[<em>Official Report, Welfare Reform

on the example of disability grants to make that point. There are many
such examples. The availability of school uniform grants is another.
Some local authorities go that extra mile and some do not, which risks
a degree of shopping around by people if there are no clear laws and
allocations.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000493">&#160;</a>

Richard and Professor Kempson both made it clear that we should be
turning some of the powers into duties, creating clear guidance on the
eligibility criteria and ensuring that we have the data—in my
view, we should have had the data to inform the Committee’s
decisions, rather than having them afterwards—to know what is
going on in different local communities. We would then be able to make
it clear that local variation is one thing, but an unacceptable level
of postcode lottery is
another.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000494">&#160;</a>

final point, which my hon. Friend the Member for Stretford and Urmston
briefly touched on, is on appeals and the absence of a proper appeals
structure. I do not think that will be sustainable in the longer term.
It is inevitable that there will be sufficient challenges to local
authorities to make it essential that they set up an appeals structure.
If they do so, setting up hundreds of different appeals structures in
different parts of the country will mean another level of bureaucracy
and
cost.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000495">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> That makes the point about the need for some sort of
national service, rather than a localised service. Perhaps the hon.
Lady should put that question to the Minister. It is potentially a
problem. I do not suppose that it will be a vast problem, but I am sure
there will be instances in which people do that. It is extremely hard
in today’s highly mobile world, particularly given that, by
definition, a number of people in this category will be sofa surfers
without fixed abodes; it will require a degree of investigation by the
353 local authorities, rather than one single
administration.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000497">&#160;</a>

absence of an appeals system is a serious flaw. It has been identified
as a serious flaw by the sector. I do not think it will be sustainable,

not be terribly desirable given the amount of money and
bureaucracy.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000498">&#160;</a>

all those reasons, the potential advantages of localism, to which I
still cleave, are none the less heavily undermined by a lack of rigour
and thought into how it will work. As is so often the case, it will be
a good idea not thought through and will end up costing more, being
more bureaucratic and, potentially, leaving some vulnerable people with
no protection whatever. For that reason, I commend the two amendments

face destitution, payments on account will replace the crisis loan
system and, eventually, budgeting loans. Again, I would hate for any
Committee member to feel that no national support will be in place,
because clearly it will. What we are discussing is the discretionary
part of the social fund. It is important to keep things in perspective.

Committee members on their serious concerns about the social fund. Why
does she think that Barnardo’s, Oxfam, Save the Children,

where the policy is set out a little more clearly, they will understand
how the change fits in with the regulated part of the social fund. Some
of the coverage that inadvertently suggested the abolition of the

problems.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000502">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
move to some of the other issues raised by the hon. Lady before going
into the detail of her amendment. She talked about local
authorities’ moral obligation. Local authorities indeed have a
moral obligation to ensure that they structure their services so as to
meet the needs of their residents, but they also have a legal
obligation to act reasonably and fairly. Having been a councillor, she
will be well aware of that, and local authorities will consider that
legal responsibility when deciding how to take the opportunity afforded
them by the Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000503">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendments seek to standardise the delivery of services and appeals
across the country in a way that lacks a grasp of where the Government
are coming from and the essence of what we are trying to do in the
Bill. We are trying to reflect the individual needs of local
communities, not simply replicate the current system’s
one-size-fits-all approach. We must ensure that the many issues raised
by the hon. Lady are addressed, but that fundamental difference in
starting point is important to acknowledge. Delivery of the new
assistance will be the responsibility of local authorities in England
and devolved authorities in Scotland and Wales, and the
Government’s overall decentralisation agenda will promote the
devolution of power to create greater financial autonomy in local
government. It is incredibly consistent with the overall principles
followed by the
Government.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000504">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">In
England, delivery of assistance locally will mean that decisions are
made locally, in the most appropriate way for the area. That will
naturally lead to differences. If it did not, I would be most
surprised, because there are different pressures and different needs in
each area of the country that we represent. That, however, implies a
more tailored service that responds better to the specific needs of a
community. I hope that the hon. Lady will understand that and embrace
it as the starting point for this piece of
legislation.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000505">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Local
delivery means that local service providers will have the flexibility
to design and deliver new assistance in a way that best fits local
circumstances. I understand the hon. Lady’s point about falling
through the gaps in the net, as well as the pinball analogy. We
recognise that determining eligibility is one of the range of issues
that local authorities will have to consider when designing their new
assistance. As a result of the responses we have received to the call
for evidence on these changes, we are actively considering a range of
ways that we

                           </div>could offer support to local authorities during
transition to the new assistance. It will be the responsibility of
local authorities in England to ensure that decisions are fair and
impartial, as well as deciding on appropriate arrangements on
reconsideration or review; that was another issue that the hon. Lady
brought up.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000506">&#160;</a>

the hon. Lady is clearly aware, the discretionary social fund is not
subject to an appeals process. Because it is discretionary, internal
reviews of decisions can be made, and there is an independent review
service. Decisions made on whether to award somebody a crisis loan, a
budgeting loan or a community care grant cannot be appealed in court.
Although we agree that there needs to be a way for decisions to be fair
and impartial, which local authorities will look at, she needs to take
account of what goes on currently, because it is not fair and impartial
in the way that other parts of the benefits system
are.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000507">&#160;</a>

through that issue, because he raised it earlier in the debate. He is
right that the allocation of the funding will be an important part of
getting the measure right. It will be based on social fund spending in
local authorities, and in Scotland and Wales. We will be publishing
local authority level data as part of the response to the call for
evidence. That will happen shortly and the data will be updated
frequently during the transitional period. That will allow funding to
go to high pressure areas, as the hon. Member for Westminster North was
calling for. It is important that we reflect the real need among local
communities and we have been looking closely at that. I hope that the
information that we are publishing will reassure the hon. Gentleman
that the money will go where it is needed

                        <p class="tabbed">In
her speech, the hon. Member for Westminster North raised a number of
issues about goods and services. It is fair to say that we would expect
local authorities to contract with organisations that already provide
the sort of services on which so much of the money is currently used,
whether it is on reused goods or to expand the services that are on
offer. Those who work in those organisations on the ground have told us
that that is a much better way of providing support.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000510">&#160;</a>

are some good examples of how the system is working already. For
example, there is the work of Age UK in Camden, which has an incredibly
successful project, ordering goods from Argos for local people in need.
I urge the hon. Lady to look at some of the examples where things are
working well on the ground. The proposal also has the potential to
support some of our recycling obligations under the waste electrical
and electronic equipment directive, which is another benefit that we
cannot dismiss out of hand.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000511">&#160;</a>

across the country, for the reasons pointed out by the hon. Member for

need. We will shortly be publishing levels of demand and spend by local
authorities on community care grants and crisis loans as part of our
summary response document to the call for evidence. The most recent
data, from 2009-10, show that the highest levels of demand for a crisis
loan in the life of the social fund were realised; there were about 1.8
million applications for living expenses, and 1.3 million awards
elsewhere. It is important to realise that there will be demand, but
the applications will not be on the scale feared by the hon. Lady; they
will be at a rather more manageable level.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000512">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The hon. Lady
raised an important point about the movement of individuals between
local authorities, which I was going to talk about before the
intervention, and asked how we will determine eligibility and ensure
that people do not fall through the net. That is one of a range of
issues that local authorities will have to consider. As a result of the
responses received to the call for evidence on the changes, we are
actively considering a range of ways to offer support to local
authorities during the transition to the new
assistance.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000513">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Nothing
will stop local authorities such as that of the hon. Lady in
Westminster, and particularly in London and other high population
areas, working together to provide assistance. They will be best placed
to determine the criteria, and funding will be allocated to reflect the
need in areas. Many local authority areas may decide to come together,
so perhaps some of the smaller scale demands that the hon. Lady
mentioned in her earlier contributions will be met. The real richness
of the needs of local communities can be realised, but it will be down
to local authorities to ensure that they get it right. It will be the
responsibility of the devolved Administrations in Scotland and Wales to
do that as well.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000514">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I hope that
starts to set out for the hon. Lady some of the work that has already
been done, and some of the work that we are yet to do to ensure that
the sorts of issues she has raised in the debate are addressed in a way
that gives her confidence in our progress. I ask her to recognise and
realise that the Government’s commitment to localism is real and
strong, and is one of the main planks of our agreement with our
coalition partners. This area is ripe for localism to be an effective
way of ensuring that more people get the support that can make a real
difference to their lives. I urge the hon. Lady to withdraw the
amendment and support the Government’s
approach.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000515">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I am slightly reassured by the Minister. Some

lack of specificity will need to be redressed before the devolution of
the grants, because it will not be good enough to say that local
authorities will, whether alone or in partnership with neighbouring
authorities, willingly accept applications from people for whom they do
not have a connection. The Secretary of State’s moral obligation
notwithstanding, there is no question about it: with a budget that is
not ring-fenced—we have still not had a clear indication from

from recovered grants, local authorities will simply not want to take
applications from people without a local connection. I cannot see any
way round that other than a clear national mechanism to deal with those
people. They will not necessarily come from a neighbouring borough;
they will come from all over the country, as the hon. Member for Dover
will know from the way people flow in and out of constituencies such as
his. His local authority and many others will undoubtedly need some
means of determining whom they are obliged to deal with from a budget
that will not be sufficient to meet
needs.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000517">&#160;</a>

tend to want. They wake up to their new responsibilities and say,
“We haven’t been given the funding or powers to implement

happen.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000521">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Member for Dover made my point for me. Local authorities will make
a decision on whether someone has a local connection. That is exactly
the point. Five hundred discretionary fund cases were analysed by the
Department last year and 20% of them involved people who were homeless.
A substantial minority—the figure quoted is 20%, and sometimes
up to 40%––will have no connection with anywhere, so what
will happen to them? They will not disappear; they will present as a
problem somewhere, and something must be done to ensure that they are
not destitute and homeless. It would not be in their interest or the
community’s interest if no mechanism
existed.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000522">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Gentleman proved my point exactly. The local authority’s
first instinct, understandably, will be to ask “Are these people
my people?”. If they are, it will help them, and if they are not
it will say, “They are not my responsibility.” If every
local authority says that, which they will once one or two start, we
will end up with many vulnerable people being like pinballs in a
machine. That is
unacceptable.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000523">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The hon. Lady has painted a picture, but I am
not sure that it is the right picture. The reality is that in practice
a homeless person will present to a local authority, which will have to
provide temporary accommodation, and from that point on it is common
sense that the discretionary social fund will surely
flow.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000524">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> It is not necessarily the case that the local
authority will have to provide temporary accommodation. If someone does
not fall into a priority needs category, the local authority does not
have to help them, and may send them away without providing
temporary accommodation. A local authority must only place people in
temporary accommodation to review their homeless status if they fall
into a priority group, and many of them will not because they may not
have dependent children and so on. I am not sure that that safeguard
applies. Even when it does apply, a local authority may make a decision
to house someone pending a review, but if they do not have a local
connection, it will simply discharge its duty, and understandably so.
That is why there has to be some form of national safety
net.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000525">&#160;</a>

properly what the Government are proposing. I hope that it is not the
case; I believe it is not. I say again to the Minister that it is
worrying that although her Department is no doubt in constant contact
with the many excellent and expert organisations that operate in this
field, those organisations wrote a letter to the Minister with
responsibility for pensions, the hon. Member for Thornbury and Yate
(Steve Webb), only 10 or 15 days ago, expressing their deep concerns
about the DWP proposals to abolish part of the social fund. They
highlighted the huge need for those payments. There were 3.65 million
applications for crisis loans and 640,000 applications for the
community care grant in 2009-10. The organisations expressed deep
concern about the lack of analysis by the DWP of the needs and
circumstances of people who rely on those grants and loans, the lack of
detail about how the proposals will work and the decision to move
administration to local authorities at a time when their budgets are
being
cut.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000526">&#160;</a>

turn. We know that in those situations people seek to borrow the money
to get by. The place that they will go to borrow the money, if they are
unable to access it or do not even realise that they can access it from
legitimate statutory authorities, albeit that those authorities may be
national or local depending on what the appropriate route is for them
given their particular situation, will be the easy-access loan sharks
and illegitimate lenders—the doorstep credit
suppliers—who, in many cases, will put such people into further
financial need.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000536">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Frankly, I
have listened with dismay to the debate this evening, because it seems
to me that the potential for confusion and for people to be unable to
find the financial support that they need in times of crisis is being
exacerbated by the complicated way in which Ministers are seeking to
localise some aspects, but not others, of the current discretionary
social fund.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000537">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">My first plea
would be for us to take a step back from all of this confusion that I
think will prevail, particularly as we have only just completed a
consultation process and we have not yet had a chance to consider the
outcome of that process.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000538">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">However, if
we are going ahead with the system that Ministers are proposing, we
need to be sure that people are not forced into the arms of the loan
sharks because they simply cannot work out where else they could
possibly go. That is why amendment 181 and new clause 5 propose that a
backstop lender of last resort is appointed to protect people in such
situations, and that function would be best fulfilled by central
Government. It is not the same as payments on account, which are about
people trying to spread over time the cost of lumpy items, perhaps,
which are difficult to fund from their regular benefit payments. This
is about people in crisis, who urgently need access to money, because
they have faced an emergency or a difficult domestic situation. As I
understand it, they will never be expected to access that kind of
support through payments on account. What they would be doing in the
new world, it would seem, is going to the local authority, saying,
“I’m in a high degree of need”, and the local
authority would then decide how best to respond. That might be through
financial assistance, or it might not.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000539">&#160;</a>

in emergencies, we will have limited access to funds, which in future
will be managed and disbursed by local authorities, at their
discretion. It is possible that some will choose not to make any
financial support available to people in crisis at all because,
locally, they feel it more appropriate to provide such support in kind
through further investment in public services and so on. That is the
logical consequence of the decision to localise in the way proposed by
the
Government.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000543">&#160;</a>

                           </div>the logical consequence of where the Government are going with their
proposals: people will be unable to access some of the sources of
emergency financial support that they can currently access, in
particular, through the crisis loan and the community care element of
the discretionary social fund. Some people might, therefore, have to
borrow the money or to raise it elsewhere, which is likely to be from
the high-cost lenders, the loan sharks and the doorstep and others
accessible lenders to whom we know people turn to in times of financial
crisis.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000544">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendment and new clause 5 seek to put in place a means of protecting
people from high-cost credit providers by setting up what we have
entitled a citizen financial safety protection payment fund—it
is not catchy, I apologise—putting in place a public lending
facility of last resort. That would ensure that people were not forced
to turn to high-cost lenders in times of crisis. Emergency loan
facilities, which would be available and accessible from the state,
would provide that lending safety
net.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000545">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
do not see that as creating cost for the Government because obviously,
as a loan fund, people would be repaying it. If they did not, we
suggest that the Government recover the money from local authorities,
which should be putting in place better solutions so that people are
not forced to rely on the emergency payment protection fund. It is
important to have proper mechanisms in place so that people avoid
falling into the worrying situation of incurring particularly high-cost
credit commitments in an emergency, which will increase their stress
levels, their susceptibility to mental illness and the cost to the
economy.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000546">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendment seeks to put a modest backstop in place for people in times
of desperation, so that they know that they have somewhere to turn for
immediate financial support. We naturally hope that such a fund would
not need to be much drawn on, because local authorities would provide
people in crisis at the moment of need with suitable financial support
or, as the Minister might suggest, in some cases with in-kind support,
to enable them to weather their particular crisis. It seems to us
important that the Government’s proposals are not seen as
increasing the susceptibility of vulnerable people to illegitimate and
high-cost lenders, who will simply exacerbate their financial,
emotional and personal difficulties. I propose my amendment in that
spirit.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000547">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I thank the hon. Lady for outlining the intentions
behind her amendment and new clause. New clause 5 would provide for a
new fund called the citizen financial safety protection payment fund.
As I understand it from the amendment, the fund would be delivered by
the DWP and would essentially create a new social fund. The new clause
would require the Secretary of State to establish the fund to prevent
the financial destitution of those who apply for public assistance.
Amendment 181 would ensure that the ending of the discretionary social
fund did not affect that
duty.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000548">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
we have all set out, the discretionary social fund is in much need of
overhaul. Indeed, we go as far as to say that it is out of date and no
longer fits with the modern welfare delivery in existence in this
country. It is overly expensive to administer, inefficient, poorly
targeted and 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 750<a class="bkMark" name="Column750">&#160;</a>
                           </div>often does not reach those who need it most. In addition, there is
limited scope for the sort of wrap-around provision of non-financial
support services that might best address the complex personal issues
faced by many individuals who come forward for support. We are
therefore taking the action, in the first major reform in this area for
more than 20 years, of replacing the most discretionary aspects with
provision that will be better targeted to local needs and will ensure
that support is given to the most vulnerable. Local authorities and the
Scottish and Welsh Governments will be responsible for deciding on
that, as we have already discussed this
evening.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000549">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">National
provision will be retained, which is a point that, at the risk of
labouring it too much, I will labour again in referring to payments on
account. In setting out the intentions of her amendment and new clause,
the hon. Lady talked about individuals who would still have to have
access to payments, because they are in great financial crisis. I
simply point out to her that about half the crisis loans last
year—in 2009-10—were alignment payments. They will not be
replaced with local provision; they will continue and will become
payments on account of
benefits.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000550">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Local
authorities also have the ability to offer crisis grants, should they
decide to do so, but it is important for the Committee to realise that
there will be extensive provision for the sorts of payments that the
hon. Lady is trying to ensure will still be available for some of those
whom she terms the most vulnerable people. They might otherwise be at
risk of having to resort to high-cost lenders, and I have to say that I
share her concerns. I have concerns and worries about individuals
having to resort to high-cost credit, and I continue to worry about the
apparent availability of high-cost credit to a wide range of
people.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000551">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">It
is important to realise, however, that the available evidence shows
that budgeting loans are a significant alternative to high-cost
lending. As I have said—the hon. Member for Westminster North
will fear that I am repeating myself—those loans are still in
place. Such financial support can make a real difference to the sorts
of families whom the hon. Ladies have referred to, who are finding it
difficult to make ends meet. Financial support from local authorities
for the most vulnerable is likely to be made available in the form of
grants or the provision of goods. That will complement the national
availability of budgeting loans to ensure that the sort of situation
that the hon. Member for Stretford and Urmston has referred to would
not arise.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000552">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Local
provision will be augmented. My real concern with new clause 5 is that
the hon. Lady appears to be replicating the existing system; I
understand her rationale for doing so, although I do not agree with it.
I challenge the Opposition to explain how they would fund it, because
they do not seem to be looking at trying to reduce expenditure in other
areas, so this proposal would be an additional expenditure. We need to
understand where the funding would come from and what other elements of
the Opposition’s plans would be amended to take that into
account.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000553">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I believe
that that covers most of the questions that the hon. Lady has raised. I
remind the Committee that we have had to make substantial changes to
the way in 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 751<a class="bkMark" name="Column751">&#160;</a>
                           </div>which crisis loans are run in this country, because of the
problems that we inherited from the previous Administration. I draw the
Committee’s attention to the statement that the Minister of
State, Department for Work and Pensions, my hon. Friend the Member for
Thornbury and Yate (Steve Webb) made to that effect on 3
March.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000554">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We have
already had to make important changes that will mean that we will no
longer be able to give crisis loans for items such as cookers and beds.
Residual support will be paid to people following disasters such as
flooding, but we have had to reduce the rate paid for living expenses
from 75% to 60% of the benefit rate in order to align with the position
for jobseeker’s allowance cases that are paid at the hardship
rate. We have also implemented a cap of three crisis loan awards for
general living expenses in a 12-month period.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000555">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Without those
measures, budgeting loans would be in severe financial straits. Those
sorts of changes, which we have already established, are starting to
regain some control over the expenditure. That is an important part of
the measures that we are advancing. We will replace crisis loans with
local provision to ensure that we have sufficient funding to meet
demand at the point of transition. It is important to realise, however,
that we have already taken steps to reduce the demand, so that we will
not be passing over to local authorities out-of-control levels of
demand that we have inherited. The Committee needs to be aware of
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000556">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We do not
feel that the creation of an entirely new fund, as detailed in new
clause 5, is warranted. With that clarification and that reassurance, I
hope that the hon. Lady will feel able to withdraw the amendment, and
that she is reassured that the support will be there for the people
about whom she is most concerned.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000557">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I certainly note the Minister’s final
statement that the support will be there for the people who need it,
and I hope that that will come to fruition. Two concerns have emerged
as the debate has proceeded this evening, not only on the amendments
but on clause 69 as a whole. First, we have lost sight of the
absolutely desperate and dire circumstances in which people find
themselves when they come to access the social fund. Applying for
social fund support is not a nice experience at the moment. The
pervasive attitude that people are running away with a set of loans for
expenditure that they do not really need to meet does a huge disservice
to the reason why people have been accessing the social fund and the
very desperate circumstances in which they find themselves. It worries
me greatly that we have a set of proposals that will leave very
desperate people turning to high-cost lenders, because it is the
simplest, quickest and, as far as they can see, the only way in which
they can meet emergency financial need. I say that because of the
second thing that has been concerning me as the debate has proceeded
this evening, which is that one of the advantages that was proclaimed
for the Government’s welfare reforms was that the system was
going to be simplified. I have lost sight of the simplification in
relation to the proposals on replacing elements of the discretionary
social
fund.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000558">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">My
hon. Friend the Member for Westminster North alluded to the puzzlement
of the expert bodies—I would not call it confusion—as to
what the Government were trying to achieve. If that confused puzzlement
exists 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 752<a class="bkMark" name="Column752">&#160;</a>
                           </div>among those bodies, it is all the more likely that we will see
considerable confusion and uncertainty about entitlement and
opportunity to access support and where to go for it from people who
are in dire need. We are likely to see an increased reliance on
high-cost lending as a means for people to get out of desperate
circumstances in a landscape where, as the Minister herself
acknowledged, funding to provide financial support is being reduced and
where it may be less clear to claimants in future where to go to get
support.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000559">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
proposal would not cost the Government money, because it would be a
loan facility that would be repaid. Even if it were not all
repaid—I accept the risk of default—the proposal
envisages that local authorities would have to reimburse the Government
from the devolved funding any unpaid lending that central Government
had incurred. It would be a failure on their part to provide for the
emergencies—the Minister suggested that the power being devolved
to them is to enable them to undertake that—that would cause the
need to draw on a central
fund.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000560">&#160;</a>

in her amendment, but can she clarify who would be paying for the
administration of that loan? If it were central Government, where would
the money come from? If it is local government, presumably money would
be taken away from front-line support for residents and

                           </strong> The Minister is right that to make it cost-neutral
for central Government, naturally it would have to be recovered from
the funding that is being provided to local government to meet
emergency needs. That would surely act as an incentive to local
authorities to meet the emergency needs well. We certainly seem to have
a lack of incentive built into the proposals at the moment, and more an
expectation that local authorities will always do this well. As my hon.
Friend the Member for Westminster North pointed out earlier, witnesses
have made it clear that some local authorities will do it well and some
will not. In a sense, it would be an opportunity to build in an
incentive system to encourage local authorities to meet needs
adequately at a local level so that there was no call on central
funds.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000562">&#160;</a>

I accept that in proposing the amendment the concern is much more to
expose the risks of high-cost lending. I invite Ministers to ensure
that the playing out of their proposals does not lead to putting
vulnerable people in a position where they are more likely to turn to
such creditors and increase the levels of debt that they incur, with
the stress that goes with that when the loans are simply unaffordable
and people struggle to repay them. I do not intend to press the
amendment to a Division, but it is part and parcel of our general
concerns about what may happen in practice, whatever the
Government’s intentions. I suspect that this is an issue that my

                           </strong> Amendment 180 and new clause 4 relate to the Sure
Start maternity grant payments. Of course, they are part of the
non-discretionary social fund. I note from the helpful paper provided
by the Department that that will continue to be administered
nationally, as it is now, and that universal credit will be the
qualifying benefit for access to that support. However, we also know
that it is the Minister’s intention that the Sure Start
maternity grant will, in future, be payable only to the first born in a
family. The amendment seeks to make a change in a specific and
relatively unusual set of circumstances, which is where second and
subsequent births in a family are multiple births.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000570">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We are
concerned about families in which multiple births take place. Although
their incidence of poverty is much the same as for families in
non-multiple-birth households, there are a couple of characteristics of
those families that we think will potentially be affected by some of
the Government’s other welfare reform proposals and may make
their risks greater. For example, the cap on benefits—both the
housing benefit cap and the overall benefits cap—will hit,
inevitably, larger families more harshly, and therefore, by definition,
are more likely to affect a greater proportion of multiple-birth
households than other households.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000571">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It is also
important to note that many of the families with multiple births in the
household tend to be working families. We are concerned to ensure that
those families can continue to have at least one parent in paid
employment and remain out of poverty—I know that that is the
Government’s intention in the design of universal
credit.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000572">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It seems that
it has been accepted that if the first births in a family are multiple
births, there will be a recognition that the Sure Start maternity grant
will cover each of the new children in the family. There will be
payments not just for the very first of the first born group of
children, but extra money will be available for twins and triplets, for
example, who are born as a result of the first pregnancy in a family. I
would be grateful if the Minister would confirm that my understanding
is correct. Extra expenses are incurred when more children arrive all
at once in a household. A family will need more than one cot and more
than one buggy, and naturally the need to spend money on equipment is
multiplied. It is good that when the first children arrive in a family,
the system recognises that.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000573">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
same problem arises if a second or subsequent pregnancy leads to a
multiple birth. It can be said that the Sure Start maternity grant is
paid for only the first child because it enables the family to invest
in equipment that can be passed down to second and subsequent children,
but if a second or subsequent birth is a multiple one, there will not
be enough equipment to pass down and the family will need additional
financial support to meet the higher cost. The amendment and new clause
4 seek to ensure that extra financial support can be provided for that
group of relatively rare families, by extending the Sure
Start maternity grant to subsequent multiple
births.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000574">&#160;</a>

                        </h4>
                        <p class="tabbed">Figures
for the past year show that about 20% of the 11,000 multiple-birth
families are in poverty, and that 2,200 of them might have been
eligible for the Sure Start maternity grant. In April 2011, it was
calculated that 990—45%—of those families were expecting
their first children and would therefore continue to be able to access
the grant, but that 55%, which is 1,210 families, already had children
and would therefore not be eligible for the grant for their second and
subsequent children. Only a small group of families is set to miss out
under the new rules, and a minor change could significantly help
them.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000575">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendment and new clause 4 propose that, in the case of multiple births
from a first pregnancy, families receive £500 per baby, but that
if there are other children under the age of 16 in the family, there
would be a single payment of £500 for twins, £1,000 for
triplets and £1,500 for larger multiple births. It would
obviously be important that a health professional confirmed that the
number of children expected was delivered, and the systems exist to do
that. Government Members will naturally be concerned about the cost of
such a measure. If we were to allow another 1,210 families to be
entitled to the grant, the cost would be between £500,000 and
£1 million. I think that all hon. Members could agree
that, in the context of social security spending, that is a small and
affordable sum, which would not significantly increase the
administrative burden on Jobcentre Plus, creating just an additional 23
applications a week for multiple births, bringing the total to
42.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000576">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There
are consequences to not introducing the change proposed in the
amendment and in new clause 4. Parents who received the Sure Start
maternity grant have said that they spend the grant on double
pushchairs, the cost of which is about £200, car seats at around
£50, baby clothes, bottles, milk, nappies, cots and mattresses,
at £200. The millennium cohort study suggested that
30% of multiple-birth parents do not have savings before the
birth, so if they cannot afford to buy that sort of equipment they are
less likely to be able, for example, to get out of the
house.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000577">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Some
20% of multiple-birth mothers suffer from post-natal depression,
compared with 10% of mothers with single births. The commonest factors
in post-natal depression are tiredness and isolation, which are likely
to be exacerbated if parents cannot afford the equipment they need to
get out of the house. If families cannot afford an additional cot,
there is the danger, once the babies have outgrown sharing a cot, of
parents being forced to have one of them in their own bed, which is a
significant contributory factor in cot death, especially if parents are
tired, exacerbating the already higher risk 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 755<a class="bkMark" name="Column755">&#160;</a>
                           </div>faced by multiple-birth children of early death due
to prematurity and low birth weight. Finally, the costs of meeting the
additional needs of subsequent multiple-birth children will, if not
provided for by extra Sure Start maternity grant money, have to be met
by the family out of the resources for their existing children. That
suggests that the multiples themselves are more likely to be materially
deprived than other children. Logically, their siblings are also likely
to suffer as a result of that relative poverty.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000578">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I am indebted
to the Twins and Multiple Births Association for much of the data that
support my arguments. I know that it has had the opportunity to discuss
its concerns about the impact of the Government’s provisions on
subsequent multiples with the Minister of State, Department for Work
and Pensions, the hon. Member for Thornbury and Yate (Steve Webb). It
explained its proposals for addressing that situation and I understand
that the Minister was interested, sympathetic to what it had to say,
and impressed by the modesty of the cost involved. I very much hope
that the Minister in Committee this evening can offer reassurance that
consideration will be given to extending the Sure Start maternity grant
beyond the first born for subsequent multiple births. I look forward to
hearing her comments.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000579">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I thank the hon. Lady for raising the matter and I
have a great deal of sympathy with the points that she has made. She
has said that such groups of families are rare, but it does not feel
like that to me. My agent’s wife recently gave birth to
triplets, all of whom are doing extremely well. They were his second,
third and fourth daughters, which is wonderful. My twin brothers are
the third and fourth members of our family. Although the hon. Lady
asserts that such family groups are rare, the issue is very real to me,
and I understand the points that she has
made.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000580">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
180 seeks to extend the payment of Sure Start maternity grants to cases
where a subsequent birth is a multiple birth. The restriction of such
grants to the first child was, as the hon. Lady will know, a
deficit-reduction measure that was announced in the emergency Budget
last June, shortly after the general election. It has been in force
since the beginning of April of this year. As she knows, there has been
a great deal of parliamentary debate on the measure, so I do not intend
to repeat our arguments for the policy in the Bill. However, including
so much detail, as in her proposal, in primary legislation is not
appropriate, because primary legislation would be needed to change it.
For that reason, we find it difficult to accept the
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000581">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Government recognise that a multiple birth can be an extremely
expensive time in people’s lives, as is any birth, as all
parents know. It is important that the change to Sure Start maternity
grant eligibility does not force families to use high-cost lenders,
which the hon. Lady discussed extensively in the debate on the previous
group of amendments. We do not want that to happen to facilitate the
purchase of important items related to the babies’ early weeks
and months. That is why we have decided to extend the scope of
budgeting loans, under clause 70, to allow for maternity expenses in a
way that did not happen before. I hope that the hon. Lady agrees that
extending the scope of budgeting loans to include maternity expenses
will be a tangible method of providing some of the support, which she
has rightly discussed, in those important early months.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000582">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="hs_ParaIndent">I
understand the hon. Lady’s point about families who experience
multiple births in their second or subsequent births. There will be
extra costs, and having the ability to look to budgeting loans to
provide some way of smoothing those costs really tries to address the
point that she has raised. She will obviously also be aware of the many
other ways in which we are trying to ensure that much-needed additional
support for early years is extended to families, such as through the
work of my hon. Friends in the Department for Education. The Department
of Health is providing support for health visitors. There is also the
commitment to extend nursery care to disadvantaged two-year-olds. Those
measures show the Government’s credentials and real commitment
towards early years. That, coupled with the changes that I discussed
under clause 70, will mean tangible support for the sorts of families
that she is talking
about.</p>

know whether the arrangements that the Minister was discussing under
clause 70 will be equivalent to or more than what a grant would be. I
am probably one of the few people here with experience of this, because
my third pregnancy was a multiple birth, and I can assure the Committee
that the cost does not just double; it probably quadruples, because
equipment and things have to be provided that would not be needed for
another single baby, such as play pens. I wonder whether the amount of
money available in clause 70 to families that have limited incomes will
cover the actual cost, because it is real, not
imaginary.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000583">&#160;</a>

support that families need and on the right scale. It is difficult to

we were discussing a rare situation. The Minister, the
Minister’s agent and my hon. Friend the Member for Sunderland
Central, in a sample of about 25 people in this room, have all been
able to come up straight away with examples of exactly this situation.
<em>[Interruption.] </em>It appears that the hon. Member for Dover can
offer a further example, and there are other offers all around the
room. It is becoming something of a bidding war, and it is quite clear
that my opening premise was perhaps a little ill
founded.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000586">&#160;</a>

welcome the Minister’s recognition of the underlying concern
about the additional financial cost, leaving aside the operational
burdens that she highlighted in containing the children, as she put it.
I absolutely accept the point that she makes about the detail that
appears in the amendment. That is always a difficulty in

coming from. Of course, we recognise that the Government are taking a
number of steps to support young families, and as the Minister has
reiterated this evening, families with the needs that arise when coping
with multiple births will be part of the Government’s ongoing
thinking about how best to provide such
support.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000587">&#160;</a>

am not absolutely convinced that all that need can be well met by
budgeting loans, because they will be extra items of expenditure that
families will obviously have to repay through the medium of payments on
account. Obviously, such families will always have more expenditure;
they will always be looking after more children, so their means will
always be
stretched.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000588">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I apologise for rising again so rapidly,
particularly as I am about to raise another issue that relates to all
the clauses on the social fund that we have been debating this evening.
It has come up briefly once or twice in relation not just to the way in
which people might be helped to apply for financial assistance from the
local authority that will administer the replacement for the community
care grant and crisis loan in future, but to the way in which such
support might be operated and distributed.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000593">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The Minister
mentioned a system operated by Age UK in Camden, which helped people to
access goods from Argos. It is in that sort of territory that I should
like to invite the Minister to consider how some of these models might
be taken a little further to ensure that good value for money is
secured in devolving funding out to local authorities so that we can
get the best value for the public purse and also maximise the
availability of financial support to hard-pressed
individuals.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000594">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">One
of the major concerns about the current community care grants is that
they are often insufficient to enable people to buy good quality goods.
Tales abound of customers being able to afford only shoddy washing
machines that require frequent repairs and so incur further costs. The
previous Labour Government sought to address that in the Welfare Reform
Act 2009 by enabling some grants to be provided in the form of goods
and services by entering into centralised contracts with major
suppliers with the aim of getting customers a better deal than was
currently available. By using central purchasing they could offer them
a choice of high quality goods which would have product guarantees

                           </div>and, importantly, would not be identifiable as being from the social
fund. It was estimated by the National Audit Office that there could
have been savings amounting to between £15 million and
£23 million a year, which included, interestingly, savings made
from an expected reduction in
fraud.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000595">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
am aware of the balance that needs to be struck between getting best
value for the taxpayer and ensuring that the best quality goods and
services can be provided to people in financial need on the one hand
and the importance of protecting people’s autonomy and choice in
the way in which they spend money on the goods and services that they
need on the other. None of us would want to get into a position where
we humiliate and stigmatise people who are in dire need by forcing
them, as my hon. Friend the Member for Westminster North pointed out
earlier, to put up with shoddy second-hand goods that are handed to
them with the comment, “That’s good enough for
you.”<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000596">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It
is quite clear that there are other ways of developing effective
purchasing arrangements which can ensure that a range of goods is on
offer to somebody who is in need of community care grant-type financial
support and which can ensure that in going out to spend their money,
they spend it cost effectively. We are aware that a number of
organisations, including in the voluntary sector, have begun to explore
how it is possible to arrange some of these bulk purchasing
arrangements and to remove the stigma that can result from an apparent
take-it-or-leave-it approach to providing the goods that people
need.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000597">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Are any
continuing discussions under way to help local authorities look at how
they maximise, not just within the local authority but across local
authorities, the possibility of centralising purchasing arrangements
and pooling resources, which I think the Minister mentioned earlier
this evening? What learning and conversations may be drawn from
organisations in the voluntary sector who already operate
non-stigmatised central purchasing arrangements? Will the Department
itself be prepared to support and promote such discussions on the
development of such schemes possibly at a regional level, bringing
local authorities together with a view to maximising the effectiveness
of the scheme and cost-effectiveness for the
taxpayer?<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000598">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Clause 72 repeals sections 16 to 21 of the Welfare
Reform Act 2009. That obviously was not the issue that the hon. Member
for Stretford and Urmston was drawing to the Committee’s
attention. However, it is worth ensuring that hon. Members are aware of
the full intentions behind this clause because those sections would
enable loans to be made by external lenders in place of the social
fund, and would provide for awards of community care grants as a matter
of course to be for goods or services, rather than for cash. Those
provisions have not been brought into force and, given our intentions
to abolish the discretionary social fund through clause 69,
the Government do not intend to use them, hence they are referred to in
clause
72.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000599">&#160;</a>

on the previous set of amendments, we recognise how important an
interest-free facility is at a time of particular need to people on
benefits, who might otherwise have to turn to some of the loan sharks
that we have been talking about. We are demonstrating our commitment to
addressing that issue by taking the powers in clause 98 to
modernise and simplify the current approach of the national loan
systems by moving to payments on account, as I have outlined before, as
part of universal

care grants and crisis loans are being abolished by clause 69 and, from
April 2013 at the earliest, new and locally administered provision will
be targeted, as we have mentioned, and will offer better value for

point made by the hon. Lady was important: how we can use
the opportunity to promote innovation in the way that local authorities
approach the new situation. It is only right that many local
authorities will want to look at the sort of things she has raised,
making sure that they are offering maximum value for money
in their local services, whether through the type of schemes
that operate in my constituency, such as those that recycle
furniture, or through bulk buying and working across local
authorities to achieve bulk buying in areas that might be especially
relevant in a particular geographical location.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000602">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">By working
together, some local authorities will be able to see the maximum
benefit of the opportunities that we are putting into their remit. I am
sure that today’s debate will promote further discussions.
Indeed, the response document to the call for evidence will discuss the
issue in detail. I hope that the hon. Lady will find that a useful way
of advancing the idea and that she will be able to encourage local
authorities to think about it in her own area. I hope that that will
satisfy her that we are looking at the issue in some
detail.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000603">&#160;</a>

carer’s supplement to the pension credit, our constituents have
also had to apply for a carer’s allowance, and demonstrate their
eligibility for it, but then not get it, which has caused them enormous
confusion. The clause simply deals with that anomaly so that they will
no longer have to do that, and I hope it will be welcomed by the

anxious that we are not accused of skimping on our scrutiny of clause
74. I am grateful to the Minister for giving a couple of us an informal
explanation earlier today of what the clause does, but one aspect of it
puzzles me. He explained that the Government’s intention is
simply to apply a capital limit to the new housing credit, which is the
equivalent of housing benefit that will be available to pensioners in
the future. It will not, therefore, change in practice the arrangements
affecting
pensioners.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000612">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">What
I am puzzled about, however, is why the clause does that in a way that
could be used to impose a capital limit or threshold on pension credit
as a whole. There is no such limit at the moment. I think that it has
generally been felt in the past that pensioners should be encouraged,
not discouraged, to save. That is the reason why there is no capital
limit in pension credit, whereas there is elsewhere in the means-tested
system. The wording of the clause could be used to impose such a limit,
so I am anxious that the Minister put on the record his intention that
the Government will not do that. Will he also explain why the capital
limit is imposed in this clause, where it could be used more widely
than I think is the Government’s intention, instead of in the
part of the Bill that introduces housing credit to pension
credit?<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000613">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The right hon. Gentleman is right about what
happens in this part of the Bill. Universal credit will replace housing
benefit for working-age claimants. We intend to introduce a new housing
credit into pension credit, which will provide support for rental costs
for people over the state pension age. There is, as he rightly says,
currently no capital limit for entitlement to the state pension credit.
However, a claimant can only be entitled to housing benefit if they
have capital below a prescribed level, which is currently set at
£16,000. There is an exception to the capital rule, and it
applies where the claimant is also in receipt of the guarantee credit
element of pension credit. In such cases, receipt of the guarantee
credit provides a passport to full support for eligible housing costs,
irrespective of the level of capital
held.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000614">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
have made it clear that our aim is for the existing housing benefit
rules to be broadly carried across to the housing credit element in
pension credit, but the picture is complicated, so it is not quite that
straightforward. We recognise that it will be important for pension
credit to continue to operate in a way that is clear to both customers
and staff once housing credit has been incorporated. We want the power
to introduce a capital limit that can be exercised in respect of one or
all of the elements of pension credit, allowing for the possibility of
simplification through the alignment of the rules. I will be frank.
There are ways of doing that. One could establish a much higher capital
limit that applied across the board or apply a limit to the individual
element of housing.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000615">&#160;</a>

this on the record: it is not our intention to apply a capital limit of
the kind that exists for housing benefit—the £16,000
equivalent and the group of people it affects—within pension
credit. We might put in place a system that applies a flat rate to a
much higher level of capital, or we might equally apply a capital limit
to the housing element, but it is not our intention for the measures to
disadvantage people who have a sensible level of savings. It is our
intention to replicate the system that is already there in so far as we
possibly can. Therefore, although I do not rule out an approach that
might end up with an across-the-board limit for a much higher level of
capital than the current level of £16,000 in order to achieve
our objectives, it is not our intention to apply a capital limit of the
kind that we know now to claimants.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000616">&#160;</a>

slightly less reassured than I had hoped to be. What does he mean by
“a much higher level”? What does he regard as a level
that could possibly be introduced to pension credit? What does he mean
by “a sensible level of savings”? Can he assure us that
the Government do not intend, at the moment at least, to introduce any
limit at all outside the housing credit

enable us to replicate the system of capital limits and the elements of
support that are transferring to pension credit, as I explained. We
have not finally decided exactly how to do that. One issue is clearly
that all the elements get wrapped up into one single payment. When I
said “much higher”, I meant very substantially higher.
One approach could be to establish a single, much higher limit, rather
than an individual limit to an individual element of pension

                        <p class="tabbed">It is not our
intention to disadvantage anybody who is currently in the pension
credit mix by applying a capital limit of the kind that exists in
housing benefit that would affect the vast majority of claimants. I can
conceive of us applying a limit that would affect a small minority at
the top end in order to achieve an overall flat rate across the whole
pension credit audience, but no decision has yet been taken on whether
it is appropriate to introduce a capital cut-off limit of that kind for
the whole of pension
credit.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000619">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
cannot give the right hon. Gentleman an absolute indication of what an
appropriate level might be, but when I say “very substantially
higher”, I mean “very substantially higher”. It is
merely a question of identifying the best way of making the changes
work. This is not a clandestine means of applying a £16,000
limit to all pension credit recipients.<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000620">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I am grateful to the Minister. By the way he is
speaking, I think he recognises that it could be quite a major, and
potentially controversial, change. Will the regulations that would
introduce such a change be subject to an affirmative
procedure?<a class="bkMark" name="11050437000621">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I am happy to address that question when I come
back with the changes I have committed to make on Report. I think that
a number of the measures in the Bill should have an initial affirmative
