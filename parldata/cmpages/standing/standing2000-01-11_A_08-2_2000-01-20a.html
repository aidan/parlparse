<H5>[continuation from column 296]</H5>
</P>
<P>
<H5>8.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
On resuming—
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I was in the closing stages of a long disposition.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> You were enjoying it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> The Financial Secretary says that I was enjoying it. There were moments when I was enjoying it, but I shall resist the temptation to be self-indulgent. Instead, I shall close my remarks by saying that I do not think that the Committee can have been very impressed by the strength of the Economic Secretary's argument, and hope that we may proceed rapidly to some accommodation on these difficult matters.
<P>
<B>Mr. Alan Williams:</B> I shall speak briefly on new clauses 8 to 25. We shall not move new clause 8 because although the body to which it refers was set up, the scheme to administer it was not, so it is effectively defunct. Therefore, we are now considering new clauses 9 to 25.
<P>
Most hon. Members probably understand this, but I should explain that the amendments have been tabled to deal with non-departmental public bodies because Ministers have told us, time and time again, that each should be considered on its merits. We want to create an opportunity for that to take place. The problem for the Public Accounts Committee and for this Committee is that, to our knowledge, no one has ever spelled out the reasons why the remaining bodies covered by the new clauses have been excluded from full coverage by the Comptroller and Auditor General. We are trying to establish what the reasoning is, so that although we recognise that there might not be a meeting of minds on whether anything should be done, at least we shall understand the Government's thinking—not only the thinking of this Government but that of previous Governments as well—which has never been satisfactorily explained.
<P>
The amendments are in a standard form, and in each case we propose that there should be full access and involvement by the National Audit Office. Having explained our objectives, it would be most expeditious if, in relation to new clauses 9 to 25, the Economic Secretary would give the Committee a synopsis of the reasoning behind the Government's refusal to allow PAC wants in relation to those particular bodies.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I suggest that hon. Members relax for a few moments while I take the Committee through the bodies, one by one, as I promised my right hon. Friend I would. However, although I am happy to try to explain why the present Government take certain views about individual bodies, I cannot possibly explain why the previous Government took the view that they did.
<P>
New clause 9 affects the British Potato Council, a levy-funded body, which has received no, or very little, central funding. It seeks to promote potato marketing, so it would be useful for such a body to have commercially minded auditors. The estimate of central funding is something in the order of £37,000 and expenditure is about £6.7 million. The custom and practice is that private sector auditors have been appointed following competitive tender.
<P>
It seems that new clause 9 also deals with the Horticultural Development Council—I hope that is right—the purpose of which is to promote and undertake research on behalf of the industry, excluding apple, pear and hop growers. It is also a levy-funded body. It seeks to promote research and its central funding is some £37,000. Again, by custom and practice, private sector auditors have been appointed following competitive tender.
<P>
The Milk Development Council is also levy-funded. It promotes scientific research. Its expenditure is £6.1 million and its central funding is £16,000. Again, by custom and practice, private sector auditors are appointed following competitive tender.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Davis:</B> Will the Economic Secretary say whether she thinks that the situation that she is describing, in which all bodies are privately audited, will or should change?
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> As I go through the different bodies, in some cases—although not in the cases that I have just mentioned—it will become obvious that, for one reason or another, it is not possible for the Comptroller and Auditor General to be appointed. In those other cases, there are no particular reasons except the ones that I have given why, by custom and practice, audit is carried out by private tender, but those organisations use extremely small amounts of central Government money.
<P>
Moving on to the Historic Buildings and Monuments Commission for England, to which new clause 10 relates, that body receives Government funding of £102 million. Its auditor must be either a member of the body of accountants recognised by the Companies Act 1948 or a member of the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy. We assume that the prevailing climate of the early 1980s argued for activities such as external audits to be put into the private sector wherever possible on the grounds of achieving the best value for money. Those audit arrangements have been in place from that time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> Will the Economic Secretary give way?
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I should like to finish what I am saying and then I shall answer the hon. Gentleman's question.
<P>
The National Audit Office recently declined to tender for the audit of that particular body and PricewaterhouseCoopers was recently appointed for five years.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I am grateful for the Economic Secretary's last comment, but will she acknowledge that the Comptroller and Auditor General is a member of CIPFA?
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I am sure the Comptroller and Auditor General is a member of CIPFA. I was not saying that he was not eligible in that particular case.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> Given that there does not seem to be any legal reason why the Comptroller and Auditor General should not be appointed in this case, what reason does the Economic Secretary give for not setting in statute that, from now on, the Comptroller and Auditor General will be appointed.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> Clearly, it would be a difficult and lengthy business if we were to deal with individual bodies by statute. In the case that I have just mentioned the NAO could have tendered. My understanding is that it did not choose to tender for the audit of that body. I cannot comment further.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> The hon. Lady says that it would be a long and difficult process. However, in this case, would it not be simple to accept the new clause?
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> In fact, there is already an auditor, who has been appointed for five years.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I may sound ironic but I am trying to be helpful. If the real problem is that auditors have already been appointed and, as the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs says from a sedentary position, those auditors have rolling contracts, I am sure that the chairman of the PAC would accept some revision, through a revised amendment, to allow existing auditors to end their contracts. No one is trying to undo the rights of existing auditors.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I have indicated that we are happy to enter on-going discussions about individual NDPBs as well as to consider the general situation. I am looking at the Chair of the Public Accounts Committee in particular.
<P>
<B>Mr. Williams:</B> Can my hon. Friend see the paradox in our having been told until now that the provisions were not acceptable because of the smallness of the public contribution, whereas in the present case they cannot be accepted despite the public contribution being so large—£105 million, or 80 per cent. of the funding of the organisation?
<P>
The second inconsistency is that the same Department is responsible for the occupied royal palaces, which are subject to NAO audit.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> The sum is £102 million—but that is neither here nor there; I say it just for the correctness of the record. I am not arguing, and never have, that because the relevant sum is sizeable the provision would not be appropriate. However, in the present case the system is clearly working. The NAO has not tendered for the audit. It could have, and I do not know why it did not.
<P>
Government funding with respect to English Partnerships is of the order of £28 million. Statute does not allow—I cannot comment on why—the Comptroller and Auditor General to be the auditor for that body, which operates in a commercial environment, with central and local government and now, indeed, with the regional development agencies.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> The Economic Secretary says that she cannot comment on the statutory provision. Has she a view on whether it is sensible to leave matters as they are, so that the NAO cannot audit English Partnerships?
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I have said that I am happy to continue discussion of the issue, or the way it affects one or more body. However, it does not seem sensible for us to try tonight to resolve a question about the audit conditions for one body.
<P>
The Environment Agency was set up in 1996 to protect and improve the environment in England and Wales. It spends £98 million of Government funds. Again, statute prevents the Comptroller and Auditor General from being its auditor. There is not a very strong logical case for private auditors, but the arrangements have worked perfectly satisfactorily and I cannot comment on the thinking of the previous Government who made those arrangements.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> The Government seem to be agreeing with new clauses 11 and 12, on English Partnerships and the Environment Agency. It is odd, since they have been on the amendment paper for weeks, and civil servants have been able to prepare a brief for the Economic Secretary, explaining that there is no reason for those bodies not to be audited by the National Audit Office, that the Government will not accept them. What is the reason?
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> The Government do not view it as sensible to tackle the issue piecemeal. We have taken that approach when we have encountered suitable instances for the first time and the opportunity has arisen to appoint NDPB auditors from scratch, as it were. In those cases we have always made the Comptroller and Auditor General the auditor. I appreciate that my right hon. Friend the Member for Swansea, West has tabled the measures as a selection, but as we all know, it is just a selection of many and varied NDPBs. It does not make sense, even in principle, to make the changes in the way suggested. However, I am happy to discuss with Committee members the auditing arrangements for some or all of the bodies concerned.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Williams:</B> That presents another quandary. We are now told that matters must not be dealt with piecemeal. We had a long debate on new clause 1 in which we were told that they could not be dealt with collectively either. I accept my hon. Friend's good will in offering to discuss matters with us, but the Treasury's position seems to alter from amendment to amendment, in whatever way is convenient to justify opposing the amendment.
<P>
<H5>8.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I fear that my right hon. Friend is being uncharitable.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Will the Economic Secretary give way?
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> No, I will not give way. I will respond to my right hon. Friend on this matter. He suggests that we do not want to tackle the issue in the round, but that is exactly what we have said we do want. I have repeatedly said that the issue is one of considerable breadth and complexity—too much to be dealt with by the amendments and new clauses. I appreciate that the examples are interesting and that they contribute to the debate by providing a flavour of the range of contexts to which NDGBs are relevant—and I am sure that that is why my right hon. Friend chose them. None the less, by trying to deal with each case one by one in Committee, we would probably only create difficulties—and possibly even further anomalies.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davis:</B> I do not want to make the Economic Secretary's task more difficult than it is, but I wish that she would show me the eye of the needle with respect to the arrangements that she has described. She has said that the matters should be dealt with not piecemeal but en bloc, but also that, although primarily legislation will be required, it is not appropriate to make the changes by way of the Bill. I have three times offered her the opportunity to tell us that the Government are willing to undertake primary legislation, but she has each time refused that fence, as it were. How on earth are we to make progress? Not piecemeal, not collectively; not in the Bill, not in a future Bill. Where is the eye of the needle through which we can go to meet the Minister on this matter?
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will take up the offer of dialogue about the issues. Primary legislation is not, as I understand it, required to alter the arrangement for some of the bodies concerned. Of course, audit arrangements are in full flow, and in some cases where the work has been put out to tender in the private sector, it may be difficult for the Government to intervene.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> Will the Economic Secretary give way?
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I would like to move on to the next matter. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will shortly find a way to make his point.
<P>
The role of Food from Britain is to develop and promote the marketing of British food and drink abroad and within the United Kingdom. It spends £6 million of Government money. The Comptroller and Auditor General is not a qualified accountant as set out in the Agricultural Marketing Act 1983. Good service has been given by private auditors. Again, I cannot comment in any detail on the Act.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davis:</B> This is very similar to what was said with reference to another of the new clauses and relates to restriction of the Companies Acts. The Chief Secretary to the Treasury said to the Public Accounts Committee that he was willing to examine the question of amending the legislation to enable the Comptroller and Auditor General to audit those limited companies within the Government's purview. We would probably pick up this issue at the same time, if we were to do that.
<P>
When the Minister comes to discuss companies and bodies restricted by the Companies Acts or by associated legislation, will she tell us what she thinks that we should do if we were to lift that limitation, as we have an agreement from the Chief Secretary to look at the matter, and we pass companies legislation very frequently?
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> We are dealing here not with the Companies Acts, but with a specific piece of legislation. The assurances that my right hon. Friend gave to the right hon. Gentleman still stand, as much now as they did when my right hon. Friend uttered them.
<P>
New clause 14 concerns the Football Licensing Authority, which operates a football licensing scheme under the provisions of the Football Spectators Act 1989, and reviews the discharge of local authority functions under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 in relation to football grounds. It receives Government funding of £1 million. The auditor has to be a member either of the body of accountants recognised by the Companies Act 1948, or of CIPFA. I assume that the climate prevailing in the early 1980s argued for activities such as external audits to be put into the private sector whenever possible. There is no logical argument for private sector auditing in this case.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davis:</B> May I correct the Minister? She has said twice that she assumed that the climate in the early 1980s had influenced certain decisions with respect to companies. I mentioned earlier that the hon. Member for Ashton-under-Lyne (Mr. Sheldon) had made it clear what happened in 1983. The National Audit Act 1983 was the last piece of legislation to go through before the general election and, as a result, this was one of the compromises that was not completed. That is why the issue was not dealt with at that time.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for reminding me about that. I remember my hon. Friend the Member for Ashton-under-Lyne mentioning it on Second Reading.
<P>
New clause 15 relates to the Gas Consumers Council, which has a remit to look after the interests of the 19 million gas users in the United Kingdom, and it receives £3 million of Government funding to do so. It is audited by private sector auditors and, again, the logical case for that is not strong.
<P>
New clause 16 concerns the British Hallmarking Council, which oversees the operations of the Assay Offices and advises the Government on the operation of the Hallmarking Act 1973. It receives no direct funding from the Department, but is funded by a levy from the Assay Offices. Its expenditure was £27,000 in 1998-99. It is audited by private sector auditors, and there is no reason for us to resist the notion that the Comptroller and Auditor General would be a respectable auditor for this body.
<P>
New clause 17 covers the Home-Grown Cereals Authority. The authority's purpose is to improve the production and marketing of United Kingdom cereals and oilseeds. It is a levy-funded body that receives no central funding. The Comptroller and Auditor General is not, in this case, a ``qualified accountant'' as defined in part III, 21(5)(b) of the Cereals Marketing Act 1965.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> In the case of levy-funded bodies—some of which I have been involved with in the horticultural industry—although the levy is compulsory, they normally have members who participate. I wonder whether they have the equivalent of annual general meetings, at which the appointment of auditors can be raised and confirmed by the members, or whether that rests in the hands of the executives of those bodies. There is a difference between a levy-funded body that receives little from the Government and is controlled by its members, and a body that receives huge amounts of Government money.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman's recognition of the various differences in these cases. However, I cannot help him with information about the annual general meeting arrangements.
<P>
New clause 18 concerns housing action trusts. Their role is to promote the sustainable regeneration of former council estates and their communities by building new homes and refurbishing existing ones. I believe that there are now five such trusts in the United Kingdom. They receive £85 million in Government funding. The statute does not allow the Comptroller and Auditor General to be the auditor for those bodies. They are subject to substantial commercial pressures and it is, therefore, quite appropriate for them to have commercially minded auditors.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> I am sorry to interrupt the Minister's flow. My point relates to the question raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs about the reappointment of auditors of those non-departmental public bodies that do not have the Comptroller and Auditor General as their auditor. I draw the Minister's attention to remarks made by the Chief Secretary, who said in response to a question on this point:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``They come up regularly for reappointment. I do not know whether that is on an annual basis. I suspect that it is not on an annual basis in every case.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He then went on to say that he would look into the matter.
<P>
In the light of the Chief Secretary's comments, and of the questions put by Opposition Members in Committee, will the Minister consider tabling a list of all non-departmental public bodies that do not yet have the Comptroller and Auditor General as their auditor, detailing when their current auditors are due for reappointment? In those circumstances, we would have the basis for the discussion that she offered earlier in reply to the hon. Member for Swansea, West.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> It would be difficult to do as the hon. Gentleman suggests. The right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden said earlier how difficult it was to track down all such public bodies, and to make sure that every Department had produced details of them all. It would also be difficult to track down their current audit arrangements.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davis:</B> We would be happy to provide a list of the ones about which we are concerned. However, that is not why I rose.
<P>
The Minister mentioned housing action trusts. The last item that we come to will be the Housing Corporation, on which we have very strong views. Social housing is an area of serious concern. It embodies a serious social policy objective and the question of regularity must, therefore, come to the fore. That is the first good reason why the Comptroller and Auditor General should at least have rights of direction over any auditor going into such a body.
<P>
The second is that we know from experience in councils and, nowadays, in housing associations, that there are problems of fraud. Individual power can be very great in these circumstances. On those two counts alone, there are good reasons for the housing action trusts to be brought—legislatively, as the Minister mentioned— within the remit of the Comptroller and Auditor General.
<P>
Finally, the Minister said that, because the trusts operated in a commercial area, it was worth their having commercially minded auditors. That is an interesting elision, but a complete non-sequitur. I have yet to hear an argument that the audit techniques used by the Comptroller and Auditor General are not every bit as good as those of any commercial auditor. Indeed, to judge by the evidence that we gave earlier in the debate, they are rather better.
<P>

<br>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I note what the right hon. Gentleman has said on that point.
<P>
New clause 19 covers the Engineering Construction Industry Training Board, which receives no grant aid from the Government. It spends about £230,000 of Government expenditure out of a total income of £14.7 million. It is a levy-funded body, funded from a training levy on employers in the industry covered by the board. The levy, which is subject to annual parliamentary approval, raises £10 to £11 million a year. Commercial auditors have been appointed by the board.
<P>
The Construction Industry Training Board, which also receives no grant aid, is funded from a training levy on the employers in the industry covered by the board, which is subject to annual parliamentary approval and raises about £70 millions to £80 million a year. Commercial auditors are appointed by the board.
<P>
<H5>9 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
New clause 20 covers the Meat and Livestock Commission, which we touched on earlier. Its job is to promote greater efficiency in the livestock and livestock products industries. It is levy funded, and receives about £284,000 in Government funding out of an expenditure of £57.6 million. In this case, the Comptroller and Auditor General is not a qualified accountant as defined in section 19(3) of the Agriculture Act 1967.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I am trying to spare the Committee the repetition of these phrases. We understand that many of these bodies do not allow the Comptroller and Auditor General to be their auditor because he is not qualified. However, the fundamental principle of legislation is that the later amends the earlier, and if we pass any of these amendments that would be irrelevant; it would be invalidated by the amendments. There does not seem to be any argument.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I am not sure that the amendments address that point. However, I am going through these points one by one because I received information from my right hon. Friend the Member for Swansea, West that he would like me to do so. There is no point in mentioning only half the points.
<P>
New clause 21 relates to the museum of London, the role of which is to collect and display the social history of London from prehistoric times to the present. It receives about £4 million in Government funding. This is another example of there not being a strong case for private sector auditors. The present auditors are PricewaterhouseCoopers. There is no such requirement in either the legislation or its financial memorandum—the latter requires that the museum's accounts be audited by a body approved by the board of governors and that the appointment of auditors be subject to periodic competitive tendering exercises. That seems reasonable.
<P>
New clause 22 relates to the Oil and Pipelines Agency, which is funded not by a grant in aid but by a transfer of funds from the Government pipelines storage system account of £1.6 million. The agency spends £51,000 out of a £1.5 million expenditure. Again, the case is not especially strong for there to be private auditors; the work is carried out at present by KPMG, which successfully tendered for the contract. The Oil and Pipelines Act 1985 requires the Secretary of State for Defence to appoint the auditors in this case.
<P>
New clause 23 concerns the Policyholders Protection Board, a statutory body set up under the Policyholders Protection Act 1975 to administer a scheme for compensating policyholders in cases in which their insurance companies get into financial difficulties. The board receives no public funding, and is funded entirely by the insurance industry, in which statutory powers enable a levy to be raised on insurers. It will cease to exist after the Financial Services and Markets Bill receives Royal Assent and the Policyholders Protection Board legislation is repealed.
<P>
New clause 24 concerns the Sea Fish Industry Authority, which promotes the efficiency of the sea fishing industry. It is levy funded and the Comptroller and Auditor General is not a qualified accountant as defined in section (11)(6) of the Fisheries Act 1981. The Comptroller and Auditor General already has access rights to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food self accounting executive NDPBs, and that arrangement has always worked well in this case.
<P>
New clause 25 relates to the Housing Corporation, which the right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden mentioned. That organisation funds and promotes the proper performance of registered social landlords. It receives £910 million of Government money, but statute does not allow the Comptroller and Auditor General to be its auditor. It is a commercially focused organisation. Private sector auditors provide an efficient service that is working well.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Davis:</B> I am afraid that I need to correct a point of fact. A study that the National Audit Office started but did not finish arose from a negotiated access to a housing association that took months to complete. It is now apparent why it took so long to negotiate, and the matter is before the courts as a serious case of fraud. As a result, the NAO's investigation is suspended because it would be improper to publish its findings.
<P>
The study was undertaken in part because of a recognised weakness in the Housing Corporation's control system and follow-up procedures. Far from being a well established, commercially effective operation, it is just the opposite. Like Camelot, it squawked a great deal when I raised the issue of its being audited. When organisations do that, I think that there is more to examine than they claim. The Economic Secretary must take note that what she told the Committee is not sustainable on the basis of information of which the Treasury must be aware.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> All I can say is that I am using the information that is available to me. Obviously, the Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, the right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden, is aware of the detail of issues in the arena in which he works. I am grateful to him for his remarks.
<P>
That concludes my run-through of the bodies that would be covered by the new clauses. It is worth reiterating that the Government are happy to have a continuing discussion with hon. Members, especially those who sit on the PAC, about the issues, many of which will require considerable debate. We have a good track record on NDPBs I hope that the right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden accepts that, on our appointment of the Comptroller and Auditor General to audit NDPBs, we have a 100 per cent. track record when choice and flexibility have readily existed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Alan Williams:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that explanation, which we will consider between now and Report. The fact that something is statute-barred does not explain why it was statute-barred in the first place. One enactment can repeal another. There is no bar to those bodies being covered by the Bill. However, we appreciate that she has done what we requested. I have no intention of forcing the amendment to a vote because the PAC and the National Audit Office will want to discuss whether we should revisit the issues on Report. I thank her for the information that she has provided.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> I take on board what has just been said and would like to comment on the tenor of the debate. The Government have a right to feel peeved. As the Economic Secretary said, they have a strong track record. Moreover, her evidence and that of the Chief Secretary to the PAC made it clear that the Government are sympathetic towards the issue. We should welcome that and take it in good faith. Although my party has not been in power for a while, the Conservative party has been in government. Many of the problems that the Economic Secretary quoted were caused by the Conservative Government, and she is right to feel peeved about that. I understand why she is shutting up shop and does not want to be conciliatory now. However, it cannot have escaped her attention that tonight's debate is a Westminster farce. There are 30 or so adults in the Room—
<P>
<B>Mr. Allen:</B> I would not say so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> The Whip can speak for himself.
<P>
This is a farce because nearly everyone in the Room—not just politicians—agrees that we should give institutional jurisdiction to the NAO for auditing the bodies. I am delighted that the Economic Secretary has not mounted a defence against that argument because it will make our job easier in another place or elsewhere. She has been—
<P>
<B>Mr. Keith Simpson </B>(Mid-Norfolk): Courageous.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> Yes, courageous. I am grateful to the Conservative Whip for that prompt.
<P>
I hope that the nature of our discussions has got through to the Economic Secretary. Those who read Hansard may pick up the farcical quality of our debate, but if they do not, because nods, winks and smiles are not recorded, they should realise that most of us think that a simple course is open to the Government, and it is one that they want to take.
<P>
In conclusion—I am grateful to you, Mr. Butterfill, for allowing me to make some general remarks—the Government can, as the Chairman of the PAC said, take the easy or hard route. I am not threatening the Government—I am in no position to do so—but I can envisage, as the hon. Member for West Dorset said, the other place passing similar amendments. I predict that members of the other place will stick to their guns because the issues and arguments are dear to their hearts. Many members of the other place have served in the House of Commons. Parliamentary accountability and scrutiny of financial matters are imprinted on their hearts.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that there is a delicious but, alas, implausible prospect of the Government using the Parliament Acts to defeat Parliament by overruling the other place when it agrees with Members of Parliament on this matter? It is not a realistic prospect; although we are not in a position to threaten the Government, in this case it will be a political necessity for them to do something about it. We hope that that will guide the Government in making real the discussions that they have so kindly offered.

<P>

<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman, who has anticipated what I am about to say. If the other place sticks to its guns, as I believe it will, we shall get into the usual ping-pong. That follows from a private discussion that I had with the hon. Gentleman outside the House. Bills such as this one, and changes that the Government want to make, go completely unnoticed by the press and the outside world and may have no political impact whatever. However, when a measure is ping-ponging between the House of Lords and the House of Commons, with amendments going back and forth, it will be noticed. It will start off on page 6 and then get on to page 1. Do the Government really want the Bill, which has cross-party support, and on which we are in agreement, to become such an issue?
<P>
<H5>9.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Government may believe that that will not happen; they believe that it is fanciful to say that there will be any ping-pong and that the Bill will get on to the front page of the broadsheets, but they should be more cautious and less complacent. They should wonder whether they are storing up unnecessary political trouble for themselves. I believe that the Government's heart and mind are in the right place on the matter; they want the improvements that we are arguing about.
<P>
I am delighted that you have not called me to order, Mr. Buttterfill, as I have not actually spoken about the new clauses. My comments are geared to back up the more technical speeches from other members of the Committee who have argued for the clauses in a way in which I am not capable. It is in the Government's interests to accept those arguments and their approach.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> We are reaching the end of our deliberations and I hope that this is an appropriate moment to thank you, Mr. Butterfill—[Hon. Members: ``It is a bit premature.''] If hon. Gentlemen want a longer debate I am happy to go on for a considerable time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> May I start by saying something that I sought to raise in an intervention? The Economic Secretary said that she was sure that I would find a way to say it later.
<P>
On whether the matter can be handled in a collective full swoop, or dealt with piecemeal, the Minister said earlier that she did not think that it could be dealt with collectively now, but that she would like to deal with it collectively in general, which is why she wanted further discussions. Tonight, she reiterated that she does not think that the matter can be dealt with piecemeal by individual amendments. However, that is not entirely consistent with her point of view, which seems to be—
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> May I intervene on the hon. Gentleman to point out that I did not say that I wanted the matter dealt with piecemeal, or whatever was the expression that he attributed to me. I felt that it needed to be considered and discussed in its breadth and complexity. That is what I said. Earlier, the hon. Gentleman attributed some remarks to me that I do not think that I made, and which I therefore dispute. I want to ensure that the hon. Gentleman does not draw too heavily on the exact form of words and that he is not attributing some further nuance to what I said, which is not the nuance that I expressed in the words that I used.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> I hope that that the Economic Secretary is agreeing with the point I am about to make about the logic of her position in saying that there are, or may be, some reasons why particular bodies cannot follow the general rule that they will be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General. She said that there are some reasons why some bodies cannot be handled in that way. If that is true, the only way in which we can deal with the matter is piecemeal, body by body, considering each one to decide whether, for a particular reason, it cannot be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General. If the Economic Secretary is saying that we must deal with the matter on a one-by-one basis, I am delighted, because it greatly strengthens the case for the amendments.
<P>
Although I welcome the prospect of discussions between the Public Accounts Committee and the Government, like other hon. Members I hope that the Economic Secretary will recognise that these discussions, if we are to have them, must take place soon. If they do not, we will lose the one slot that we have. People have mentioned time and again that it may be the last slot for the next 20 or 30 years unless discussions take place in such a short time that we are still able to make any amendments necessary, as a result of that discussion, before the Bill is enacted. It is not a matter of saying that the discussions could be used by the Government to put off the whole thing in order to ensure that none of it gets on to the statute book. If the Government choose to use the discussion to put a brake on the matter, almost to filibuster the proposal, there will be much anger on the Opposition Benches and in Parliament generally that they are not making serious attempts to ensure that the present anomalies in what the Comptroller and Auditor General can and cannot audit are cleared up. It is important that the Government take on board the need for rapid progress in the discussions.
<P>
Earlier, when I challenged the Economic Secretary to say which of the various bodies had a reason not to be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General, she appeared unwilling, at that stage, to put the bodies in a list of those that could, and could not, be so audited. In her response, the hon. Lady told us that there is no good reason why the Comptroller and Auditor General should not be the auditor for some bodies. I am delighted with that response.
<P>
In response to my intervention, the Economic Secretary said that there were certain categories of body that had a joint reason why they might not be suitable to be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General. The first category was that the sum involved was so small, or that the money was collected via a levy. The Economic Secretary seemed to think that that was a reason why they should not be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General. Some Opposition members of the Committee, and perhaps some Labour Members, doubt whether that is really a good reason for their being excluded from being audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General. I am one who has such doubts.
<P>
A case has already been made for saying that although some bodies may be funded by levy, it is nevertheless money from the public and it is Parliament's job to decide on the amount. It is a good reason for supposing that it is also Parliament's job to ensure that that money is being properly used; how do we know at what level the levy should be set in the following year if we are not sure that the levy set in the previous year was properly used?
<P>
The second category mentioned by the Economic Secretary was when special expertise was needed, usually because it involved a commercially oriented body. Three points have been made in that respect: first, the Comptroller and Auditor General is perfectly entitled to use private sector auditors with particular expertise if that is necessary. Secondly, the people who work for the Comptroller and Auditor General have themselves come through the same training process, and often have the same qualifications, as many in the private sector. Indeed, many who work for the Comptroller and Auditor General have previously worked for the very firms that the hon. Lady is talking about. The same people are able to do the auditing, even those who are directly on the staff of the Comptroller and Auditor General. Thirdly, the Chairman of the PAC made the powerful point that, in practice, it has been found that it is often the private sector auditors who miss fraud, or the failure to look after Government money properly, and that, when the Comptroller and Auditor General has become involved, the fault has been spotted. Therefore, there is little argument to suggest that some special expertise is hidden away in the private sector that is not available to the Comptroller and Auditor General.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davis:</B> The hon. Member for Newbury makes a good point and raises an issue on which our discussions have not touched. We have perhaps too easily accepted the presentations of commercial sector auditors as being of a higher quality. That might have been true 25 years ago when the people who typically populated the NAO were higher executive officers in the civil service, but that is nothing like the situation today. The NAO recruits people with very good degrees from good universities. We find that we have to pay market rates to keep those people, but we still lose them when they reach 30 and have to get them back again when they have made their money, want to do something interesting and come back into the public sector. In my commercial life, I have worked with all sorts of auditors and accountants in two continents. The NAO staff with whom I deal are at least as good as, if not significantly better than, any set of accountants I can think of in the commercial sector.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for backing me up on that point. In practice, when the Economic Secretary went through the list of bodies to which the new clauses relate, she did not list the point about requiring commercial expertise as the prime reason for excluding any of the bodies. In some cases, it constituted a secondary reason, but never the prime reason.
<P>
The third category, which she did not mention in her original response to my intervention but which she made clear this evening, comprises those bodies that statutorily exclude the Comptroller and Auditor General from carrying out their auditing. That was marginally the largest category. I have done a quick count and it seems that about six were excluded because they were too small or funded by levy and about eight were statutorily debarred. There did not seem to be any good reason in the cases of the other bodies, as the Economic Secretary herself recognised.
<P>
Those who fall into the statutory category do so because something in their original set-up provided that the Comptroller and Auditor General could not be used as the auditor, but there is no reason why that should not be changed by a new clause or other amendment to the Bill. It could easily be done. As the hon. Member for West Dorset said earlier, if the Bill provides that the original statutes that created the bodies should be changed, we could handle that problem straight away.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Alan Williams </B>(Swansea, West): Is the hon. Gentleman aware that many of the bodies that the NAO is statutorily barred from auditing are quangos related to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food?
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> That is an interesting point, but one that I need not comment on any further, although it is interesting to speculate why that should be.
<P>
The Economic Secretary mentioned that there might be other categories, although she has not suggested any so far. So the categories are the small and levy-funded bodies—there are good arguments for saying that that is not a valid reason for excluding bodies; the one about needing special expertise, which we have conclusively demolished; and the third one relating to statute, which really is not an argument because we could change that in this Bill. So there no longer seem to be any very good categories into which these bodies could fall. The only one about which any argument remains is that relating to very small bodies. The only possible argument for excluding such a body would be if it could be proved that allowing the Comptroller and Auditor General to carry out the audit would be vastly more expensive than allowing the private sector to carry it out. That could conceivably be a reason why the general principle of public money being audited by the public auditor should be overturned. However, I would challenge the Economic Secretary to prove that the Comptroller and Auditor General would be that much more expensive. It seems to me that it is difficult for the Economic Secretary to make the argument stand up in relation to any of these cases.
<P>
The Economic Secretary's final argument was to ask whether it is sensible to deal with the bodies, one by one in the Bill and not to deal with all of them, and to ask whether we should not perhaps wait until we have captured every single body that is not currently audited and deal with them all at once. If something is wrong in principle with the current set-up, surely we should, if the opportunity arises, mend at least part of it—even if we cannot be sure of mending the whole. If, in the weeks before the Bill is enacted, we overlook in that process a small, obscure body that is not currently audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General, although it could be, I shall be sorry. However, I should still think it better that most of the relevant £3 billion be brought within the ambit of the Comptroller and Auditor General, even if the odd £100 somewhere went missing.
<P>
<H5>9.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I congratulate the Government, as others have, on having so far set up all 19 relevant new bodies with the Comptroller and Auditor General as auditor. Perhaps it is pure chance, but it seems odd that none of those new bodies fell into the categories in question, into which so many other bodies seem to fall. That suggests that an attempt is being made almost to force bodies falsely into those categories, whereas the Government would never have dreamed of putting them there if they had been setting up the organisations from scratch. Since they would never have dreamed of putting them in those categories, I suggest that they now take them out.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I shall be inordinately brief—or perhaps people would say properly brief.
<P>
As I understand matters, the Economic Secretary has offered to discuss the matter in depth with the Public Accounts Committee. I do not know when the Government's business managers intend us to debate the Bill on Report. I hope that it will be possible for the discussions to be conducted in sufficient detail to enable the Government to table their own amendments or to conspire with the PAC to produce some that are acceptable. If that is not feasible before the Bill goes to the other place we shall—in conjunction, I suspect, with our noble Liberal Democrat colleagues—do our utmost to ensure that a comprehensive clause of the sort originally envisaged, along with the other relevant amendments, will be tabled. I am sure that it is not in the Government's interest to achieve the remarkable Coup of making the Bill interesting. It is in their interest—as it is in Parliament's—that the Bill should remain boring and unnoticed. That can be achieved by ensuring that the amendments are made on Report and not sent back and forth between the two Houses.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davis:</B> I want to be moderately quick too. I congratulate my fellow member of the PAC—I shall not condemn him by calling him my right hon. Friend—the right hon. Member for Swansea, West for his brilliance in devising the mechanism that has been used this evening of dealing one by one with a sample of the bodies relevant to the Bill. Alternatively, I curse my own lack of insight for not thinking of that mechanism at the beginning of the proceedings. It has demonstrated in practical terms the weakness of the argument against giving the Comptroller and Auditor General pretty much absolute access. After the Economic Secretary's account of matters, we realise one thing—the need for primary legislation to resolve the problem. That was the one persuasive point that she made. The problem, which I offered the hon. Lady the opportunity to correct all the way through, is that in essence the Government's line is ``Not now'' to primary legislation and when asked ``When?'' effectively to say ``Not ever'', or at least not in legislation in the foreseeable future. I have tried three, now four, times to give the hon. Lady the chance to tell us whether the proposal can be included in prospective legislation.
<P>
What practical solutions are there if we believe, as almost every member of the Committee does, that that would be an intelligent, sensible thing to do in the interests of Parliament and the public and, in the long run, of the Government? As I believe my hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset said, if there are no small scandals, one day there will be a big scandal, and that is not in the Government's interests.
<P>
One possibility would be for the Government to accept the amendments, which are, after all, the latest legislative proposals and would overcome previous legislation. Clearly the Minister does not wish to do that. Perhaps she thinks that they are ill drafted, although she has not said that. If that were so, we could come back on Report. The second possibility would be to table a schedule to the Bill; it would be a simple way to deal with the issue. Problems may arise but I will come back to this because issues have been raised by the Chief Secretary and others.
<P>
Thirdly, we would have to do something about the Companies Acts, but that is in prospect anyway; on that at least we appear to have some understanding with the Government. I compliment them for having an open mind about that because the Chief Secretary gave a serious undertaking which we shall pursue with him. This may be the one item in all the proposals that actually amounts to a modernisation. The Companies Acts and the 1983 Act were drafted in the days of the HEO-type National Audit Office auditor and we are now well beyond that.
<P>
A few things could be done along the way to keep up the Government's record. We have talked about the 19 out of 19: I was first to compliment the Government on that at each stage, and will continue to do so. But they will not get quite 19 out of 19 by the end of the Bill because we shall have lost Partnership UK, which should be within the NAO's reach, not merely because of the huge amount of money going into it—although that is significant—but because of the huge multi-billion pound leverage in pursuit of the public interest.
<P>
There is something else that could be done. The Minister told us that one of the bodies that we discussed will be transmuted into the Financial Services Authority, which is being debated in the House next week. I suspect that the Minister herself will deal with the Report stage of the Financial Services and Markets Bill, so she has the option there and then to ensure that that issue is put right before it goes wrong, and keep the Government's record at 100 per cent.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I hope that my right hon. Friend finds it expedient to note at this point that the Government's appetite for amendments on Report clearly would not preclude even a line-by-line solution to this problem as they have tabled 800 amendments to that Bill on Report.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davis:</B> I often view with some scepticism arguments from Ministers of all parties. They say, ``We can't do this. It's too quick. We can't deal with it. There's not enough drafting capacity'' or whatever. [Interruption.] Well, we may have all parties in due course: we still await the outcome of the Ashdown agreement.
<P>
If there is no prospective legislation—[Interruption.] If the Government Whip wants to intervene I will give way to him. I see that he has risen from his chaise longue again. It appears that there is no prospective legislation and that this is the only Bill available. The Minister did not respond to my offer, which would allow her to deal with her concerns about cases in which it might not be appropriate for the CAG to audit some of the bodies. The offer was to allow the Government the caveat of bringing to the House, to debate and pass by affirmative resolution, their decision for an executive NDPB to be audited by someone other than the CAG.
<P>
The second argument put to us, which has been dropped, is that we could not act so quickly because we needed to consult. However, the Bill does not necessarily bring everything into effect immediately. In fact, the clause allows the Government to bring parts of the Bill into effect by order, about which I shall make a technical point later. That applies even to the requirement for consultation by the Bill, as the matters that we have talked about could be brought in by order after consultation. I have already said that we could have a timetable that comes in after 12 months, and there are various other possibilities. None of the Minister's arguments stands up to a determination to solve the problem, which is what is lacking today.
<P>
Instead, we could summarise the Government's argument in two words: ``Trust us.'' They expect us to trust them to do what is right in all circumstances. Parliaments cannot trust Governments; that is the nature of the relationship between the two. However, let us put aside the difficulties at the beginning of the process, and the fact that the Public Accounts Committee was not properly consulted or responded to for seven months. We have had an apology for that. Let us put aside the fact that we have not had a response about the behaviour of the Treasury. Earlier today, I pointed out that it had vetoed access to training and enterprise councils, even though the Department was on side. The Treasury gave in only under the threat of qualification by the CAG. As my hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset highlighted well, those are examples not necessarily of Ministers but of the machinery of government acting in a manner not in the interests of Parliament, greatest transparency or the British public.
<P>
We have heard three substantive arguments that have not been resolved. The argument about costs simply does not stand up. The CAG uses private sector accountants often, not infrequently. They are properly directed, and required to undertake regularity checks and to meet the standards of the public service. The mechanism of having access without audit leads to duplication. It means that the private sector auditor carries out the audit, and the National Audit Office afterwards looks at something else. Proper audit arrangements would cut duplication, not remove it.
<P>
The last point is vital to the operation of the National Audit Office in terms of its financial audit functions. Financial audit acts as an information-gathering mechanism. It is how the National Audit Office has eyes and ears throughout Whitehall and Government in several interests, as is set out in the National Audit Act 1983. Those interests include propriety, efficiency and economy-effectiveness. That means avoiding waste and getting good management in terms of value for money and of public service delivery, which I should have thought was vital to this Government. The ability to do that job would be enormously improved by having proper, unlimited audit rights throughout the public sector, and not leaving a voluntary loophole or allowing the Permanent Secretary—more often than the Minister—to decide in which areas Parliament will use its eyes and ears. I have not heard answers to those points.
<P>
I shall not press new clause 2, because we have heard so much from the Economic Secretary that we may want to redraft it and return on Report with a slightly different amendment, based on the information that we have gathered—which has been fascinating, and which we wish that we had had on day one. I propose not to press any of the PAC new clauses or amendments to the clause but to reintroduce them on Report. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<B>Mr. David Davis:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 56, in page 10, line 18, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(3A) No order shall be made under this section in respect of sections 5, 6, 7 or 8 until the Committee of Public Accounts—<P>

<P>

<P>

</UL></FONT>
<P>
I hope not to detain the Committee too long. The amendment makes a simple and straightforward point, albeit one that has been a matter of some dispute between the PAC and the Treasury. It relates to the provisions that change the system of Government accounting, and, strictly, to resource accounting. It relates in particular to clauses 5 and 6, which will end appropriation accounts and replace them with resource accounts.
<P>
Members of the PAC and hon. Members who have read our reports will be well aware of how often serious problems accompany the development of new computer systems in Government Departments. The introduction of resource accounting involves far more than merely information technology issues, significant though those are. It is nothing less than a revolution in working, requiring Departments to collect, verify and maintain vast amounts of information to which they paid little attention in the past.
<P>
The PAC believes that the change is right and that the immense effort devoted to the task will pay dividends in better-informed management and decision-making. However, it is a major task, and it does not denigrate the many staff contributing to it to say that we might expect some problems. Members of this Committee will, therefore, not be surprised to learn that the National Audit Office has reported Departments falling well behind the Treasury's timetable of trigger points—stages in the implementation of resource accounts. The PAC's fourth report of 1999--2000, which was published earlier this month, states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``In July 1999, at trigger-point 2, the Treasury told us that all departments remained on track to produce auditable accounts for 1999–2000, although significant challenges remained for some departments. By that time the National Audit Office had carried out an audit of departments' 1998–1999 opening balance sheets and a further review of accounting system and procedures. It found that a significant number of departments were not yet fully prepared and seemed unlikely to meet the target date for producing 1998--1999 ``dry run'' resource accounts This has proved to be the case. By November 1999 Departments were well behind their timetables in meeting the latest trigger-point, which is to produce dry-run resource accounts. We understand that the Comptroller and Auditor General expected 53 ``dry-run'' accounts to be available for audit by mid-August 1999. by the end of October he had received only 22.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Two and a half months after the time when the Comptroller and Auditor General had expected to have dry run accounts for all Departments, he had received 42 per cent.—or fewer than half—of them. That does not reassure me that the Departments will be ready with robust resource accounting systems by the time that the Treasury has planned.
<P>
When the Chief Secretary gave evidence to the Public Accounts Committee on 12 January, he gave a commitment that the period over which the appropriation accounting system and the resource accounting system will run in parallel would be extended should problems with resource accounts continue. That was welcome, but the fact that the Bill still leaves it to the Treasury to decide when to pull the plug on the appropriation accounting system fills me with alarm.
<P>
Amendment No. 56, which is tabled in my name and the names of the right hon. Member for Swansea, West and the hon. Member for Newbury, would prevent the Treasury from switching off appropriation accounts before the Public Accounts Committee had received and reported on evidence about the state of readiness of the new resource accounting system. That is a vital safeguard which would ensure an independent view of whether the system is ready before we commit ourselves irrevocably to it.
<P>
This is not an academic matter. The Treasury will inevitably take a rosy view of the state of its own project. That is no criticism—it is human nature; indeed, we have seen evidence of it already. But the stakes—the Government's ability to keep track of the entire public finances—are far too high to risk moving to a brand new accounting system before that system is ready. I therefore hope that the Minister will see the value of the amendment and either lend her support to it today, or undertake to produce a similar provision on Report.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> Throughout the resource accounting and budgeting project, the Treasury has kept the Public Accounts committee—as well as the Treasury Select Committee and the Select Committee on Procedure—informed of progress through a series of parliamentary memorandums, oral evidence sessions and informal presentations.
<P>
We accepted that the move to resource accounting and budgeting should be subject to the agreement of the Public Accounts Committee and the Treasury Committee. That is why we adopted a trigger-point strategy, which was agreed with the National Audit Office and Parliament, and why we have reported—and will continue to report—to the Committees on the Departments' progress towards full readiness to implement resource accounting and budgeting.
<P>
However, I do not believe that it is appropriate for that process of consultation between the Treasury and the Public Accounts Committee and other Committees to be made the subject of a statutory requirement. The Government have undertaken to provide the Committees with reports on the progress of implementation, which will, of course, also be examined by the Comptroller and Auditor General, and to await their approval before proceeding. Those undertakings should be sufficient evidence of the Government's intention on these matters.
<P>
I would point out that, assuming the final stages of the trigger-point strategy are successfully met, a firm decision to proceed with the introduction of resource-based supply from 2001--02 would have to be taken by July 2000. Realistically, that is the latest point by which a decision can be taken in order to leave sufficient time for the necessary final preparations to be in place.
<P>
We have set up safeguards in the system and given assurances about them and we agree that these matters can proceed only when things are properly prepared. However, we do not regard the amendment as being helpful. I therefore ask the Committee to reject it—or perhaps the right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden would withdraw it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davis:</B> I shall withdraw the amendment for three reasons. First, at this time of night I do not think it will receive the level of thought that it deserves. Secondly, and more importantly, we are waiting on the Chief Secretary to write to the Public Accounts Committee on this matter. I hope that we receive his response before Report. We may want to raise the issue again on Report. I have listened to the Minister and heard her undertakings, but the simple fact remains that the Treasury has been optimistic throughout the process. Of course it wants to make it work: I understand its determination and applaud it in many ways. However, the risk of things going wrong could be disastrous, so I urge that the forces of conservatism be heeded in this case. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davis:</B> New clause 26 is a relatively recent amendment to the Bill. It would allow the Treasury to exclude bodies from the national health service summarised accounts. Interestingly, the National Audit Office was not even aware of it until today, which shows how recently it was tabled. We want to ensure that the Treasury's proposals will not lead to gaps in parliamentary accountability or information. As a safeguard, will the Minister ensure that Treasury orders be subject to the agreement—or, at least, consultation—of the CAG? I hope that the Minister will give us that undertaking today, or we shall have to return to it on Report.
<P>
Other concerns arise out of the loss of summarised accounts, which are the only accounts to provide a whole picture of the finances of the national health service.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> If I may, I should like to help the right hon. Gentleman, who may be intending to speak at length, when I agree with him. Obviously, I cannot foresee exactly what he is going to say—a remarkable talent—but I would be happy to reflect with the National Audit Office on whether further amendments are necessary before Report. I appreciate that that office became aware of our amendment only very recently. We have no intention other than to make the system work well and to ensure that the National Audit Office is content with the legislation—as the Government hope to be.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davis:</B> I am grateful to the Minister, but I have three further points to make. First, this is the only account that gives the whole picture of the finances of the national health service, so it is important to Parliament. Secondly, the resource accounts that the Department of Health excludes are important; we are given only a partial picture. Thirdly, the summarised account provides an opportunity for the CAG to report to Parliament on a number of important issues, one of which came up this week. The CAG picked up the problem of criminal negligence costs of nearly £3 billion. Without that vehicle, there will be no such opportunity. However, we shall have plenty of time between now and Report to discuss the matter properly and shall return to it then. I do not oppose the schedule; I merely wanted to put my comments on the record.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<P>
<B>Mr. Davis:</B> It might help the Committee if I say now that as there are a number of amendments relating to schedule 1, it would be simpler to table them again on Report, rather than deal with them at this time of night. I shall withdraw them.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Butterfill. May I confirm that we are discussing amendments Nos. 58 and 60? To help the hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden, I can tell him that we accept the amendments in principle.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Is the Minister saying that she is happy for the amendments to be made this evening?
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> We fully accept the principle behind the amendments, but we need to ensure that they are in the right form, so we shall return to the matter on Report.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davis:</B> As ever, my first instinct was correct. I shall withdraw the amendments and discuss the matter with the Treasury between now and Report. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

Question proposed, That the Chairman do report the Bill, as amended, to the House.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davis:</B> I should like to take this opportunity Mr. Butterfill, on behalf of the fourth party in this Room, the PAC, to extend my thanks to you and your colleague, Mr. Hood, for your great patience, forbearance and tolerance of our wide wanderings and particularly, this evening, your tolerance of our occasionally fractious proceedings. I thank you for carrying this Bill through so efficiently and effectively.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I echo the comments of my right hon. Friend, Mr. Butterfill. You and your co-Chairman, Mr. Hood, performed a valuable role. This has been a Committee in which we have explored important terrain. Much has been said. Some comments have been less cogent than others, but that is the nature of Committee discussion. I am sure that you will be relieved that you will not have to take the Chair when the matter receives a prolonged ping-ponging between the two Houses That will presumably fall to the Deputy Speakers. I am sure that I speak for the entire Opposition in thanking the Economic Secretary—she may be surprised to hear me say this—for exhibiting considerable patience in what must have been rather adverse circumstances for her.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I add my thanks to you Mr. Butterfill, to your colleague Mr. Hood and to the Economic Secretary. May I also earn some brownie points for future Committees by sitting down now.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I join the thanks that have been offered to you, Mr. Butterfill, and to Mr. Hood. I thank you for your patience, good humour, and even-handedness in chairing our proceedings. At this unexpectedly late hour I should also like to take the opportunity to thank the Clerk, the Hansard staff, the police and the messengers who have supported our efforts so well. My thanks also go to my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary, to our parliamentary private secretaries and to my other hon. Friends on the Committee.
<P>
On behalf of the Labour Members on the Committee I should also like to thank the Conservative and Liberal Democrat Members and even those belonging to the fourth party, the PAC. I am not quite sure where I should put them. I am grateful to them for their learned and thought-provoking contributions, particularly the right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden (Mr. Davis), the Chairman of the PAC, and my right hon. Friend the Member for Swansea, West (Mr. Williams), its most senior member.
<P>
I should also thank the National Audit Office for its excellent briefing. It is seldom that the Government are opposed by so well briefed a team. We have had full and interesting debates on this important matter. I hope that we have done justice to the resource accounting aspects of the Bill as we have certainly tried to do justice to the issues relating to the NAO and the PAC. If any members of the Committee thought that things were going to be dull, I am sure that they will have been disabused of that idea by the passion of some of our debates. Of course, my patience has never been tested by our proceedings because it is infinite—as infinite as the speeches of the hon. Member for West Dorset sometimes seemed. I am pleased to say that our work has nevertheless been carried out in a constructive and good-humoured fashion.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I thank the Committee for those words of thanks, which I shall pass on to my co-„Chairman, Mr. Hood. It has been a pleasure to chair this Committee. For the most part, it has been good natured and, in the best traditions, constructive in its deliberations on a complex piece of legislation. Thank you all very much.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
