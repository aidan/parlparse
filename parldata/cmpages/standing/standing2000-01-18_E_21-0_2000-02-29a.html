<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (Mr. Keith Hill):</B> I am grateful to you, Mr. Gale.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster </B>(Bath): I wonder whether the Under-Secretary has had an opportunity since this morning's sitting to reflect further on whether the limit should be six or 12 months?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> Much water has flowed under the bridge since the previous sitting, most of which was entirely unexpected. The hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Don Foster)—who is my hon. Friend in spirit, if not in title—was referring to the six-month maximum period that will be allowed under the clause between approving a quality contract scheme and its being made. He was concerned about the procedure if the appropriate national authority requests modifications to the scheme. I hope that I can reassure him.
<P>
If a scheme is approved with modifications, clause 106 will require the scheme-making authority to be given prior notice, and it must then consult anyone likely to be affected by the modifications. The authority must inform the Secretary of State, or the National Assembly for Wales, of the consultation's outcome; only then can the scheme be approved under clause 106(6). The six-months referred to in clause 107(1) will begin on the date of that final approval. We believe that six months is sufficient time in which to arrange matters so that the scheme can be duly made in that time.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman asked what would happen if further issues arise as a result of the second round of consultation. In consulting on any modification, it would make sense for the local authority to aim to arrive at an accommodation with the parties. The time scale will be in its hands, and it can delay informing the Secretary of State until such time as outstanding issues are resolved. I hope that the hon. Gentleman finds that answer satisfactory. If he has further questions, I shall try to be of assistance.
<P>
I have explained why the amendments tabled by the Liberal Democrats are unacceptable. For the same reasons, I cannot accept amendment No. 517, under which the official Opposition would reduce the period from 21 to 12 months. I draw the Committee's attention to clause 107(7), which provides for the appropriate national authority to vary the period by order; it is not necessarily set in stone, although obviously there would need to be very good reasons either to increase or to decrease it.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 518 and 519 deal with the maximum period for which the scheme—not an individual contract—can remain in operation. The Bill refers to a maximum of 10 years. Under amendment No. 518, that would be shortened to 5 years, and with great ingenuity, as the hon. Member for Bath said during the previous sitting, it would be increased to 12 years under amendment No. 519. That makes me pretty sure that 10 years is about right. We want to provide scope for reasonable stability, partly in the interests of local authorities and local taxpayers, given the work involved in such schemes. However, a scheme should be re-examined occasionally with a wholly fresh eye— hence the maximum period. Time and travel patterns change and a fresh look will be appropriate from time to time.
<P>
Amendment No. 520 refers to the maximum length of a contract within a scheme. The Bill refers to 5 years, but 12 years is proposed under that amendment. Frankly, five years is long enough for anybody to have an exclusive monopoly contract to run bus services in an area. Of course, the operator needs stability to encourage proper investment, but after 5 years it will be time to consider whether somebody else could do better—to test the market, in fact. Amendment No. 521 deals with when the clock should start ticking for the maximum contract. In effect, the Bill states that the clock will start when the contract is signed, but it does so in legal language. Under that amendment, a gap of up to 12 months is proposed, but I am reluctant to accept that the time scale should be spun out any more than necessary. The completion of the contract would be spun out to six years after it was signed—an unnecessarily long time. I accept that the operator may need to prepare, but he will do so in the confidence that the contract will be definite, and I believe that five years is enough time for that. I hope that those explanations have helped the Committee and that, in the light of them, the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for that helpful response. I am especially grateful that he obviously devoted much of the time since the previous sitting to considering a clearer response to the amendment, despite the fact that other activities took him away from that consideration.
<P>
Using amendments Nos. 518 and 519, under which Conservative Members would change the limits from 10 to five years, or from 10 to 12 years, to justify alighting on 10 years is not a mathematically sound argument. The average of the two figures that Conservative Members propose is only eight and a half years. Nevertheless, the Under-Secretary was right to reject those amendments. Therefore, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 596, in page 63, leave out lines 38 to 40.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendment No. 597.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> Subsection (2) states that quality contract schemes must specify certain matters, including the area of application, the commencement date and their duration. None of that will be affected under the amendments, but the clause also requires the scheme to specify the local services to be provided and the features of the proposed invitations to tender. On reflection, that is thought too inflexible.
<P>
The policy intention is that local authorities should have the option, if they wish, to take a broad-brush approach in describing the service requirements and routes, but to allow detailed matters to be decided in the light of the bids received. That would give bus operators scope to bring their professional views to bear in determining how best to meet the local authority's requirements.
<P>
Therefore, under the amendments, we shall omit such matters from those that must be specified under subsection (2) and introduce a new subsection under which it will be necessary only to outline, rather than to specify, the local services to be provided and the features of the invitations to tender. I hope that the Committee agrees that that will improve the Bill.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Amendment made: No. 597, in page 63, line 44, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) The scheme must outline—
<P>
(a) the local services which are to be provided under quality contracts, and
<P>
(a) the features of the proposed invitations to tender for quality contracts.'.—[Mr. Hill.].
<P>
Clause 107, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 108</center></H4>
<H4><center>Postponement of scheme</center></H4>
<P>
</UL></FONT>Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robert Syms </B>(Poole): Will a proposal become a scheme when the local authority receives the approval, or when the appropriate national authority—the Secretary of State—gives approval? If a proposal becomes a scheme only when the Secretary of State has given his approval, why would a postponement be necessary? Can the Under-Secretary provide several examples of why a postponement might be necessary?
<P>
People will have advertised the fact that an area will be covered by a quality contract scheme. Some of the companies operating in the area will try to redeploy their buses elsewhere, so they will move out of the area. However, the scheme may not start for three months. Therefore, there may be no bus services available because of a hitch in the new regime and because companies that have made a commercial decision to run other routes or operate elsewhere may not be able to extend their business in a particular area in which a quality contract is being implemented.
<P>
I should like the Minister to give some examples of circumstances in which postponement would be necessary. Will schemes be implemented after the Secretary of State or the National Assembly has approved them, or after the local authority has approved them? What will happen in the event of a postponement if businesses operating in the area have already adjusted to the expectation of a quality contract?
<P>
<B>The Minister for Housing and Planning (Mr. Nick Raynsford):</B> The hon. Member for Poole (Mr. Syms) made some important points, and I hope that I can satisfy him. The purpose of the clause is simply to provide flexibility to cope with particular circumstances, some of which can be anticipated, but some of which cannot.
<P>
Circumstances in which postponement might be necessary include difficulty in confronting one of the operators, which may have gone into liquidation, leaving the basis on which the quality contract was devised no longer viable. As the hon. Member for Poole will recognise, subsection (4) allows the Secretary of State to make regulations to govern the circumstances of a postponement and require authorities to reissue invitations to tender in such circumstances.
<P>
The hon. Member for Poole asked when a scheme becomes a scheme. A scheme will be implemented once it is has been made by the local authority after approval has been given by the appropriate national authority, whether the Secretary of State or the National Assembly for Wales.
<P>
To generate enthusiasm and whet the hon. Gentleman's appetite, other circumstances include a change of political control in a local authority, when the basis on which the scheme has been agreed is unacceptable to the new controlling party. I realise that in the Conservative party it is nice to live in hope, so I offer that tempting little morsel to suggest that a case may be made for postponement in the dim and distant future when his party may aspire to resume control in some local authority somewhere in the country.

<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 452, in page 65, line 17, at end add—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(5) No local service provided under a scheme made in accordance with section 107 shall be covered by the provisions of the Competition Act 1998.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Thank you, Mr. Gale, for bringing me back from my reveries, which I should perhaps share, as they are relevant. I was rather taken aback by the request of the hon. Member for Poole for the Minister to give examples of circumstances that cannot be anticipated, but it was pleasing to see the Minister rise to the challenge. I was reflecting on the wonderful quote by the former Vice-President of the United States, Mr. Dan Quayle, about being ready for all foreseen and unforeseen events. The Minister falls into a similar category.
<P>
Ministers have been waiting a long time for an opportunity to explain how they intend to deal with the impact on the Bill of the Competition Act 1998. We had a brief debate on the matter on 17 February, when the Under-Secretary, the hon. Member for Streatham (Mr. Hill) acknowledged that I had expressed considerable anxiety about it, as had other hon. Members, including the hon. Member for Poole. At column 735 of Hansard he titillated us by saying:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>It seems that two issues are connected with the Competition Act. One is the imminent issue of its coming into force on 1 March—[Official Report, Standing Committee E, 17 February 2000; c. 735.],<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and went on to make some comments about that. Unfortunately, he did not get around to telling us about the second issue and how he intended to deal with it. Even before the coming into force of the Competition Act 1998, several non-statutory quality partnership proposals have run into some difficulty because of the actions of the Office of Fair Trading. Many people feel that the situation may become worse when the Act comes into force tomorrow.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Minister said at column 735 of the Hansard report of our sitting on 17 February that the OFT would be considering the matter and issuing guidance to the bus industry. We were also told that it would be examining block exemptions. However, following a helpful intervention from the hon. Member for West Bromwich, East (Mr. Snape), the Minister said that the block exemptions would have to be sought by the industry as a whole, not by individual operators. It will be difficult for the industry as a whole to make an application for a block exemption.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Snape </B>(West Bromwich, East): Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I shall happily give way to the hon. Gentleman in a second.
<P>
It would be better if the Bill referred to a block exemption for such schemes. That was the intention behind the remarks of the hon. Member for West Bromwich, East when he proposed a manuscript amendment on 17 February, which stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>schemes made under this section shall be exempt from any provisions of the Competition Act 1999.—
<P>
[Official Report, Standing Committee E, 17 February 2000; c 730.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Of course, that was a slip of the tongue. I know that the hon. Gentleman meant the Competition Act 1998. Amendment No. 452 is worded almost exactly the same as the hon. Gentleman's draft amendment. I look forward therefore to receiving his support for this amendment.
<P>
The Minister made clear, however, his intention to table amendments on the subject. He said that he did not necessarily like my amendment and added,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>we prefer to deploy parliamentary counsel, who is already busily drafting amendments to clauses 96 to 103 on quality partnerships, clauses 115 to 118 on ticketing schemes and clause 130(4) on subsidies. We have therefore anticipated that matter and firm and prompt action will be taken.—[Official Report, Standing Committee E, 17 February 2000; c. 735.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Well, some time has now elapsed and the Government have not tabled amendments on such issues, so it is important that the Minister gives us a little more detail about his intentions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Snape:</B> As always, I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way. Returning to his earlier point, surely a block exemption could be sought by the Confederation of Passenger Transport, for example—an organisation to which all reputable operators in the United Kingdom belong.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> From my understanding of the Under-Secretary's statement to us on 17 February, that particular body could come forward and apply for a block exemption. However, the proposal drafted by the hon. Gentleman, which was along the lines of the amendment under discussion, would ease that burden by ensuring that there was a block exemption for all schemes that fit within the provisions of the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I am most grateful to the hon. Member for Bath for reminding me of what I said on 17 February. In my job, I can hardly remember what I said yesterday or even this morning, and I require that sort of prompt if I am to address his concerns. Let me deal briefly with the substance of the amendment and then turn to the issues that he raised about broader aspects of competition.
<P>
I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his explanation of the amendment, which seeks to disapply the provisions of the Competition Act 1998 about bus services operating a quality contract scheme under clause 107. I am happy to assure him that the amendment is wholly unnecessary. Once a quality contract scheme has been introduced, there is by definition no longer a competitive situation for bus operators. All services, unless exempted under clause 107(3), will henceforward be operated under quality contracts and subject to the terms and conditions specified by the local authority in the contracts, under the Bill. There will no longer be any scope for competition for the provision of bus services within quality contract schemes.
<P>
Even if a quality contract were otherwise caught by section 2 of the Competition Act 1998, it would be excluded by virtue of the provisions in paragraph 5 of schedule 3 to the Act. It states that conduct engaged in order to comply with a legal requirement is exempted from the Competition Act.
<P>
I hope that that assists the hon. Gentleman and that he will be content to withdraw the amendment. It might benefit the Committee if I said a little about competition issues. I mentioned our expectations about them, but not in the context of quality contracts. The issues that the hon. Gentleman raised are not about the 1998 Act, as it is not relevant to quality contracts.
<P>
The Government intend to table amendments to the Bill to ensure that the new powers for local authorities dovetail properly with the 1998 Act. The amendments are intended to apply powers to the local authority concerning subsidy for bus services, which will be made more flexible under clause 134, and quality partnerships and ticketing schemes, which are important due to recent actions by the OFT. The amendments will give bus operators scope to approach the OFT if it seems that the local authority has used its power in an unfair or discriminatory way. Another key objective is to ensure that the OFT is required to consider not only the competition implications, but at benefits to bus operators and the wider public interest.
<P>
We also know that the OFT and the Department of Trade and Industry are carefully considering the idea of a block exemption under the Competition Act 1998 for bus ticketing schemes, so that bus operators can continue to run sensible schemes or start new ones. I know that other members of the Committee share the concerns expressed by the hon. Member for Bath, and I hope that that information reassures them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Snape:</B> I guess that my hon. Friend the Minister knows the question that I shall put to him. If the exemption sensibly applies to bus fares, should it not also apply to bus services generally to avoid the problem that has often occurred when someone deliberately registers and runs a service two minutes in front of a pre-registered one?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> My hon. Friend makes a reasonable point. There are questions about the role of the OFT in relation to service frequencies following a simultaneous or co-ordinated publication of timetables by bus operators, which is not an intrinsic issue for competition authorities. However, it is felt that the OFT has a legitimate concern about the possibility of excessive co-ordination or collusion among bus operators when they publish their timetables. I hope that that clarifies the position for my hon. Friend.
<P>
<B>Mr. Snape:</B> I fear that it does the opposite. A joint quality partnership should surely be based on the sensible timing of buses. If operators are involved, it surely makes sense to publish a simultaneous timetable that gives a fixed frequency rather than two vehicles within five minutes and then a 15 or 20 minute gap.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I do not need to remind my hon. Friend that frequencies per se are not part of the quality partnership; they are part of the voluntary codicil.
<P>
Block exemptions relate to agreements. Disruptive service registrations are, by definition, not agreements, but the OFT also has powers to act in cases of abuse. I hope that that reassures my hon. Friend.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> To give the hon. Member for West Bromwich, East time to reflect on whether he is reassured, I remind the Minister that in our earlier deliberations on quality partnerships, he was not prepared to accept that fares and frequency were part of quality partnerships. Nevertheless, the Minister said it was perfectly possible to have an agreement on fares and frequency running alongside a quality partnership. I therefore put to him the kind of problematic situation that we know has occurred. The arrangement of two companies that agreed a timetable with the local authority, as part of a non-statutory quality partnership, so that one operated on the hour and the other on the half hour, was considered by the OFT and judged to be in breach of current competition regulations. Can the Minister assure the Committee that when similar arrangements are made as part of the adjunct to the quality partnership, they will in future not lead to such problems?

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I cannot give the hon. Gentleman that assurance. Such timetable agreements may or may not be in breach of the competition rules, but it is for the OFT to make inquiries into that and to come to its own decisions. Since such agreements do not form part of the Bill, it is hardly for me to make a judgment on them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Snape:</B> I cannot say how sorry I am to intervene again, but could I take my hon. Friend back to what seems like a millennium ago, to an earlier debate in which he assured the Committee that voluntary agreements made as part of a quality partnership—something he underlined at the time—would include those frequencies and services about which we have spoken at some length? He now appears to be contradicting those assurances to some extent by telling us that any such voluntary agreement is likely to be caught by the OFT. Does that not underline the point made by those who sought to tighten up quality partnerships in the first place?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I am grateful for my hon. Friend's helpful point, about which I have already spoken in a different place. The fact remains that such voluntary arrangements are entirely permissible, even though they fall outside the provisions of quality partnerships. If the OFT deems them to be in contravention of the public interest, it is for the competition authorities to investigate them and certainly not for us to exclude them in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> The debate has been disappointing—not least the Minister's response. The Committee was expecting great things of him, and hoping for an indication of the Government's response to the real problems faced by those who seek to introduce arrangements to improve the bus services for the people they want to serve, yet the Minister has given us no comfort other than to promise some goodies.
<P>
As the hon. Member for West Bromwich, East said, the Minister cannot have it both ways. Great play was made of the importance of addressing issues such as fares and frequency in relation to quality partnerships. As the Under-Secretary said, partnerships are allowed to deal with such issues.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Under-Secretary said that he is desperately keen to ensure that quality partnerships work and that matters handled by partnerships do not fall foul of the Competition Act 1988 and the work of the OFT. However, fares and frequency—perhaps the two most important elements in public transport provision—will fall outside the protective net offered by the Under-Secretary. I am deeply disappointed by his response. He admits that he cannot always remember what he has said and so likes a reminder. Therefore, I remind him that he said: ``We''—I assume that that means the Government—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>have made representations to the OFT. The Act allows for public benefits to be taken into account when the OFT considers these matters.—[Official Report, Standing Committee E, 17 February 1999; c.735]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is the only crumb of comfort that the Under-Secretary has given us. It appears that he has been gnawing away at that crumb in what he has just said.
<P>
<B>Mr. Snape:</B> I do not want to detain the Committee any longer than necessary. However, I shall provide an example of the matter under discussion.
<P>
Travel West Midlands, a company that I chair which is based in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Coventry, North-East (Mr. Ainsworth), operates a route alongside that of the well known company Stagecoach. Indeed, Stagecoach may be described as one of our competitors. We operate a showcase route using the best vehicles and would like to publish a joint timetable, as that would make sense. We would also like a pitch frequency. Does the hon. Gentleman think that the Under-Secretary is telling us that, were we to do that, we would be hauled before the competition authorities?
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I think that the Under-Secretary does not have the foggiest notion about whether that would happen, as it has nothing to do with him and is a matter for the Department of Trade and Industry and OFT. Indeed, I believe that he does not give a fig whether those two companies can undertake such matters. He has an opportunity to confirm or deny that. He remains sedentary so, sadly, I must draw the conclusion that my analysis is probably correct. The hon. Member for Poole, however, may have a different interpretation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> In earlier debates, I asked whether Ministers might write to the Committee, setting out how the Bill will interact with competition law, the OFT and the Competition Commission. There is some confusion about the matter and it would be helpful if, before Report, the Ministers would send a letter setting out how the Bill will operate in relation to competition law.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right and the Under-Secretary might wish to confirm his intention in that respect.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> That goes to show that when one makes a gesture to the Opposition, they just come back and kick one in the teeth—with assistance, I might add, from unlikely sources.
<P>
Everyone knows that I am a Minister who chooses his words with extraordinary precision. My view is on the record. However, to make the matter crystal clear, I repeat that, in principle, there is nothing to prevent the voluntary agreements on frequencies that we have discussed.
<P>
However, it is not my place to speak on behalf of the OFT. Frequencies may be entirely satisfactory, but it is the competition authority's right to distinguish between a market stitch-up and a beneficial arrangement for the customer. It is for the OFT to decide where the interest lies. It is all about the consumer. I sometimes wonder how many Committee members speak on behalf of the consumer. We are concerned with the interests of the traveller, who does not benefit from cosy deals. The OFT has a right to examine the matter and consider who benefits. I have already offered the hon. Gentleman more than a token gesture on block exemptions on ticketing. I rest my case.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I can see that when the Committee reports, I shall have to award a prize for the longest intervention. The competition may not be confined to Back Benchers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for his helpful intervention.
<P>
<B>Mr. Snape:</B> So am I. Does the intervention of my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary mean that I am no longer his guru?
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> The hon. Member for West Bromwich, East shows considerable courtesy to his hon. Friend. The accusation of being party to a stitch-up against the public interest is not likely to have been made lightly. I would certainly never dare to make such an accusation.
<P>
The Under-Secretary has shown his hand. On three different occasions, he has said that it is not his place to speak on the matter. However, he is in a position to do so if he wishes and could table an amendment addressing it. Sadly, however, he appears unwilling to do so. Nevertheless, we shall have an opportunity to tackle the matter when the Government table their expected amendments. According to the Under-Secretary, parliamentary draftsmen have been working on clause 130(4) for almost two weeks and will doubtless have completed their deliberations by the time that we discuss it.

We shall, therefore, have an opportunity to examine the Government's proposal. If the hon.

Given that forthcoming opportunity, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 598, in page 65, line 24, leave out subsection (3).
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss amendment No. 574, in page 65, line 24, leave out `not'.
<P>
Government amendment No. 705.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> Clause 110(3) replicates the ban in section 89(3) of the Transport Act 1985 on including employee conditions in tender invitations. On reflection, neither provision is needed, which, I am sure will be warmly welcomed by most reasonable Committee members. Section 17 of the Local Government Act 1988 already requires local authorities to exclude from the tendering process consideration of non-commercial matters, including terms and conditions of employment.
<P>
Times, however, are changing. The present policy is against such a blanket ban. Indeed, in cases in which employee conditions may affect the achievement of best value, it is proper for local authorities to exercise influence. Work force matters, such as the company's experience and track record in delivering similar services, human resource procedures and so on, may be germane to performance and value-for-money issues. Local authorities should be able to take such matters into account. Accordingly, there is soon to be public consultation on proposals to modify the current regime under the 1985 Act.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 598 and 705 delete subsection (3) from the clause and make a corresponding deletion from 89 of the 1985 Act. That will allow appropriate provision to be made by modifying the Local Government Act 1988.
<P>
I am sorry to have stolen the thunder of the hon. Member for Bath. The Government amendments shorten clause 110 even more than his amendment would do as they delete subsection (3) entirely. The late Nicholas Ridley, a relative of a member of the Committee who was late, was directly responsible for the clause's insertion in the 1985 Act. He will be spinning in his grave, but that is no bad thing.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> The last time that I hit the jackpot, Mr. Gale, I promised not only to write to my wife but to send a copy of the letter to you. I have not yet got round to writing it. I am now in difficulty because I appear to have hit the jackpot a second time, so I have a second letter to write and a second copy to send to you.
<P>
The Minister has rightly pointed out that his amendment, which was submitted after mine, will go even further than mine. Therefore I am delighted to give my full support to his proposals on what I consider to be a most important issue.

<B>Mr. Snape:</B> I shall not detain the Committee. My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary said that no reasonable member of the Committee could take exception to his amendment. He knows that I am one of the Committee's more reasonable members, and I agree wholeheartedly with it. One problem with this contracting system, which is franchising by another name, is that reputable companies which pay reasonable wages would be likely to be undercut if the amendment were not absorbed into the Bill. Any reputable operator would welcome such an amendment, as would the trade unions and workers in the bus industry. My hon.

<P>
</UL></FONT>Clause 113 sets out the exceptions in a scheme for which the appropriate national authority—either the Secretary of State or the National Assembly for Wales—may make regulations. Our amendment would ensure that there is consultation with interested parties prior to regulations being made. We have suggested local transport authorities, providers of bus services, community transport organisations, providers of dial-a-ride services and of taxis and private hire services, providers of home to school transport and bus passenger user groups. Our view is that when the Secretary of State in particular makes regulations, all those who will be involved should be given an opportunity to have their say.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The hon. Member for Poole has made his case for the importance of consultation. I hope that I can assure him that consultation will take place and that his amendment is unnecessary.
<P>
It is well-established custom and practice that Governments undertake appropriate consultation on draft regulations made under secondary legislation. I can give the hon. Gentleman the clear assurance that there will be consultation on any regulations made under the clause, or under any clause in this part of the Bill, before they are laid.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman has made a valiant attempt to be all-embracing in listing the bodies that he thinks should be consulted. But here we come up against argument C; the issue of the list. I notice that traffic commissioners are not included. They may feel that they are badly done by in being excluded from the list. I need not repeat the arguments. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will recognise that there is an inherent defect in a list approach. I have assured him that there will be consultation and that it will cover all appropriate bodies. I hope that he will withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I thank the Minister for his reply. I am pleased that his assurance is on the record.
<P>
I have one further question for the hon. Gentleman. Does he envisage there being a template of regulations for the operation of all such schemes or will there be different regulations for different schemes? When the Secretary of State sets out how the quality contracts will be operated, will it be a national set of regulations rather than regulations for a specific area?
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> We envisage a standard set of regulations covering all quality contracts, with the caveat that circumstances that we have not anticipated may necessitate further regulations relating to a particular area. I do not, therefore, preclude the possibility that more detailed regulations with a more specific application may be required. Our initial intention is to prepare regulations covering the generality of circumstances surrounding quality contracts.

<P>
The clause brings us to the important topic of bus ticketing, which has already formed part of our debate today. The Minister's comments about how the competition laws will relate to ticketing schemes have been of major concern to bus companies. We are all pleased with what he said on that point. I am trying to remember why we tabled the amendment—I am sure that there is a good reason for it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> My speaking note begins:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I am grateful for the explanation we have had for this amendment.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
As we have had no explanation, it seems otiose to explain to the hon. Gentleman precisely what his amendment is about; we understand it perfectly well. The key point is that the amendment is, as usual, entirely unnecessary and I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for that answer. I am not sure that I am much wiser, but I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 391, in page 68, line 35, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) A local transport authority may specify in a ticketing scheme that tickets shall be sold in advance of the journey and that operators shall sell the tickets for any journey covered by the ticketing scheme.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I do know why I am moving the amendment, but I should be quite interested to hear the Minister's explanation before I give mine. Would the Minister care to intervene and give me his version first? [Interruption.] Clearly not.
<P>
I hope that the Committee agrees that we want an integrated transport scheme and an integration of the ticketing scheme for buses. The amendment enables the local authority to specify, not only that there will be joint ticketing schemes, but that tickets can be sold in advance. It would also be possible for a potential passenger to approach one company for a ticket in advance for a bus operated by another company on the same route; that is a development of e-commerce. Some customers may wish to have one number to contact for their tickets, and the amendment would be a sensible way of ensuring that there is genuine integration, not only in the delivery of the service, but in the arrangements for ticketing.
<P>
The amendment might also give the Minister an opportunity to comment on what he regards as the advantages of ensuring that there is the opportunity for advance purchase of tickets. We have moved increasingly to one-man operated buses, known in the trade as OMOBs. I should point out that it is a move that I do not personally like, because I used to be a bus conductor. The job that I once had—certainly not on tour buses, which seem to have several people operating them—was taken away.
<P>
The move towards one-man operated buses means that people have to queue for a long time at peak hours to get their tickets before they can get on to the bus. That adds to delays and causes congestion. If people can purchase tickets in advance, it reduces congestion at bus stops and on the roads. I should be grateful if the Minister would confirm that he agrees with me.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I am delighted that the hon. Gentleman outlined the purpose of his amendment, rather than expecting an immediate response. It gave him an opportunity to tell us about his earlier career; later, we may hear more about his experiences on the buses. However, I hope to persuade him that the amendment is unnecessary.
<P>
Clause 115 refers to a ticketing scheme as one under which operators may be required to make and implement arrangements for the purchase of tickets of various descriptions. The intention is to enable the local authority to promote joint bus ticketing or through ticketing as described in subsection (3). That will include multi-ticket journeys—such as season tickets and through ticketing, which avoids people having to buy new tickets when changing to another bus—and reciprocal arrangements whereby passengers can make a return journey on a bus belonging to a different operator from the one on which they made their outward journey.
<P>
The clause refers to the arrangements for the purchase of tickets. There is no impediment in the wording of the clause as drafted to arrangements for the advance purchase of tickets, which is what the hon. Gentleman had in mind. However, there is a potential difficulty in obliging every operator to sell every type of ticket, including those relating to services from which they do not benefit, as that would not be reasonable.
<P>
However, it is reasonable to expect all operators to be required to sell network tickets which include their own and other operators' services. Local authorities will need to consider such matters if they want to proceed with the proposals.
<P>
The clause as drafted meets most of the hon. Gentleman's requirements and provides a reasonable framework within which to proceed. I hope, therefore, that he will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I will. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 525, in page 68, line 42, at end insert—

One of our anxieties is that if an authority wants a ticketing scheme which causes problems, such as the loss of revenue to a commercial bus company, it should be liable to the operator of the services for any loss which may arise from the imposition of such a scheme.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for the magnificent brevity of his explanation. However, the amendment betrays a misunderstanding of the powers in clause 115. Subsection (3) gives the arrangements under which people may purchase tickets entitling them to make certain types of journey, which may include multi-journey tickets such as season tickets or travel cards, through tickets, which avoid people having to buy a separate ticket if they have to change buses on their journey, and return tickets which allow people the freedom to make their return journey using a different operator's service if that is more convenient. Those are all excellent proposals, none of which is rocket science. What is proposed is already possible in many places as a result of sensible arrangements agreed voluntarily between operators. Clause 115 will provide a fall-back arrangement in the event that there are no such local arrangements. It will give the local authority the power, after due consultation, to introduce a ticketing scheme and to require operators to comply with it. Enforcement would be by the traffic commissioners through the bus registration system, by virtue of clause 118, and schedule 10(17)(b). Compliance with the ticketing scheme would become a condition of the bus operators' registration.
<P>
The clauses do not give local authorities a role in fixing the price of tickets. Pricing of multi-operator or multi-journey tickets would be a matter for negotiation between bus operators and there is no reason for us to intervene in that respect. The clause is about flexibility and convenience, not discounting. It follows that there can be no question of any loss of revenue being attributable to local authorities as a result of a ticketing scheme. The amendment is therefore unnecessary and I hope that the hon. Gentleman will be happy to withdraw it in the light of my explanation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I thank the Under-Secretary for that full explanation of how the scheme will operate. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take Government amendment No. 426.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I assure the Committee that there is no question of this amendment not being moved.
<P>
These are minor, technical amendments. They will ensure that the traffic commissioners are appropriately consulted about local authority proposals for the provision of information under clause 119 and notified of arrangements duly made under clause 120. Similar provision is already made in the Bill for quality partnerships, quality contracts and ticketing schemes, and we wish the traffic commissioners to be similarly consulted and informed about local authority action on the provision of information. There was a brief reference to the traffic commissioners earlier when we discussed the previous issue. I hope that the hon. Member for Poole will recognise that we are being diligent in ensuring that the commissioners are not omitted on this occasion and that he and the rest of the Committee will accept the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> Before we move on to the next debate, I point out that clause 119(2), states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Before making such a determination, the authority must consult such organisations appearing to the authority to be representative of users of local services as they think fit.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Many bus providers are worried that local authorities may over-egg the providing of information, especially electronic information, because of the substantial costs involved, and it is possible that the proposal is drawn too widely. I am anxious that the local authorities will be able to strong arm bus companies into providing more information, thereby adding substantially to their costs.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The matter would be better discussed in the stand part debate. However, if you will allow me to do so, Mr. Gale, I should be happy to say a few words now on the wider implications of the amendments.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> On the basis that these are the only amendments to the clause and that they have not been discussed earlier, I am happy to allow the Minister to speak about them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> Thank you, Mr. Gale. The purpose of the clause is to make arrangements for information to be given to bus users. I entirely understand the hon. Gentleman's concern that in certain circumstances local authorities could be tempted into gold-plated arrangements that would impose unreasonable cost burdens. For that reason, the authority must seek to make arrangements with operators of local services to make information available. That is the prime responsibility under subsection (5). Only when operators have failed to provide appropriate arrangements for information does the local authority itself step in to do so.
<P>
I hope that that convinces the hon. Gentleman that we are not seeking a gold-plated arrangement, but a proper partnership between local authorities and operators—yet with a fall-back provision for the local authority to act if the operator fails, for whatever reason, to make the necessary arrangements.
<P>
When we reach clause 120, the important word ``reasonable'' applies to costs. I shall draw attention to that again later if we have an opportunity to debate that clause. I hope that the hon. Gentleman is reassured that we are mindful of his concern and intend to establish arrangements that will avoid any of the risks that he described.

<P>
Thank you, Chair. We propose to delete subsection (3). It is a probing amendment to elicit a fuller explanation of how the provision interacts with the rest of the architecture of the clause and the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I extend my sympathies to the hon. Gentleman who seems to have been abandoned by his Front-Bench colleagues and is not receiving sufficient support from the lance corporal on the Back Benches.
<P>
<B>Mr. James Gray </B>(North Wiltshire): I heartily support everything that my hon. Friend the Member for Poole said, with the exception that he had the temerity to address the Chairman as ``Chair''.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Fortunately, I did not hear the remark. It is well known, however, that that form of address is likely to provoke this Chairman into irascibility. ``Chairman'' or ``Mr. Gale'' will do nicely.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> To avoid any risk of moving into that territory, Mr. Gale, I shall rapidly return to the amendments.
<P>
The Committee will be aware that the Government view the local authority as a facilitator. The authority has an important function to represent the interests of the travelling public in its area, and to exercise its functions with a view to improving public transport, and information about it.
<P>
As I said where bus operators provide comprehensive information to a satisfactory standard, there will be little for the local authority to do. Where that is not the case, and operators are unwilling to make satisfactory arrangements, the authority has powers—indeed, under clause 120, a duty—to make the necessary information available. It follows that the authority must be in a position to obtain that information, if it is to be able to fulfil its statutory role. That is what clause 120(3) provides. It states clearly that in such circumstances, bus operators are obliged to provide the necessary information to the authority, so that it can meet its obligation.
<P>
I hope that the hon. Gentleman will acknowledge the need for subsection (3). Without it, it could leave a local authority unable to comply with its legal obligations because it is unable to obtain the necessary information to pass it on to the public. The provision is necessary on the simple constitutional principle that no authority should be under an obligation to do something without the means to deliver it. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I thank the Minister for his explanation. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<B>Mr. Syms:</B> Thank you, Mr. Gale.
<P>
Clause 122 extends the power of traffic commissioners to impose traffic regulations and conditions on local bus services under section 7 of the 1985 Act. At present, those powers allow the commissioners, at the request of local authorities, to impose restrictions on routes and stopping places to prevent danger to road users or reduce severe traffic congestion. Under the clause, a commissioner will also be able to act for the purpose of reducing or limiting noise or air pollution. The amendment would make it explicit that bus noise and pollution should be limited.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Member for Poole for explaining the amendments, but I was puzzled why Opposition Members felt any doubt about the interpretation of the clause as drafted. I shall do my best to explain why the Government do not share those doubts.
<P>
In earlier deliberations, I assured the hon. Member for Bath that clause 122 would be relevant to his concerns about the noise of public address systems on open-top tour buses. I do not say that to provide an incentive for him to reappear and reiterate his concern now—a matter for his judgment. We debated the issue on the morning of 17 February and the record appears under column 689. The clause is not aimed exclusively at tour buses and I do not wish to open another lengthy debate on the matter.

<B>Mr. Foster:</B> The very words of that column are engraved on my heart, though the hon. Member for North Shropshire (Mr. Paterson) is not with us at present. If he were, the debate would appear in edition 14,237 of the local focus newsletter, which will soon be travelling around Bath.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his intervention. I am sure that much good work is being pursued in relation to tour buses in the wonderful city of Bath.
<P>
The amendment would ensure that the reference to noise or air pollution is read as a reference to noise and air pollution ``from buses''. Frankly, I cannot see how any other interpretation could be put on it. The clause amends section 7 of the Transport Act 1985, which deals with buses—though the term of art is ``local services'', defined as services using public service vehicles carrying passengers paying separate fares and with stopping places no more than 15 miles apart.
<P>
The traffic regulation provisions made by the traffic commissioners under section 7 are all about buses. The section allows commissioners to attach conditions to restrict bus routes and stopping places in the interests of preventing danger to road users or reducing severe traffic congestion. As amended by the Bill, section 7 will also permit traffic regulation conditions that are required to reduce or limit noise or air pollution. By definition, we are dealing only with noise or air pollution from buses, because the powers do not extend to noise or air pollution from other sources. As I said, noise from the bus need not be limited to engine noise. It can include other noise—from loudspeaker systems, for example—emanating from the vehicle. Amendment No. 529 is otiose.
<P>
By analogy, amendment No. 535, to clause 130, is also unnecessary. That clause refers to local authorities' bus subsidy powers and amends the bus tendering provisions in the 1985 Act to take account of the Bill. In particular, when considering whether to accept tenders for bus services, local authorities will be required to consider several factors, including the bus strategy and the reduction or limitation of noise or air pollution. We want to ensure that authorities take environmental considerations into account. For example, if an authority receives two similar bids, but one provides for the use of vehicles with low emissions—or those that run on alternative fuels—the authority can consider that factor when deciding which bid to accept. In some cases, authorities might want to accept a slightly more expensive bid if it promises additional environmental benefits.
<P>
As clause 122 deals only with bus services, it is unnecessary to add an explicit reference to buses. By definition the reference in the clause to ``noise or air pollution'' must relate to the vehicles to be used in providing the local service. Amendment No. 535 to clause 130 is equally unnecessary. My response has been rather comprehensive, but necessarily so and I hope that the hon. Gentleman has been persuaded to withdraw his amendment.

<B>Mr. Foster:</B> The Committee will be aware that, since 1998, the Government have been promising, and publicising extensively, their intention to introduce a concessionary fare scheme, although the comprehensive spending review funding for such a scheme is not due to kick in for about 18 months. Nevertheless, the Committee welcomes the Government's intention to introduce such a scheme. I hope that, with your normal generosity, Mr. Gale, it may be possible to have a slightly wider, albeit brief, debate on concessionary fares. I am slightly confused about which Minister is dealing with the issue. One wonders whether there should be a sign so that we know to which Minister we should address our remarks. [Interruption.] I am grateful to the Under-Secretary, the hon. Member for Streatham (Mr. Hill) for indicating that he has responsibility for the issue.
<P>
Several local authorities and some operators are concerned about the Government's plans for concessionary fare schemes, because some local authority areas already have such schemes, certain aspects of which may be more generous than the Government's scheme. Those local authorities would have considerable difficulty operating two different schemes in parallel, one designed by them, and one introduced by the Government. [Interruption.] The Minister is indicating that the hon. Member for West Bromwich, East wants to intervene.
<P>
<B>Mr. Snape:</B> I have been provoked to ask whether the more generous schemes are all in areas controlled by the Labour party, or whether the Liberal party has introduced any.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> Although I come prepared with extensive briefing notes, I confess that if I were a Minister, I would reply, ``I will write to the hon. Gentleman.'' As I am not a Minister, I do not feel duty-bound to do that, but I will certainly seek to find out the answer to his question.
<P>
<B>Mr. Snape:</B> One should never ask a question in this place to which one does not know the answer. None of the schemes are in areas controlled by the Liberals.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I often defer to the hon. Gentleman, but I suspect that he has forgotten that the control of several local authorities has recently changed hands—for example, Liverpool and Sheffield. I would be somewhat surprised to discover that both those great cities did not have concessionary fare schemes that are more generous to some categories of user than that proposed by the Government. If the hon. Gentleman can assure me that I am wrong about that, I shall defer to his greater knowledge.
<P>
<B>Mr. Snape:</B> No, I cannot. I apologise to the hon. Gentleman. A few authorities, two of which he named, inherited such schemes from the former controlling Labour group. None of them were initiated by the Liberal Democrat party. Indeed, in most parts of the country the Liberal Democrats voted against them.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I am already whittling away the hon. Gentleman's original assertion that a Liberal Democrat-controlled authority was responsible. He and I can debate the matter another time, when I have done more homework.
<P>
Anxiety has been expressed about the difficulties that may be experienced in operating two different schemes in parallel, especially when the local authority scheme is more generous for some categories of passenger or parts of journey than the scheme that the Government propose.
<P>
Amendment No. 577 would make everyone over the age of 60—not only people of pensionable age—eligible for concessionary fares. All hon. Members will have done their homework and will be aware that the power to offer a concessionary fare was introduced as early as 1955. One of the limits placed on local authorities' powers to introduce such schemes related to the age of 60 for women and 65 for men, as proposed in the Bill. The differential continued under the 1985 Act and it seems that it will under the Bill.
<P>
As the Committee will be aware, discrimination between men and women on the grounds of age has been the subject of several test cases in the various judicial branches of the European Parliament. The European courts have consistently ruled that only a link that is financially or objectively necessary can justify such discrimination. In 2000, no argument can be advanced for perpetuating such discrimination as is proposed between men and women. Support for the amendment is widespread, but even if it were not, a change such as is proposed in amendment No. 577 is a matter of basic justice.
<P>
Amendment No. 578 would extend eligibility for the proposed concessionary fares scheme to several other groups. Those groups will be familiar to hon. Members who have studied previous legislation, as the categories that we propose that the extension should cover are specified in sections 93(7)(b), (c), (d), (e) and (f) of the 1985 Act. They include people whose age does not exceed 16 years, blind people, disabled people and, interestingly, such other classes of person as the Secretary of State may by order specify. That provision provides an opportunity to extend the concessionary fares scheme.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 530, 531 and 579 to 583 are consequential on amendments Nos. 577 and 578, which contain two fundamental proposals—to equalise the age at which men and women are eligible for the scheme and to extend the scheme's eligibility to other disadvantaged groups.

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Member for Bath asked if I was prepared to allow a wider debate. I am, because the amendments effectively cover the whole clause. Clauses 123 to 129 are related and cover the concessionary fares scheme, so it makes sense to have a wide-ranging debate. However, I urge the Committee not to debate the same issues on all those clauses, as that would not be helpful.
<P>
<B>Ms Claire Ward </B>(Watford): Thank you for the explanation, Mr. Gale, which assists me.
<P>
I am pleased that there will be a statutory minimum concessionary fare scheme, which is an important recognition of the role that elderly people play in our society. It will provide a filler to the gaps that exist in concessionary fare schemes. Some areas do not have schemes or if they do, schemes that are as good as that provided by the local authority in Watford, where a bus pass scheme costing pensioners £15 per annum allows them free travel in the borough and to the local hospital in a London borough. It also allows them half fare for the rest of the county. The wide-ranging scheme also applies to the disabled and to companions of the blind.
<P>
It is not a cheap option for the borough, costing £131 per head for each eligible pensioner. However, it is a recognition by the Labour council of pensioners' value to the community and of the importance of ensuring that the elderly remain active and mobile. We are keen to see them getting about in Watford and throughout the county.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> The hon. Lady mentions that the concessionary scheme in Watford applies to the disabled. Would she therefore like the Government to include the disabled in the national statutory scheme, and if so does she support our amendment?
<P>
<B>Ms Ward:</B> The hon. Gentleman tries hard to make me fall into that trap, but he shall not succeed.
<P>
It would be impossible for other local authorities to be forced to supply the scheme, because the council tax payers of Watford, of whom I am one, pay a significantly larger sum than council tax payers in some local authorities. I am happy to pay the extra to ensure that our pensioners get the best travel scheme available. Other areas must decide whether they want such a wide-ranging and generous scheme. In addition to the scheme provided by the borough council, all those who are on income support and are eligible for a pass get one free. As I hope that the hon. Gentleman recognises, it is an unusual scheme and it is at the higher end of those that operate in the country.
<P>
The national scheme in the Bill must be a minimum and we must ensure that local authorities that provide no scheme for their pensioners are forced to provide it at least, although it is basic. As a lawyer, I would like more detail about the issues. I would be interested to know what legal advice the Under-Secretary of State, my hon. Friend the Member for Streatham (Mr. Hill), has received regarding the different age provision, especially in the light of the recent European Court decision. What differentiates the scheme from the rulings on the winter fuel allowance? What is the extent of the national scheme? Pensioners from my constituency enjoy an exceptionally high standard of travel provision. Will they benefit from the national scheme if they travel outside their area? Perhaps I have misunderstood the issue, but will the scheme ensure that people from neighbouring boroughs, who may not benefit from such a good local scheme, can visit the best shopping centre in Hertfordshire, in Watford?
<P>
It is important that the scheme should apply more widely than simply to local authorities, to ensure that pensioners can travel not only within their own borough or local authority area, but to other areas that may contain important facilities, such as hospitals and other public services, main shopping areas and entertainment attractions. I am sure that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary has the answers to all my questions, because I have total confidence in him and his preparation. I would be grateful to hear what he has to say.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> Several questions are raised by the topic of mandatory travel concessions. Many concerns have been expressed about the confusion and difficulty that having both a national scheme and local schemes will cause. In its ninth report, on the White Paper on integrated transport, the Select Committee on the Environment, Transport and Regional Affairs said that it was concerned that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>some areas which already offered greater concessions might change their schemes so that they provide only the national minimum standard.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Local Government Association has raised several points on concessionary fares. It said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Whilst recognising that concessionary fares is a potentially difficult area for debate, the LGA is concerned that practicalities of the scheme outlined in the Bill are too prescriptive and fail to take sufficient account of the need to dovetail with existing, more generous schemes. The LGA is particularly seeking clarification on the change to the start time of the minimum scheme (from 9 am to 9.30 am) to minimise disruption to existing schemes, as well as reducing competition with people using buses to get to work, and supports the amendment to this effect.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The LGA is also worried about reimbursement to local authorities. Currently, the Government suggest that an extra £25 million will be included in the standard spending assessment. The document on SSAs is interesting to look at, but it is very thick and not always easy to understand. Is £25 million sufficient? How will it be provided? Will it be distributed equally across boroughs? Will authorities such as Watford, which already has a very generous scheme, receive more compensation than others, or will they be treated the same as boroughs that have simply implemented the national minimum scheme? The distribution of the resources will be a critical issue.
<P>
If one accepts the principle of a national scheme for buses, why not have one for trains? This is a Transport Bill, but, although it clarifies the position for buses, it does not give a similar priority to trains. Amendment No. 531 raises the issue of disabled people, to which my hon. Friend the Member for North Wiltshire (Mr. Gray) referred in his intervention. Why is there no national scheme for disabled people? Many pensioners—perhaps by choice—use public transport, but also have cars that they can use. That option is not available to many disabled people, because they are not as mobile as some pensioners.
<P>
The hon. Member for Bath made a relevant point on the retirement ages of 65 and 60. All members of the Committee will have had in their surgeries people who, with the Court judgment, found that they could claim the winter payment, but had difficulty in doing so. The hon. Member for Watford (Ms Ward) raised an important point on the legal grounds for doing so and suggested that we might get into difficulties unless we received the right advice.
<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
There are concerns about having two schemes, especially about the compensation that the Government have promised to pay local authorities and how it will be distributed. Beyond that, many bus companies have concerns. Often, when a transport authority or local authority has agreed to compensate bus companies for concessions for pensioners, it has not compensated them pound for pound, but has assumed that the companies will gain additional business, with more people riding on their buses. The authorities do not always give full compensation and there is concern that there will be a squeeze from Government on authorities, who are then fully compensated, and a squeeze from authorities on bus companies who may not be given proper compensation for the additional bodies that travel on their vehicles. Some of the passenger transport authorities are aggrieved. They do not feel that the money through the system has always fully compensated for the concessionary scheme.
<P>
<B>Mr. Snape:</B> I shall be extremely brief. The west midlands enjoys one of the best concessionary travel schemes in the United Kingdom. Women over 60 and men over 65 travel free on buses and trains across the conurbation, except for a short period in the afternoon. When my hon. Friend responds, will he explain with his customary clarity, for the benefit of my constituents and of pensioners in the west midlands, how the new national scheme will apply, especially between 3.30 pm and 6 pm, when free travel for pensioners is suspended unless a supplement is paid?
<P>
I have a further question to put to the hon. Member for Bath, but I think that I shall not get a straight answer.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster indicated dissent.</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Snape:</B> The hon. Gentleman shakes his head, so I was right. He does not know yet what the question is. In typical Liberal fashion, he is anxious to extend the scheme to everyone in the United Kingdom, regardless of age. I doubt whether he has costed it. I have always admired the Liberal party for its brass neck when it controls local authorities. The Liberal Democrats have never introduced such a scheme, but expect the British taxpayer to pay, not only for the scheme so sensibly and generously proposed by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Education, Transport and the Regions, but for the even better scheme proposed in their amendment.
<P>
How much would it cost? I do not want to enter into that argument, so ably put by my hon. Friend the Member for Watford. It was generous of her, given her youth and beauty, to think of those of us who are much closer to the magic age. I hope that when my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary replies, he will give us hope that over the years there will be movement towards the equalisation of age, preferably before it is too late for my generation. I do not look forward to being issued with a bus pass, but it will at least qualify me as a pensioner to sit in the pub, twang my braces, bemoan the fate of modern society and comment on every subject under the sun. Some of my critics might say that I have adopted that role for many years.

<P>

<B>Mr. Peter Atkinson </B>(Hexham): I do not want to appear insulting to the hon. Member for West Bromwich, East but he seems to think that he is an expert on everything now, so when he reaches pensionable age, God help those who have to listen to him.
<P>
I reinforce what my hon. Friend the Member for Poole said and reflect some of the concerns sent to me by the Tyne and Wear Nexus, who have the same concerns about running the dual systems. It already has a system in place and is worried about having an alternative system that would allow pensioners a choice. As the chief executive of Nexus said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>This would be unnecessarily cumbersome, bureaucratic and expensive and would divert much needed resources from the provisions of concessions themselves.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The local district council in my constituency has a token system that is rather archaic. Every pensioner receives a number of tokens every year, because many pensioners in the constituency have no access to buses: there are no services. Quite properly, the council opted for the token system, paid for from council taxes, because it was unfair to make elderly people pay council taxes for a concessionary fare that they could not use. The main beneficiaries of the token system are the local taxi services. Pensioners save up the tokens and use them to go, in a group, into the town or to Newcastle to do some shopping. It is a good system, if slightly cumbersome, and it is a fair one.
<P>
The reservations I have are about how the local authority would run a parallel system with the Government's proposals. They are serious concerns, and I await the Minister's reply.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> You, Mr. Gale, invited the Committee to be wide-ranging in the debate on the first amendments to clause 123 and that is what I propose to do. I shall take the Committee on another tour on the guided bus, but before I do so, let me say that this is a moment to rejoice. Clauses 123 to 129 fulfil the Labour party's pledge that all elderly people should have a concessionary fares scheme for their local bus services that is at least as generous as half fare on the purchase of a bus pass costing no more than £5 a year. This promise has been a key plank in our policies. Access to affordable public transport can make a big contribution to the pleasures of everyday life for elderly people, as I am sure my hon. Friend the Member for West Bromwich, East will only too shortly discover.
<P>
At present, concessionary travel outside London is entirely a matter for the discretion of individual local authorities. Some offer no cheap fares for pensioners while others offer less than the minimum provided in the Bill and will have to meet the new standard. But I should stress to hon. Members—the point has been raised on both sides of the Committee—that any local authority that wishes to offer a scheme that is more generous than the statutory minimum will be entirely free to do so. There is no question of existing schemes that go beyond our new statutory minimum having to be brought down to the minimum: they can continue as they are. I am sure that that is what all members of the Committee would wish, and I give them that reassurance.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lawrie Quinn </B>(Scarborough and Whitby): I am sure that my hon. Friend is aware that 10 borough councils in England, including Scarborough borough council, provide no concessionary scheme. A scheme in Scarborough was removed in the 1980s. The commitment that we are making today shows the worth of concessions to all elderly persons. No local authority will be able to remove the privilege by removing their largesse.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I am very grateful to my hon. Friend. He is right and I am delighted that the scheme will apply to his local authority. I hope that a news release is on its way.
<P>
<B>Ms Ward:</B> As my local pensioners are already so well catered for, news releases are hardly necessary. If a local authority scheme is better than the proposed national scheme, will my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary assure us that he will discourage the authority from lowering its standards to the minimum?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> Let me send out the message from Committee that the Government would strongly discourage local authorities from reducing their standards. We would look dimly on any opportunistic council—such as those that have recently although, I am sure, temporarily acceded to Liberal Democrat control—that moved in such a direction. Such actions are political madness, but that does not prevent them from being taken.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> May I make it clear that we Liberal Democrats share the Under-Secretary's delight about such schemes, which we welcome? However, questions are being asked about their local organisation—an issue that I sought to raise with him earlier. He says that he wants to send out the message that people should not reduce their standards. If a local authority operates a scheme in which it arranges a fixed fare over various distances that is 40 per cent. of what the full fare would be, those who travel a short distance will be better off under a half-fare scheme than under the local authority scheme, whereas those who travel the full length of the route will be worse off. Therefore, the problem is how best to combine arrangements to produce a scheme that is simple to understand, yet brings out the benefits of the Government's and the local authority's proposals, even though it might mean reducing the advantages gained by a few people.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes a serious point. He will be aware that many important issues have been raised during the debate, and I intend to deal with all of them in due course.
<P>
The basic purpose of the mandatory travel concessions proposal is to ensure that the operation of the current legislation is unchanged so far as possible in England and Wales outside London and within London.
<P>
Under clause 123, we shall ensure that bus operators provide the half-price minimum, provided that an elderly person produces any necessary bus pass. However, there is provision for an elderly person to opt for a scheme other than the statutory minimum that a local authority provides, even if it might superficially appear to be less generous. We included that provision in response to representations made to us; we do listen. As the hon. Member for Hexham (Mr. Atkinson) said, some local authorities have schemes based on tokens, which are often popular with pensioners, especially if the tokens can also be used in taxis and minicabs. Therefore, the individual pensioner can choose an alternative if the local authority provides one. I hope that the hon. Gentleman finds that response helpful.
<P>
Clause 124 contains the necessary technical definitions and a regulation-making power so that the price of the bus pass can be altered. Clause 125 includes a further flexible order-making power, so that, for example, the statutory minimum can be extended to other groups of people or forms of public transport, or be made more flexible in its geographical coverage or more generous. I hope that the Committee welcomes such room for manoeuvre, as it allows for future developments and changes in circumstances.
<P>
Clause 126 is an enforcement provision, equivalent to that which exists for discretionary schemes, that ties up with the duty on the operator to provide the statutory minimum. Clause 127 rightly matches that with a provision for local authorities to reimburse operators. I shall deal with the regulation-making power contained in that clause in due course, as the issue was raised by the hon. Member for Poole. We envisage no change in the reimbursement arrangements for existing schemes; it is not our intention to upset arrangements that have been tested over time and are broadly accepted by those concerned. That clause is thus similar to the corresponding provision in the Transport Act 1985.
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Clause 128 sets out the procedures for reimbursement arrangements, including requirements for publication and opportunities for an operator to appeal to the appropriate national authority if he is unhappy with the local authority's proposals. Again, that deliberately follows the model of the 1985 Act.
<P>
Clause 129 applies to London. It is necessary because, as many hon. Members will know, the legislation on concessionary fares in London is separate from that for the rest of England and Wales. Accordingly, separate technical provisions are needed. The current statutory position in London is that a reserve free travel scheme can be applied if the boroughs fail to agree on a joint scheme of their own. Under clause 129, that reserve scheme will be triggered if the boroughs fail to agree a scheme that is at least as generous as the statutory minimum.
<P>
<B>Mr. Christopher Leslie </B>(Shipley): The fact that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary has mentioned London, and did so on the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Watford (Ms Ward), reminds me of the representations made, as I recall, by passenger transports authorities. They were concerned about the overlap between the national concessionary scheme and their local schemes and the associated administrative arrangements. Has consideration been given to any problem that might arise?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> Again, I shall deal with that matter during my speech.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Atkinson:</B> The Under-Secretary mentioned token schemes. If the mandatory scheme is more generous than the token scheme for those people who have access to public transport, presumably it will be incumbent on the district council in my constituency to improve the token scheme for those who have no access to public transport. Therefore, the council will have to increase the value of the token scheme. Will the council be reimbursed, or will that cost fall on the council tax payer? I am happy for the Under-Secretary to answer that later.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I shall deal with reimbursement in due course, but the short answer to the hon. Gentleman's question is that both choices will be available to pensioners in that district. The measure is intended to provide choice in such matters.
<P>
I shall continue with my tour d'horizon, I expect clause 129 to be academic only. The reserve free travel scheme has never been needed. The boroughs have always agreed a good scheme that is much valued by elderly and disabled Londoners, as my hon. Friend the Minister for Housing and Planning and I can certainly vouch. The scheme shows every sign of continuing for many more years. Indeed, the Greater London Authority Act 1999 ensures that boroughs can continue to provide travel concessions on the transport services that will be transferred from the control of London Transport to Transport for London under the mayor. Nothing in the Bill will require the London boroughs to change their current system.

<P>

<B>Mr. Gray:</B> The Under-Secretary applauds the London scheme, which provides concessionary travel for pensioners and disabled people, but he has not yet mentioned the disabled. If he is so proud that London has such a scheme, why are the disabled not included in the minimum terms referred to in the Bill?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for reminding me of my duties. It is absolutely my intention to deal with matters that relate to people with disability, which, as the hon. Gentleman has pointed out, is the subject of the Conservative amendment, but he will have to be patient for a moment because many other issues have been raised.
<P>
I turn first to those put forward by my hon. Friend the Member for Watford, who paid me a warm tribute. I am not sure that I can entirely live up to her expectations, but I shall do my best. She asked first about the legal advice that we have had on equalising the age of benefit, as it applies to clause 123. We are aware of the European Court decision on winter fuel payments. In our view, however, that decision does not lead across to concessionary fares. She alluded specifically to the case as the Atkins case: the Court ruled that that was not a social security benefit and therefore the directive on equal treatment in social security matters does not apply. I propose to return to this in due course. If my hon. Friend has further observations to make—from her body language, I deduce that she may—I will be willing to listen to them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> The Minister said that the Atkins case was about winter fuel payments. To make sure that the record is correct, it was not; it was the case about concessionary fares.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> Let me at this point say that I understand that was being intimated by my hon. Friend the Member for Watford and I accept that correction. I am grateful to the hon. Member for Bath.
<P>
Turning to a second point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Watford concerning the anxiety that local authorities with better schemes might use this as an opportunity to level down their provisions, I can reassure her that the Bill offers no reason to do so. Our proposals are about levelling up, not down. Local authorities are still free to offer better schemes and it has been pointed out that a number already do. The Bill provides a floor for beneficiaries; the wonderful Watford scheme, about which we heard in great detail, is entirely safe. We are all grateful that the Committee's attention has been drawn to this excellent Labour scheme.
<P>
That was the subject of a certain amount of reproof from the hon. Member for North Wiltshire. For the record it might be interesting for him to learn of the authorities that have no such concession scheme in place. There is Caradon, which has no overall control; Eden, Liberal Democrat; Campbeltown, Conservative; Kerrier, no overall control; Malvern Hills—no relation—no overall control; North Cornwall, independent; Penwith, no overall control; Scarborough—as pointed out by my hon. Friend the Member for Scarborough and Whitby (Mr. Quinn)—no overall control; and South Holland, which is, of course, Conservative. That is a record of shame that the Government intend to rectify.
<P>
<B>Mr. Quinn:</B> My hon. Friend may not be aware that there was a concessionary scheme in Scarborough until the early 1980s. A Conservative administration withdrew it because of what they regarded as budgetary constraints forced upon them by the Conservative central government.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend. For the record, let me make it clear that the winter fuel payment case was the Taylor case. The Atkins case was an earlier case, expressly about concessionary fares, in which the European Court of Justice found in favour of the UK Government.
<P>
My hon. Friend, the Member for Watford asked whether the scheme will be truly national, so that pensioners get half fares in every local authority. On that point I may have to disappoint her slightly. The present statutory arrangements are based on the principle of local authority discretion. Clauses in the Bill reflect that, leaving local authorities free to go beyond the national minimum and, after all, buses are essentially a local means of transport. The idea of a national bus pass is extremely interesting and perhaps an idea after which to strive. The bus industry may be interested in pursuing that commercially, but a local authority-based, national scheme could be bureaucratic, requiring many inter-authority reimbursement arrangements, similar to those with which we were saddled over the railways, post privatisation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Phil Woolas </B>(Oldham, East and Saddleworth): My hon. Friend may be interested to know about the national discount scheme that applies to all students on coach services and has operated successfully for many years.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> My hon. Friend speaks with authority since he was the founder and creator of that scheme. We offer him hearty congratulations on behalf of the millions who have subsequently benefited from his excellent leadership of the student movement.
<P>
I hasten on to the fourth point raised by my hon. Friend, the Member for Watford. She asked about provisions for local authorities to work together for journeys across areas. As she knows there is a county-wide scheme for Hertfordshire, where the districts have joined together in a ``go anywhere'' enhanced scheme. It goes without saying that Watford has a scheme for its own resident pensioners that is even more generous than that for the rest of Hertfordshire. That is entirely typical and predictable and once again we offer our congratulations to Watford. The Hertfordshire scheme demonstrates that county-wide, across-district, across-authority provision is possible, and that is reassuring.
<P>
Provisions already exist for joint working on the part of local authorities and, as I have demonstrated, these are used. Concessionary fares are the responsibility of councils at shire district level. For example, in East Sussex, West Sussex and Brighton and Hove, all districts have combined to offer a common pensioner's travel card. A single district can provide cheap travel in its vicinity, for example, to a local hospital or shopping centre beyond its boundaries. I hope that that will reassure other members of the Committee.
<P>
The hon. Member for Poole talked about compensation to local authorities. We estimate that £25 million will be the total extra cost of the scheme. That sum will be put into the standard spending assessments, to be spread equally among district councils. That principle is fair and reasonable, because it would be wrong to award only those authorities that have not spent so far.
<P>
Finally, on the points raised in the debate, as opposed to the amendments, my hon. Friend the Member for West Bromwich, East asked about the afternoon break in the west midlands scheme. Clause 124(1) defines ``relevant time'' as 9 am to 11 pm. We are due to debate start time shortly, but the implication in the Bill is that the west midlands PTA will have to offer at least the statutory minimum during those hours, early evening included.
<P>
I am conscious that I have spent a good deal of time responding to the concerns of colleagues and must now respond to the amendments that led to the debate. They raise interesting and important issues, such as those identified by the hon. Member for North Wiltshire, and I am grateful for the challenges that hon. Members have made. The amendments fall into three groups, to which I will respond in turn.
<P>
First, we have amendment No. 577 and the consequential amendment No. 579, which were tabled in the name of the hon. Member for Bath. They would equalise the age at which men and women become eligible for concessionary fares. At present, as we have heard, eligibility is tied to pension age: women qualify for the state pension at 60, while men have to wait until they are 65.
<P>
I recognise the strength of feeling behind the amendment. My ministerial postbag has made me well aware of the issue, so I have thought hard about it. However, it is not wrong in principle that there should be a link between the age at which one qualifies for a pension and the age at which one qualifies for financial help in the form of cheaper bus fares. It may be argued that, even if such a link is appropriate, it is wrong for the ages to be different for men and women.
<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I understand that argument, but Parliament has already legislated on that point. The Pensions Act 1995 provides for pensionable ages to be equalised; the age for men and women will be 65, and will be phased in between 2010 and 2020. That might seem a long way off to some of my hon. Friends—though not to others—but they must believe me when I say that the years will catch them up all too quickly. As legislation that addresses the issue is on the statute book, it would be wrong to accept those amendments.
<P>
Amendment No. 530 and the consequential amendment No. 531 were tabled in the name of the hon. Member for North Essex, (Mr. Jenkin), who is absent. I readily acknowledge the positive and benevolent instinct to extend the new statutory provisions to disabled as well as to elderly people. However, as Opposition Members will be the first to admit, we must consider issues such as cost before any such provision is incorporated in the Bill. None the less, I am reluctant to rule out any change of the kind outlined in the amendment, and the Government will certainly consider such a change most carefully. As hon. Members know, clause 125 contains a regulation-making power; it uses deliberately flexible terms to enable the statutory concession scheme to be varied, so an amendment is not the only way forward. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will feel able to withdraw his amendment on the basis of our undertaking to consider the matter carefully.
<P>
The third set of amendments includes amendment No. 578 and consequential amendments Nos. 580 to 583, which were tabled by the hon. Member for Bath. Their effect would be to extend the statutory minimum to the complete range of people identified in the existing legislation, most notably to all those aged under 16, and to those aged between 16 and 18 who are in full-time education. That would be a large step, all the more so as many bus operators already offer reduced fares to young people on a commercial basis, without any local authority money being involved. The result might simply be to transfer expenditure from the private to the public sector, with no difference to passengers.
<P>
It has been said before in Committee that Liberal Democrats belong to a tax and spend party, and this set of amendments confirms that view. The Government have clearly played their part in proper social provision by fulfilling their promise on fares for elderly people. We promise to consider the scope for extending it to people with disabilities, but the taxpayer must also be considered, so I cannot support the amendments. However, again I direct the hon. Gentleman to the power given in the Bill to extend the coverage of the statutory minimum by secondary legislation. The door is not closed to further changes in times to come. I make no promises at all, but given that the Bill provides for that flexibility, I hope that he will feel able to withdraw the amendments.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for his useful guided bus tour of concessionary fare schemes, and for the helpful way he has responded to points raised by hon. Members on both sides of the Committee. Many of us feel that we are now much wiser about the Government's intention in respect of the scheme. I also thank him for his willingness to consider extending one area at least of the concessionary fares scheme—that which applies to disabled people. Members of the Committee and many other people will welcome that commitment. The issue is one on which the hon. Gentleman and all members of the Committee have been extensively lobbied.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman is right to draw our attention to the regulatory powers that will allow for an extension of the concessionary fares scheme at a later date. That is a small chink in the door. He and the hon. Member for West Bromwich, East raised the question of the cost of extending the concessionary fares scheme and described the Liberal Democrats as a tax-and-spend party. I hope that the Under-Secretary is aware that there has been detailed analysis of the benefits of extending the scheme, which would reduce the number of car journeys and create huge savings. It can be demonstrated—subject to one caveat, to which I shall come later—that such an extension would create an overall saving for Great Britain plc. I am sure that the Under-Secretary will accept that. The caveat, as the Under-Secretary rightly said, is that some of those savings would go to the private sector, because of expenditure in the public sector. I acknowledge that problem, but it has more to do with the current accounting system than with my proposal.
<P>
I hope that the Committee, including the hon. Member for West Bromwich, East, will accept the broad principle that there will be huge savings from getting more people on to public transport. Congestion costs businesses about £20 billion a year and costs motorists £23 billion a year in increased charges, according to the latest figures from the RAC. There are huge overall savings to be made, although I accept that they would not necessarily fall into the coffers of the Exchequer or of local government. The Under-Secretary faces that difficulty.
<P>
Age equalisation is the crucial issue, to which I will come in a second. First, I should like to raise the issue of local authority schemes. The Under-Secretary gave an absolute assurance to the hon. Member for Watford and other members of the Committee that existing local authority schemes will be safe, because of the introduction of the Government's scheme. I have suggested that, although that may be the Government's intention—it is a worthy one, which I support—the hon. Gentleman should ask his officials and advisers whether that would be the case.
<P>
I gave the example of a scheme under which there was a flat fare of 40 per cent. of the full rate, regardless of the distance travelled. People travelling a short distance would pay rather more than the 50 per cent. envisaged by the Government, whereas those travelling longer distances would get a considerably better deal than those under the Government's scheme. Under such a scheme, those travelling short distances subsidise those on longer journeys. If the Government's scheme is to run alongside that, and if pensioners have the opportunity to choose, those travelling short distances will choose the Government's scheme, while those who travel long distances will choose the local authority scheme. That will diminish the effect of the subsidy in the local authority scheme, and the local authority will have to reduce the benefits of its scheme, unless additional money is made available. That is a hypothetical example to illustrate the concerns that have been raised, and which the Under-Secretary has not yet answered—he is waving his hand to indicate that he will now do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> There will be a need to adjust flat fare schemes so that for short distances they do not involve more than half fare. I do not apologise for that. It is not beyond the scope of a local authority of good will to be able to work out a solution and I do not see this as a major issue.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I am grateful for that candid answer. The hon. Gentleman was telling us earlier that it would be possible for the two schemes to operate side by side. It is now acknowledged that there would have to be a change to the type of scheme that I was describing. Of course I accept that amendments can be made to it, but some of the benefits of a flat-fare scheme will be lost. In that connection the hon. Member for Watford was given an assurance that I do not believe can entirely be met under the proposal, notwithstanding the enormous improved benefits that the scheme will bring generally.
<P>
The equalisation of the age at which men and women will be eligible for the scheme is of considerable importance to me. I had genuinely hoped that we would have heard a more positive response from the Under-Secretary. We have at the moment a glaring inequality, which is both outdated and unfair. In the year 2000 I had hoped that we would see an end to such discrimination between men and women.
<P>
In his response, the hon. Gentleman made two points: first, that a link already exists between pensionable age and concessionary fare schemes, and the question was whether that was reasonable. He argued that it probably was reasonable, yet he has referred to the Atkins case at the EU court in 1996. It concerned a concessionary fare scheme to which the hon. Member for Watford has already referred. Although the Under-Secretary is right to say that the Government were successful in their defence of the scheme at that time, the reason given in court was not that they were right in respect of the equalisation of age but that the case was deemed to be outside the remit of the legislation because included within the concessionary fare schemes were other categories of people including young travellers. For that reason the Government succeeded. However, the EU court made clear in its ruling that it did not believe that the link between pensionable age and concessionary fare schemes was justified. Because time is short I shall not detain the Committee by reading out extracts from the ruling, but it is clear that the Atkins case cannot be relied on by the Under-Secretary to demonstrate that a link between pensionable age and concessionary fares is reasonable. In the view of the European Union it is unreasonable, and in my view it is certainly unreasonable on moral grounds.
<P>
Secondly, the Under-Secretary said that he was sympathetic to the principle of equalisation but that we need not do anything about it because Parliament had already legislated by its proposals to equalise the pensionable age. That is a reasonable argument. We are grateful that Parliament has so legislated. However, that equalisation is not to take place until between 2010 and 2020. That is a long way off, not least to the hon. Member for West Bromwich, East. He will still have to wait until he is 65 before he can benefit from the scheme whereas females of his acquaintance will have to wait only until the age of 60.
<P>
<B>Mr. Snape:</B> First, I want to put on the record that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary is not that far behind me. Secondly, no female of my acquaintance would dare ask for a bus pass. [Laughter.]
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> Interventions from the hon. Gentleman are always helpful. A matter of principle is involved here. The Under-Secretary implied that he was sympathetic to the issue. He can do something about it—as I am sure he will acknowledge, the cost of equalisation is negligible, compared with the total cost of the scheme. That would right a long-standing wrong. Since 1975, when the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 and various other directives were passed, Parliament has, under all political parties, begun the move to end all forms of sex discrimination.
<P>
<H5>6.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Under-Secretary has asked me to withdraw the amendment. This is too important an issue on which to give way. It is a matter of principle for the Liberal Democrats, as for many people outside. I would like to press it to a Division.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The hon. Gentleman talks about giving me an opportunity; he nearly spoilt an opportunity for me a moment ago—I will not elaborate on that, although I was called to the Division rather abruptly. Nevertheless, I am delighted to be back in Committee.
<P>
The amendments are largely directed at ensuring that community transport and community dial-a-ride service—and, in the case of amendment 584, post buses, tramways and light rail—are specifically listed as being within the scope of the mandatory travel concession and are also made eligible for grants for bus operation and for local authorities.
<P>
The amendments are not appropriate or necessary, as I will explain in a moment. The hon. Member for Bath will be pleased to know that I shall not resort to argument C. I should say a few general words about community transport. We fully recognise the important role that community transport plays in the delivery of services to the public. There is a wide range of such services, very often dependent on the dedication, commitment and skill of volunteers. The services often meet needs that commercial operators running conventional scheduled services cannot, or do not, meet. The potential of community transport is particularly significant in rural areas, as we have recognised through our new funding for rural transport through the rural transport partnership and rural bus challenge schemes.
<P>
Last year, the Department published a review of the voluntary and community transport sector, which we commissioned from Steer Davies Gleave. It has been valuable in describing the broad span of the sector's activities, identifying problems and issues facing it, and producing recommendations. We are now considering those recommendations. As announced in the transport White Paper, we have also asked the Commission for Integrated Transport to examine financial support for bus services. The commission's study includes fuel duty rebate and possible changes to it.
<P>
I acknowledge that strong arguments have been made for extending the coverage of the fuel duty rebate. It is currently restricted to services that are local bus services registered with the Traffic Commissioner and available to the general public. Many dial-a-ride services or community transport services do not meet the present criteria—for example, the requirement that the service should be available to the general public. Fuel duty rebate was introduced as long ago as 1965 to support scheduled local bus services, which was a perfectly proper aim.
<P>
I should now make it clear that the purpose of clause 131 is to provide flexibility for future changes to grant arrangements. Therefore, the option of extending fuel duty rebate or some successor scheme will be kept open, thanks to the regulation-making powers in the clause. I assure the Committee that the arguments for inclusion of community transport are well recognised and will be most carefully considered, particularly in the light of the forthcoming recommendations from the Commission for Integrated Transport. It would not be right to pre-empt the views of the commission or to put an inflexible requirement into the Bill, but I assure the hon. Member for Bath that his concern is well recognised.
<P>
By the same token, I am reluctant to put into the Bill a requirement that community transport services should be brought within the scope of the national minimum concessionary fare scheme. I draw the Committee's attention again to the flexible regulation-making power in clause 125 that could bring in a range of other public passenger transport services. It is a wide definition and could cover trams, too. The provision was deliberately included to keep options open for the future. I must stress that local authorities have their own flexible discretionary powers to provide concessionary fares.
<P>
Amendment No. 540 similarly seeks to ensure that community transport and dial-a-ride services are eligible to benefit from the grants to local authorities for the provision of public transport services and facilities under clause 133. Again, clause 133 is drawn deliberately with breadth and flexibility in mind. That, for example, is why the term ``public passenger transport service'' is used, with its broad meaning. The Bill therefore will keep options open for the future and with the prospects perhaps of battles yet to come, and nothing lost here, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> The Minister said that nothing has been lost. May I suggest that a great deal has been gained. I am grateful to receive the Minister's assurances that the Government are looking at such matters and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 427, in page 71, line 42, leave out `qualifying for fuel duty grant' and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`in relation to which fuel used in operating the service fails to be taken into account for the purpose of calculating grant payable to the operator of the service under section 92 of that Act'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 429, 432, 434 and 439 to 441.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> These are technical amendments. Amendments Nos. 427, 434 and 440 are intended to make the Bill easier to read—something that we should all be delighted about—by removing from clause 138(7) a somewhat tortuous referential definition of
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>services qualifying for fuel duty grant.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Given that the expression appears once in the Bill, the need for a definition is unnecessary.
<P>
Amendment No. 439 enables section 112(2) of the Transport Act 1985 to be repealed along with other statutory references to fuel duty rebate when clause 131 comes into effect. Amendments Nos. 429 and 441 correct a drafting error, which would have meant that services provided under a quality contract would not have been eligible for receipt of fuel duty rebate. We made a mistake, but fortunately we have spotted it. Amendment No. 432 is concerned with paragraph 7 of schedule 10, the effect of which is to make a textual insertion into section 26(1)(b) of the Transport Act 1985 to apply the enforcement provisions in that Act to services operating under a quality partnership scheme. The amendment ensures that the necessary additional words are inserted at the right place in section 26.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 455, in page 72, line 11, leave out `9 a.m.' and insert `9.30 a.m.'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 456, in page 72, line 11, after `11 p.m.', insert `or longer'.
<P>
Government amendment No. 599.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> This may be the occasion on which I write my third letter and send a copy to you, Mr. Gale. Although the amendment is eminently sensible, we did not get it entirely right because we failed to draft the consequential amendment that is necessary for concessionary fares in London. I am therefore most grateful to the Minister for having drafted such an amendment. I assume that he will support amendment No. 455, so it seems pointless for me to go into further detail.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> The amendments concern the weekday times when the statutory minimum concessionary fare must be available. The first amendment concerns the time in the morning at which the scheme must start. I am glad to say that the Government can accept amendment No. 455. Of course, we are all cautious about restricting the availability of the statutory minimum scheme but, as the hon. Member for Bath said, there are good transport reasons for doing so. I have in mind particularly that, between 9 and 9.30 am, people may still be travelling to work and we should not risk overcrowding. Incidentally, as the hon. Gentleman said, Government amendment No. 599 is a consequential amendment for London.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman has now had so many successes that, instead of writing to his wife, he might consider visiting her. If he is flushed with the success of amendment No. 455, I hope that he will understand why we oppose amendment No. 456. It is unnecessary: local authorities remain free to go beyond the statutory minimum scheme in any respect and if they want to offer concessionary fares after 11 pm, they are entitled to do so. The point of the Bill must be to provide certainty about the legal obligation and I fear that the words ``or longer'', because they are indeterminate, would not achieve that. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept a one-one draw and withdraw amendment No. 456.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I am more than happy to accept a one-one draw. It would be helpful if, from time to time, the Hon. Gentleman would break away from his briefing notes. I was slightly embarrassed to hear him tell the Committee that I had given good reasons why my amendment should be accepted—having deliberately not given any. If the hon. Gentleman thought that my silence was a good reason for accepting the amendment, I might adopt a different strategy for my next batch of amendments.
