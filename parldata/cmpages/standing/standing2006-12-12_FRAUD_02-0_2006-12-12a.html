Douglas Hogg</b> (Sleaford and North Hykeham) (Con): Just in
time.</div><a name="0612134000021"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0612134000456"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> Just in time is always good enough. I thank the
Committee for agreeing to change the time of the sitting because it has
allowed colleagues the opportunity to speak on the urgent question in
the House. That was much appreciated.</div>
<a name="0612134000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment would delay for
two years the period before which the Bill comes into force. I put the
arguments for waiting to see how the changes already announced will
take place. My final argument was to do with the Government&#146;s
review. When do they expect to announce the its conclusions? The
consultation finished in October. I understood that we were to expect
an answer about now, and people will need to digest that. However, it
is another reason for giving Parliament, the Committee and the country
time to digest the implications of what has happened in the two years
since the Government thought we needed to proceed.</div>
<a name="0612134000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that the Committee can be
persuaded that it will be sensible not to rush any changes, even if
people are minded to support them in principle. I hope that we can
agree that it will be better to wait, take stock of where we are, and
then properly evaluate the best way to try cases of serious fraud. I
hope that that is an attractive argument.</div>
<a name="0612134000024"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0612134000457"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Dominic Grieve</b> (Beaconsfield) (Con): I
support the amendment. The hon. Gentleman touched on the fact that we
have a new Fraud Act&#151;the FraudAct 2006&#151;which has
not yet been fully implemented. There has also been no time for us to
understand the extent to which it will simplify trials.</div>
<a name="0612134000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">I mentioned an issue relating to
the Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act 2004, which is also highly
germane to the debate. Those who participated in the debates on that
Act will recollect that it contains a controversial provision that
attracted considerable 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column43" />Column number: 44</div>debate, but which the Conservatives did not seek to obstruct. That
provision allows for the trial of specimen counts in the case of
somebody who carries out what is described as repetitive criminality.
When a person has been convicted, it allows the judge alone to make a
finding of fact on the outstanding counts that have not been tried but
have used the same system to obtain something or otherwise to commit an
offence.</div><a name="0612134000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">The obvious
example is someone who uses a credit card 500 times fraudulently and
dishonestly to obtain goods or services. Rather than having to plough
through all 500 counts, one can pick two or three specimen counts to be
tried by jury. After the person has been convicted of those offences,
other offences that plainly bear the imprint of their criminality,
having been committed in the same period and starting with a specimen
count at the beginning and the end of a period, can be dealt with by a
judge on his own.</div> <a name="0612134000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
system existed informally in my early yearsat the Bar. It was
called taking offences into consideration. In that period, the system
that we had in place was that if a person would not agree to offences
being taken into consideration, the judge effectively took them into
consideration if he considered that the evidence of a person&#146;s
involvement was overwhelming. That system was overturned by the Court
of Appeal, which said that if a person disputed TICs, as they were
called, the outstanding offences could not go into the balance of the
sentencing process. The Government&#146;s proposal in the 2004 Act
was precisely to get around the problem by having a formal system of
adjudication on outstanding counts. Although some had concerns about
the extent to which it might usurp trial by jury, I for one considered
it to be a sensible way to
proceed.</div><a name="0612134000028"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0612134000458"></a><b class="B">Mr.
David Heath</b> (Somerton and Frome) (LD): My recollection of
our proceedings on the 2004 Act coincide with the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s. Although we had reservations, we all felt that that
was a sensible way to proceed for precisely the reason of exposing the
full criminality&#151;I believe that is the phrase the
Solicitor-General likes to use&#151;without placing too onerous a
duty on the jury. Why on earth it has not been implemented, God only
knows.</div>
<a name="0612134000029"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0612134000459"></a>Mr.
Grieve:</b> The hon. Gentleman, with whom I have shared many
hours in Committee on numerous Bills, mainly in the field of criminal
justice, takes the words out of my mouth because that is precisely the
point I was about to move on to.</div>
<a name="0612134000030"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0612134000460"></a>The
Solicitor-General (Mr. Mike O'Brien):</b> Will the
hon. Gentleman give way?</div>
<a name="0612134000031"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0612134000461"></a>Mr.
Grieve:</b> I will in a moment when I have made another
point.</div> <a name="0612134000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">Seeing that the
measure was specifically designed to expose the full criminality in a
way that provides reassurance of the maintenance of the principle of
jury trial, it is odd that the principle and the power in the 2004 Act
should have been ignored by the Government in the current proposals.
The situation is all the odder because the 2004 Act has been on the
statute book for some little time. The Minister will be able to tell us
exactly how many months, or years, but we are talking 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column44" />Column number: 45</div>about a considerable period. Yet I understand from a comment this
morning that a particular clause dealing with this procedure, which I
would have thought would have been fairly easy to implement, has not
yet been implemented and is not due to be implemented until January
2007.</div>
<a name="0612134000033"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0612134000462"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> Will my hon. Friend give
way?</div><a name="0612134000034"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0612134000463"></a>Mr.
Grieve:</b> I had better be fair and give way to the
Solicitor-General first.</div>
<a name="0612134000035"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0612134000464"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> I am curious because as the hon.
Gentleman supported the provision, I would have thought that he
understood its purpose. It seems that he did not. The particular
provision to which he refers, in the 2004 Act, relates to the charging
of specimen counts that deal with the same sorts of other counts which
are subsequently the subject of
sentencing.</div><a name="0612134000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">The role of
such a trial is to deal with a wide range of activities. They are not
the same. They may in some cases be broadly similar, but they may
indeed be different. Therefore the prosecution of fraud may involve the
prosecution not of a range of identical offences, but a broad range of
fraudulent activity which may go across a whole series of transactions,
some of which may be similar and some of which may not. Therefore, what
the hon. Gentleman is talking about, and what we are talking about in
the prosecution of fraud, may well be entirely different things, and
that is why one does not deal with the other.
</div><a name="0612134000037"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0612134000465"></a>Mr.
Grieve:</b> I listened carefully to what the Solicitor-General
said and I am now even more puzzled by what the Government are
intending to do in this Bill.</div>
<a name="0612134000038"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0612134000466"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. Amendment No. 1 to clause 4 has a
relatively limited scope. It concerns the commencement date and the
territorial coverage, both of which matters the hon. Gentleman will be
well familiar with. He may periodically animadvert to, but he may not
dilate upon matters that are outwith the terms of the Bill or the
amendment.</div>
<a name="0612134000039"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0612134000467"></a>Mr.
Grieve:</b> Mr. Bercow, I am
grateful to you for reminding me of the scope of the amendment, but I
hope that you will be able to rule at least in order that we are
dealing with delay. One of the arguments for delay is to see how the
impact of the 2004 Act provisions may work in practice after it has
been implemented at the end of January. I will do my best not to
digress too much, but the Solicitor-General has raised an issue, to
which I hope I can respond promptly and expeditiously. He suggests that
in fact there is a completely different effect that is not germane to
the issue under consideration. Of course, I will be mindful that I must
not stray into a general debate on a clause in a separate
Bill.</div>
<a name="0612134000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Solicitor-General puzzled me because, while I accept entirely that
fraud may not necessarily be a systems offence, with a repetition of
the same format time over time&#151;although it very often
is&#151;he raises a separate issue, which I hope we can properly
consider without straying too far. Even if we have trial by judge
alone, that does not justify lumping together in one trial a series of
separate fraudulent activities. I simply suggest 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column45" />Column number: 46</div>to the Solicitor-General that if a prosecutor attempts to do that, the
rules in front of a judge alone would apply exactly as they would in
front of a jury and he might well be prevented from doing that, because
it could be extremely unfair to a defendant. I hope that the
Solicitor-General can provide clarification on that. If we are dealing
with one fraud concerning extorting money from A and one from B, I
would not necessarily assume that they would be allowed to be tried
together.</div> <a name="0612134000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the main
point, it seems to me that the 2004 Act provision on specimen counts is
potentially sufficiently germane to the issue under consideration that
we ought to have an opportunity to see how it works. In many cases, I
think that it will greatly shorten trials. Prosecutors will be able to
select specimen counts in many instances of fraud which involve a
system and try those quickly with the reassurance that at the end the
judge will assess the full criminality by a speedy method that does not
involve a jury. Therefore, it drives something of a coach and horses
through one of the Government&#146;s principal arguments. For that
reason, and without wishing to digress too far into the principles of
the Bill, it seems a powerful argument for saying, &#147;Let&#146;s
wait and see how this works in practice,&#148; before we move to a
highly controversial measure that departs from our established
principles and practices of trial by jury.</div>
<a name="0612134000042"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0612134000468"></a><b class="B">Stephen
Hesford</b> (Wirral, West) (Lab): I made a similar point on
Second Reading. Does the hon. Gentleman accept that while a High Court
judge listening to an application could take the matters that the hon.
Gentleman describes into account, that would have the same effect as
looking at the system of report? If in reviewing these things a High
Court judge and/or the Lord Chief Justice judged it as a relevant
matter and it was argued before them, they would take it into account.
No doubt, if it was powerful they would refuse the application for the
non-jury trial.</div>
<a name="0612134000043"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0612134000469"></a>Mr.
Grieve:</b> I accept that the hon. Gentleman makes an
absolutely valid point. When an application is made for having a trial
by judge alone, I can see that it would be possible for defence counsel
to argue that in such a case, as part of the other arguments that could
be advanced, it could have a jury trial because we could proceed on
specimen counts and have it tried separately thereafter.</div>
<a name="0612134000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although I
accept that that is a perfectly good argument, my point is simply that,
for reasons that are philosophically based, I do not like departing
from the principal of trial by jury. On the whole, experience shows
that if a mechanism or power is provided, it sometimes ends up being
used when it might not necessarily be needed. As I disagree with the
Government on that, I would much prefer to give the new systems
established in the Fraud Act 2006, which were touched on by the hon.
Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey, and the 2004 Act the chance
to bed in. We might all end up with an agreement in two years&#146;
time between the Solicitor-General, the Attorney-General and myself,
with everybody saying, &#147;Actually, as it&#146;s turned out, we
now realise that this really isn&#146;t necessary,&#148; at which
point we can be convivial and stop disagreeing, which on the whole is a
good thing</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0612134000470"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> I would be surprised if we managed to do
that.</div><a name="0612134000046"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0612134000471"></a>Mr.
Grieve:</b> My right hon. and learned Friend, who has much
longer experience of parliamentary life than I have, is probably right
in his gentle pessimism about the state of politics and the
disagreements that spring up. It is nevertheless a laudable aim,
especially in this season, and I ask the Solicitor-General to bear that
in mind. I am happy to support the
amendment.</div><a name="0612134000420"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.45
pm</div><a name="0612134000047"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0612134000472"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> With regard to what my hon. Friend the Member for
Beaconsfield said, let us be clear that I never see it as my business
to agree with the Government. I will stand in the way of a great
majority of their policies with as much energy as possible, regardless
of the season.</div><a name="0612134000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is
not the burden of what I want to say, however. I want to support the
hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey and I have four reasons
for doing so. First, I entirely agree with what the hon. Gentleman and
my hon. Friend said about the implications of section 17 of the
Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act 2004. It will clearly make a
huge difference to the approach of courts in criminal cases, because
once a light indictment may be the charge in all but the most serious
of accounts, with the rest to be taken without the jury by the judge
alone, that will make a difference to the length of trials that are
currently deemed to be burdensome because of their length. I say to the
Government that, from their perspective, they will do well to bring in
section 17 and allow considerable time for it to be worked through, so
that one can see its consequences.</div>
<a name="0612134000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">My second point relates to case
management powers. The courts are becoming increasingly accustomed to
using robust case management powers. These have been in existence for
some time, but the courts inevitably take time to become fully
acquainted with them and to work them through. When used by a robust
judge with a co-operative prosecution, the powers can go a long way to
reduce the complexity and length of trials. I hope that the judiciary
would be encouraged by the senior judiciary to use the powers in a
robust manner. I think that it will, and that will be relevant to the
subject that we are
discussing.</div><a name="0612134000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
third point harks back to the undertakings that were given by the
former Home Secretary. We have been through the argument of whether
there has been proper discussion. We have heard the
Solicitor-General&#146;s explanation, and the Committee will make up
its own mind. Some of us might think that a satisfactory discharge of
the undertakings that were given did not take place. Time would enable
the Home Secretary of the day properly to discharge the undertakings
given by his predecessor. I would regard that as a good
thing.</div><a name="0612134000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">Lastly
and differently, my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield made some
important points about the difficulties that will occur in the court of
a trial by judge alone. The issue was raised on Second Reading.
Currently, the judge is a judge of law and the jury is a judge of fact.
The judge makes rulings on a range of procedural matters, such as those
relating to admissibility. If he decides in favour of the
defence&#151;these are only 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column47" />Column number: 48</div>examples&#151;previous convictions, hearsay evidence or alleged
admissions never go before the jury. When the judge is judge of both
law and fact, he makes those rulings and is aware of the underlying
facts, whether he deems them to be admissible or not. The problem will
become even greater when there is an application for public interest
immunity. The hon. and learned Member for Medway (Mr.
Marshall-Andrews) talked about this point at considerable length and
with great eloquence. I am sorry that he is not on the Committee; it
would have more fun had he been so.</div>
<a name="0612134000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">There will
have to be a lot of practice directions, and perhaps statutory
instruments, to give effect to the procedural solutions that will be
required. I would not be wholly surprised if the reason that section 17
of the 2004 Act has not been introduced is that the Department for
Constitutional Affairs and the Home Office have had some difficulty in
drafting the necessary consequential orders and practice directions
along with the Chief Justice. A delay of two years or so would be
useful in that connection. In the end, however, the proposals are
thoroughly bad and any delay is worth having; after all, the thing
might sink.</div>

support the observations of my right hon. and learned Friend the Member
for Sleaford and North Hykeham, my hon. Friend the Member for
Beaconsfield, and the hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey,
and I shall supplement them with a couple from my own comparatively
recent experience. I was not, of course, a Member at the time of the
agreements, so I could not be a party to them. That gave me the
opportunity to be active in the criminal justice system, at least on a
part-time basis&#151;an activity that, lest it ever be discussed in a
focus group in south-east London, I should emphasise has ceased since I
became a Member.</div>
<a name="0612134000054"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0612134000474"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> May I encourage my hon. Friend to remain active at
the criminal Bar? That will enable him to say no to the Whips whenever
he chooses.</div>
<a name="0612134000055"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0612134000475"></a>Robert
Neill:</b> I shall take my right hon. and learned
Friend&#146;s very sage advice. If he ever needs a good junior he
will know where to come.</div>
<a name="0612134000056"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0612134000476"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> If he ever needs a good leading counsel, I am
here.</div><a name="0612134000057"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0612134000477"></a>Robert
Neill:</b> I fear that my diary may get in the way of that at
the moment.</div> <a name="0612134000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">My recent
experience reinforces my hon. and learned Friend&#146;s point about
the desirability of delaying implementation, a point that has been well
made in relation to section 17. Just before I entered the House, I
prosecuted a fraud case that was not so substantial as to qualify under
the serious fraud provisions, but complex nevertheless&#151;it
involved something of the order of 250 separate transactions. I have no
doubt that those who instructed me would have been delighted, as would
I, had I been able to use the section 17 provisions, so that we could
have had a short trial on, say, the six counts that embraced the
criminality. The judge would then have had the totality of the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column48" />Column number: 49</div>picture and been able to deal with matters in sentencing. That is why I
intervened on the Minister earlier: full criminality is most important
in sentencing rather than in anything else, and we can get where we
need to be on sentencing by implementing section
17.</div><a name="0612134000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">Two years&#146;
delay would give us the opportunity to work out how to do that
sensibly, because there is much good will for section 17&#151;among
practitioners, prosecutors and the judiciary. It would also give us the
chance to see how the Criminal Procedure Rules 2005 work out. The
resident judges and those more likely to deal with more complex cases
in the courts where I practised have been enthusiastic and willing to
take the greater case management role on board. There has been good
co-operation from the Bar, from solicitors and from the prosecuting
authorities. None the less, we are only 18 months into that
regime&#151;not very long in the life of some of the complex
cases&#151;and matters will take a little time. It would be sensible
to have an additional two years to see how things work out in practice.
My right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Sleaford and North
Hykeham has already argued for the accompanying statutory instruments,
protocols and procedures, and I shall not repeat his argument, which
was well made.</div> <a name="0612134000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
final argument for delay is that it would give time for the Government
to reflect on the comment made by the Solicitor-General in response to
my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield. That response troubled me
as much as I believe it troubled my hon. Friend, and it surprised me a
little as well. The Solicitor-General said that the indictment could
cover a whole range of criminal activities, some of which might be
similar and some of which might not. On the face of it, that raises the
question whether the Government are proposing to revisit the joinder
rules.</div><a name="0612134000061"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0612134000478"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> The answer is no, as far as we are
concerned. There will of course need to be a link between charges, but
they do not have to relate to the same sort of offence. The Domestic
Violence, Crime and Victims Act dealt with cases in which there was
replication of pretty much identical activities, so that a specimen
charge could easily be used. By contrast, we are dealing here with a
range of behaviour, and what is happening in fraud trials is that cases
are being split and charges are being reduced, so we need to ensure
that the full range of the fraudster&#146;s behaviour can be brought
before the
court.</div><a name="0612134000062"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0612134000479"></a>Robert
Neill:</b> I am grateful to the Solicitor-General for that
clarification, but from what he said it seems to me that the normal
rules about a nexus being found should
apply.</div><a name="0612134000063"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0612134000480"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> I am not implying that. Of course there
will be some nexus between the charges against a defendant, but that
does not mean that all the items brought before the court need to be
identical. The provisions that the hon. Gentleman is addressing in
section 17 relate to charges for virtually identical behaviour. We are
considering a range of behaviour, which may well have a nexus but is
carried out in a range of ways.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column49" />Column number: 50</div><a name="0612134000064"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0612134000481"></a>Robert
Neill:</b> I am grateful again to the Solicitor-General. That
clarifies his position but does not assuage my concern&#151;in fact,
it increases it. It might be legitimate for the Government to make
changes by another route, but if we are to change the
approachto admissibility, that is another reason to have a
good deal of time to consider the matter. It would be a substantial
departure, and it would be troubling as a matter of principle if there
were to be special rules on what can be joined on to an indictment for
one class of crime, or indeed the one class of fraud covered by the
Bill. I urge the Government to think again about that, and two years
would give them time to do
so.</div><a name="0612134000065"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0612134000482"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> It would give the Government time not only to think
again but to consult. The Solicitor-General&#146;s suggestion might
well require a substantial amendment to the Indictments Act
1915.</div><a name="0612134000066"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0612134000483"></a>Robert
Neill:</b> My right hon. and learned Friend is absolutely
right and brings me back to the point that I made before the
Solicitor-General helpfully intervened. If there has to be such an
amendment, which seems to me the logical consequence of what the
Solicitor-General is saying, we need time to get it right, even leaving
aside the
principle.</div><a name="0612134000067"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0612134000484"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> The hon. Gentleman and his colleague,
the right hon. and learned Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham, are
getting a little carried away with their argument. We do not need to
change the nexus rules in relation to trials, nor do we need to amend
the way in which indictments are drafted. We need to ensure that we can
establish in court the full culpability of fraud defendants so that
justice can be done. I notice that the hon. Gentleman winks at his
colleague because he has drawn me to clarify the situation, which I
hope I have done. I hope that he accepts my
position.</div><a name="0612134000068"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0612134000485"></a>Robert
Neill:</b> I am grateful to the Solicitor-General, which I am
becoming used to. With respect, he has not answered my principal point.
If we are to move towards putting a defendant&#146;s total
criminality before one tribunal of both fact and law, it is important
that we get the procedural rules correct. To start the new system only
two months after the Bill is passed and without consultation, as my
right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham
said, seems dangerous even from the Government&#146;s point of view,
leaving aside our objections to the proposal. If the Government are to
make this change then, for heaven&#146;s sake, they must take the
time to ensure that they get it right. That is why I beseech the
Government to reconsider being so arbitrary about the Bill&#146;s
commencement.</div><a name="0612134000069"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0612134000486"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department (Joan
Ryan):</b> We have had a lively debate. I
was struck at the beginning of our proceedings this afternoon by the
sight of the hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey. He rushed
in and could hardly draw breath before he urged us not to rush. I
assure him that we are not rushing and that we have given the matter
long and full consideration. Our debate this morning demonstrated that,
and the problem 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column50" />Column number: 51</div>in question has been recognised and considered for not years, months or
days but decades. The idea that we have rushed into anything is, to say
the least, an
exaggeration.</div><a name="0612134000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman and other hon. and right hon. Members seem to cleave to
the idea that if only we were to wait long enough, the need for serious
fraud trials to be considered without a jury would somehow disappear.
The Government do not share their optimism. It is recognised that the
problem has existed for at least20 years and we do not believe
that such measures as the Fraud Act 2006 or the Lord Chief
Justice&#146;s protocols in 2005, although admirable, will be
sufficient to deal with the
issue.</div>
<a name="0612134000421"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5
pm</div><a name="0612134000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">Right hon. and
hon. Members have asked that we wait for some of the other measures. As
has been said, the Fraud Act comes into force on 15 January 2007. As I
understand it, the Act deals with the substance and definition of
fraud, as opposed to the process by which we deal with it, which is
addressed by the Bill before us. I reject the points made my Opposition
Members about waiting until the Act is in
force.</div>
<a name="0612134000072"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0612134000487"></a>Mr.
Grieve:</b> Does the Minister not agree that those two things
are linked? One of the arguments that is made persistently in fraud
cases&#151;I use that word generically because, sometimes, such cases
might concern obtaining property by deception&#151;is that the
concepts are complex. With the support of the other place and both
sides of the House, the Government have tried to simplify the law in
relation to fraud, which ought to make the trials themselves simpler.
That goes to the heart of this
legislation.</div><a name="0612134000073"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0612134000488"></a>Joan
Ryan:</b> That something is linked does not mean that it is
the same, or can be dealt with in the same way.
</div><a name="0612134000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">An
important point was made on Second Reading, to which I am sure that
hon. Members were listening, but I shall reiterate it because otherwise
Committee members, and anyone reading these proceedings, might assume
that we have not adopted a strategic approach, and that this problem
has just leapt in front of us and did not exist before. When my hon.
and learned Friend the Solicitor-General opened Second Reading
proceedings, he
stated:</div><a name="0612134000075"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Our
policy has four main strands. We recently took through the House the
Fraud Act
2006&#148;&#151;</div><a name="0612134000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">that has
been referred
to&#151;</div><a name="0612134000077"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;which
will create a statutory offence of fraud and modernise much of our law
on deception. Secondly, the Government have also carried out a
cross-departmental review of fraud to examine the prevention,
detection, investigation, prosecution and punishment of
fraud.&#148;</div><a name="0612134000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was asked about
that. He
continued:</div><a name="0612134000079"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
published a report in July, and consultation finished on 27 October. We
are now considering our response.&#148;</div>
<a name="0612134000080"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0612134000489"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> Under the timetable that the
Minister has given us, a cross-departmental report is likely in
January. We have seen the consultation document. Does she accept that
it is likely to suggest improvements to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column51" />Column number: 52</div>the process in order to increase the chances of a conviction? They are
all good ideas and none of them requires a change in the method of
trial, but other things will improve the
process.</div><a name="0612134000081"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0612134000490"></a>Joan
Ryan:</b> I am pleased that the hon. Gentleman thinks that
they are good ideas. I am sure that good ideas will come forward.
However, that in no way contradicts or undermines what I said about the
four-pronged approach&#151;the &#147;four main strands&#148;.
Such things work together and I think that a strategic approach has
many advantages. We need to plumb that at the outset, not in
retrospect. That is what I was talking about.</div>
<a name="0612134000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">The third strand deals with the
new protocols and procedures for our courts, which have been referred
to, and case management. I shall return to what the Solicitor-General
said on Second
Reading:</div><a name="0612134000394"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Bill is the fourth element. It will reform our criminal justice system
to enable it more effectively to try a small number of serious and
complex frauds without a jury.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report</i>,
29 November 2006; Vol. 453, c. 1088.]</div>
<a name="0612134000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">I repeat the point about &#147;serious
and complex frauds&#148; because they are the point of the measures.
Although all the other measures will help in various ways in lots of
other cases, we do not believe that they will address the burdensome
nature of serious and complex fraud trials.</div>
<a name="0612134000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having said
that, let me respond to the point made by the hon. Member for
Beaconsfield about how the Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act
2004 applies, and why its provisions have not been implemented. It was
necessary to make rules of court, and those took effect in England and
Wales in November and will apply to Northern Ireland from January 2007.
The relevant provisions of the 2004 Act will therefore be commenced in
January, and they are not aimed at section 43 cases&#151;cases of
serious and complex fraud. On that point, I return to the comment of my
hon. and learned Friend: fraud trials may relate to dissimilar or
similar acts, so the specimen credit card fraud cases given as examples
by the hon. Member for Beaconsfield might not be relevant to cases of
serious and complex fraud. It is not argued that that Act will deal
with the issue that this Bill attempts to
address.</div><a name="0612134000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">Mindful
of your warnings about straying too far, Mr. Bercow, I shall
attempt to rein in my comments and return to the amendment tabled by
the hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey. He said that it
sought to change the commencement period from eight weeks to two years.
I refer him to the point made this morning by the Solicitor-General.
Commencement of the Bill will amend section 43, but commencement of
section 43 itself depends on a commencement order under the 2003 Act,
so the hon. Gentleman need not get too worked up about undue
haste.</div> <a name="0612134000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me say a
word on a couple of other issues, so as to ensure that I have answered
as far as possible every point that was raised. I think that it was the
hon. Member for Beaconsfield who talked about convictions and the role
of the judge and, in a case with a jury, of the jury. The Lord Chief
Justice will need to consider procedural rules, but there is not a
problem in, for example, the Diplock courts, or for district judges and
magistrates, who try cases without juries. Examples of endurance trials
already exist, so that addresses that point.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column52" />Column number: 53</div><a name="0612134000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">Questions were asked&#151;also,
I think, by the hon. Member for Beaconsfield&#151;about the way in
which prosecution applications under section 43 will be made in
circumstances involving sensitive information. That relates to the
point that I have just made. Concern has been expressed about the
potential for unfairness to defendants in cases in which a judge
considers a public interest immunity application and then goes on to
conduct the trial. The Government are confident that existing public
interest immunity procedures are fair and effective and do not in any
way endanger the rights of defendants. Currently, lay magistrates,
district judges and others hear public interest immunity applications
and then go on to find the facts. I hope that that lays that point to
rest, or at least answers it, even if it is not a response with which
the hon. Gentleman is satisfied.</div>
<a name="0612134000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">I believe that I have covered
the points that hon. Members raised about measures that we have taken
in our overall strategy and shown why the fourth part of that strategy
is important. The Bill should not be delayed, and it cannot be replaced
with the other measures that we are taking. The Government&#146;s
unshaken view is that, in a small number of serious and complex fraud
cases, trial without a jury is the best solution. We remain committed
to the provision in section 43 and can see no grounds for delaying its
introduction yet further. I therefore ask the hon. Member for North
Southwark and Bermondsey to withdraw the amendment. If he does not, I
will urge hon. Members to vote against
it.</div><a name="0612134000089"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0612134000491"></a>Mr.
Heath:</b> On the basis of that response, I hope that my hon.
Friend the Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey will not withdraw
his amendment. It seemed to me that in setting out the
Government&#146;s strategy, the Minister made it abundantly clear
that it is based on an ex cathedra statement that they will proceed
irrespective of the evidence and the effect of the other measures that
are being taken.</div>
<a name="0612134000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">It has always
been suggested that the Bill is needed because of the complexity of the
cases in question and the strain that they put on juries. However, the
Minister said clearly that the fourth element of the
Government&#146;s strategy&#151;to proceed with the removal of
trial by jury&#151;will be unaffected by the other measures being
taken. She said that even if the existing legislation, the changes to
procedural rules and the redefinition of the offence of fraud were
proved substantially to reduce the complexity of cases and the time
that they take, they would have no effect on the Government&#146;s
intention to remove the jury from trials in complex fraud
cases.</div>
<a name="0612134000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am left to
conclude that the Government&#146;s intention lies in a vacuum and is
not based on any evidence of a requirement. It is certainly not based
on the view, which is held on these Benches and was displayed by some
Labour Members on Second Reading, although possibly not those in the
Committee, that jury trial is a good in itself. It is part of the
judicial system of England and Wales and should not be dispensed with
unless there are very strong arguments for doing so. Such arguments
have not been adduced by the Minister, who is impervious to any
rational explanation involving other measures that have been taken. I
hope that my hon. Friend will not withdraw his amendment and that we
shall have the opportunity to divide on it.</div>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column53" />Column number: 54</div><a name="0612134000092"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0612134000492"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> Even if I had started to wobble, my hon. Friend
would have prevented me from going too far. I was not tempted to
wobble, because I have listened carefully to the Minister and the
Solicitor-General, as I did on Second Reading. I wish to deal with the
matter, because there is no point in failing to confront the issues put
forward by the
Government.</div><a name="0612134000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
two up-front, objective reasons why the Government are still pushing
for this fourth strand in their set of measures. There is also one
unspoken reason, which I believe might be the motive behind the two
spoken reasons. The three strands that are not to do with trial by jury
are on case management, procedural changes and so on. They address, in
part, one of the Government&#146;s two objectives, which is to get
rid of the burdensome nature of trial by jury. I understand that
argument. If you, Mr. Bercow, I, or anybody else were called
for jury service, as we are eligible to be, and found ourselves on a
case that was to last for six months, it would be
burdensome&#151;more so for some people than others. I am not naive
about that. Some of the changes announced in the past two years are
specifically intended to address that point. Let me give the Government
the objective evidence&#151;it was not concocted either by me or the
Solicitor-General.</div>
<a name="0612134000422"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.15
pm</div><a name="0612134000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
had the report on the Jubilee line case. Quite rightly, the report,
produced by Her Majesty&#146;s chief inspector of the Crown
Prosecution Service, a Government appointee, looked into why that case
went wrong.</div>

<a name="0612134000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">I concede that the executive
summary of the chief inspector&#146;s report
stated:</div><a name="0612134000395"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Seen
from the perspective of the jury, the trial was a quite intolerable
burden.&#148;</div><a name="0612134000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clearly, the
inspector looking into the Jubilee line case said that it was
burdensome for the jury.</div>
<a name="0612134000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for Beaconsfield
quoted the evidence of jurors, which, unusually, was in the public
domain because the trial was discontinued. The inspector reported that
the trial was burdensome not because the jurors did not understand it
or because the issues were burdensome but, putting it bluntly, because
the trial went on for so long, in an uncontrolled way, and the judge
did not appear to have a full grip of the case. Gradually, things
started unwrapping.</div>
<a name="0612134000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">There have been burdensome
cases.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0612134000495"></a>Stephen
Hesford:</b> I am obliged to the hon. Gentleman for giving
way. He was, I believe, in the Chamber on Second Reading; indeed, he
led for the Liberals. The Solicitor-General made it plain, time and
time again, that in persuading people that we need these measures, the
Jubilee line case was not relied on. It seems to me to be wrong for the
hon. Gentleman to waste the Committee&#146;s time quoting a case on
which the Government did not rely, and which is not germane to
proceedings.</div>
<a name="0612134000102"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0612134000496"></a>Simon

states:</div>

is its identification of a consensus that no trial should be permitted
to exceed three months or an outer limit of six months, save in
exceptional
circumstances.&#148;</div><a name="0612134000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those are

point.</div>
<a name="0612134000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">One of the
things that has been done since the Jubilee line trial is the
introduction of a protocol that says, &#147;We will have shorter
trials. This is the way to do it. In procedural terms, here is the way
in which you can have much shorter trials.&#148; That is one of the
things that will lift the burden. In fact, the Government have argued
that the main element of the burden is the length of
trial.</div>

contemplates is that the indictment should only cover the central
material on which the Crown needs to rely, and that the concept of full
criminality should play no part in the
indictment.</div>
<a name="0612134000108"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0612134000498"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> That is correct and the right hon. and learned
Gentleman made the point well. We have discussed in the debate and in
others why the &#147;whole criminality&#148; point is not valid. It
is not compatible with any other part of the criminal justice system,
nor is it necessary to secure justice. That is the issue.</div>
<a name="0612134000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">I asked the Solicitor-General,
and he gave me a perfectly reasonable answer, to show us why we have a
continuing problem post the Jubilee line case. The case is relatively
old and has not been relied on. The Solicitor-General cited three cases
that he said gave rise to the problem being one that the three strands
are not sufficient to address, and that a fourth strand is required. He
said:</div> <a name="0612134000397"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;There is
a serious history of such proposals, and eminent judges have made
reports&#148;</div><a name="0612134000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">but</div><a name="0612134000398"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Since
the passing of the Criminal Justice Act
2003&#148;</div><a name="0612134000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">&#151;so, since
the last time we looked at these
issues&#151;</div><a name="0612134000399"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;there has
been further evidence of the importance of introducing such a measure.
I referred to cases that had to be severed. In the Talbot Village Trust
case, completed in 2004, the trial judge had to order the prosecution
case to be reduced for management reasons. Again, in the Versailles
case of 2004, which involved Cushnie and others, the judge ordered
three counts against one of the defendants to be severed in the
interests of trial management.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report</i>,
29 November 2006;Vol. 453, c. 1132.]</div>
<a name="0612134000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">He also mentioned a third case, that of
the Global Wildlife Trust.</div>
<a name="0612134000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">Were those cases evidence of an
unsuccessful outcome? I was assisted by a young Mr.
McCracken&#151;a lawyer of the future working in my office. It would
be a slight overstatement to say that his research required great
skill, because the availability of the web and the Serious Fraud Office
website enabled us to find a summary. With him looking up the cases for
me, I discovered the details. Neither case was a failure.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column55" />Column number: 56</div><a name="0612134000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">The press release concerning the
first, dated16 February 2004 and
entitled</div><a name="0612134000400"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Fraud
on charity hidden in &#163;15 million building
contracts&#148;</div><a name="0612134000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">said:</div><a name="0612134000401"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Three
construction industry professionals were convicted today at Winchester
Crown Court for defrauding the Talbot Village Trust in Dorset of
&#163;3.5 million through manipulation of building contracts. The
fraud related to six contracts totalling &#163;15 million and
involved invoicing for work not done and disguising inflated
professional fees in the
contracts.&#148;</div><a name="0612134000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
accept that that case had gone on for a relatively long time; it had
started in the magistrates court in 2001. However, although two
defendants were acquitted, three were convicted. Unless the Minister is
going to say that a case that results in any acquittals is a
failure&#151;not an argument that I hope anyone would make&#151;the
serious punishments that were awarded for those offences prove that the
case did not, in fact, fail.</div>
<a name="0612134000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">The other case was the
Versailles case concerning Carlton Cushnie, who is based in my
constituency. The Serious Fraud Office press release of 29 June 2005
was
entitled</div><a name="0612134000402"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Versailles case: Carlton Cushnie ordered to
pay&#148;</div><a name="0612134000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">and
said:</div><a name="0612134000403"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Carlton
Ellington Cushnie was ordered today at Southwark Crown Court to pay
over &#163;10 million by way of confiscation in relation to the
Versailles fraud.</div><a name="0612134000404"></a><div class="hs_brev">This
hearing arises from Cushnie's conviction on 25 May 2004, and sentencing
on 8 June 2004 when he received six years imprisonment and was
disqualified from acting as a company director for 10 years. The
sentence was handed down for conspiring to defraud private investors
who provided monies to Versailles Traders Limited and Trading Partners
Limited. The earliest Cushnie can be released from prison is 8 June
2007.&#148;</div><a name="0612134000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">So
the two cases that were readily accessible on the SFO website were not
unsuccessful. Convictions and significant imprisonment were secured in
both, and one secured a huge financial penalty. There were two
acquittals in one of the cases, but it was possible to present to the
juries both the seriousness of the cases and the breadth of the
criminality involved. The juries&#151;one in Winchester and one in
Southwark&#151;reached guilty verdicts.</div>
<a name="0612134000120"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0612134000499"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> I shall not try to
make my point by way of intervention, and we shall perhaps have the
opportunity to deal with it later. I shall merely say that, in the case
of Talbot Village Trust, the judge ordered that the scope of the
prosecution case should be reduced for trial management reasons. In the
SFO&#146;s opinion, that reduction made the case appear disjointed,
and undermined the prosecution case in a number of key areas, although
it was none the less successful. There is capability to succeed, but
the SFO was concerned about the way in which the case proceeded as a
result of the
decision.</div><a name="0612134000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
conscious of your strictures, Mr. Bercow, so I shall not go
into detail on the Versailles case on intervention. In that case the
judge ordered one of the three counts against Cushnie to be severed in
the interests of trial management, and the SFO again felt that that did
not allow the jury to see the full
picture.</div><a name="0612134000122"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0612134000500"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> This sort of exchange is
valuable. However, the whole history of both cases&#151;the committal
from the magistrates court, the commencement of the trial and the
judges decision on trial handling&#151;came 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column56" />Column number: 57</div>before the Lord Chief Justice&#146;s direction of last year. Both
cases also came before the report of Her Majesty&#146;s inspector
into the Jubilee line failures. My point is that we have learnt the
lessons from the system failures that led to long trials and burdensome
implications for jurors. We have not, however, learnt the lessons of
the past year and a half&#151;since the beginning of the changes.
Those changes will reduce trial lengths substantially in nearly every
case, but without&#151;in the view of the judges and the
SFO&#151;prejudicing the generality of the case on guilt that is
presented to the jury.</div>
<a name="0612134000123"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0612134000501"></a>Mr.
Grieve:</b> The hon. Gentleman&#146;s point is important. He
may join with me in inquiring about something on which the
Solicitor-General may be able to help us later. A six-year sentence is
a very long one by modern standards, particularly for fraud. If it is
being suggested that the level of criminality was not reflected in the
final outcome of the sentence, it would be interesting to know the view
of the Solicitor-General on the sort of sentence that the total
criminality ought to have attracted. I really wonder whether it would
in reality have been very much.</div>
<a name="0612134000124"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0612134000502"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> Just one other point, although we could turn this
into a seminar on recent successes in SFO cases. I am conscious,
Mr. Bercow, that you will not allow us to do
so.</div><a name="0612134000125"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0612134000503"></a>Mr.
Heath:</b> It would be a useful
precedent.</div>
<a name="0612134000126"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0612134000504"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> Yes, a useful extra seminar that we had not
anticipated. I will just pick up this point; in the Winchester case,
there was a unanimous verdict by the jury. So, that was not one of
those cases that struggled to get a verdict, and I share the concern of
the hon. Member for Beaconsfield that the evidence and argument do not
suggest that justice there was letting off those people lightly, since
they were not.</div> <a name="0612134000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
leads to my last point. The unspoken reason motivating the Government
in part, which sort of slipped out on Second Reading, is that they
think convictions will go up if there is no jury. If that is in their
minds explicitly or implicitly, then it is a worrying thought. There
are a couple of obvious points to make if that was their
thought.</div> <a name="0612134000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">We all want
to have criminals dealt with by the justice system, and to be convicted
when they commit offences. Serious criminals need to be convicted and
punished seriously. When you represent a constituency like mine, where
there is still a lot of poverty and some extreme affluence, so near to
the City of London, not a few people have come to see me over the years
saying, &#147;Why is it that the heavy hand of the law comes down on
little people for small offences&#148;&#151;that is not my phrase,
but other people&#146;s&#151;&#147;when the big crooks working in
the City or elsewhere are not being caught?&#148;
</div><a name="0612134000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">So I am up for these
people being prosecuted, with the SFO doing its job properly, serious
investigation being pursued and people being brought to book and locked
up when they deserve it. However, if the suggestion is that we are not
getting enough guilty verdicts, the evidence does not support that and
the philosophy is fundamentally flawed.</div>
<a name="0612134000130"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0612134000505"></a>Mr.
Heath:</b> Another thing occurs to me in what my hon. Friend
was saying about these two cases that the Solicitor-General relies on
as evidence of the need for 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column57" />Column number: 58</div>change. For his proposition to be correct, then there must be an
assumption that the Lord Chief Justice would produce new rules of
procedure and new guidance for trials without a jury as opposed to
trials with a jury. The purpose of those new
rules&#151;[<i class="I">Interruption.</i>] Well, the Solicitor-General is
looking puzzled, but otherwise the severance would be exactly the same
in a trial before a judge alone as with one before a jury. If that is
the case, it means that having got the length of complex trials down,
by using the Lord Chief Justice&#146;s rules, the Government now
propose to increase the length of trials&#151;and, therefore, their
cost and complexity&#151;once the jury was safely out of the way.
Does my hon. Friend believe that is the Government&#146;s
intention?</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0612134000506"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> The debate could be extended, but without putting
words into his mouth what my hon. Friend implies is that we would,
objectively or rationally, have to take a different view if we had all
seen a report written by the Serious Fraud Office saying that since the
experience of the jubilee line case and Her Majesty&#146;s
inspectors&#146; report, and since the Lord Chief Justice&#146;s
protocol, and the experience of recent trials, then in the light of all
those experiences it was still of the view that the new procedures were
not delivering the outcomes that everybody has sought. If that came in
the annual report of the Serious Fraud Office, then we would all have
to take notice and probably say, &#147;We&#146;ll give it a bit
more time, to see if they bed down a little longer&#148;. We would be
arguing for time. However, that is absolutely not the case, and the
last of these cases saw a conviction only in June 2005.</div>
<a name="0612134000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">To do the Solicitor-General
credit and to be fair, I will observe that I have not gone into similar
detail on the last of the three cases that he cited&#151;the Global
Wildlife Trust&#151;for the simple reason that it was not as easy to
find out the details from the same place. So, of course, I shall wait
to hear from the Minister. However, the Solicitor-General conceded that
it was not that the prosecution was not successful&#151;the
implication was that it was successful&#151;but that the size of the
case was limited. So we return to the argument of whether the full
criminality was exposed to the
court.</div><a name="0612134000423"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.30
pm</div><a name="0612134000133"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0612134000507"></a>Joan
Ryan:</b> To help the hon. Gentleman, he might like to know
that in the case that he could not find&#151;the third one on the
Global Wildlife Trust&#151;the severance of the indictment meant that
one defendant was not tried in the first and, so far, only trial, and
that it is uncertain when, if ever, the second trial will take place. I
think that that is relevant to his remarks&#151;one of the trials did
not reach a satisfactory conclusion, in the interests of
justice.</div><a name="0612134000134"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0612134000508"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> My wise hon. Friend the Member for Somerton and
Frome, one of the omnipresent three wise men, said that it is not
surprising that we could not find the information as the last trial has
not happened yet, which is, of course, true. I would not dare to
contest that.</div><a name="0612134000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
serious point is that we could make a judgment only if a trial went
ahead. However, in my experience, from my more limited number of years
at the Bar, prosecuting and defending, there is a severance of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column58" />Column number: 59</div>many criminal cases. One of the first cases that I prosecuted for Thames
Valley police was for affray on Blackbird Leys estate in Oxford, which
occasionally features in debates on criminal justice in this place.
Lots of people participated in the case and in the end there were two
trials because it was easier for case and jury management. They were
related to the same offence, but none the less that was the
decision.</div>
<a name="0612134000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is quite
common in all sorts of cases. We look at how we can best manage the
case and consider things such as the number of defendants, bundles of
papers and the length of time. That is not unique to fraud cases and it
is not a sign of weakness. Of course, we would not get a whole picture
of life on the Blackbird Leys estate over 24 hours if a trial was split
into two, nor the whole story of a company and its activities over a
lifetime of 10 years, but that does not prevent justice from being
done. The question is whether justice is done.</div>
<a name="0612134000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">My proposition
is simple: it is neither timely nor reasonable to implement the Bill.
The Minister made a procedural point and I shall end with a substantive
one. She told us not to worry because two timetable triggers remain and
that if the measures become law two months after the passage of the
Act, it is all right because a commencement order would yet to be laid.
However, my hon. Friend and I have spotted the flaw. The commencement
order would not require the assent of both Houses of Parliament by
affirmative resolution. So that is not a sufficient protection.
Although the Minister might delay for a day, a week, a month or even a
year before the introduction of the commencement order by the
Attorney-General, I am afraid that we saw through that claim.</div>
<a name="0612134000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, on the four strand
approach, there is a consensus that three of them are perfectly
acceptable. The fourth would change a fundamental element of British
criminal justice. We should not change a system that has the confidence
of the people and delivers a very high success rate&#151;we should
not even consider it, unless everything else has been tried, which we
have not yet done. Even if we had, some of us would still need
persuading. So we are certainly not
persuaded.</div><a name="0612134000139"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0612134000541"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second
time.</div> <a name="0612134000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">The object of
the new clause is to enable the defendant, or a defendant if there be
more than one, to make an application for a trial without a jury. At
the moment, as the Committee knows, an application for a judge-alone
trial under section 43 can be made only by the prosecution. That raises
the question: why should a defendant not be able to make such an
application? Itis my recollection that Lord Justice Auld, in
his recommendations, contemplated that a defendant should be able to
make an application. What I seek to do, therefore, if we must go down
this road, is to ensure parity between the prosecution and the
defendant.</div>
<a name="0612134000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">The question
that we need to address is whether there are circumstances in which a
defendant might wish to have a judge-alone trial. The answer is yes; I
can contemplate at least three sets of circumstances in which that
might happen. The first, which will occur increasingly often thanks to
changes in the legal aid rules, will occur when defendants pay for
their own legal representation. A defendant might well conclude that it
would be quicker to hold a trial without a jury. If it is quicker, and
he is paying for his own representation, it will be cheaper for him.
That might be the sort of situation in which a defendant would wish to
have a judge-alone trial. There are parallels in cases of libel, in
which defendants can elect judge-alone trials.</div>
<a name="0612134000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second circumstance that
might arise is that in which a defendant might conclude that he is
likely to get a more favourable hearing from a judge. I think that that
would be a fairly exceptional situation, but I can think of it arising
in some circumstances. A defendant may be of a class that would make
him think that he would get a less sympathetic hearing from a jury than

<div class="Column"><a name="Column60" />Column number: 61</div>from a judge. Let us be honest about this: if one was a professional,
middle-class person and an alleged white-collar fraudster, one might
feel that one would get a thoroughly unsympathetic hearing from a jury.
That has been so in some libel cases, in which defendants have come to
that conclusion. One could ask oneself whether the same is not true of
politicians. We are said to be one of the least popular groups of
individuals in the land, which may well be true. If I were foolish
enough to start a libel action, I would much rather have my case tried
before a judge alone than before a jury and I can contemplate
situations in which, if I were tried for a serious fraud case, the same
would apply, simply because we are the kind of people that we
are.</div> <a name="0612134000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a
different situation that is equally relevant, which depends on the
nature of the offence. Let us say that a defendant is charged with
milking pension schemes. We know how sensitive the public is about
pensions schemes, and rightly so. A defendant might come to the view
that such charges would get an unsympathetic hearing from a jury. Let
us consider Farepak: I am not suggesting that any fraud has been
committed, but for the purpose of illustrating the argument, let us
assume that there was an allegation of fraud associated with Farepak. I
can very well see that a defendant who was charged with that kind of
offence might think that he would get a pretty rough ride from a jury.
There are cases in which a defendant might choose a judge-alone trial,
because he reckoned that he would get a rough ride from a
jury.</div> <a name="0612134000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">The third class
of cases is related to the first, but nevertheless stands alone. I can
contemplate a situation in which a defendant might conclude that the
complexity of a case was so great that it was best dealt with by a
judge, on the basis that the jury would not properly understand it and
would not return a safe verdict. Let us consider cases of long-term
fraud involving lots of people from abroad. Such cases would involve a
mass of documents, much of which would have to be translated from
Arabic, for example, and the original text of which would not be
comprehensible. Furthermore, and more damagingly from the
defendant&#146;s point of view, most of the witnesses would speak in
Arabic and would have to have their evidence translated by an
interpreter. I have done a number of cases in which interpretation was
essential and I can say that one rather loses the thread of the
evidence when it comes through an interpreter. If there are a lot of
witnesses whose evidence is being interpreted, there is a real danger
of losing the plot, however good the interpreter may be&#151;many of
them are quite good in this context. In those circumstances, I can
imagine a defendant saying, &#147;This is a jolly difficult case
because of the special reasons that I have advised, and I would be
happier if my case were determined by a judge
alone.&#148;</div><a name="0612134000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
against this Bill and I hope it fails, but now that we are here we have
to try to improve the beastly thing if we can. It is difficult to see
an argument of principle for the defendant not being in the same
position asthe Crown. It was the view of Lord Justice Auld
that the defendant should be in that position and that is the proper
way forward. I therefore commend new clause 1 to the
Committee.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0612134000542"></a>Mr.
Heath:</b> I listened carefully to the right
hon. and learned Gentleman, and I found his arguments persuasive to an
extent. I am inclined to support his
views.</div><a name="0612134000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">On equity, if
there is to be a trial in which the forces on either side are equal
under the law, it must be right in principle that the application for a
trial without jury should be open to both the prosecution and the
defence. I share the right hon. and learned Gentleman&#146;s view on
circumstances in which the defence might consider it in the interests
of the accused to go to a judge-only trial.</div>
<a name="0612134000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">He mentioned the complexity of a
case, but the crucial issue is the complexity of the defence. Much of
our discussion has been to do with whether the complexity of the
prosecution case is understood by a court, but there are instances in
which the complexity of the defence in a fraud trial will raise the
question whether the jury can understand it fully. My view is that, if
both the defence and the prosecution do their work properly, that will
not be an issue. However, if there is not a requirement for a jury to
be in place, it will be perfectly proper for the defence to argue to a
judge that the complexity of the defence is such that it should be
heard before a judge only.</div>
<a name="0612134000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">That will be particularly true
in cases on the cusp of sharp practice and dishonest behaviour in which
the defence argues that the defendant&#146;s behaviour was
reprehensible in the view of the common man&#151;and therefore of the
jury&#151;and not sound business practice, but was not fraud because
it was not dishonest. At that margin, a defendant might feel better
able to explain their position to a judge than to a
jury.</div><a name="0612134000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">Nothing that I
say should be taken as an expression of a view contrary to that which I
have expressed throughout progress of this Bill and preceding Bills. I
believe that the jury is an essential part of the process, but I can
conceive of a position whereby the defence would want a judge-only
trial.</div><a name="0612134000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">My last point
returns to principles. I have mentioned the principle of equity, but
there is a further principle. As my hon. Friend the Member for North
Southwark and Bermondsey said when speaking to the previous amendment,
the Solicitor-General, in presenting the case for the Bill on Second
Reading and in Committee, has come perilously close to saying that one
of its purposes is to secure more convictions, because more people will
be found guilty by a judge than by a judge and jury. Considering that
one purpose of it is to replace the finding of fact by a jury with the
finding of fact by a judge on the basis of the same evidence, that is a
worrying principle on which to work.</div>
<a name="0612134000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">That concern could be dispelled
at a stroke if the Government were to accept the new clause, which
would make it clear that not only the prosecution but the defence could
expect the interests of justice to be best served by a court without a
jury. Nothing could better exemplify that than a clear and explicit
statement that the Bill is not purely a device to secure more
convictions but is intended to serve the best interests of justice. For
all those reasons, I shall be interested to hear the
Solicitor-General&#146;s response to the right hon. and learned
Gentleman, who made an interesting point.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0612134000543"></a>Mr.
Grieve:</b> Some Members will recollect that when we
considered the Criminal Justice Bill in 2003&#151;it introduced
section 43, the matter now under consideration&#151;we considered
whether jury trial should be restricted for several different
categories. One of the principal arguments at the time, and one on
which we persuaded the Government to back down, was over the
Government&#146;s wish to give a general right to the defendant to
obtain a trial without a jury. The right could be denied in cases where
it was thought that the defendant was trying to avoid the wrath of the
public; that is, the defendant might consider that a compliant judge
would be kinder than a jury. I took grave exception to the principle
and argued against it. As a result, it was eventually defeated in the
Lords and the Government dropped
it.</div><a name="0612134000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">We also considered
whether to get rid of juries for cases in which jury nobbling had taken
place, or where there were grounds to fear that it might take place and
justify, in effect, a Diplock court because the trial could not take
place with a jury. For obvious reasons, the prosecutor would normally
seek such a ruling, because, on the whole, defendants would not seek a
ruling on the basis that they would nobble their own jury, albeit
sometimes a defendant fears that somebody else&#151;for example, a
co-defendant&#151;might nobble the jury to his
prejudice.</div><a name="0612134000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">Leaving that
to one side, I have never been keen on the idea of defendants being
able to opt out of jury trial. However, having said that, my right hon.
and learned Friend the Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham made a
good case, because what is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander,
and there is a lack of equality of arms in a process in which only the
prosecution can argue that the seriousness, complexity and length of a
trial is such that the jury should be removed, and the trial should
take place by judge alone. If the Government are arguing the principle
that it is offensive to good justice that such long, complex trials
should be allowed to take place with a jury, I cannot see why the
defendant should not be allowed to make that argument as
well.</div><a name="0612134000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">Moreover, if we
are to end up with multi-handed trials, which often happens&#151;it
is common for four, five, six, seven or eight defendants to be tried
for fraud together&#151;when the case goes before the Lord Chief
Justice on an application by the prosecution for trial by judge alone,
it must at least be possible that different defendants will have
different views on the matter. Some defendants may welcome the idea of
trial by judge alone, but others may argue that they wish to be tried
by a jury. Therefore, while the system in the Bill allows such an
argument to take place, it seems to be a little defective, whereas the
new clause tabled by my right hon. and learned Friend would establish
straightforwardly and clearly that all parties can argue one way or the
other. I do not think it beyond the bounds of possibility that there
might frequently be circumstances in which all sorts of arguments would
be made from different
angles.</div><a name="0612134000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">To take an
example, the Solicitor-General raised the issue of the full criminality
being exposed. One consequence of the exposure of full criminality, as
an example, is that it frequently happens&#151;I have been involved
in such trials with juries&#151;that there are two principal
defendants and a third defendant whose role 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column63" />Column number: 64</div>in the overall alleged fraud is pretty minimal. He, however, has to sit
through months of evidence, while his barrister picks up substantial
fees for doing absolutely nothing because it is not until day 56 of the
trial that he finally comes to the witness box to give the bit of
evidence that concerns his client.</div>
<a name="0612134000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">In such cases, there might well
be arguments for severance, and one of them might be that one lot of
defendants says, &#147;It is a long and complex trial. We would like
it to take place in front of a judge alone, because that would shorten
it,&#148; whereas the other defendant says, &#147;This is a long
and complex trial, and it will be made even longer if I have to appear
in front of a judge alone; I want it to be severed, and I want to argue
to be tried in front of a jury, because my case is a short and simple
one.&#148;</div><a name="0612134000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">I give
that by way of illustration. I might add that that argument could even
take place as the Bill stands. Given that one can easily foresee a
multiplicity of arguments, I must say that my right hon. and learned
Friend has made a powerful and compelling case and I will be happy to
support him if the matter goes to a vote. I see that the
Solicitor-General has a full reply to make. It might be that on this
issue we have persuaded him that there is merit in the point that is
being made.</div>
<a name="0612134000203"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0612134000544"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> I have in my hand the original clause
that the Government included in the 2003 Bill. At that stage, it was
our intention that there should be an ability for the defendant to
waive jury trial. In that case, we also provided for defendants taking
different views by giving a veto to a defendant. I am curious, because
the Conservatives strongly opposed the provisions at that time and it
seems that they nowtake a somewhat different view, as do the
Liberal Democrats. Can the hon. Gentleman say whether, if we introduced
a provision such as this, which we had not intended to do, the
Conservatives&#151;and, perhaps, the Liberal Democrats&#151;would
be disposed to support it?I might well be disposed to give it
serious consideration.</div>
<a name="0612134000204"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0612134000545"></a>Mr.
Grieve:</b> I fairly laid out, I hope, two key points. First,
my principled opposition to opening a door that allowed people to elect
trial without a jury. That is what was debated during the passage of
the 2003 Bill, and it is something to which I remain resolutely opposed
because I believe in jury trial. I made that clear then, and I am sure
that it coloured my approach to the various areas in which the
Government wanted to restrict trial by jury. However, I accept that if
clause 43, which I do not want to see on the statute book, is to be
placed on the statute book, then there may be an argument&#151;the
one put forward by my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for
Sleaford and North Hykeham&#151;for saying that what I have described
as fairness or sauce for the goose and sauce for the gander demands
that a defendant should be able to make a similar
application.</div> <a name="0612134000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although,
as I indicated, I can see that that argument could take place in cases
in which there is more than one defendant, it ought to be possible,
too, if there is a single defendant. I do not know what the
Solicitor-General wishes to do about that. In any event, it is not my
amendment; it is that of my right hon. and learned Friend, who will
doubtless respond shortly. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column64" />Column number: 65</div>However, we could leave it for the moment if the Government wished to
return to the matter on Report; it could be considered in another
place; or we could all reflect on
it.</div><a name="0612134000425"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6
pm</div><a name="0612134000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">My right hon.
and learned Friend makes the compelling case that if we allow one party
to ask for something in those circumstances, once we have conceded the
principle and even though we did not like doing so, there will be a
strong argument for letting the other party make a similar application.
I am quite prepared to consider it, although it may be wise to reflect
on it briefly before trying to reach consensus. As it is not my new
clause, however, I defer to my right hon. and learned Friend&#151;and
to the Solicitor-General.
</div><a name="0612134000207"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0612134000546"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> It has been an
interesting debate. The proposal that the Government put forward in the
Criminal Justice Act 2003 was similar to that being put forward as a
new clause by the right hon. and learned Member for Sleaford and North
Hykeham. If my recollection serves me well&#151;I stand to be
corrected&#151;the Conservative party strongly opposed the idea, as
did the Liberal Democrats. They now support the provision.</div>
<a name="0612134000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">It had not been the
Government&#146;s intention to revive the proposal for the defendant
to have a waiver on jury trial. However, I am more than happy to
reflect on the idea. Some time ago, the Government would have been
disposed to accept not the broad recommendation of the Auld review for
a general waiver but a specific provision that would give a defendant a
veto on a non-jury trial, so that if one defendant wanted a jury trial
and the other did not, a jury trail would take place, unless the
prosecution had made its application in the normal way.</div>
<a name="0612134000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is how we dealt with it,
but I have been led to believe by the substance of the debate that
Opposition Members are seriously prepared to revisit the matter and
would be prepared to support a Government amendment on report. I do not
know whether we would be in time to do it on Thursday, but we might be
prepared to table a Government amendment after due reflection and some
discussion. I give no undertakings at this stage; I say only that I am
prepared to reflect on the matter and discuss it.</div>
<a name="0612134000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have listened with care to the
proposals of the right hon. and learned Member for Sleaford and North
Hykeham. I do not envisage that it will unduly delay the passage of the
Bill. We have always tried to proceed through consensus. Given the
strong speeches made by the right hon. and learned Member and by the
Liberal Democrats in favour of the amendment, and the encouragement of
the Opposition spokesperson, the hon. Member for Beaconsfield, I feel
that the right hon. and learned Gentleman might not wish to press the
matter to a Division, and that he will agree that we should reflect on
it and perhaps return to it on Report.
</div><a name="0612134000211"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0612134000547"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> I am grateful to the
Solicitor-General. I realise that he is not giving an undertaking to
come back with an amendment on Report that would encapsulate or wholly
reflect my thoughts. However, I understood him to say that he would
give serious consideration to the principle. He indicated that he might
be willing to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column65" />Column number: 66</div>embark on negotiations and discussions with Front Benchers. I would be
rather pleased to be associated with those discussions. That said, it
would be churlish not to welcome what the Solicitor-General has
said.</div>
<a name="0612134000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have told
you already, Mr. Bercow, that my knowledge of procedure is
20 years old. Do I need the leave of the Committee to withdraw my
motion? If, by any chance, the Government do not introduce proposals of
the kind that we have outlined, I am sure that the Committee will not
be surprised if I seek to catch the Deputy Speaker&#146;s eye and
move something similar on Report. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
motion.</div><a name="0612134000213"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Motion and

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0612134000548"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second
time.</div> <a name="0612134000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new clause
is a safeguard provision. If one refers to section 43 of the 2003 Act,
one will see that there are precious few safeguards for a defendant.
The only criterion applicable to an order as to whether a judge-alone
trial is made is that which is set out in section 43(5). There, the
court is not directed in any strong way to consider the position or the
arguments of the defendant, and in general terms of fairness and
parity, that seems to be unfair. Let us remember that under the
existing provisions, the Crown is the party who makes the application,
and one must assume that the Crown&#151;the prosecution&#151;is
under the belief that it is in the Crown&#146;s interests to make it.
However, the Crown is not obliged to consider the welfare and interests
of the defendant, nor is the court so directed in any direct manner.
Consequently, the interests of the defendant do not seem to be properly
protected under the existing legislation.</div>
<a name="0612134000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government from time to time
talk about rebalancing the criminal system. I am deeply suspicious
whenever I hear that, because I subscribe to the old-fashioned view,
which I believe none the less to be right, whereby it is better by far
that the occasional guilty person escapes justice than that innocent
people are convicted. Incidentally, that view is regularly reinforced
by Lord Bingham, the former Lord Chief Justice, who has committed
himself to it in several recent judgments. I entirely agree with him. I
have seen miscarriages of justice, and I have been associated with them
in the criminal courts. I have seen people convicted of serious
offences when in my judgment they should not have been. It is
unpleasant and upsetting, and it should not happen in a mature judicial
system. I want, therefore, proper safeguards.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column66" />Column number: 67</div><a name="0612134000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">One must ask, &#147;In what
circumstances would a defendant assert that a judge-alone trial might
be unfair?&#148; We must leave aside the fact that many judges become
prosecution-minded. It is important to keep that fact in mind, but it
would be difficult to articulate to the trial judge. I have practised
at the Bar off and on since 1968-69, sometimes more off than on,
because I was a Minister for 13 years, but it does not alter the fact
that I am pretty familiar with judges, and many become
prosecution-minded. I agree that that argument would not be easy to
advance to a trial judge in favour of a jury or of denying a
judge-alone trial, but it is a fact.</div>
<a name="0612134000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are other curious
circumstances in which that argument may arise, most notably the
perverse verdict. Oddly enough, despite the name, &#147;perverse
verdict&#148;, it is one of the important safeguards that a citizen
has against the state. A perverse verdict operates when the Crown can
establish the evidential requirements needed to sustain a conviction,
but, broadly speaking, one should not convict in that case. There are
several examples of that; I shall come to the fraud example in a
moment.</div> <a name="0612134000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">In general
terms, there is the mercy killing type of case in which murder is made
out in accordance with the ordinary test of the Homicide Act 1957, but
it was done to spare a person a long and horrible death. The perverse
verdict is where the jury says, &#147;We will not convict in such a
case albeit that the legal requirements have been established.&#148;
Although it concerns a different point, the Ponting case is an example
of the jury deciding that although the evidential requirements have
been made out, the Government have acted oppressively in bringing the
prosecution at all.</div>
<a name="0612134000221"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0612134000549"></a>Stephen
Hesford:</b> Our common-law jurisdiction has developed over
hundreds of years and all that common law is judge-made. As time goes
by, judges review previous judgments and depart from them or make
different judgments. Does not the right hon. and learned Gentleman
envisage that a judge might come up with a perverse judgment, to use
his term, if he or she thought the prosecution
oppressive?</div><a name="0612134000222"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0612134000550"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> There is no chance of that at all. If the legal
requirement were made, a judge would convict as a matter of fact, but a
jury might not because juries bring a different set of considerations
to a case. They bring the consideration of a citizen assessing the
propriety, appropriateness and broad justice of the case. It is not
open to a trial judge who is the judge of both law and fact to do that,
but it is open to a jury. Perverse verdicts are so called because the
jury should not reach that decision, in one sense, and that is why a
judge will not do it. A jury, however, might, and the Ponting case is
one such case.</div>
<a name="0612134000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">Juries might
reach similar decisions in fraud cases in which the Crown has behaved
in a way that is oppressive but falls short of &#147;abuse of
process&#148;&#151;a technical term with which lawyers are
familiar. For example, in a case in which there has been unauthorised
eavesdropping, inducements to make witnesses say things or coercive
conduct of a kind that does not quite so infringe the PACE regulations
as to make the evidence inadmissible, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column67" />Column number: 68</div>the jury might well decide that they are damned if they will convict
albeit that the legal requirements are met. The perverse verdict is
therefore an important safeguard in protecting the individual as
against the state, and I can well see why a defendant might say,
&#147;I want to have the benefit of a jury trial.&#148;</div>
<a name="0612134000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is
another argument that flows from a point made by my hon. Friend the
Member for Beaconsfield. He is entirely right to say that there is
often a multi-handed defence in which one defendant is the minnow and
the other defendants are the sharks. In such a case, the minnow might
well want a jury trial. My new clause would enable the minnow to say,
&#147;Please let me have a jury trial.&#148; That might have one of
two beneficial consequences: the minnow might win; or the
minnow&#146;s application might be so likely to win that the Crown
would make an application to sever so that the minnow&#146;s case
could be tried separately in a different pond. That is to safeguard the
interests of a defendant.</div>
<a name="0612134000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is nothing in section 43
that seriously protects a defendant but there should be. I am perfectly
willing to accept that the language in my new clause might be a little
off, but, incidentally, it is modelled on section 43(7) in which the
phrase &#147;significantly disadvantage the prosecution&#148; is
used by the Government. They cannot, therefore, be heard to quarrel
with the phrase &#147;significantly disadvantage a defendant&#148;
because that is their language while the
phrase</div><a name="0612134000409"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;or otherwise
prejudice a defendant&#148;</div><a name="0612134000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">is
a concept very well known to the criminal
courts.</div><a name="0612134000426"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.15
pm</div><a name="0612134000427"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that the Solicitor-General, in the surprising spirit of compromise
that is developing in the Committee and which as a good-natured chap I
encourage, comes forward to say, &#147;Well, he has a point and I
will take it away and give it serious consideration&#148;. If he does
that, on the same terms as I have withdrawn new clause 1, I will
withdraw new clause

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0612134000551"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> I rise to support the new clause and will briefly
say why. At the moment, when an application is made, the law as drafted
requires the judge to consider a limited number of issues. The most
important of which is whether a case is burdensometo the jury;
that is the effect of section 43(5) of the2003 Act. There is a
definition of what may make a case burdensome that we have partly
touched on in earlier debates: complexity, length or both. The judge
then has to assess whether complexity or length can be dealt with by
procedural matters and if it should become a procedural question. There
is only one other further prerequisite in the current legislation. That
is that the judge is prohibited by law from coming to the conclusion
that to dispense with the jury would be reasonable if it would severely
and significantly disadvantage the
prosecution.</div>
<a name="0612134000228"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0612134000552"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> I think that subsection (7) applies when considering
whether or not there can be changes made to the way the crown is
handling or proposing to handle cases.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column68" />Column number: 69</div><a name="0612134000229"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0612134000553"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> The right hon. and learned Gentleman is quite
right; I was not sufficiently precise in my language.</div>
<a name="0612134000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">The last part of the
consideration is whether a trial would be able to continue by
management and that is a matter when the interests of the prosecution
are weighed in the balance.</div>
<a name="0612134000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is no
consideration requirement in the present Act for the defendant&#146;s
interests. The right hon. and learned Gentleman, in tabling the new
clause, seeks to point out that both parties should be considered in
this trial as well as the jury&#146;s interests. The new clause has
the merit of introducing a third and highly relevant player into the
mind of the judge by law when going through the process. Let us look at
the jury&#151;is it in their interests? Let us look at the
prosecution&#151;would it be to their disadvantage if the processes
were changed? If it is to their disadvantage, that road becomes a
cul-de-sac. The right hon. and learned Gentleman asked about the
defendant, but he went further than that and pointed out that what is
in the interests of one defendant may not be in the interests of all
defendants. That, as we all know, it always a material
consideration.</div><a name="0612134000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">The same
reasoning determines whether people elect for a summary trial in a
magistrates court for a lesser offence or go to a jury. Often one
party, normally the less involved participant in the events that give
rise to the charges, prefer a jury because it is perceived they would
give consideration to the separate roles more carefully and give the
benefit of the doubt. The judge, of course, follows the same rules in
theory, but would not have the same confidence of a defendant as a
jury. However, there would be the ability to distinguish those things.
Presuming that this year the Lords will reject the proposal and next
year the Government will bring it back and use the Parliament Act, if
we are driven to have a new process that involves non-jury trial, it
seems imperative that the interests of the defendant is in the mind of
the judge when considering an application. That must mean the interests
of each and every defendant and that is why the new clause has much to
commend.</div><a name="0612134000233"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0612134000554"></a>Mr.
Grieve:</b> I do not want to take up much
more of the Committee&#146;s time. It seems to me that in discussing
new clause 1 we touched on the potential of opening up a new area.
Although our principled opposition to this Bill remains total&#151;I
still believe that the Government will have to resort to the mechanism
of the Parliament Act to get it through another place&#151;if at some
point in the future it is to go on the statute book, even if I dislike
it in principle, I wish it to be as good as possible.</div>
<a name="0612134000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">If we are to end up with a
situation where both the prosecution and the defence can apply to the
judge for trial without a jury this will have an impact on all the
preconditions that have to be looked at in order to ensure that there
are proper safeguard. It probably also applies to the new clause 4
conditions that we will come on to look at thereafter. As drafted at
the moment, section 43 has the prosecutor&#146;s view in mind and not
that of the defendant.</div>
<a name="0612134000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">If prosecution and defence
representations are considered and there is an option for the defence
to ask for trial without a jury in the very limited number of cases
suggested by the Attorney-General and Solicitor-General, it will be
very important that those measures 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column69" />Column number: 70</div>should be so tailored first to emphasize the desirability of maintaining
trial with a jury whenever possible, as long as it is not contrary to
the interests of justice, and, second, to ensure that no party is
placed at a significant disadvantage.</div>
<a name="0612134000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">My right hon. and learned Friend
the Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham has highlighted an important
area in which I have always thought section 43 was deficient. It seems
to look at mechanistic and procedural matters rather than at the issue
of prejudice. I hope I am not opening too much of a can of worms
because I can see that this is a debate which could continue well into
Report if we were to carry out a major alteration to the
Bill.</div> <a name="0612134000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would
encourage my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Sleaford and
North Hykeham to withdraw the motion because, clearly, if we are moving
towards the notion that a defendant also should be able to make an
application, we would need to be looking at new clause 2 with that in
mind. I would wish wherever possible to preserve jury trial even if one
side or the other were asking for something different.</div>
<a name="0612134000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">That concludes my remarks on the
particular new clause, although I suspect that when we come to new
clause 4, I am likely to repeat very much the same thing, which may
shorten matters. One needs to look at the totality if we are to shift
to a defendant being able to make the application as
well.</div><a name="0612134000239"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0612134000555"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> I listened with care to the arguments
put forward in particular by the hon. Member for Beaconsfield about the
interrelationship between this provision and the previous one. I accept
that to some extent if we were to look at the previous issue then we
might wish to consider some of these issues.</div>
<a name="0612134000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having said that, let me take
the new clause at face value. The effect of new clause 2 would be to
allow the defendant in the course of the Bill to argue to the judge
that his case would be heard by a jury because he would be
significantly disadvantaged by a judge-alone trial. The Government,
however, do not accept that a non-jury trial is capable of prejudicing
a defendant or placing him at a disadvantage and therefore we would not
accept the new clause.</div>
<a name="0612134000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">The only
example that the right hon. and learned Member for Sleaford and North
Hykeham has provided of where the defendant might be disadvantaged
seemed to be that he would be hoping for a perverse verdict. As the
right hon. and learned Gentleman has said, the judge is less likely to
come to a perverse decision on the evidence than is the jury. The judge
is also unlikely to decide that he should not hear a case because of
the improbability that he would be perverse.</div>
<a name="0612134000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the
circumstances, I am not sure that the argument that the right hon. and
learned Gentleman has put forward can possibly stand, because we would
be asking the judge to decide on something where he must conclude that
it would be perverse of him to decide in the way that the right hon.
and learned Gentleman suggests he might. The judge would be deciding
that he might be perverse, and that is nonsense.</div>
<a name="0612134000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the sorts of case to which
the right hon. and learned Gentleman drew attention, for example, the
Ponting case&#151;I can think of others&#151;we are unlikely 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column70" />Column number: 71</div>to have a non-jury trial. The Bill deals with serious and complex fraud
cases, and the Ponting case was an entirely different
matter.</div><a name="0612134000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">The right hon.
and learned Gentleman argues that a perverse jury verdict is a
safeguard in particular kinds of cases. That is an arguable point. The
alternative argument is that the interests of justice are that there
should be justice according to the law, and that it is for Parliament
to look at that law and alter it as Parliament sees fit. I hear his
point about perverse jury verdicts. In the past, they have been lauded
as the democratic view of individuals, even though such a view may, on
occasion, be contrary to the law. The complex and serious fraud cases
that the Bill deals with are not the sorts of cases where that issue is
likely to arise.</div> <a name="0612134000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
latter part of the right hon. and learned Gentleman&#146;s
proposal&#151;the change in proposed new subsection (3)&#151;is
different. In considering a section 43 application, the judge has to
decide whether there are steps he could take that would reduce the
length or complexity of that trial, since that might render a non-jury
trial unnecessary. Section 43(7) requires the judge to disregard any
step that would significantly disadvantage the prosecution. If there
were steps that could reduce the length or complexity of the trial
which might disadvantage the defendant, as opposed to the prosecution,
we would agree that, rationally, they ought to be disregarded under
subsection (7). We cannot think of any such steps in the Bill, and we
are not persuaded that we can accept the new
clause.</div><a name="0612134000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">The right hon.
and learned Gentleman raised an issue, as others have done, about the
issue that I am going to consider in respect of the defendant waiver. I
will examine the matter, although he has not persuaded me on it. I
think that he had a stronger argument on the defendant waiver more
generally. Again, I give him no undertaking and I say to him that I am
unlikely to be with him on the point. I hope that he feels that he does
not have to press this new clause to a Division. If he does not, I
shall ask my hon. Friends to vote against
it.</div>
<a name="0612134000247"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0612134000556"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> Again, I am seeking compromise wherever I can get
it. I note that the Solicitor-General has less enthusiasm for new
clause 2 than he does for new clause 1. I draw the important conclusion
that there might be considerable progress on new clause 1 and perhaps
some progress on new clause 2. I welcome that, as far as it goes. On
that basis, I am minded not to press new clause
2.</div><a name="0612134000428"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.30
pm</div><a name="0612134000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, I say
the following to the Solicitor-General and the Committee at large.
First, do not overlook the importance of perverse verdicts. They are a
safeguard that addresses the risk that the state might act in an
oppressive way, as it sometimes does. It is good for a jury to be able
to say, &#147;Up with this we will not put.&#148;</div>
<a name="0612134000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, if
the Solicitor-General is right in saying that the circumstances in
which a judge will be satisfied that the defendant&#146;s interests
will be prejudiced by a judge-alone trial cannot arise, in truth no
harm would 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column71" />Column number: 72</div>be done by including the new clause in the Bill, because it would not
carry any weight. However, the defendant&#146;s interests would be
protected in his or her own eyes, and we are in the business of dealing
with parity.</div> <a name="0612134000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">My last
point, which I did not hear the Solicitor-General deal with, is that
when there is more than one defendant, there is the minnow, who may
well decide that there are advantages in seeking a jury trial. Their
interests must not be ignored. If the Solicitor-General will forgive
me, the minnow, in this case, escaped his net. On that basis, and
subject to my remarks, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
motion.</div><a name="0612134000251"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Motion and

splendid speed, are we not Mr. Bercow? If we crack along, we

point.</div><a name="0612134000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause 3 is
also designed to improve the safeguards for the defendant. It is odd,
but if one looks at section 43 of the 2003 Act, one sees no requirement

will say that practice directions will be

nominated judge. As I understand the procedure under the Bill, the
concept is that the Lord Chief Justice should be a help and that the
judge-alone trial order should be made only with the concurrence of the
Lord Chief Justice or a judge nominated by him.</div>
<a name="0612134000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">As far as I am aware, nothing in
the 2003 Act or the Bill requires the Lord Chief Justice to listen to
oral representations. In other words, it is a paper-only exercise. I
certainly accept that many decisions are paper-only
exercises&#151;for example, a decision by the single judge about
whether to grant leave to appeal against conviction or sentence is a
paper exercise only, albeit subject to the proviso that the prospective

<a name="0612134000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">I agree that there are
situations when courts determine matters as a paper-only exercise, but
with a matter of this import, I suggest that it is a good thing for the

the opportunity to make oral representations to the Lord Chief Justice.
That is the burden of new clause 3(3), and I hope that it finds favour

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0612134000560"></a>Mr.
Heath:</b> The Solicitor-General&#146;s intervention was
extremely helpful in shortening our proceedings. It is clear to me that
section 45 of the original Act deals with the opportunity for parties
to make oral representations to the judge, but only in the first
instance, and that the provisions of section 43 are dependant on
section 45, so a judge could not come to a view on the basis of an
application under section 43 without taking account of section 45.
Therefore, I think the point raised by the right hon. and learned
Gentleman is entirely covered by existing legislation.</div>
<a name="0612134000265"></a><div class="hs_Para">There remains the right hon. and
learned Gentleman&#146;s view that it should be possible to make oral
representation to the Lord Chief Justice in the certification of the
decision on the application. I am not entirely convinced that that is a
satisfactory procedure in this instance. There may be exceptional
circumstances when the Lord Chief Justice might be prepared to
entertain direct applications&#151;perhaps if a judge has misdirected
himself or herself on the basis of the application&#151;but in
general, I would expect that to be dealt with by written evidence
before the Lord Chief
Justice.</div><a name="0612134000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">The right hon.
and learned Gentleman has raised an interesting point, but I am not
sure whether I could support him if he proceeded to a Division on the
motion. I should be grateful to the Solicitor-General if he gave his
view on whether I have accurately described the
situation.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column73" />Column number: 74</div><a name="0612134000267"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0612134000561"></a>Mr.
Grieve:</b> I, too, am grateful to the
Solicitor-General. I certainly understood&#151;my memory is engraved
with all the sections, even from 2003&#151;that oral representations
could be made. However, I perhaps differ from the hon. Member for
Somerton and Frome: I certainly think that the possibility should be
preserved for oral representations to be made to the Lord Chief Justice
at the end of a certificating
process.</div><a name="0612134000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not want
to labour the point and I do not want too convoluted a system, but I
have said in the past that I want jury trial to be preserved in so far
as possible. To achieve that, at every stage when a prosecutor is
making his application&#151;if we were to move to a situation where a
defendant could do it as well, I would wish it also to be preserved at
every stage&#151;the line of reasoning should be, wherever possible,
that a jury trial should happen. For that reason, I had always
understood that the Lord Chief Justice&#146;s role was an important
safeguard, and although I would normally agree that it would be
appropriate for that to be done by written submission if necessary, the
possibility of it being done by oral submission is important, and I
should like that option to
remain.</div><a name="0612134000269"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Solicitor-General may say that the option exists without further
amendment, in which case I shall be reassured, but it is an issue of
some importance and we must face up to two facts. First, in the
Government&#146;s view, the number of cases in which such things will
happen in any year is likely to be pretty minimal. Therefore, I do not
think that the burden that we will place on the judiciary in the
process of deciding whether it should happen will be too great.
Secondly, the decisions, when taken, will be of some public interest.
For that reason, it is important that there should be a full
understanding by the public of what has happened, and oral hearings
often provide an opportunity for that to
happen.</div>
<a name="0612134000270"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0612134000562"></a>Mr.
Heath:</b> I am studying again the words of the new clause. I
do not see that it provides for any further opportunity to make oral
representations to the Lord Chief Justice; it simply requires the Lord
Chief Justice not to give approval in circumstances in which any party
has not had the opportunity to make oral representations before the
judge under subsection (3A). Therefore, the matter remains entirely
permissive on the part of the Lord Chief Justice, rather than by
prescription of the new clause.</div>
<a name="0612134000271"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0612134000563"></a>Mr.
Grieve:</b> That it is a matter of drafting. Those of us who
draft for Committees are always happy to be told that we are wrong. It
was the intention of subsection (3) to do precisely that. If it has not
achieved it, that is another matter. I wait to hear from the
Solicitor-General whether the new clause has not achieved its purpose.
In any event, the intention is that there should be an option for oral
representations to be made to the Lord Chief Justice. I leave it at
that.</div>
<a name="0612134000272"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0612134000564"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> It is not intended that the Bill should
oblige the Lord Chief Justice&#151;or the president of the
Queen&#146;s bench division who, in practice, might consider these
matters in person&#151;to hear oral representations. It is, however,
the view of the president of the Queen&#146;s bench division that the
manner in which he&#151;it is likely that he, rather than the Lord
Chief 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column74" />Column number: 75</div>Justice, will deal with such applications&#151;hears the applications
should be a matter of judicial discretion. If appropriate, provision
for representations to be made in writing or orally could be set out in
criminal practice rules or other guidance. Therefore, I suggest that we
leave the matter to judicial discretion.</div>
<a name="0612134000273"></a><div class="hs_Para">The arguments
might well be able to be put by the various lawyers in a
case&#151;both for the prosecution and for the defence&#151;before
the judge who initially hears the application. He will be able to make
a note of the arguments, and if they are straightforward, the president
of the Queen&#146;s bench division or the Lord Chief Justice might
well take the view that those representations are adequate. The
president might, however, take the view that he wants to hear oral
representations. The request is that that be left as a matter of
judicial discretion. That might not be appropriate in all cases; I do
not say that it would be inappropriate in any case.</div>
<a name="0612134000274"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that the right hon. and
learned Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham will be able to accept my
position in dealing with the substance of the argument that he puts
forward. I think that I have dealt with the first part of the new
clause, and I am grateful to him for having accepted that. So far as
the last part goes, I think that he will agree that it does not achieve
what he intends it to achieve.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0612134000565"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> I take responsibility for the new
clause, because it is in my name. However, a small error has been made
during the reduction into the blue paper of my original drafting. It
was my intention, as formulated in my draft, that the Lord Chief
Justice should give an opportunity for oral representations before he
gave his approval. I certainly accept that, in the form to which it has
been reduced on the amendment paper, it refers to an application to a
trial judge. I take responsibility for that, because anything that
appears under one&#146;s name is one&#146;s
responsibility.</div><a name="0612134000429"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.45

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0612134000566"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> I am grateful to the right hon. and
learned Gentleman. I cannot accept the new clause, but I hope that he
accepts that I have sought to deal with the substance of his arguments.
I hope that he will withdraw the
motion.</div><a name="0612134000277"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0612134000567"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> I accept that the new clause is imperfect, and I
apologise to the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome, who was right. I
was looking at my original draft of the new clause and had not spotted
that the final version does not faithfully reflect what I had in mind,
but the fault is mine. It is important for the Lord Chief Justice, or
the judge nominated by him, to have judicial discretion to entertain
oral representations if he thinks it appropriate. I believe that the
Solicitor-General has said that that will be the case. I should be
happier if the Bill contained something to that effect. That would
concentrate the minds of the judiciary when they came to issue their
practice direction. Although I welcome what the Solicitor-General has
said, I ask him to reflect before Report on whether the language could
be modified to make it plain that the Lord Chief Justice will have
discretion to hear oral representations.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column75" />Column number: 76</div><a name="0612134000278"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0612134000568"></a>Mr.
Heath:</b> Having been slightly critical of the drafting of
the new clause, perhaps I am necessarily critical of the intention
behind it. However, I agree entirely with the point that the right hon.
and learned Gentleman has just made. Considering that the
Solicitor-General clearly intends such discretion to exist, it would be
helpful if that were stated in the Bill. I hope that he will introduce
that on
Report.</div><a name="0612134000279"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0612134000569"></a>Mr.

hope that the Solicitor-General will reflect carefully on the
desirability of reaching a compromise without the need for unnecessary
votes on Report. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the

The condition is that by reason of the complexity or length of the
trial, or both, and their likely impact on the safety of the verdict,
the interests of justice require that serious consideration should be
given to the question of whether the trial should be conducted without
a jury.&#148;.&#146;.&#151;<i class="I">[Mr.
Hogg.]</i></div><a name="0612134000281"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Brought

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0612134000570"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second
time.</div><a name="0612134000283"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new clause is
an important safeguard. I concede at once that its purpose is to redraw
the test set out in section 43(5) of the 2003 Act. The hon. Member for
North Southwark and Bermondsey mentioned that test. I wish to discuss
the criteria on the basis of which a judge-alone trial is to be
ordered. As the Bill stands, a judge-alone trial will be ordered when,
by reason of complexity or length, a trial is likely to
be</div><a name="0612134000412"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;so burdensome upon the
jury that the interests of justice
require&#148;</div><a name="0612134000284"></a><div class="hs_Para">and so
on.</div> <a name="0612134000285"></a><div class="hs_Para">The attention of
judges is therefore drawn to the burden on the jury caused by either
complexity or length. On Second Reading and in the debate on the 2003
Act, Ministers said time and again that, for the most part, they were
not seeking to assert that such cases are so difficult that a jury
cannot comprehend what is going on. They are concentrating on the
burdensome nature of such trials, which is not peculiar to fraud cases.
Many classes of case could be said to be burdensome by reason of
complexity or length. Terrorism trials are cases in point&#151;there
have recently been very long trials&#151;as are conspiracies to
import drugs. Trials can be very lengthy and complicated. The same is
true of multi-handed affrays, for which trials can be very long and
could therefore be said to be
burdensome.</div><a name="0612134000286"></a><div class="hs_Para">Once
the concept of burdensomeness as a result of complexity and/or length
has been introduced, that asserts a principle that drives a coach and
horses through our commitment to jury trials. Once that precedent is
established, it will be difficult to say that there is no argument for
doing away with jury trials in terrorism, affray, conspiracy and other
cases. I strongly object to a test based on the burdensome nature of
trials, because it establishes an unfortunate precedent.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column76" />Column number: 77</div><a name="0612134000287"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have
therefore tried to apply a different criterion. Generally, I do not
think that a jury would find it too complicated to determine a trial,
but I am prepared to acknowledge the possibility. If a case arises
whose complexity and length impugns the safety of the verdict, that
seems a situation where the Committee might look favourably on a
judge-alone trial. I have already given examples of how that situation
might work in a defendant&#146;s favour, as did the hon. Member for
Somerton and Frome. I strongly resist the proposition that we should
rely on the burden placed on the jury. However, in a small number of
cases, because of complexity or length, it might be proper to consider
whether or not a verdict is safe. That is a different approach, and I
commend it to the Committee.</div>
<a name="0612134000288"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is unlikely that there will
be many such cases, but I do not exclude the possibility that there
will be one or two every so often. Therefore, I hope that the Committee
will give favourable consideration to what I admit is a redraft of the
criteria set out in section 43(5) of the 2003
Act.</div>
<a name="0612134000289"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0612134000571"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> I am sympathetic to the right hon. and learned
Gentleman&#146;s argument, and he has given reasons for it. The most
important issue for us to face could have been the burdensome
consequences of trials for juries. The Liberal Democrats think either
that that is not the case, that the burden on juries is not unique to
fraud trials or, if it is, that it has been partly dealt with so that
such trials will be less burdensome. For one, another or all of those
reasons, we do not think that there is a reason for moving to a
different sort of trial.</div>
<a name="0612134000290"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is a more substantive and
well rounded point. An experienced judge would be well able to consider
it. Bluntly, it is on a different level from the pragmatic, functional
matter of length of trial, documentation and number of witnesses. It
relates to what we in this country train and employ judges to
do&#151;they are all trained now, and well trained&#151;which is to
conduct a trial that, in the end, proceeds fairly.</div>
<a name="0612134000291"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a danger with complex
trials. They could be complex trials for offences of affray, which is
halfway down the league table of seriousness, or for terrorist
offences; they could be complex trials involving detailed forensic
evidence for offences of serious assault, homicide and so on, which can
be burdensome because of the trauma to the jury and witnesses. The
danger is that, for all sorts of reasons, the verdict might not be
safe.</div> <a name="0612134000292"></a><div class="hs_Para">Juries are
confronted with the issue of how to ensure that they bring in a safe
verdict. Juries are told over and again by the judge in summing up that
they have to be satisfied that they are sure beyond a reasonable doubt.
The right hon. and learned Gentleman made the point that such a verdict
may err on the side of acquittal rather than give a verdict that was,
as it were, just over the line of being persuaded. The test is much
higher. The bar is much higher because we do not want thisto
be a country in which convictions are thought tobe dubious,
questionable, marginal or any other appropriate adjective. We have
unanimous verdicts, but in exceptional cases, verdicts of 11 to one or
10 to two. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column77" />Column number: 78</div></div><a name="0612134000293"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause 4 is a
serious and more rounded proposition, and is worth considering. To be
fair to the Solicitor-General, it deals with an issue that has been
reasonably addressed, whereas the issue of burdensome consequences has
not been, for reasons that we have talked about&#151;not least the
procedural changes. I would be interested to hear his comments. My hon.
Friend the Member for Somerton and Frome and I do not have a definite
view, but if we must have a test for a trial to be conducted without a
jury, we are sympathetic to the one in new clause 4. It may be a
better, safer and more rounded test than the one in the current
legislation.</div><a name="0612134000294"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0612134000572"></a>Mr.
Grieve:</b> I welcome this opportunity to look at new clause
4. It is a probing new clause to tease out the reasons why the
Government think that jury trials might not be satisfactory in very
long cases. There is a slight sense that we sometimes avoid the nub of
the matter. The Government argued that very longtrials are
burdensome on juries, but, of course, some very long, non-fraud trials
will continue to be burdensome.</div>
<a name="0612134000295"></a><div class="hs_Para">At the same time,
although we have always accepted that trials are burdensome, evidence,
such as that from the report into the Jubilee line case, does not
support the view that juries cannot hear such cases, although,
admittedly, our pool of information is limited because of the
difficulty in interviewing juries. Personally, in my experience of
fraud trials, or, indeed, trials in general, verdicts have never been
inexplicable or appeared perverse. It is true that, on occasions, I
have seen people acquitted when I might have taken a different
view&#151;that tends to happen when one is prosecuting&#151;but I
have never felt that the jury had done something plainly wrong or that
there was no material on which it reached its decision. That is one of
the reasons why I have so much faith in jury
trials.</div><a name="0612134000296"></a><div class="hs_Para">When
applying my own experience, however, perhaps I should be more concerned
about whether I have ever had a case in which a guilty verdict was
returned and I was worried because I thought that the defendant ought
to have been acquitted. We know that such cases happen and, of course,
those are the ones that get overturned in the Court of Appeal with the
wonderful words of the appeal judge: &#147;We feel that there is a
lingering doubt&#148;. However, statistically, such cases are few and
far between and in my professional experience I hardly ever encountered
them.</div><a name="0612134000297"></a><div class="hs_Para">When we ask why
we should get rid of juries in long fraud trials, we come to some
difficult issues, on which my right hon. and learned Friend the Member
for Sleaford and North Hykeham touched. He raised the question of
whether the truth was not simply that the Government want to get rid of
juries in long fraud trials because they believe that they will secure
a higher rate of conviction. They are wrong. I do not believe that that
is likely to
happen.</div><a name="0612134000298"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a
final possibility. If jurors are forced to remain in court for a very
long time listening to a fraud trial, might that make them prejudiced
against the defendant to such an extent that they would, at that stage,
lose sight of their duty, so that the safety of the verdict could be
impugned?</div>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column78" />Column number: 79</div><a name="0612134000430"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">7
pm</div><a name="0612134000299"></a><div class="hs_Para">These are quite
difficult areas. I see this as a probing new clause designed to tease
out what the Government really think. If they have faith in the jury
trial system&#151;they are always repeating that they do&#151;they
have no reason to feel that jury verdicts are less safe than any
others, and I think that that is their stated position. Do they feel,
however, that in long trials the safety of the verdict can be called
into question? If so, would the Solicitor-General like to tell us
why?</div><a name="0612134000300"></a><div class="hs_Para">I personally take
the view&#151;I can only repeat it&#151;that on the whole jury
trial delivers a very high quality of justice and does so in a way that
is transparent, that the public have come to accept and that, for the
reasons given by my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for
Sleaford and North Hykeham, is seen to be fair and to provide a
safeguard against state oppression&#151;a safeguard that is so
important.</div><a name="0612134000301"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the
Solicitor-General has other views, this is our opportunity in Committee
to understand what exactly is troubling the Government about long
trials. Is the issue anything other than just the burdensomeness to
jurors of having to attend court for a long
period?</div><a name="0612134000302"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0612134000573"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> I fear that if the new clause is
pressed, we will end up voting on it, because it would alter the
criterion for determining an application under section 43. The question
would no longer be how the length and complexity of the trial would
affect the burden imposed on the jury, but how those factors would
affect the safety of the verdict. That would be a significant change,
because it has never been the Government&#146;s position that there
are doubts aboutthe verdicts returned by juries in serious
fraud cases or that trial without a jury is necessary to
resolvethem. Rather, our position throughout has been that
section 43 is needed for the twin purposes of limiting the burden on
the jury in such cases and of enabling justice to be done by exposing
in court more fully the alleged criminality. The condition set out in
the new clause would render section 43
ineffective.</div><a name="0612134000303"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have
heard arguments advanced that other types of trial can last a very long
time, and of course they can. However, there is a particular history in
relation to serious and complex fraud cases that does not exist in
relation to those other types of case. It is not only that eminent
reports such as the Roskill report and the Auld report support our view
or that various representations have been made to Governments over
time; it is that there has been a series of cases. Reference was made
to some of the cases on which we rely. I shall talk about some of
them&#151;there are others&#151;in which problems arose, in which
there were burdens on juries or in which the full criminality of the
case was not able to be exposed. Some of the cases are older; some are
more recent.</div><a name="0612134000304"></a><div class="hs_Para">The first
case is R <i class="I">v. </i>Cohen and others&#151;the Blue Arrow
case&#151;which was completed back in 1992. The allegation was that,
in effect, there was an agreement to rig the market. The case involved
complex evidenceon rights issues and the basis on which a
takeover by Blue Arrow of another company was structured. Defendants
were convicted of conspiracy to defraud and given suspended sentences
after a trial that lasted a year. The convictions were subsequently
overturned on appeal.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column79" />Column number: 80</div><a name="0612134000305"></a><div class="hs_Para">The prosecution had significantly
reduced the prosecution case before it came to court; that had already
happened in order to get the case before a jury. Even so, the trial
judge pruned the case further during the trial, greatly reducing both
the scope of the indictment and the complexity of the counts. The trial
judge ordered further deletions from the indictment between
counsels&#146; final speeches and the jury&#146;s deliberations,
directing the jury not to consider the admissible evidence relating to
the deleted particulars. That was held to be a material irregularity by
theCourt of Appeal when it subsequently considered the
matter.</div> <a name="0612134000306"></a><div class="hs_Para">Additionally,
the trial judge severed the case into two trials to make it
&#147;manageable&#148; for the jury. That still meant 10 defendants
facing trial together. On the burden experienced by the jury, the trial
judge, Mr. Justice McKinnon, said that no jury should be
asked to cope with what that jury had to endure. Following the appeal,
the Court of Appeal said that there was</div>
<a name="0612134000413"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a significant risk of a
miscarriage of justice resulting from the volume and complexity of the
evidence.&#148;</div><a name="0612134000307"></a><div class="hs_Para">It noted that
the jury retired with 956 pages of exhibits and such recollections that
they might have had of94 prosecution witnesses giving evidence
between seven and 11 months earlier and of counsels&#146; final
speeches having been delivered between 59 and 65 days
earlier.</div> <a name="0612134000308"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Serious
Fraud Office&#146;s view is that the pruning of the case and the
trial severance undermined the prosecution&#146;s ability to present
a cohesive or coherent case. Measures designed to improve conditions
for the jury, such as two periods of extended leave over Christmas and
the summer, were said to have helped destroy the basic assumption that
a jury determines guilt or innocence on evidence that it is able to
comprehend and remember. It is not so much the jury&#146;s
comprehension that was in question, but the sheer volume of the
evidence.</div>
<a name="0612134000309"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0612134000574"></a>Mr.
Grieve:</b> I appreciate the
Solicitor-General&#146;s concentrating on complexity and length
rather than the new clause, which is about the impact on safety. The
Jubilee line case suffered massive interruptions. Notwithstanding that,
the evidence was that when the jurors were brought together in one room
some time afterwards and asked to recollect the case and the key
issues, they were able to do so with little difficulty. I suggest that
what the Solicitor-General says is mere hypothesis. The only evidence
we have, limited as it is, tends the other
way.</div>
<a name="0612134000310"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0612134000575"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> The hon. Gentleman
asked me to set out the arguments about the burden on juries. That is
why I am taking so much time. Members of the Committee will have to
bear with me, because it is worth the Government setting out some of
their concerns about that burden. We have never said that juries are
unable to understand such cases&#151;what the hon. and learned Member
for Harborough (Mr. Garnier) called the stupid jury
argument. That is not the Government&#146;s view, but we do think
that the burden on the juror and on juries is unacceptable in certain
cases and that, in those circumstances, we should be able to have a
non-jury trial.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column80" />Column number: 81</div><a name="0612134000311"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for Beaconsfield
mentioned the Jubilee line case. In his report, Her Majesty&#146;s
inspector of the Crown Prosecution Service questioned whether it would
have been suitable for treatment under section 43. In a sense, the
question of whether the case would ever have been dealt with in a
non-jury trial is moot. Of course, problems arose in the management of
that case and in the handling of the charges of conspiracy to defraud.
There were issues in relation to the illness of a defendant, and some
on the disjointed handling of evidence. More particularly, the problems
that arose in relation to the Jubilee line case that were exposed in
the inspector&#146;s report related to the impact of the long trial
on the lives of a number of the jurors. The jurors found that when they
returned to work their promotion had been affected, their relationship
with their employer has been affected, or the way in which they were
able to deal with business had been affected, and the burden on them
was significant. I am not sure that the Jubilee line case entirely
proves either of our points, although it does give some evidence on
both sides of the argument. Yes, the jury in the Jubilee line case gave
clear evidence that it understood the case, which was very complex, but
it also said that there was a burden on
individuals.</div>
<a name="0612134000312"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0612134000576"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> That point I have accepted, and it is agreed
throughout the Committee and the House. Will the Solicitor-General
either tell us now, so that it is on the record, or check later, first,
whether he has figures that show, for the period before and after the
Jubilee line case, which was the one that gave rise to all sorts of
reports, how many cases dealing with fraud have taken more than three
months, six months or&#151;I am trying to ask the question that
allows the easiest answer, if the information exists&#151;a similar
period, and, secondly, whether the same figures exist for that period
across the criminal courts generally? Obviously the burdensome point
will apply in those cases too, because of the length of time away from
normal life. It would be helpful for the debate, as much now as on
Report, if there were figures that showed how many criminal trials in
21st century Britain&#151;or at least England and
Wales&#151;currently exceed the three, six and nine-month
hurdles.</div>
<a name="0612134000313"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0612134000577"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> It might be useful to refer to the
Serious Fraud Office&#146;s annual report for 2005-06, which
says:</div><a name="0612134000414"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In this
year ten trials were completed including23 defendants, among
whom 13 were convicted and ten
acquitted&#148;.</div><a name="0612134000314"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall have
to come back to the hon. Gentleman on the number of trials that lasted
longer than six months. I have the figures, but it will take me a
moment or two to look them up, although I hope to come up with them
shortly, as I quoted them in the debate that we had in the Chamber and
they are in the
transcript.</div><a name="0612134000315"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to take some time to consider those cases in which there was a
burden on juries, because it is important to set out the
Government&#146;s views in relation to them. Another case that comes
to mind is the Maxwell case, which is I am sure is known to all right
hon. and hon. Members. The indictment alleged eight separate
conspiracies to defraud involving combinations of six defendants, plus
two substantive counts of related false accounting. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column81" />Column number: 82</div>The Maxwell brothers were acquitted in 1996, after the first trial
lasting seven months. The second trial was stayed as an abuse of
process. The prosecution had significantly reduced the prosecution case
before it came before the court. Even so, the trial judge severed the
case for trial management purposes and further reduced the number of
counts put forward by the prosecution. The trial judge remarked
that</div> <a name="0612134000415"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the prosecution and
most of the defendants are agreed that, were it practicable, all the
counts should be the subject matter of a single trial ... all are
agreed that the length and complexity of such a trial would far
outstrip the capacity of any
jury&#148;.</div><a name="0612134000316"></a><div class="hs_Para">Following
acquittals in the first trial, the judge due to hear the second trial,
Mr. Justice Buckley, stayed the proceedings on grounds of
abuse. He
noted:</div><a name="0612134000416"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;When
using his powers of severance the trial judge recognised that it would
prevent the prosecution from putting before the jury the full weight of

in a serious and complex fraud, the limitations of jury trial prevent
the prosecution from presenting a case which fairly and adequately
represents the fraud alleged. If that is so, then jury trial is unfair
and
inappropriate.&#148;</div><a name="0612134000318"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
the Da Costa case of 2004, a more recent case, the SFO decided to offer
no evidence on a conspiracy to defraud. The allegation was that the
suspects had been underwriting marine and other insurance on behalf of
an Italian company when they were not authorised to do so. I approach
the case with care, because I make no allegation in relation to those
individuals. The Crown offered no evidence in relation to it, and it
became clear that trying to present the complexity of the case would be
burdensome and difficult. The legal arguments and the trial
judge&#146;s ruling, which suggested that the insurance contracts
would have to be proved separately and could not be relied on to prove
the illegality of the scheme as a whole, meant that the jury would be
required to grapple with the common law doctrine of ostensible
authority against a complex, highly detailed factual background
involving thousands of marine insurance policies. In other words, the
SFO decided not to proceed because the approach that was insisted on
was so complex and unmanageable for a jury. I repeat that I make no
allegation in relation to any of the defendants in that case, for
reasons that hon. Members will
understand.</div>
<a name="0612134000431"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">7.15
pm</div><a name="0612134000319"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have previously referred to the Talbot Village Trust case. The trust
was a charity. It employed professionals who, between 1985 and 1995,
fraudulently overcharged for professional services related to
construction works on major projects. Three of the five defendants were
convicted by a jury. On 26 March 2004, one three-year custodial
sentence was handed down, which was increased to six years on appeal
because of its undue leniency. There were two suspended sentences. The
trial judge ordered that the scope of the prosecutions be reduced for
trial management reasons. That included evidence that for contracts of
the construction company that was run by the acquitted defendants,
profit margins were substantially larger than would be expected of such
contracts. Even so, the trial lasted for 13 months. In many ways, that
is a typical example of a Serious Fraud Office case, in which numerous
individual transactions 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column82" />Column number: 83</div>have to be proved to establish dishonesty. The reduction in the scope of
the prosecution case made it appear disjointed in the view of the SFO
and undermined it in key areas, such as the establishment of
dishonesty. That is why I refer to that
case.</div><a name="0612134000320"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0612134000578"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> I am following carefully what the
Solicitor-General says and I understand the argument. What he has not
said is that there are cases with which prosecutors decide not to
proceed because they would fail the test of being convincing in front
of any tribunal. They would not be able to accumulate the evidence in a
way that a single judge, three judges, a jury or other people would
necessarily find convincing. That applies to all considerations of CPS
or SFO cases. Although the Solicitor-General makes a good point, it is
not persuasive that jury trial must give way so that those cases would
work in front of a single judge and be successful, where others would
fail and result in acquittal.</div>
<a name="0612134000321"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0612134000579"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> I hear what the hon. Gentleman says. He
asked me earlier about some cases; I shall give him the answer that I
did not have to hand then, before I deal with the substantive point.
Between 2002 and 2005, 26 trials lasted more than six months, of which
six lasted more than a year.</div>
<a name="0612134000322"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
point, the nature of jury trial requires the presentation of oral
evidence. By agreement with both parties, a judge may be able view some
written evidence in documentation, either before or during the
proceedings. He may be able to manage that documentation in a way that
does not require the substantial oral presentation that might be
necessary before a jury. Furthermore, defence or prosecution lawyers
may feel that they have to explain things fully to a jury and so
explain them at some length and in substantial detail. The judge,
however, may be able to say to the lawyer who is making his
presentation, &#147;You have gone on too long. I understand your
point. Move on to the next one.&#148; Some hon. Members on the
Government Benches may well feel that I am in that position now. That
is the how a judge can deal with such a
situation.</div><a name="0612134000323"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0612134000580"></a>Mr.
Grieve:</b> In my experience, it is always a dangerous moment
when the judge in a civil case says, &#147;I understand that point;
move on.&#148; One discovers subsequently that he does not understand
it at all and is saddled with a
difficulty.</div><a name="0612134000324"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will
touch on an important point that I mentioned on Second Reading,
although I did not get an answer. I can see that if the prosecution and
the defence agree to the acceptance of certain facts or material, the
judge might have an opportunity to consider them and so short-circuit
some of the oral evidence, but it must be clear that if the parties do
not agree, whether the trial takes place before a jury or a judge
alone, all the evidence must be laid in the usual way and read out if
necessary. Without that, it should not be on the record. Even if they
are agreed, it should still be on the record.
</div><a name="0612134000325"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am troubled by what
the Solicitor-General said, because I do not see where the short cut
lies. The logic of what he said is that some evidence not laid in court
could still be considered by the judge on his own. In my view, that
makes a fair trial impossible.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column83" />Column number: 84</div><a name="0612134000326"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0612134000581"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> It is the case not only under Diplock
court rules but in civil cases that judges may consider documentation.
That is not secret; the documentation it is part of the pleadings,
documents and evidence in the case. However, in jury trials, the
documents will no doubt have to be explained at substantial length so
that juries are fully cognizant of the surrounding circumstances. If a
judge is known to be aware of those circumstances, a lot of that can be
short-circuited.</div><a name="0612134000327"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0612134000582"></a>Mr.
Grieve:</b> Will the Solicitor-General give
way?</div><a name="0612134000328"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0612134000583"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> Let me make this point. The hon.
Gentleman says that it might not reduce the length of some trials. I
accept that. On Second Reading, I accepted that because some trials
might not be severed&#151;all the counts might be included rather
than being cut short and defendants might not be dropped off the end so
as not to make things too complicated for the jury&#151;some cases
might well last longer than an individual severed case. However, the
judge would be able to manage much more effectively the volume of
material and breadth of the case and to deliver a fair verdict that
deals with the defendant&#146;s full culpability without placing an
undue burden on 12 jury
members.</div><a name="0612134000329"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0612134000584"></a>Mr.
Grieve:</b> To pick up on the first point about documents, in
the jury trials with which I have been involved, voluminous documents
were placed before the jury. Not all the documentation is explained in
the course of the trial, but the documentation on which the parties
rely must be explained and considered and individual paragraphs
identified as key in documentary evidence so that the jurors can
highlight it to consider
later.</div><a name="0612134000330"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not really
see that the procedure will be any different with a jury than with a
judge, except that in terms of opening speeches, it might be possible,
as has been said, for the judge to say, &#147;I understand that
point,&#148; whereas prosecutors tend to go over ground carefully if
they think that they are touching on areas of complexity. It worries me
that the very long cases that I envisage will come out of the
legislation might be burdensome to judges and lead to difficulties with
verdicts and a lack of
clarity.</div><a name="0612134000331"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0612134000585"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> Judges do a very good job for us and
are very well paid for it. If they must take something of a burden in
handling complex and serious frauds, that will perhaps be an instance
in which they earn their salary. I shall not worry too much about that.
It is incumbent on Members, however, to consider members of the public
whose lives may well be significantly affected by the burden of having
to sit ina serious and complex fraud case for a period of a
year or more. We know from the Jubilee line case thatthat can
affect their employment status and their circumstances, and we should
not ignore that
burden.</div><a name="0612134000332"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was going to
elaborate further on the Versailles case, the Global Wildlife Trust
case and the PA spiral case, but in view of the time and the length of
my submissions I shall spare the Committee that. Nevertheless, the
burden on juries can be serious, and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column84" />Column number: 85</div>we must ensure that it is recognised. The new clause proposed by the
right hon. and learned Gentleman would change the terms of the
judge&#146;s decision, and would do so in a way that the Government
do not find acceptable. It is axiomatic that no judge will make a
decision that he believes to be manifestly unsafe to the delivery of
justice&#151;that is a broader consideration that judges will always
have.</div>
<a name="0612134000333"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
important to set out in statute the reason for the Government&#146;s
view that change must be made. The reason is clear: change is necessary
because we need to ensure both that the burden on the jury is not
disproportionate and that justice is properly done through exposure of
defendants&#146; full culpability in complex and serious fraud cases.
I hope that my references to older cases, despite being truncated, have
demonstrated that judges who have to deal with such circumstances are
very concerned about that burden and about the effect it has on
presenting, handling and managing the case. The SFO, which has to
prosecute the cases, is very concerned that the requirement to present
complex and detailed evidence orally to the jury makes it difficult
properly to set out a case to that jury. That has resulted in severing
of cases, reducing of counts, and knocking off of some defendants from
the end of charge sheets, none of which delivers justice
effectively.</div> <a name="0612134000334"></a><div class="hs_Para">I accept
that there are similar problems in some other types of case. However,
complex and serious fraud cases have a long history of recommendation
after recommendation, of judges calling attention to matters, and of
Governments not&#151;until 2003&#151;doing enough about the
problem. We are now intent on doing something about it. Justice needs
to be
delivered.</div><a name="0612134000335"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0612134000586"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> The hour is getting late, and I should not be
surprised if, at the conclusion of the debate on the new clause, you
might feel it appropriate to adjourn, Mr. Bercow. It is a
matter entirely for the Committee, so I shall lighten the
grief.</div>
<a name="0612134000336"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us keep in
mind what we are about. We are trying to define the criteria that would
justify a judge-alone trial. The Solicitor-General has advanced at some
length the arguments in favour of the existing provisions in the
Bill&#151;which may be described as the &#147;burdensome&#148;
provisions. I am bound to say that I do not agree with him, which is
very largely because an unfortunate precedent would be set that would
apply to other types of trial. I am realist, however, and I know full
well that the Government have the majority on the Floor of the House
and that they are clearly determined to push the idea forward. I think
it is a bad idea, but so be it&#151;that is the nature of
parliamentary life.</div><a name="0612134000337"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are also, however, in the business of improving legislation, and when
the Solicitor-General was talking a thought occurred to me that I need
to share with the Committee. If I may catch the
Solicitor-General&#146;s attention, I hope that he will reflect on
it. We have accepted the possibility that the defendant will be
entitled to apply for a judge-alone trial, and one has to define the
criteria that will govern that application. The defendant might make an
application on the grounds of burden, and of course subsection (5) of
section 43 enables him to do so. But he might also make an application
on the grounds that the length and complexity of the trial are likely
to impact on the safety of the verdict.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column85" />Column number: 86</div><a name="0612134000432"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">7.30
pm</div><a name="0612134000338"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Committee was good enough to listen to two examples that I produced,
one of which received support from the hon. Member for Somerton and
Frome. In one example, the detail of the case was such that it might
impact on the jury&#146;s verdict; for example, so much
interpretation or translation of documents was required that the jury
might well become confused, and that would impact on the safety of the
verdict. If the defendant is making an application for a judge-alone
trial, he must be able to say why, but the reason might not be
burdensomeness. It might be the one that I just advanced, at which
point the impact on the quality of the verdict should be a
criterion.</div><a name="0612134000339"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
example that the hon. Gentleman picked up on&#151;perhaps I advanced
it less clearly than he did&#151;was when the concept of the defence
is so difficult that it might itself impact on the safety of the
verdict. He said, and I entirely agreed with him, that there will be
cases where one is on the margin between what is illegal and what is
questionable. At that point, a defendant may say to the judge,
&#147;This is such a complicated concept, and it involves so much
history and so many details, proprieties, cross-national jurisdictions
and this and that that a jury will not be able safely to come to a
verdict.&#148; The defendant might wish to use a concept of that kind
to seek a judge-alone
trial.</div><a name="0612134000340"></a><div class="hs_Para">Therefore, on
the basis of improving what I do not like, I am saying that if we must
have the concept of burdensomeness, which I do not like, and given that
the defendant might make an application, we should reflect on the need
for criteria that go to the quality of the verdict on which the
defendant can rely when making an
application.</div><a name="0612134000341"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0612134000587"></a>Stephen
Hesford:</b> Given the late hour, I would
ask the right hon. and learned Gentleman to come clean with the
Committee. The new clause is tendentious. He does not believe that the
jury can be impugned in its deliberation in a case. Neither do the
Government believe that, yet he wants a defendant to be able to make
that argument in order to get a non-jury trial. In fact, the
prosecution will never make such an application to a judge because the
Government and the Crown do not believe that the deliberations of a
jury can be impugned. This is a wrecking
amendment.</div><a name="0612134000342"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0612134000588"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> The hon. Gentleman is a confused and confusing
Member. I do not like the Bill or the concept of burdensome&#151;I do
not make any bones about that. But we are where we are, and I am making
some suggestions as to how the Bill might be improved. The
Solicitor-General has been good enough to say that he will reflect on
the desirability of the defendant&#146;s being able to make an
application for a judge-alone
trial.</div><a name="0612134000343"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
point is that the defendant may do so on the basis that the trial is
likely to be burdensome to the jury, but he may have other reasons
which go to the safety of the verdict. Those other reasons are not
reflected in the Bill or the Act as it is now. Once we accept that the
defendant might be able to make an application for a judge-alone trial,
we must ask what the criteria will be&#151;and they are not confined
to being burdensome. That was my only point, which I think that the
Solicitor-General has understood even if the hon. Member for Wirral,
West has not. I know that other members of the Committee, on the
Opposition Benches, at least, have understood it.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column86" />Column number: 87</div><a name="0612134000344"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given that I
am in favour of improving the Bill, I am perfectly prepared to accept
that my new clause does not go as far as I now think that it should.
Because there is merit in giving careful reflection to what I am
saying, with the leave of the Committee I beg to ask leave to withdraw
the new clause.</div> <a name="0612134000345"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Motion and

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0612134000589"></a>The

response to the observation made by the right hon. and learned Member
for Sleaford and North Hykeham a few moments ago&#151;that I might at
this point seek adjournment of the sitting&#151;that I have no
intention of doing so. We have only to deal with one further new clause
and I should have thought that the Committee would therefore wish to
persevere.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0612134000590"></a>Mr.
Grieve:</b> I beg to move, that the clause be read a Second
time.</div> <a name="0612134000349"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall
endeavour to be brief, seeing that this is the last new clause that we
have to consider in Committee.
</div><a name="0612134000350"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
must first confess to the Committee that when I went to the office to
present amendments to this Bill for consideration, it was my desire
that the Committee might debate having trials by special juries. The
Solicitor-General knows well that we on these Benches were always
prepared to consider that one area of compromise to deal with the issue
of burdensomeness. I believed that it would be possible to put together
jury panels consisting of individuals who were well versed in financial
matters, which would allow them to sit on such panels and consider the
verdict&#151;because I regard having an independent assessment,
separate from the judge, as so important for preserving confidence in
our criminal justice system. We should maintain the principle that it
is not the state against an individual, with the judge reaching a
decision, but independent members of the community who decide on guilt
or innocence.</div>
<a name="0612134000351"></a><div class="hs_Para">That would
have been my preferred course. Yet although I sought as ingeniously as
I could to suggest variously using the terminology
&#147;panel&#148;, or &#147;group of experts&#148;, or any
other device, I discovered that&#151;despite all my creative
ingenuity&#151;those better versed in drafting would tell me firmly
that it could not be done, as the principle at Second Reading was that
we were getting rid of juries. Even a special jury was a jury: even a
&#147;special panel&#148; was a jury by another name. So, I regret
that I have not been as successful as I would have wished in providing
an opportunity for the Committee to revisit that issue.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column87" />Column number: 88</div><a name="0612134000352"></a><div class="hs_Para">I must put on
the record that I believe there was always the possibility of
compromise on such a principle, including a potential departure from
having 12 to have a smaller panel. I am convinced that if this is a
real area of difficulty, that would be the wise way to proceed. There
are plenty of people of the right age around, being semi-retired, who
could make up such a panel and be only too happy to spend months poring
over a case that was forensically interesting to them. They would also
have the independence to deliver a verdict that would command public
acceptance and confidence.</div>
<a name="0612134000353"></a><div class="hs_Para">Seeing as I could not do that,
the only thing to do was to put before the Committee the proposal that
the judge should sit with assessors. That apparently is permissible, as
they would be with&#151;and retire with&#151;the judge, and the
judge would still have a role in the verdict. I must accept one point:
if the motion were to proceed, it would need fleshing out. On the basis
of what I have tabled, I accept that it is not clear whether there
would be a majority verdict or a casting vote from the judge, and that
other details would need further examination. The only merit of the
proposal is that the final decision is not that of the judge on his
own. If a judge were to sit with a panel of six assessors, there would
have to be unanimity or a majority, or a straight majority with a
casting vote from the judge if there were a three-three split on guilt
or innocence at the end of a trial. The proposal has, however as I say,
the merit that the judge&#146;s role is diluted, and that the role of
the independent assessors, suitably selected, is enhanced.</div>
<a name="0612134000354"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should be grateful for the
Government&#146;s response&#151;it is a probing motion&#151;about
why such a course of action does not commend itself. It would be useful
for the Committee to know at what point the Government decide that the
introduction of lay assessors becomes impossible. The Solicitor-General
knows&#151;I do not think that I am giving away any
secrets&#151;that on occasion, there have been hints from the
Government that some form of lay assessor might be acceptable.
Generally speaking, however, they have been talking about two lay
assessors and a judge. That is an uncomfortable concept, because it
does not have the necessary critical mass; I should prefer more
assessors. Again, I hope that I can tease out of the Solicitor-General
the Government&#146;s views on the gist of the proposal, its
principle and its detail.</div>
<a name="0612134000355"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to make it clear that in
moving the new clause, it is in no sense a preferred option. It makes
absolutely no difference to my hostility to the Bill, nor I suspect to
the outright hostility that will occur in another place, too. There
would be a way forward&#151;a way forward that I rather sought to put
before the Committee. Unfortunately, however, the Government&#146;s
implacable desire to get rid of trial by jury makes it impossible for
us to consider it, which I regret. Even at the eleventh hour and
fifty-ninth minute, if the Government were wise, they might reconsider
that issue.</div>
<a name="0612134000356"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0612134000591"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> On the question of lay assessors, I entirely agree
with my hon. Friend about critical mass. Two or three lay assessors is
not a critical mass. Again, in the spirit of trying to improve the
imperfect, he will keep in mind the Crown court when it acts as a court
of appeal from justices. There, one sometimes has a Crown court judge
sitting with two justices, and that might be a model on which one could
proceed if we have to go down this road at
all.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column88" />Column number: 89</div><a name="0612134000357"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0612134000592"></a>Mr.
Grieve:</b> Yes. As I say, the Government have not come up
with the proposal, although in the past they have floated it. In
fairness to them, the proposal has on the whole received a frosty
reception from the Opposition parties. However, before it was too late
and we ended up with what I anticipate will be a great confrontation
between the Lords and the Commons, I wanted to tease out how far the
Government&#146;s give might go on such an issue. If I may say to the
hon. and learned Gentleman, the Solicitor-General, I do so in a
conciliatory spirit and not to wrong-foot him.</div>
<a name="0612134000358"></a><div class="hs_Para">I appreciate
that the Solicitor-General may disagree with the principle of the
proposal or with the number of lay assessors, and that he may come up
with arguments, which I prefer to have on record, about why the course
of action is considered impractical, unwise or unnecessary. However, I
should not wish this Committee to be completed without our having an
opportunity to consider the motion.</div>
<a name="0612134000359"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall now sit down. My one
regret is that we have not had the opportunity of considering a
proposal for special juries, which would commend itself to me so very
much
more.</div>

hon. Friend the Member for Somerton and Frome and I were aware, and it
was clear from the drafting of the advice, that there was a line beyond
which we could not go formally. The hon. Gentleman tried to get as near
to that line as he could, and again, I want to respond.</div>
<a name="0612134000361"></a><div class="hs_Para">I, my hon.
Friend and our colleagues do not support the proposal, because we have
always argued that there should be a clear division between the person
who is in charge of judging the law and the people who arein
charge of judging the fact. Thus, the principle that in serious cases
facts and guilt are determined by lay people&#151;representatives of
the public, not professionals paid to be judges&#151;is kept. That is
Lord Devlin&#146;s small Parliament, little democracy principle. It
is about having a criminal justice system that, whether in a
magistrates court with lay justices or in the higher courts with
juries, ensures that decisions about guilt and innocence involve the
public and are not handed over to
professionals.</div>
<a name="0612134000433"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">7.45
pm</div><a name="0612134000362"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to make
it clear that the new clause goes a step or two too far. It is,
however, a welcome probing measure that opens up discussion as to where
there might be common ground. In that context, let me outline some of
the options that I explored in conversations with the Solicitor-General
and the Attorney-General. It is in everybody&#146;s interests that we
should do that openly and straightforwardly.</div>
<a name="0612134000363"></a><div class="hs_Para">The first option that we
explored was to have smaller juries&#151;juries of fewer than 12
people, possibly eight or even half a dozen. Why? Because if there were
a burden it would be a burden on a smaller number of people. The second
was to draw juries from a pool of people who would hold themselves
available for trials such as those that we are discussing, because that
would not be as burdensome for them as it is for others.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column89" />Column number: 90</div><a name="0612134000364"></a><div class="hs_Para">Certain categories of people
would be willing totake up that offer. Perhaps they could
answer a supplementary question about empanelling juries when they
filled in their forms to register on the electoral roll; then enquiries
could be made. We need to ensure that we do not end up with
representatives of only one section of the community, but one can
imagine that the offer might be taken up by people who are retired,
those who are unable to do paid work for a significant period following
injury and so on, and those who are willing to do it because they are
self-employed and can manage their lives accordingly. I do not say that
the principle is perfect, but it would be entirely possible to
construct an alternative pool of people for whom it was not a
burdensome task in the way that it might be for somebody who was taken
off the street, brought to the court and, out of the blue, told that
the case might last for nine months rather than the usual two weeks.
Both of those options are possible.</div>
<a name="0612134000365"></a><div class="hs_Para">The third
option that we considered was one that used lay magistrates&#151;not
trained lawyers or judges&#151;as jurors. There would be a
professional judge, with the jurors separately as judges of fact. That
is a difficult argument to sustain, but it is worth considering. It
would, however, be a separation. Finally, we had conversations that
crossed the line in the direction of this new clause. That involved
having a judge plus other people sitting with the judge. There was a
discussion&#151;I do not want to betray any confidences&#151;that
involved including magistrates or assessors, that is to say experts or
lay people, in combination, so that one or the other or both could sit
with the judge. As the hon. Member for Beaconsfield indicated, they
would retire with the judge. I think that that goes too far, as I have
said. Therefore, my hon. Friend and I cannot support the new
clause.</div> <a name="0612134000366"></a><div class="hs_Para">For us, it is
not an absolute principle that there have to be 12 people for a jury,
or that there has to be any particular number. The number has to have
sufficient weight or centre of gravity to be a group; I think that the
phrase is critical mass. It is also important that there should be a
distinction, so that the public can see that the defendant can know
that two functions are being addressed in the court: the assessment of
the law and the judgment of the facts. That, for us, is the principle.
Within those parameters, there is a conversation that we are still
willing to have and, I am happy to say, my hon. Friend and I are
willing to return to the matter.</div>
<a name="0612134000367"></a><div class="hs_Para">If we went down that road, there
might be progress. It would not be technically a &#147;fraud (trials
without a jury)&#148; Act because there would be a jury. It would be
a &#147;fraud (less burdensome ways of trying these big
cases)&#148; Act and that is, according to the Government, one of the
objectives. It would also achieve the second Government objective:
there would not be the difficulty, if one accepts the
Government&#146;s case, about exposing the potential breadth of
criminality. If one had selected, smaller numbers and more expert
jurors, it would be possible to sustain an argument that they were able
to look at anything that the prosecution was minded to give
them.</div><a name="0612134000368"></a><div class="hs_Para">We will not
support the new clause. It is worth probing the matter, if only to
encourage the Solicitor-General and the Attorney-General to think that
there may even yet be some ground that we could find 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column90" />Column number: 91</div>between us that might save quite a long process in this Session and
another quite long process in the next Session. It may be better to get
something done this year, rather than nothing being done this year and
a great battle with an uncertain outcome next
year.</div>
<a name="0612134000369"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0612134000594"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> We have had substantial discussions on
this matter both privately and publicly, and I do not think it is
likely that we are going to get a compromise. I wish that I could be
convinced that Opposition Front Benchers would be likely to agree to a
compromise. The Government have made clear what our view is and
Opposition Members have done likewise. I do not think that there is
likely to be any room for the compromise that we have sought, which has
not been forthcoming.</div>
<a name="0612134000370"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Beaconsfield described, quite fairly, the new clause as a
probing measure. It was not favoured by Roskill or Sir Robin Auld in
the way he describes, but they both looked at it. Roskill recommended a
judge sitting with two lay members drawn from a panel of persons with
general expertise in business and experience of complex transactions.
Auld came to a similar conclusion but only, as he put it, after
considerable thought. As he acknowledged, the arrangement would not be
without its difficulties. What would be the role of the expert members?
Would there be a risk that members would contribute evidence that could
not easily be challenged by the parties? How readily could suitable
members be found? What would be the cost of remunerating them? For all
those and other reasons, the Government have decided that, on balance,
following the seminar and various representations made to us, the
option of trial by judge alone was preferable.</div>
<a name="0612134000371"></a><div class="hs_Para">Sir Robin Auld had this to say
about special juries; it was referred to during the
debate:</div><a name="0612134000418"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
proposal would revive for a special category of criminal case an
institution that was abolished in criminal and most civil cases in 1949
and had been little used in crime for several decades before that. If
the institution were to be revived for fraud and possibly other complex
cases the first question would be the nature of the qualifications
required for selection as a potential special juror. Presumably in the
context of fraud they would need to be those with wide experience of
business and finance. But, as the Roskill committee pointed out in
rejecting this option, it would be difficult to empanel a jury even
from such a restricted category who would collegiately have the degree
of specialist knowledge or expertise which by definition they would be
required to have for the particular subject in each case. And even if
suitably qualified jurors, maybe smaller than twelve, could be found,
it would be unreasonable to expect them to serve the length of time
that many such fraud trials now take.&#148;</div>
<a name="0612134000372"></a><div class="hs_Para">That deals with the points raised in
relation to special juries. It is from Sir Robin Auld rather than me.
In the Government&#146;s view, it is a serious objection to a special
jury that evidence would have to be presented to it orally without the
interaction with counsel. It would not be possible, as it would be for
a tribunal or for a judge, for the jury of the sort described to let
the lawyers know that they had understood a point and that the lawyers
should move on&#151;in other words, to be able to manage the case
themselves. The Opposition&#146;s idea that the decider and the
arbitrator of a case must be separated would make it far more difficult
to manage. If a single judge were sitting, or a judge with perhaps two
lay assessors, he would be able to manage the case much more
effectively and its complexity could be properly evaluated. That would
not be the position 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column91" />Column number: 92</div>in the case of a special jury or in the system proposed in the new
clause. I appreciate that it is a probing new clause, and I hope that I
have given views on the points raised and that the motion will be
withdrawn.</div><a name="0612134000373"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0612134000595"></a>Mr.
Grieve:</b> I am grateful to the Solicitor-General for
participating in the debate in the spirit in which the new clause was
tabled and for dealing with the wider issues that I raised on special
juries. I wish to pick up on two or three points, because there are
matters on which I disagree with the Solicitor-General and with Sir
Robin Auld and Lord
Roskill.</div><a name="0612134000374"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
suggested that one of the objections to specialist lay assessors is
that the extent to which they would bring their own knowledge to bear
on a case would be unclear. But that happens all the time with jurors,
who are entitled to bring to the jury box their own knowledge and
experience of the world. Some of them have specialist knowledge, and
that is explicit in barristers now being allowed to serve on juries. If
they get on to the jury, which sometimes does not happen because they
know the judge, defendant or a counsel, they certainly have a knowledge
of court procedure. That includes occasions when a jury has been sent
out for some reason, so they have a pretty good idea of issues that
require a jury&#146;s non-attendance. That does not seem to trouble
the Government, and it does not really trouble me much. I do not
consider the fact that lay assessors might have background knowledge of
the areas covered a viable
objection.</div><a name="0612134000375"></a><div class="hs_Para">On special
juries, if the Solicitor-General would like to come my constituency, he
will find a plethora of
retired&#151;</div><a name="0612134000376"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0612134000596"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will be
very brief and sparing in his remarks about special juries. I know that
some comments on them have already been made, but, strictly speaking,
if he were to dilate upon the point, he would be in danger of
addressing a new clause that some might wish we had to consider but
which we do not, rather than the one that we do
have.</div><a name="0612134000377"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0612134000597"></a>Mr.
Grieve:</b> I can promise you, Mr. Bercow, that I
shall be very brief and only respond to the Solicitor-General&#146;s
helpful comments.</div><a name="0612134000378"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
the Solicitor-General comes to my constituency, he will find a plethora
of retired chartered accountants and professionals, many of whom would
be only too happy to give some of their time, particularly as many of
them took early retirement when pensions policies were rather
different. They would be happy to devote time to considering the
matters in question, and would do so well. I simply do not accept that
it would be impossible to find panels of individuals capable of doing
the job.</div><a name="0612134000379"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have said
clearly that this is a probing new clause, and I am grateful to the
Solicitor-General for responding in its spirit. There may well be no
meeting of minds on the matter, for the reasons given by the hon.
Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey. I agree with him&#151;the
approach in the Bill does not commend itself to me. I have said, out of
conscience if nothing else, that if the Government&#146;s anxiety is
about the difficulty and burden on ordinary jurors, we can do 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column92" />Column number: 93</div>something about that. I hope that the Government will continue to
consider the issue. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
motion.</div><a name="0612134000380"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Motion and

Solicitor-General:</b> On a point of order, Mr.
Bercow, I extend the Committee&#146;s thanks to you as Chairman. Due
to the firmness of your chairmanship, not only was good order
maintained but we were able to have a full debate and finish the
Committee early. We are grateful to you for that.</div>
<a name="0612134000383"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also extend my thanks to the
Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, my hon. Friend the
Member for Enfield, North, for her efforts duringthe passage
of the Bill. I also thank my hon. Friend the Member for Tynemouth, who
is the Government Whip and other members of the Committee from all
parties, especially my hon. Friend the Member for Coventry, South, my
Parliamentary Private
Secretary.</div><a name="0612134000384"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also thank
the police, the attendants and, most importantly, as they ensured that
I was able to deal with the issues, those officials who were kind
enough to give me such excellent briefing. I also extend my thanks for
the very considered way in which the Opposition spokespersons, the hon.
Members for Beaconsfield and for North Southwark and Bermondsey, and
their colleagues made their
points.</div><a name="0612134000385"></a><div class="hs_Para">I give
particular thanks to the right hon. and learned Member for Sleaford and
North Hykeham, who after many years as a Back Bencher might have got a
Minister to look at something again. Whether he gets the result he
wants remains to be seen.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0612134000599"></a>Mr.

Bercow, I associate myself and my hon. Friend with those remarks. I add
my thanks to our friends from <i class="I">Hansard</i> whom the Minister may
accidentally, but not intentionally I am sure, have omitted to mention.
Rarely can such serious business on such important issues have been
conducted so quickly. It was due to our having a short Bill that did
not allow many
