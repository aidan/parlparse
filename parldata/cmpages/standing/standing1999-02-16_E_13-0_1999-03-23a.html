<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Bruce </B>(South Dorset): I beg to move 
amendment No. 120, in page 15, leave out lines 22 to 37.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take 
the following amendments: No. 122, in page 15, line 31, 
at end insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`Provided that regulations under this section shall only be made 
with the purpose of protecting employees' rights and not otherwise 
to interfere with the commercial relationship between such agencies 
or businesses and employers'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 254, in page 16, leave out lines 10 to 16.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> May I put on record my somewhat 
qualified thanks. The Whip was kind enough to point out 
this morning that I should look in my post. I found there 
the draft consultation document on the regulation of 
private recruitment industries. I have taken the document 
out of its envelope, but I have not yet read a word of it. 
We put the Government on notice that although the 
document might be helpful, we are likely to debate its 
contents when we return to clause 28 on Report.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Boswell </B>(Daventry): Although my hon. 
Friend has not read the document in detail, a problem that 
he shares with me, does he concede that it was more or 
less physically impossible in the time available to read it, 
let alone assimilate its 60 or so pages of closely typed 
print?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend; but, as I 
said, I have not read a word. I have not even attempted to 
start reading it.
<P>
Before getting into the meat of the amendments,
Mr. Atkinson, I thought that it might be appropriate to 
give a short history lesson to hon. Members who have not 
worked, as I have, in the employment agencies industry. 
I left the industry 12 years ago, and I earn no money from 
it, but I thought that it would be useful to put on record 
how the Employment Agencies Act 1973 and the 
regulations that flow from it came into being.
<P>
Some hon. members may be surprised to discover that 
the idea for the 1973 Act came from a private Member. 
Sir Kenneth Lewis, who was the then Conservative 
Member for Rutland and Stamford, decided in the early 
1970s that, because his industry the travel agency 
industry was highly regulated, the employment agency 
industry should be covered by national regulations to 
protect the rights of employees.
<P>
The Employment Agencies Act 1973 was meant to 
acknowledge that an individual who wandered in off the 
street to work for an employment agency for a week or 
two, or even for only one day's work, was not in the same 
position as an employee who, after an interview, could 
have several months to think about whether he wanted to 
work for that employer. An employee has a permanent 
contract with the employer; it is a long-term and different 
relationship. However, in view of the way in which they 
put people to work, it was decided that employment 
agencies should be additionally regulated, to ensure that 
individuals were fairly treated.
<P>
Before Labour Members say that the Government 
should get rid of the 1973 Act because it was a Tory Bill, 
I should say that the regulations were made not under a 
Conservative Government but under a Labour 
Government. The regulations were made to protect 
employees fully. However, the Prime Minister was 
incorrect to say that, because the Act dated from 1973, it 
was high time that it was revised. The regulations have, 
of course, been revised many times since then.
<P>
The Employment Agencies Act 1973 is designed to 
protect employees. I have searched the database for the 
hon. Member for Corby (Mr. Hope) who had, I thought, 
given the same speech on a dozen occasions. I was 
incorrect he has given it on only three occasions, 
although he may have intervened to give it on others.
<P>
When I first arrived in the House, an older Member 
told me, "If you have a good speech, stick with it it 
could keep you going for 20 years". The hon. Gentleman 
is an example of someone who seems to have based his 
whole career on one speech. He may be justified in his 
belief that some employment agencies in his constituency 
have been up to things that he does not like. However, he 
has given us only the example of a lady who lost her 
wages, or had them reduced, because she did not turn up 
for the full duration of her contract. He has not named the 
agency involved I hope that he will do so today and 
the details of the story have changed each time that he 
has given it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Stewart </B>(Eccles): Whose speech are you 
giving?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I am trying to boil down the speech by the 
hon. Member for Corby, as I know that he will want to 
make a speech later but his Whip might not allow him.
<P>
The other example that the hon. Gentleman gave was 
of a 16-year-old who, instead of doing his GCSEs, was 
working an evening shift. That is a strange criticism of an 
employment agency, and I suspect that the hon. 
Gentleman may have fallen into the trap of finding an 
example that had nothing to do with an employment 
agency. Employment agencies are subject to additional 
regulations that do not apply to ordinary employers. I 
hope that he will give us some more examples.
<P>
In Hansard, we can read of the hon. Gentleman's 
passion in suggesting that Corby is rife with terrible 
events in the employment agency industry. We can also 
read that the Minister of State pointed out that he had 
ensured that the Department of Employment inspectors 
as they used to be called, although I do not know which 
Department they come under these days had gone to 
Corby to check out the situation.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. May I counsel the hon. 
Gentleman that he is making what I would term a clause 
stand part speech. It might be sensible for him to outline 
the background to the amendments if hon. Members want 
a clause stand part debate when we have finished with 
the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I am grateful to you, Mr. Atkinson. I was 
certainly going on too long, and I accept your advice.
<P>
The point that I was laboriously getting to was that, 
under the Employment Agencies Act 1973, the Minister 
of State could send an inspector directly into employment 
agencies to find out what was occurring. When an 
employer acted in the same way as an employment agency 
and gave someone a temporary contract, the Minister of 
State had no power to intervene.
<P>
The practice that concerns the hon. Member for 
Corby reducing someone's wages to £1 an hour would 
be outlawed under the minimum wage legislation. 
Whatever penalty clause was in someone's contract, the 
absolute minimum would be £3.20 or £3.60, depending 
on that individual's age.
<P>
I am worried because the Bill legislates for the 
problems that the hon. Gentleman mentioned, which I do 
not think exist. If they do, they have been cured by 
other legislation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that 
elsewhere in the Bill certain rights are attached to workers 
who are associated with or working under employment 
agencies? Those personal rights are therefore secured 
under those provisions, so it might seem that further 
regulations in that area are redundant.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> Indeed, I understand that to be the case.
<P>
It was extremely helpful of the Government to show in 
the explanatory notes how the Bill will affect employment 
agencies. The House decided to give special rights to 
people who worked through employment agencies. 
However, it decided not to intervene in the rights of the 
employment agency or employment business two 
different terms; I am sure that the Committee is 
sufficiently knowledgeable of the difference except in 
deciding how the employment agency and the employer 
deal with the employee.
<P>
The 1973 Act contained a restricting clause. The 
amendments to the Act proposed in clause 28 will result 
in a completely new employment agency Act. On page 60 
of the explanatory notes, which detail the existing 
regulations, the restriction that will be excluded is as 
follows:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Provided that regulations under this section shall not make 
provision for regulating or restricting the charging of fees to 
employers by persons carrying on such agencies and businesses."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That restriction will be excluded from the 1973 Act, and 
the Act will therefore be turned on its head. The Act will 
now be able to regulate all the terms and conditions that 
someone who wants to hire a temporary employee would 
have negotiated with the company providing that 
employee. That is dangerous.
<P>
When the Department of Trade and Industry originally 
told us that it intended to change the regulations, the then 
Secretary of State said that the issues that would be 
covered included the:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"need to ensure proper standards on reference checking"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
with which the clause emphatically does not deal the
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"rules requiring agencies to pay workers promptly and fully"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
with which the regulations do not deal but which is in fact 
already covered by the Act and the
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"obligation on agencies holding clients' money to safeguard it 
properly"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
with which, again, the clause does not deal, and which is 
already covered by the Act.
<P>
It is extremely strange that the Bill should try to do 
what is proposed. I have tried to understand what the 
Government are trying to do.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am trying to do the impossible read 
the draft regulations, and listen to my hon. Friend's 
speech. I find his speech slightly more compelling than 
the regulations.
<P>
Paragraph 6.5.32 of the consultation document on the 
new regulations suggests that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The Government believesthat a clarification of the basis upon 
which temporary staff hire services are provided is necessary."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It suggests that temporary staff hire should normally be 
conducted in future on an employment business, not an 
agency, footing, thereby steering the basis of our entire 
system of employment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I am grateful for that intervention, but I 
suspect that if I try to understand what is in that 60-page 
document at the same time as trying to understand what I 
am trying to tell the Committee, I shall be in a muddle. 
However, I am worried about what is happening.
<P>
I draw the Committee's attention to the four examples 
in the explanatory notes of matters on which regulations 
might be made. First, the regulations might restrict
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the ability of employment agencies and employment businesses to 
vary unilaterally the terms of their contracts or other arrangements 
with workers and hirers"	.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The hon. Member for Corby talked about that particular 
problem. Now that holiday pay and the minimum wage 
have been introduced, such matters are already covered, 
so I cannot understand what the Government are trying to 
do, especially as an ordinary person employed on either a 
temporary or a permanent contract with an employer will 
get the contract of employment within three months. That 
will be the law. However, under the Employment 
Agencies Act 1973, each party to the contract must get a 
copy of it within 24 hours. So I do not know why the 
Government think that they must intervene in the 
contract terms.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Secondly, the regulations might restrict
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the ability of employment agencies and businesses to make 
payment to a worker for work done by him conditional upon his 
doing other work".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Again, that may be the problem referred to by the hon. 
Member for Corby, but the minimum wage will sort it out.
<P>
Thirdly, the regulations might prevent
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"employment agencies from purporting to enter into contracts on 
behalf of workers unless they are permitted to charge such workers 
for finding them work, and have a binding contract with them giving 
them authority to enter into such contracts".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is such a muddle that I do not know what is intended. 
Loopholes hardly ever exist in the current system, but if 
the Minister has specific requirements, he can deal with 
them under the existing legislation without changing it.
<P>
Fourthly, the regulations might restrict
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the ability of employment businesses and employment agencies to 
impose terms on employers which seek to prevent or discourage 
them from dealing, whether directly or through another employment 
business or agency, with workers supplied to them; or from referring 
such workers to other persons who might employ them. Where 
businesses seek to impose charges in any of these circumstances 
regulations might limit the size of those charges, time limit their 
application, or prohibit them altogether."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Employment agencies are most worried about that matter.
<P>
An extremely effective route into employment is 
created when employers contact employment agencies 
because they need temps to fill vacancies caused by 
maternity leave, holidays or a series of holidays over the 
summer, or by someone going suddenly, leaving an 
employer in the lurch because a month or so is needed to 
recruit someone else. The temps taken on in those 
circumstances often become permanent employees, 
simply because they demonstrate that they can do an 
extremely good job.
<P>
If the employer rang the employment agency and said, 
"Will you send me somebody for the permanent job?", 
the agency would sent a temp for the permanent job and, 
if the temp was successful, the agency would charge the 
employer a fee. The tradition in the industry is that, if an 
agency sends in a temp, it charges the normal rate for the 
temp doing the job, but if the employer decides to take 
on the temp, the employer pays a permanent placement 
fee. The industry is extremely concerned that the 
Government may outlaw that arrangement. It should be 
remembered that they are contracts freely entered into 
between the agency and the employer.
<P>
Another problem is that, unfortunately, employers 
sometimes take on an individual on a permanent basis and 
say, "Don't tell the employment agency that we have 
taken you on, because we would rather not pay them the 
fee that they are entitled to." That happens regularly.
<P>
If one was supposedly not allowed to refer on an 
employee, another problem could arise. Employment 
agencies are very good at finding out that someone has 
been employed permanently. However, if the agency finds 
out that that has happened, the employer might say, "Ah, 
no, you sent the temp to Ian Bruce Associates, but the 
temp is now employed by Ian Bruce trading as Bos 
Recruitment."	 I could have done that when I was an 
employer because I owned companies that traded with 
each other and worked on the same premises. The ability 
to refer on to another individual to avoid paying a 
permanent recruitment fee would add an unnecessary 
loophole and cause the problems that I have outlined.
<P>
I referred earlier to the differences between the position 
of an employment agency, which is highly regulated to 
protect the employees, and that of an employer who takes 
on somebody on a temporary contract, who is not covered 
by the same regulations. Instead of taking on people under 
the employment agencies legislation, employment 
agencies might decide to take on people on a permanent 
contract. That is happening already with some 
employment businesses. Much contract business is carried 
out in that way, particularly with the Transfer of 
Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 
1981 and given that people have continuity of 
employment if they have been in the job for a long time. 
It is becoming less attractive to employ someone through 
an employment agency and more attractive to say, "I am 
a business setting up to employ people and to supervise 
them"	 which is the critical issue. Businesses that put 
people in to do a job avoid being covered by the 
Employment Agencies Act 1973.
<P>
If we telephoned Buckingham palace, the operator who 
answered the telephone would be not a member of the 
palace staff, but a contract worker. If we rang the 
Treasury, we would be answered not by a civil servant 
employed by the Treasury but by a contract worker. If 
we telephoned No. 10 Downing street, the switchboard 
operator would be not a civil servant but a contract 
worker. I know all about such things because, as I 
declared earlier, an organisation that is related to one that 
I advise provides people for such jobs. It does so using 
an employment agency type of arrangement. If someone 
changes contract, people do not usually charge fees from 
one agency to another; it is done almost by way of a 
gentleman's agreement. There is no problem about that. 
Indeed, No. 10 Downing street has recently changed 
agencies and there has been no transfer of recruitment 
fees. I shall not embarrass the agency that lost the contract 
by naming it.
<P>
There is some uncertainty. The Federation of 
Recruitment and Employment Services may have said to 
the Government that it would be helpful to have 
clarification when two sets of contract workers transfer 
from one employment business to another, but I do not 
believe that a problem exists that needs to be covered 
by legislation.
<P>
The amendments tackle the matter in two ways. First, 
amendment No. 120 would "delete the provisions because 
there is no need for them. Secondly, amendment No. 122 
would add the provision:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Provided that regulations under this section shall only be made 
with the purpose of protecting employees' rights and not otherwise 
to interfere with the commercial relationship between such agencies 
or businesses and employers."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am attempting to reinstate the original intention of the 
Employment Agencies Act, which is that it should not be 
the business of the Government, especially a new Labour 
Government, to regulate the commercial arrangements 
between someone who goes out looking for staff and finds 
employment for them, and someone who employs staff 
directly. That relationship does not need to be regulated, 
especially when we consider the fees that are charged. It 
is a competitive market. Employment agencies face not 
only normal competition from others who have to make 
a living but competition from jobcentres, which provide 
temporary and permanent labour to employers free of 
charge. People in an employment agency, with their skills 
and abilities, can negotiate fees sometimes substantial 
ones from an employer, when a jobcentre, which is 
funded by the taxpayer, can do it for nothing.
<P>
Before the Committee thinks that employment agencies 
will be crying into their beers, soup, or whatever, hon. 
Members should understand that the Bill may be a 
bonanza to employment agencies. The more regulations 
that the Government pile on to employers, the more 
employers will say, "Oh, crumbs, I don't even know what 
the law means now. It is easiest to ring up my local 
employment agency to sort out the problems. they can 
send in some temps."	 The Government may well be 
providing a bonanza with, for example, the additional 
maternity pay provision.
<P>
Employment agencies will not be spending too much 
time complaining about the Bill. As long as their 
commercial ability to do their job is not interfered with, 
they will not worry about what the Government have to 
say about the protection of employees. Most employment 
agencies know that they can be successful only if they do 
a good job not just for the employers to whom they send 
people but for the employees. Someone can be sent to do 
a job at whatever fee, but if it is not done fairly and 
sensibly, the individual will not do a good job, and the 
employer will not use the agency again. There is an 
extremely dynamic relationship between the two.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Bercow </B>(Buckingham): Is my hon. Friend's 
fear reinforced by the fact that in our Committee 
proceedings last week, the Minister for Small Firms, 
Trade and Industry was not willing to give a guarantee 
that the final form of the regulations accompanying the 
Bill would be shorter than the 72 pages of the working 
time directive or the 112 pages on the implementation of 
the national minimum wage?

<P>

<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I understand that the Minister will give no 
assurance on that. Even the draft consultation paper is 
lengthy. The Minister says that it may be changed, and I 
hope that it will be if it has not been changed already 
in the light of our comments. The Government will have 
the same sort of problems as with the national minimum 
wage. The concept can be quite simple, but the details 
that are required in regulations to avoid unintended 
consequences are likely to be extraordinarily long. If the 
Government want to give rights to employees, they should 
be even-handed. They should be even-handed too, with 
employers and the employment agencies. The relationship 
between the two is extremely dynamic and it is good for 
the United Kingdom economy.
<P>
One of our worries about the clause is that the Labour 
party made a commitment in, I think, its 1984 manifesto 
that it would abolish private employment agencies and 
employment businesses. I am glad to say that a few years 
later, when I asked the then shadow Employment Secretary, who is now the Prime Minister, what he would do about that pledge, he shrugged his shoulders and said, 
"Well, you know, it is not really terribly important any 
more."	 As employment agencies do an extremely good 
job for UK Ltd., I want the Minister to say that he has 
abandoned all thought of abolishing any fees.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that the 
policy has evolved somewhat from being the longest 
suicide note in history to being the longest indifference 
note in history? We are now asking the Minister to give 
the longest endorsement of the principle that employment 
agencies are a useful part of the industrial scene.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I am grateful for that comment.
<P>
When I was a member of the Select Committee on 
Employment a real Committee rather than a 
Sub-Ccommittee of another Select Committee we 
decided to examine how employment regulations affected 
employment. We talked to the French about their 
regulations and were told that in France it was effectively 
illegal to employ someone on a temporary contract for 
longer than three months. All the regulations that one 
could possibly imagine were in place to stop people 
transferring on to temporary contracts. The aim was for 
them to stay on permanent contracts. That was at a time 
when in the United Kingdom the number of people on 
temporary contracts was rising from around 6 per cent. to 
7 or even 7.5 per cent. of those employed.
<P>
Labour colleagues on the Select Committee were 
concerned that this country was moving more and more 
to a temporary contact mentality. We then compared our 
situation with the French one and examined how many 
people in France, where temporary contracts were illegal, 
were on temporary contacts. The figure was amazing;
25 per cent. of employees in France were on temporary 
contracts even though the French Government had gone 
to extraordinary lengths to try to outlaw temporary 
employment. They had also gone to extraordinary lengths 
to protect the permanent employee, who could never be 
sacked. All that that meant was that there was a revolving 
door. People were not employed for more than three 
months. A person was kept on a temporary contract for 
three months and was then told, "On yer bike."	 That 
person then had to go to the next employment agency to 
ask for another temporary contract. That was ridiculous.
<P>
We are not suggesting that the general market should 
move towards temporary contracts. The history is clear. 
If employers have long-term permanent jobs, they prefer 
to employ people on permanent contracts and give them 
golden handcuffs or whatever. When people have worked 
for a company for a length of time, they acquire skills and 
their productivity increases. That is what we want to see.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> My hon. Friend has adduced a powerful 
example from the French experience. I wonder whether 
he agrees with me that the example that he gave is a 
classic case of harmful consequences flowing from benign 
intentions. Will my hon. Friend resolve my uncertainty 
about one issue? Before making his speech did he consult 
either "The Road to Serfdom"	 which was published in 
1944 or "The Constitution of Liberty"	 which was 
published in 1960? Both are splendid tomes penned by 
the late Austrian philosopher Friedrich von Hayek who 
was extremely astute on the matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I would like to say that I read them in the 
original language, but I am afraid that I did not read them 
in that form or in translation. I hope that my hon. Friend 
will entertain, inform and educate the Committee by 
giving us a speech just about those publications.
<P>
I have a final point about unforeseen consequences. I 
do not know whether anyone saw in The Daily Telegraph 
yesterday a massive article that told us that, because of 
additional regulations, last year there were twice as many 
appeals to industrial tribunals as in 1990. That trend is 
apparent even before much of the new regulation is made 
law. We do not want people to resort constantly to law or 
tribunals. Let us keep the regulations simple.
<P>
I appeal to the Minister to accept my amendment so 
that we do not proceed with all the additional regulations 
that are in the Bill. If not, will he give the assurance that 
he is not trying to interfere with commercial arrangements 
but only ensuring that employee rights are protected?
<P>
<B>Mr. Phil Hope </B>(Corby): I welcome the opportunity to 
debate clause 28, which relates to the operation of 
employment agencies. As has been mentioned, I raised my 
concerns about their operation in my maiden speech 22 
months ago. I have written to Ministers about the problems 
that have been experienced regularly in my constituency. 
More recently, an Adjournment debate identified the 
problems of temporary workers. I am delighted that the 
hon. Member for South Dorset (Mr. Bruce) has taken such 
an interest in my contributions. In the words of Professional 
Recruiter magazine, I have become the Member of 
Parliament that some employment agencies love to hate. I 
am famous, at least in recruitment circles.
<P>
The clause allows the Government to introduce new 
regulations to govern the operation of employment 
agencies.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Bruce:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hope:</B> I shall make some progress and then give 
way. New regulations are long overdue; it is some 25 
years since the law regulating employment agencies was 
created. We need new, modern laws and regulations as 
we move into the labour market of the 21st century.
<P>
The hon. Member for South Dorset is right that the 
employment agency labour market has changed 
considerably, but his amendments would not help deal 
with that. One hundred years ago, agencies focused on the 
supply of temporary domestic servants and entertainers. 
Today, 900,000 workers in virtually all types of 
employment, forming 5 per cent. of the work force, work 
through employment agencies. Ninety per cent. of the 
employment industry's £12 billion turnover comes from 
temporary staff hire. The subject of this debate is critical.
<P>
After concerns were raised about employment 
agencies in my constituency surgeries, I conducted a 
survey of local people in Corby about their experience 
of working for them. My findings show why the 
amendment must be rejected by the Committee. Of the 
people surveyed, 41 per cent. had had money deducted 
under their contract for non-attendance. Out of 70 
people, only 30 per cent. were entitled to sick pay, only 
31 per cent. received holiday pay, only 25 per cent. 
were allowed compassionate leave, only 25 per cent. 
received any training, and 73 per cent. had had arrived 
for work only to be turned away. Most thought that 
employment agencies did not work well, did not offer 
job security and did not represent a good start to 
working life. There is a serious problem to be dealt 
with.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am listening to the hon. Gentleman's 
argument with interest. Was the survey's sample 
statistically well founded and neutral, or was it a sample 
of people with problems who had referred themselves to 
him?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hope:</B> It was a street survey, conducted in Corby 
town centre, in which we stopped 70 people and asked, 
"Have you worked for an employment agency and what 
was your experience?"	 I mentioned the responses. The 
good news is that we have already passed many clauses 
that will benefit temporary workers.
<P>
<B>Miss Julie Kirkbride </B>(Bromsgrove): Will the hon. 
Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hope:</B> I have just given way, and now I will make 
a bit more progress. We have given Ministers the power 
to extend to agency workers, and others such as home 
workers, employment rights that have previously been 
enjoyed only by workers on permanent contracts. That 
change alone will transform the experience of temporary 
workers who can, for the first time, look forward to the 
protection of the national minimum wage and proper 
rights at work, including holiday pay.
<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> I was interested by what the hon. 
Gentleman said about his scientific survey on the streets 
of Corby. How many of the 70 people that he stopped 
said that they worked for an employment agency?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hope:</B> I am fascinated by how intrigued 
Opposition Members are by my survey. Rather than bore 
the Committee with details, I shall send them copies, with 
the excellent graphs that were featured on a recent 
"Newsnight"	 programme to show the difficulties that 
people face.
<P>
We need to go further than the decisions that the 
Committee has already made to benefit temporary 
workers. We need a root-and-branch overhaul of the 
regulations. I look forward to getting into the detail of the 
draft consultative regulations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Bruce:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hope:</B> I have just given way, so I shall carry on 
and give way later.
<P>
I am delighted that the new draft regulations that have 
been issued for consultation put an end to the use by 
agencies of harsh £1 per hour penalty contracts if agency 
workers fail to complete an assignment. I have an example 
of such a contract, which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"If the Temporary Worker fails to satisfactorily complete an 
agreed assignment the Agency reserves the right to pay him an 
hourly rate of £1 per hour for any hours worked in that assignment 
irrespective of any verbal or written agreements for a higher 
hourly rate".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That has to end, and will end when the regulations 
come into force.

<P>

<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I am glad that the hon. Gentleman now has 
such a contract in front of him; he knows that its terms 
are outlawed by the minimum wages legislation and that it 
is nothing to do with what we are debating. Employment 
agencies in Corby are upset about what he has been 
saying; would he therefore put on record the name of the 
agency and what, as the local Member of Parliament, he 
did about it? Two such unacceptable employment 
agencies have been brought to my attention in the past 10 
years and on both occasions I was able to get recompense 
for my constituents.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hope:</B> I am delighted that the hon. Gentleman is 
such a champion of employment rights and that all his 
hours spent in Committee have done some good [Hon. 
Members: "Name."] It is that kind of provision that has 
created difficulties. In case Opposition Members are 
confused about where the examples come from, apart 
from those from my experience in Corby and that of the 
hon. Member for South Dorset, chapter 5 of a recent 
report, entitled "Flexibility Abused"	, by the National 
Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux gives 10 
examples from all over the country of bad practice by 
employment agencies. The regulations will address such 
abuse. I would be happy to send a copy to Opposition 
Members, with confirming examples from my survey.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hope:</B> I would like to move on because Opposition 
Members clearly dislike being told the reality of what it 
is like for temporary workers in this country; it is time 
that they learned.
<P>
I turn now to the second major transformation 
contained in the clause that we must not lose through the 
amendment: the way in which employment agencies are 
about to transform [Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman is not 
going to give way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hope:</B> Thank you, Mr. Atkinson.
<P>
The second major contribution that the regulations 
make is that 
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Bruce:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Atkinson. We 
have certain privileges in the House that allow us to give 
information without fear or favour. A large number of 
employment agencies in Corby have been slandered by 
the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I understand what the hon. Gentleman 
is saying, but it is not a point of order. What the hon. 
Member for Corby chooses to say or not to say to the 
Committee is his responsibility.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hope:</B> Thank you, Mr. Atkinson.
<P>
The draft regulations extend employment rights to all 
agency workers as a result of decisions previously made 
in Committee and provide that the agency or bureau will 
be responsible for delivering them. Turning employment 
agencies into employment businesses will at a stroke 
tackle many of the abuses, such as contract phrases such 
as "for the avoidance of doubt, these terms shall not give 
rise to a contract in employment between the agency and 
the temporary worker."	 Those days are over and we shall 
get decent rights back for temporary workers. Under the 
regulations, agencies will have to take responsibility for 
delivering basic employment rights for the people that 
they take on to their books.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> They have to already.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hope:</B> It is clear that they do not currently assume 
that obligation and say as much in their contracts, which 
agency workers are made to sign. Under the regulations 
that will cease.
<P>
I am worried about the role of employment agencies in 
regard to young people. I and a number of head teachers 
in my constituency are concerned about the impact on 16, 
17 and 18-year-old GCSE or A-level students of working, 
through employment agencies, on temporary contracts at 
weekends or during the week when they are supposed to 
be studying. According to the head teachers, it is affecting 
their education. The introduction to the world of work for 
far too many young people is a low wage, low skill 
temporary job secured through an employment agency 
that does not care about their personal development or 
future. That undermines the career development of 
individuals and prevents them from taking advantage of 
schemes that the Government are introducing, such as 
modern apprenticeships and the new deal. It also weakens 
the terms and conditions of older workers.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I turn now to the matter of fees under amendment
No. 254. A major barrier to flexibility in the workplace is 
transfer fees, or introduction fees as they are described in 
some contracts. Let us consider the individual who 
decides to move from temporary working to a permanent 
job, but whose contract with the employment agency 
contains a clause saying that if a company offers a 
permanent job to someone on its books as a temporary 
worker, the company must pay the agency a substantial 
fee for the privilege. Examples provided by the National 
Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux, and those I know 
from my experience, show that the figures run into 
hundreds, if not thousands, of pounds. Such working 
practices are a major barrier to the individual who wants 
to move from temporary work to permanent employment.
<P>
The individual has been shacked by financial handcuffs 
that prevent him or her from having the flexibility to move 
into permanent employment. It is bad for the individual; 
it is bad for the company that cannot get workers and it 
removes competitive pressure employment agencies to 
raise their standards of practice. The way to tackle the 
problem has been a matter for debate in the employment 
agency movement. Some agencies have argued indeed, 
it is probably the view of the hon. Member for South 
Dorset that removing restrictive practices means that 
agencies could go out of business, because they cannot 
hang on to their temporary work force as they would have 
no financial hold over them.
<P>
Progressive agencies and those who want employment 
standards to rise take the opposite view. They argue that 
employment agencies would be more successful in 
retaining temporary workers if, instead of beating them 
with financial sticks, they offered more carrots of 
induction, training and support, as the best agencies 
already do. Those who wish to continue as temporary 
workers would stay with the agency because of those 
benefits. Standards will improve as a result of the removal 
of introductory fees because agencies will have to 
compete on the basis of the quality of service that they 
provide. They will not simply have a financial grip on the 
agency worker.
<P>
The restrictions in the legislation mean that if the 
agency could guarantee a job for an individual, it could 
ask for a fee if that individual were to transfer to another 
employer. However, that would require those agencies to 
become employment businesses or employment 
companies, which is the direction that we want them to 
take. We want them to take on employment rights and 
responsibilities for the workers, look after them and give 
them support. Manpower is one agency that operates that 
system. Many other employment agencies could look to 
that model as a direction for the future.
<P>
Massively restricting transfer fees would remove a 
restrictive practice behind which unscrupulous 
employment agencies have been hiding. It would drive up 
standards of good practice in employment agencies and 
remove the cowboy agencies that undermine the 
reputation and financial viability of good employment 
agencies that want to provide a good service in a flexible 
labour market.
<P>
The employment service sector has a significant 
contribution to make to businesses by acting as a 
responsible partner, offering a strategic contribution to 
human resource planning and demonstrating best practice 
in the employment of a flexible work force. We can no 
longer tolerate a completely deregulated labour market 
that allows unscrupulous agencies and businesses to 
flourish and restrictive practices to act as a barrier to 
flexibility in the labour market. The "unintended 
consequences"	 to quote the term used by Conservative 
Members of the Bill will be better employment practice 
and more protection for temporary workers in the 
workplace.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I begin by making my own position clear. 
As a small employer in the agricultural sector, I have not 
been in the habit of using employment agencies. It is not 
generally the practice in agriculture, but, as I reflect, there 
are specific areas in which it is. They may be less obvious 
than the mental picture of temporary secretaries that we 
all have. The areas of agriculture that I have in mind are 
the contract milkers and stockpersons who come in as 
relief because of illness or some other unavailability, or 
to give someone the weekend off. That is an example of 
how important it is, even in that sector, which does not 
have a large number of employees per unit, to have the 
flexibility to use temporary staff through some sort of 
employment agency.
<P>
I mention my non-declaration of interest, as it were, 
because of the process that the Government have set out, 
including their last minute tabling of the pre-draft 
consultation document. As I flicked through it in the 
extremely brief moments of longueur in the speech of my 
hon. Friend the Member for South Dorset and in the 
considerable periods of longueur in the speech of the hon. 
Member for Corby, I discovered a reference to nursing 
agencies. Given that the document is something that I am 
deemed to have read, although one would have to be 
superman to have done so, it would be improper if I were 
not to declare the potential interest of my wife, as a trustee 
of the charitable trusts that run Brackley Cottage hospital, 
which was reversed out of the national health service with 
great success, and which is continuing to serve the people 
in that town in my constituency. One of her tasks is to 
interview people for nursing employment and, from time 
to time, nursing agencies are used. Conceivably, and, I 
hasten to say, on a firmly unremunerated basis, I may 
have an indirect interest that I should share with the 
Committee. The business of employment agencies, as 
addressed in the clause, is wide ranging.

<P>

<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> My hon. Friend will recall that a few 
moments ago, the hon. Member for Corby cited an 
example of alleged bad practice by an employment 
agency. Despite several opportunities to do so, he 
declined to name that agency or to say whether it was 
within his constituency. Does my hon. Friend agree that, 
apart form making a thoroughly cowardly performance 
and an extraordinarily bad speech, the hon. Gentleman has 
left a cloud of unwarranted suspicion over all the 
employment agencies operating in his Corby 
constituency? Is not that a shameful dereliction of duty?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> It is open to the hon. Member for Corby 
to repair that omission later, if it does not trouble the 
Committee's patience. I, too, noted that he declined to 
name the agency. The hon. Member for Corby is a not 
unagreeable colleague in the county of Northamptonshire, 
and I enjoy working with him. But on this issue, he has 
something of a bee in his bonnet, or even a King Charles' 
head in his bonnet, which causes him constantly to return 
to the matter, no doubt because of one or two bad cases.
<P>
The Committee will remember that at the beginning of 
our proceedings, I said that none of us on the Opposition 
Benches wanted to suggest that all employers or 
employment agencies were ideal in the conduct of their 
business. It was not necessary for us to do so, but, we 
must ask whether the regulation in the clause is 
appropriate to the perceived ill that may exist. It is for the 
hon. Member for Corby to make his own speech, and his 
own case, but the street survey that he dwelt on was 
flawed, so he did not have much evidence.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Bruce:</B> I am sure that my hon. Friend is a 
better mathematician than me. If one stopped 70 people 
in the street and only 5 per cent. of the population work 
through agencies, how many people would be likely to 
fill in the form? It seems to be an awfully small sample.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> It is about 3.5 per cent. However, I 
worked that out in my head and I may be wrong. It is a 
small sample.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> On the strength of this morning's 
performance by the hon. Member for Corby, is there not 
another difficulty and danger? People going about their 
legitimate business, shopping or travelling to and from 
work, would readily say anything to him to get rid of him 
as quickly as possible.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I encourage the hon. 
Gentleman not to follow that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am grateful, Mr. Atkinson. I thought 
that we might want to spare the hon. Member for Corby 
further attention or embarrassment. However, I remind the 
Committee that, during the general election campaign that 
he won in 1970, my right hon. Friend the Member for Old 
Bexley and Sidcup (Sir E. Heath) memorably referred to 
the former Prime Minister, the late Lord Wilson of 
Rievaulx, as having been attacked by a man with an egg. 
He said how odd it was that someone should walk round 
the streets with an egg in his pocket, just in case he should 
meet the Prime Minister, and then lob it at him.
<P>
In view of your strictures, Mr. Atkinson, I shall not 
imply how appropriate it might be for my county 
colleague, the hon. Member for Corby, if people were to 
walk round the town with their pens at the ready to 
respond to his survey questions.
<P>
We return to the issues that were set out with some 
expertise he does know what he is talking about by 
my hon. Friend the Member for South Dorset. I shall not 
comment on the details of what he said, but I would like 
to raise one or two apparently small points and then to 
make one or two general ones.
<P>
The first of the small points that we should reflect on 
the Minister has undertaken to do it in several other 
contexts is where the services are provided. He will 
remember our interesting debate about blacklisting, when 
he said that it would be possible for service providers to 
draw up blacklists and to publish them on the internet 
because it is outside the United Kingdom's jurisdiction. I 
suspect that it will be increasingly open to employment 
agencies to do that.
<P>
I shall return in a moment to the Minister's comment 
on the employment agencies' understanding of the 
regulations, but if they do not like them they may decide 
not to operate in the UK but to do so in some 
extra-jurisdictional way. They may produce lists of names 
that can be accessed through the internet or otherwise, and 
people will then employ others. He may want to consider 
that the use of employment agencies may be more 
germane to regulation than the agencies' existence if they 
are located outwith the United Kingdom.
<P>
That brings me to my second point. Clause 28(3) 
widens the existing regulations by inserting into the 1973 
Act new subsection (1A). That would include
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"persons seeking employment outside the United Kingdom"	 
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
that is persons from the United Kingdom, but also
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"persons normally resident outside the United Kingdom seeking 
employment in the United Kingdom."	
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I suspect, but I am not certain, that the sort of cases that 
might be involved are Filipina domestic servants about 
which there has been genuine disquiet, which I share or 
others, such as construction workers, coming to the UK 
for a particular contract or project.
<P>
It is interesting to note that the 1973 Act was passed in 
the immediate fallout of our accession to the European 
Union; however, no reference is made in it or clause 28 
to provisions for European Union workers. The Minister 
may need to say whether the regime for workers from 
European Union countries is different from that for 
workers from outside the EU. For example, the former 
clearly do not need work permits. I should have thought 
that, by extension, they were covered by existing 
regulations. If they are not, there may be an omission, but 
it is something that the Committee should consider.
<P>
I have other comments about the Government's 
justification for widening the existing regulations, but they 
will be debated when we come to amendment No. 121, 
tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for South Dorset, so 
I shall defer that pleasure until later. However, I can make a 
statement about the broad principles under which we would 
approach the matter. I have been in correspondence with the 
Federation of Recruitment and Employment Services, and 
also with Adecco, which claims to be the largest 
recruitment agency in the United Kingdom my 
constituency is served by its Northampton and Milton 
Keynes branches and franchises. In that correspondence, 
there is not root-and-branch opposition to the idea of 
regulation. It would be odd if there were regulation has 
been in place since 1973, as my hon. Friend the Member for 
South Dorset pointed out.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I borrow the Government's phrase for a moment, not 
least because I quite respect the man who leads the better 
regulation task force, although I do not like its title. The 
question is not whether we have regulation, but whether 
we have better regulation whether the new proposals 
help. Both FRES and Adecco homed in on regulations 
that may be used to control the imposition of fees. The 
Committee should consider whether it is necessary to 
have a special regime to deal with employment agencies 
and related issues, including there is an important 
distinction employment businesses.
<P>
The hon. Member for Corby said I am sure that it is 
his view, and I do not seek to distort it that he thought 
that there should be a move towards employment 
businesses. Oddly enough, an employment business has 
recently been given the push from No. 10 Downing street, 
as my hon. Friend the Member for South Dorset said, 
although I do not know whether that business has been 
replaced by an employment agency. It is not for the 
Committee or for Ministers to determine industrial and 
commercial structures, other than in cases in which clear 
unfairness arises. Regulations on such matters should be 
tailored to ensure that there is fairness between 
employees or workers, to use the Government's 
phrases who take such a route and those who take the 
route of direct employment. Regulation should not skew 
or unbalance the playing field between those groups.
<P>
FRES, in its letter to me, points out that the Audit 
Commission recently commented:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the average recruitment cost for a member of staff in the NHS 
was £4,900".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
FRES suggests that that job would be done much more 
cheaply by a recruitment consultancy. That point could 
bear wider scrutiny.
<P>
Employment agencies and related businesses are a 
considerable success story. Generally, although not 
universally, they show high standards in looking after 
workers and serving their customers and ultimately their 
customers' customers, who are ourselves, the general 
public. It is no accident that the proportion of those 
employed through such arrangements has risen, as my 
hon. Friend the Member for South Dorset said. 
Employment agencies have met a commercial need, in 
accordance with the tenor of the times.
<P>
To advert briefly to my experience as an Education 
Minister, I found that workers wanted to organise their 
own employment practices, and such views have become 
more widespread during my continuing interest in further 
education. Workers want to put themselves in the driving 
seat, and perhaps use others to get them employment, 
rather than going into a one-to-one relationship with an 
employer. That may be mirrored in the growth of 
self-employment, which is a different but related issue. 
That is what is going on in the real economy, and the 
Government now seek to introduce specific regulations to 
intervene in such matters.
<P>
I made several points, the first of which was that the 
regulations were rightly first introduced in 1973, to deal 
with some of the difficulties that have concerned hon. 
Members. The regulations have generally worked well; 
they have presided over an expansion of employment in 
such sectors and an increase in their services. Even if 
clause 28 were excised from the Bill which the 
amendment would not do, although some major chunks 
would be deleted those working under an employment 
agency or business would still have important additional 
rights. Those rights are not available under existing law.
<P>
Under clause 28, virtually unprecedented economic 
regulation will be introduced in pricing, fees and terms 
and conditions. That sort of thing used to happen in the 
1970s, under prices and incomes legislation. Such 
measures are now almost completely obsolete in a modern 
economy, so we should not agree to them unless a clear 
case is made for them and they are absolutely necessary.
<P>
An explanation of the Government's case should be 
found somewhere within the 60-page document. I have 
endeavoured to flick through the document, but I have not 
found the case for the specific regulations. However, we 
shall try sadly, at a later stage to unpick the difference 
between interfering and meddling in commercial 
transactions, which must be off side, and dealing with 
structural problems in the contracts between agencies and 
individuals that are thought to be unfair. We shall 
continue to oppose such interference in principle, as my 
hon. Friend the Member for South Dorset has done in 
the amendments.
<P>
As my hon. Friend has clearly said, if there were concern 
about any case, it could be picked up by other legislation. 
We would not incur your pleasure, Mr. Atkinson, if we 
were to redebate the minimum wage legislation, the 
working time directive or, indeed, other provisions in the 
Bill. However, all those measures, which are on the record, 
will be extended to agency workers, I think, under clause 
14. So why do we need an extra clause a belt-and-braces 
approach? We shall examine those matters, not to subvert 
the intentions of other measures, which we have criticised 
in other contexts; we shall to confine ourselves to any 
perceived ill in this case.
<P>
I shall quote Adecco's submission, as it is germane. 
Adecco states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"We have no concerns about the broad thrust of the Government's 
intentions in Clause 28. We support firm and appropriate regulation 
of the sector and look forward to contributing to the forthcoming 
consultation paper on employment agencies. We play a vital role in 
ensuring flexibility in the labour market but recognise that workers 
need to be protected."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I hope that every member of the Committee agrees with 
that sentiment, but it should not be used to construct 
legislation that goes beyond those intentions.
<P>
My second general consideration is bureaucracy. Even 
this morning's debates, which have not been fully 
informed by this late-arriving consultation document, 
show how complex the bureaucracy is. Although many 
members of the Committee would pass if they were 
obliged to sit an examination on the difference between an 
employment agency and an employment business, some 
would fail and most of us would falter, at least in giving 
a legally coherent definition. Beyond those complexities 
lie those of deciding whether individual contracts are fair 
and whether the regulations apply to them.
<P>
As was well exemplified in the speech of the hon. 
Member for Corby, the Government are, as ever, adopting 
what might loosely be termed an objective-based 
approach, trying to include fairness, reduced complexity 
and other things that are desirable in principle. However, 
we are worried that the Government are not plotting a 
route through the maze that allows an exit from it. As my 
hon. Friend the Member for South Dorset said, we shall 
not labour the point, but unintended consequences may 
lurk in those 60 pages of fine print.
<P>
No doubt the employment agency sector will want to 
work through the consultation document and comment on 
it, as shall we when we have had time to study it. 
Nevertheless, the Government are the demandeurs. Why 
is a special regime required in this sector, when other 
employment legislation, whether theirs or ours, does not 
in their view deal with it? What ill is being remedied?
<P>
Again, I shall not labour the next point, but it needs 
to be made with some force. The Government use the 
bland and friendly language of better and reduced 
regulation and simplicity, an aspiration with which I 
cannot disagree. However, the problem is that they do 
not deliver. We were promised the consultation paper 
on employment agencies in September. It is a complex 
field, for reasons that I have already shared with the 
Committee. Ministers apparently wanted it to reach us 
last night, but, in my case, it arrived in a pre-draft state 
at about 9 am, when I was thinking about my 
amendments and other matters. We cannot comment on 
it sensibly this morning., except to express our anxiety 
that it did not arrive until now. Given that the Bill is 
scheduled for Report next week, which is, again, a 
compression of the initial timetable, it becomes 
increasingly difficult not only to have a chance to read 
the consultation paper the hon. Member for Eccles 
(Mr. Stewart) is well into it already but to talk as we 
must to experts in the sphere, who must think about 
their pre-consultation response.
<P>
The Committee or indeed the House on Report 
cannot realistically form a coherent view on the clause 
now. As has happened throughout the consideration of 
employment rights legislation, we will get a scramble, up 
to the very last minute, presumably in another place, 
where a last minute deal that will not have been properly 
discussed will be agreed.
<P>
That is not a good way to legislate. It belies the 
Government's stated good intentions to make life simpler 
and more straightforward. It suggests a structural flaw in 
the Government, who find it difficult to organise and 
present matters straightforwardly for proper consideration. 
We want to consider the clause properly and 
fair-mindedly to ascertain whether specific ills relating to 
this sector need to be overcome. That has not yet been 
reasonably presented to us. We therefore remain worried.

<P>

<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Does my hon. Friend not think that the 
Minister should say when the draft consultation 
document was completed and whether it adhered to a 
previously announced or scheduled deadline for 
completion in the Department? If it did not comply 
with a deadline, will the Minister explain what is wrong 
in the workings of the Department that has caused the 
Committee such inconvenience?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend. I think 
that we may understand those points to be put to the 
Minister through me on his behalf. We are genuinely 
worried about it, because it is a poor way of doing 
business.
<P>
I conclude with one or two points that bear directly on 
the matter, taken from things that I have picked up recently. 
The Department has a problem, not with rhetoric but 
delivery. A mysterious senior figure, whose interest in 
over-regulation has been denied by the Minister, 
reappeared this Sunday in the columns of The Sunday 
Telegraph. He was quoted as saying that there was far too 
much regulation in the Bill and that it should be reduced. In 
some respects he was wrong because much of the 
regulation is in the working time directive and the National 
Minimum Wage Act 1998, although the regulations and the 
clause will add to that.
<P>
Alarm bells are clearly flashing for the Government 
including, I remind the Minister, for his Secretary of 
State. What did we witness on Thursday but an absolute 
indicator of clouds gathering round Whitehall? The 
Government held another summit occasions that are 
reserved for situations regarded as seriously 
dysfunctional, such as the railways. This summit was on 
red tape. The Secretary of State was quoted in extenso as 
saying that there was too much red tape and that, 
wherever possible, it had to be removed.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Having created it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> As my hon. Friend says, having created 
it. We are all aware of the boy or girl, to be bipartisan 
at school who makes trouble and then complains about it, 
demanding that it be resolved. We even have the 
occasional constituent who is a bit like that. However, 
Ministers are not meant to be like that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I am a little concerned by my hon. 
Friend's observation. He should make clear that he does 
not think that such a description applies to any Opposition 
members. We engaged in no such activities at school.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Even if I were a member of the Whips 
office, I would not luckily have carried out extensive 
investigations into the schooldays of any member of the 
Committee, on either side. I cannot speculate about that.
<P>
We cannot have what one might loosely call "naughty 
boy"	 legislation whereby Ministers, fired by their 
manifesto and feeding on a diet of transfusional press 
releases, declare that they are a Labour Government in 
action, delivering fairness at work, and produce a mass 
of regulations and then complain about the disgraceful 
burden of regulations, about which something must be 
done, making a bonfire of the situation that they 
themselves laboured long to create.
<P>
I invite the Government to make a measured case for 
what is wrong in the area not one based on one or two 
anecdotes that they have trawled up. They should give a 
structured explanation of what they intend to do and why 
they need to legislate. Though the milk is now undeniably 
spilt, the Government should reflect on the fact that the 
consultation document was issued at the very last 
moment. Even if they have not been able to consult the 
Opposition they should consult long and hard before 
making permanent regulations.
<P>
If I were a troublemaker you will know, Mr. Atkinson. 
that I seek not to be I would be tempted to go to the 
Opposition Chief Whip and say that we have tried to handle 
things with the best of good will, gone along with the 
Government's two reorderings of the Bill, new schedules 
and 11-page amendments and endeavoured to respond to 
them at break-neck speed often ahead of the briefing that 
we have received from the various interested parties who 
are the real experts in the area, but that what the 
Government have just done is a step too far. We have been 
given an hour and a half to consider the consultation 
document; we cannot do that and we will be under terrible 
strain to do so before next week. We are paid to do that, 
metaphorically speaking, but it is not reasonable to expect 
the experts who will consider the document, and wish to 
respond to it in a measured way, to come to a final view by 
next week. That is a very bad way of doing business and 
we should postpone it. Whether that argument will emerge 
through the usual channels is not for me to say, but I 
understand anyone wanting to make it. To use the words of 
the former Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, the 
right hon. Member for Hartlepool (Mr. Mandelson) 
which he used so tellingly about industry Ministers must 
really learn to sharpen up their act and ensure that this 
legislative shambles is never repeated.


<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Bruce:</B> I did not make the reason behind 
amendment No. 254 clear enough earlier and I should like 
to clarify it. Initially, I ignored the provisions of new 
paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) made under clause 28(4). I 
thought they tidied up the accepted point that employees 
should not be charged by another party for finding them 
work.
<P>
The original Employment Agencies Act 1973 stopped 
an individual turning up at employment agency, seeing a 
list of vacancies, and the employment agency person 
saying, "If you give me £25 as a signing-on fee, I shall 
give you information about those vacancies."	 It was an 
abuse of the system because, in many cases, after people 
had paid the fee of £25, the vacancies did not exist or 
were unsuitable for them anyway. Such practice was 
outlawed and no member of the Committee is trying to 
stop it being outlawed. My initial understanding of the 
provisions was that they helped to ensure that any 
loopholes under the original Act were removed.
<P>
However, it has been pointed out to me that new 
paragraph (c), which my amendment would delete, allows 
individuals to transfer an introduction between one agency 
and another. An employer could have someone sent along 
from an employment agency for a permanent job, but 
want that person to be introduced by an agency that would 
charge a lower fee. He would want the candidate passed 
to another employment agency. There is no doubt that 
employment agencies have costs and that those costs 
should be recovered, but the clause may provide a 
loophole whereby more costs could be incurred.
<P>
Members of the Committee may know that I wrote an 
article about the Bill in the magazine "Interviewer"	, which 
is designed for the recruitment industry. The article's 
heading asked
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"should you be concerned or panic stricken?"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Having now read the regulations myself, people should 
be panic stricken.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Healey </B>(Wentworth): Conservative Members 
may object to my sample size. In the past fortnight or so 
I have discussed the clause in detail with the Federation 
of Recruitment and Employment Services, Adecco, 
Corporate Services Group, Reed and several employers 
and employer representatives, including some in my 
constituency. I had not intended to speak, but it has 
become clear with the publication of the draft regulations 
that we are at the start of a wide-ranging discussion rather 
than simply being at the conclusion of a clause.
<P>
Concern has been expressed forcibly to me by 
employment agencies about the breadth of the powers 
under clause 28. Amendment No. 120 is, however, an 
overreaction and as the hon. Member for Daventry made 
clear, it would remove major chunks of the Government's 
powers. I am sure that Opposition Members as well as the 
industry accept that the draft regulations map out the 
detail that the industry has sought to follow up the broad 
framework under the clause.
<P>
The fiercest reaction that I have received from industry 
has been to the proposals on temporary to permanent fees. 
However, Opposition Members, and the industry, must 
accept that the Government want to limit, not to outlaw 
them. The likely result of clause 28 and the subsidiary 
regulations will be that agencies will have to work a lot 
harder to justify them. They will have to demonstrate that 
such fees do not prevent people in temporary positions 
taking up permanent jobs should they and the potential 
employer wish it.
<P>
Although the hon. Member for South Dorset may not 
have intended it, I think that he put his finger on it. He 
said that many people in temporary jobs are, by their own 
efforts and aptitudes, invited by employers to become 
permanent, rather than to continue on the temporary basis 
on which they were first engaged. In those circumstances, 
the contribution to the recruitment process of the agency 
that first supplied the temporary worker process is 
questionable. It rarely justifies the fee of 25 per cent. or 
more of the annual salary that I often hear is charged in 
such situations.
<P>
The clients of agencies that set temporary to permanent 
fees so high suspect that it is done to discourage 
temporary employees being taken on permanently. One 
could speculate that an agency would easily gain a greater 
income from regularly hiring out a worker on a temporary 
basis for a year than from a one-off fee for placing that 
worker in a permanent job.
<P>
Employers have similar suspicions about employment 
agencies because they often find it difficult to gain 
information from the agency about how much they are 
paying a worker hired on a temporary contract through 
the agency. It is a common complaint. It is difficult to 
find out what the worker is being paid, or what 
commission rates the agency is charging.
<P>
I realise that I am ranging rather more widely than 
amendment No. 121, Mr. Atkinson, but I understand that 
we may not have a clause stand part debate. I believe that 
the clause and the regulations will raise the standing of 
employment agencies and are likely to make them used 
more readily by employers.

<P>

<B>The Minister for Small Firms, Trade and Industry (Mr. Michael Wills):</b> The hon. Member for South Dorset asked for examples; indeed, all Opposition Members have 
been eager for examples. My hon. Friend the Member for 
Corby has given some, and I shall give more in my 
response to the amendments. First, however, I remind the 
Committee of a particularly tragic case that shows how 
serious are the responsibilities that employers or agencies 
take on, and how important it is that they clearly 
understand where those responsibilities lie.
<P>
Simon Jones was 24 when he was sent by an agency to 
work at Shoreham docks. There he was placed to work 
unloading cargo from the hold of a ship. Within two hours 
of starting work, Simon was dead. His head had been 
crushed by the grab of a crane. Regulations cannot, of 
course, prevent all accidents, but if they assign clear 
responsibilities, as the new regulations will, the chances 
of people placed in such situations will be greatly reduced.
<P>
Among the proposals on which we are consulting is a 
regulation aimed at the sort of circumstances that 
surround Simon's death. We propose that failure by an 
employment bureau to comply with the provisions of the 
Employment Agencies Act 1973 or the regulations will be 
actionable if it causes damage, including death or injury.



<P>
Let me make it clear that I am not saying the bureau 
was liable in that case. I understand that the relevant 
authorities are still investigating the matter. However, I 
make the general point that, under our proposals, any 
bureau could be liable to pay compensation if, as a result 
of failing to take the common-sense steps required of it 
under the proposed new regulations, it supplied someone 
to do work for which he or she was not qualified. The 
purpose of the clause is not only to enable people to claim 
compensation. It would be much better if the clear liability 
in the regulations made all agencies do what the best ones 
do: take on the responsibility of ensuring they do not send 
people, such as Simon, into dangerous situations for 
which they are unqualified.
<P>
I shall deal at length with the various points that have 
been made on the amendments, but I recognise the fact 
that you Mr. Atkinson, might not want to allow the 
Committee to debate the clause as a whole, given the 
extensive debate that we have had already.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Graham Brady </B>(Altrincham and Sale, West): 
Listening to the Minister's comments, I could not help 
but wonder whether the Government's proposals present 
a danger. Under those arrangements, could not an 
employer in control of activities at the workplace transfer 
elements of liability to an agency? Will he comment on 
that possibility?
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I hope that the hon. Gentleman will be 
patient; I shall address most, if not all, of what he says in 
my remarks on the amendments. I shall clearly set out our 
intentions for the clause and the regulations.
<P>
I am grateful to the hon. Member for South Dorset for 
the his extensive remarks. I recognise and appreciate his 
long experience of such matters and his deep and 
continuing concern with them. I also appreciate the 
remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Corby, whose 
experience of such matters is perhaps not quite so great, 
but who is deeply interested in them. I appreciate the 
concerns that he has expressed consistently since he was 
elected to the House.
<P>
Amendment No. 120 would prevent the Government 
from making important changes that we believe are 
necessary to modernise the regulatory framework 
governing the private recruitment industry. I shall say 
more on the reforms that the Government have in mind 
to modernise, simplify and, above all, improve that 
framework, so that it enables us to achieve our objective: 
creating a fair and efficient labour market.
<P>
The hon. Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) asked 
why it was necessary to have a special regime. Under 
most employment legislation, it is assumed that a 
relationship exists between two parties, but the 
employment agency industry often creates relationships 
between three or four parties. Many circumstances are 
unique to the industry for example, wages are passed 
through the hands of intermediaries. Therefore, the 
industry needs special attention, especially given its 
importance in the modern labour market. I shall return to 
that matter.
<P>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Corby has argued 
consistently and cogently, the regulations made under the 
order-making power in the Employment Agencies Act 
1973 the power that will be amended under clause 28 
have not been altered since they were introduced in 1976. 
We believe that they no longer meet the needs of the 
industry, nor those of its clients. The world has moved on 
a great deal, as every member of the Committee 
recognises.
<P>
Clause 28(2), which would be deleted under the 
amendment tabled by the hon. Member for South Dorset, 
will amend and extend the order-making power contained 
in section 5 of the 1973 Act.
<P>
We have heard much discussion this morning, but 
perhaps I can return to the facts. The hon. Member for 
South Dorset quoted from the statement made, on
25 September 1998, by my right hon. Friend the Member 
for Hartlepool. My right hon. Friend stated our desire to 
update the existing regulations and set out our intention 
to publish a consultation document before the end of 
1998. The hon. Gentleman might recall that my right hon. 
Friend subsequently announced, on 17 December 1998, 
that the Bill would amend the Employment Agencies Act 
1973. In the light of that, it did not seem right or sensible 
to consult on a set of proposals under the existing Act, 
only to have to consult again shortly afterwards on the 
further changes.



<P>
New paragraphs (ea) and (eb) clarify the existing 
order-making power by stating that regulations can be 
made to protect the interests of those over 18 and those 
seeking work within the United Kingdom. As the hon. 
Member for Dorset, South has said, three years passed 
between the date on which the 1973 Act received Royal 
Assent and the date on which the present regulations came 
into force in July 1976. The task, 25 years later, in respect 
of a much more complex industry has been no more 
straightforward. We thought it better to give our proposals 
careful thought before publishing them.
<P>
As Members of the Committee will know, from my 
remarks in the sitting of 16 March, the draft regulations 
are in an advanced stage of preparation and will be 
published shortly. In the interests of members of the 
Committee, I decided to circulate to them an advance 
proof of the consultation document, with the caveats 
given in the accompanying letter. I have been assured 
that that document left the Department of Trade and 
Industry at 5 pm yesterday. I apologise to members of 
the Committee who received it only this morning; I am 
at a loss to account for the 16 or so missing hours. I 
appreciate the difficulties that that delay has caused the 
hon. Member for Daventry, for example I do not want 
to cause him difficulties, particularly given the 
constructive approach that he has so often adopted in 
our Committee. With that apology, I hope that members 
of the Committee find it helpful to have the document. 
I also remind them that we are debating the clause; the 
regulations are not being issued this morning. When 
they are, we will welcome the views of everyone, 
including all members of the Committee, and three 
months will be allowed for consultation. I hope that 
that provides some reassurance on our intent, although 
it may not wholly satisfy Opposition Members.
<P>
Before I describe the provisions, I shall respond to the 
hon. Member for South Dorset who referred in our sitting 
on 2 March to the omission on page 60 of the explanatory 
notes of the words added by subsection (3). However, the 
explanatory notes deal only with alterations and 
substitutions made by the Bill, not with text that is added. 
For the same reason, new section 11A, inserted by 
subsection (6) which we will debate later is not 
covered in the notes. The insertion of new sections 5(1A) 
and 11A is fully explained in paragraphs 234 and 238 on 
pages 58 and 59 of the notes.



<P>
To answer the concern of the hon. Member for South 
Dorset about our attitude to flexible labour markets and 
the role of employment agencies and businesses within 
them, I should say that the Government wholly favour a 
flexible labour market. We fully recognise the valuable 
role played by the private recruitment industry in helping 
hirers cope with fluctuating demand and in providing an 
avenue to employment for those who wish to stop or start 
work at short notice. However, we also recognise that that 
market needs assistance to be as fair and efficient as we 
would like.
<P>
The 1973 Act expressly prohibits charging fees to 
work-seekers and recognises that it is undesirable for 
them to have to pay for work-finding services. If such 
practices became the norm, many might find that they 
could not afford to find work, which would be counter to 
the Government's approach to an important area of 
economic policy. Apart from anything else, it would not 
help the efficiency and fairness of the labour market and 
would worsen social exclusion, something that we are 
determined to combat.
<P>
I hope that we all agree that a well-functioning labour 
market requires freedom for employers and work-seekers 
to deal with each other free of restrictions. Those in the 
private recruitment industry play an important role in 
promoting a flexible labour market, but they also need to 
be careful, lest their charges adversely affect that 
flexibility to the detriment of the labour market as a whole 
and of their clients' interests.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am listening with care to the Minister's 
argument and am encouraged by it. Is it his approach to 
confine his intervention in the labour market to the 
procedures under which persons are employed to make 
them acceptable in terms of good practice, rather than to 
specific rates or other economic indicators? In other 
words, the main thrust of the regulations should be 
directed towards getting the ground rules right without 
filling in the figures.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Willis:</B> As I unfold my case, I hope that I can 
reassure the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
As for charges to hirers, we are seeking through new 
paragraph (ec) to regulate only to the extent necessary to 
ensure that they would not prevent workers from finding 
employment whether deliberately or incidentally by 
distorting the market. I appreciate that members of 
Committee may not have had the chance to examine the 
draft regulations, but they will see from draft regulation 8 
that we are not proposing to control the level of charges, 
but to control and regulate the circumstances when certain 
fees may be charged.
<P>
The hon. Member for South Dorset reminded the 
Committee that he ran an agency for 12 years and that in 
the past 10 years, he has still been involved in various 
ways. However, I am not sure that he has had an 
opportunity in recent years to examine closely how 
practices have developed in what is a rapidly changing 
market. Examples are quoted in the consultation 
document, but I have read the standard terms issued to 
hirers by one of the country's top five agencies, which I 
think has sent a briefing note to members of the 
Committee. The terms state:



<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The engagement or use by, the Client, directly or indirectly, for 
any length of time of the services of any Temporary who has carried 
out an Assignment for the Client at any time during the preceding 
six months period, or the introduction of the Temporary by the 
Client to any third party resulting in any such engagement or use 
within that period, shall render the Client liable to pay the 
Employment Business an introduction fee".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
They then describe how the fee is to be calculated.
<P>
Such provisions are increasingly common. They 
provide for fees to be paid to hirers in the most 
extraordinary circumstances, including cases when no 
service has been supplied. They can penalise a hirer for 
taking certain actions. If the hon. Member for South 
Dorset examines the terms, he will see that a fee must be 
paid first. We are talking about substantial fees often 
thousands of pounds are at stake if the hirer assists the 
worker to find a job with a third party.
<P>
An employer who hires a temp may not want to take 
on that person as a permanent member of staff, but he 
might know someone who does. I am not sure why an 
employer who helps a worker in a way that we would all 
welcome should be penalised for doing so. The terms also 
provide for fees to be paid if a hirer happens to engage a 
worker previously supplied to it though another bureau. 
In the modern labour market, many work-seekers will be 
registered with more than one bureau to maximise their 
chances of finding paid employment. That is especially 
true in the often very insecure labour market that my hon. 
Friend the Member for Corby has so often graphically 
described.
<P>
Such charges discourage hirers from using other 
bureaux. That is their aim. They also cause some bureaux 
to be reluctant to register work-seekers who are signed up 
with other bureaux, thereby frustrating competition in the 
industry. It may be that such terms are not enforceable, 
but if the bureaux issue contracts that may be terminated 
by either side at no notice, I cannot see how they can 
argue that they have any entitlement to fees if a hirer 
wishes to switch to another bureau. To remove the 
obstacles to a fair and efficient labour market, the draft 
regulations propose that such fees should be illegal, which 
is entirely reasonable.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I turn now to temp to perm fees, which are of some 
concern to hon. Members. They are payable when a hirer 
decides to engage a temporary worker permanently, rather 
than through a bureau. As my hon. Friend the Member for 
Wentworth (Mr. Healey) so fluently described, the draft 
regulations propose not to outlaw such charges altogether, 
but to limit the circumstances in which they may be 
imposed. That is to ensure that they are not used to restrict 
workers' ability to take jobs.
<P>
I shall cite an example of the practical effects of such 
fees. A letter sent earlier this month by my hon. Friend the 
Member for Wellingborough (Mr. Stinchcombe) describes 
the plight of one of his constituents who, until recently, 
worked for a transport agency. He was subsequently 
offered a better job by a distribution company, which he 
was keen to take. The agency agreed to his release, but 
then sent his new employer an introduction fee invoice 
for £2,500. Unfortunately, the company was not prepared 
to pay that sum and laid him off. The agency then refused 
to re-engage the man and he is now unemployed.
<P>
The consultation document sets out, at greater length, 
the practical effect of temp to perm fees on hirers and 
work seekers. It appears that bureaux sometimes set 
deliberately high fees to discourage temps from finding 
work elsewhere. Earlier this month, my hon. Friend the 
Member for Welwyn Hatfield (Miss Johnson) forwarded 
correspondence from a director of one of the country's 20 
largest agencies, which is based in her constituency. The 
director said that among the good arguments for temp to 
perm charges was the need to prevent temporary workers 
from being stripped out for direct employment.
<P>
That is something that the majority of bureaux are 
reluctant to admit, and we can see why. They impose such 
fees probably because they can frequently earn more by 
hiring workers out over a long period than from taking a 
one-off placement fee. Does that practice promote a fair 
and efficient labour market? I do not think so.
<P>
The hon. Member for South Dorset claimed that 
employment agencies will close their doors if they cannot 
make whatever charges they like to hirers who take over 
workers from them. Are they really so lacking in resource 
and entrepreneurial vigour that their livelihood depends 
on such restrictive practices? I hope not. Are these 
champions of freedom and modern flexible labour 
markets unable to operate, except by the mediaeval 
practice of putting a ransom on the heads of the their 
workers and saying that they will not release them until 
the bags of gold are handed over? I certainly hope not.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Bruce:</B> The Minister uses flowery language, 
but all we want to know is whether the regulations will 
ban temp to perm fees.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I shall come to that. To clarify the position, 
we are discussing clause 28 and the amendments to it. We 
are still working out the final form that the regulations 
will take. They will be put out to consultation and there 
will be an opportunity to discuss them, as I have already, 
as I have already said.
<P>
I shall now turn my attention to those responsible 
operators who are trying to make an honest living. The 
hon. Member for South Dorset may well ask why they 
should be prevented from doing that. To make a good 
living, employment agencies need only operate 
responsibly, by providing their workers with the 
opportunity of continuing, contractual paid work. We 
propose that, if they do that, they can still charge a fee to 
a hirer who takes on such a worker. Surely, it is not too 
much to ask, and we know that some bureaux see market 
opportunities in such an approach.
<P>
The mediaeval operators will have to come up to date 
and accept their responsibility to have proper contractual 
relationships with both hirers and workers. If they do that, 
their businesses will no doubt continue to flourish, but not 
at the expense of a fair and efficient labour market. Our 
arguments have all the more force because the majority 
of temps do not know whether they will be employed 
from one day to the next. The effect of such charges is 
frequently to trap workers for long periods in highly 
insecure employment. It cannot be right for fees to be 
used as a means to deter hirers from offering temps direct 
employment in circumstances when the bureaux 
themselves are unwilling to guarantee to offer, or even to 
try, to find work for the temps.
<P>
The powers in clause 28(2) will enable us to tackle 
those concerns. The proposals in draft regulation 8 set 
out the circumstances in which charges may be made by 
bureaux. I am pleased to inform the Committee that some 
operators, such as the Mayday Group, are now beginning 
to pay salaries to their temporary workers, even when no 
hirer is immediately available. We propose that bureaux 
may charge temp to perm fees when the worker is still in 
contract with the bureau, and provided that the contract 
obliges the bureau to find work for the workseeker.
<P>
The Bosman case is of interest to many members of the 
Committee. The European Court of Justice decided that it 
was unlawful for professional footballer,s who were out 
of contract, to be subject to transfer fees when moving 
from a job in one country to a job in another. I see no 
reason why less well-paid workers, such as temporary 
secretaries and lorry drivers should be treated any less 
favourably when all they want is to carry on working in 
the same place.
<P>
I can deal more quickly with amendments Nos. 122 
and 254. Amendment No. 122 would not only prevent 
regulation of fee charging to hirers but would erode a 
substantial part of the purpose of the existing Employment 
Agencies Act 1973. The hon. Member for South Dorset 
is mistaken if he thinks that the existing statute is solely 
about protecting the interests of workseekers. The opening 
words of section 5(1) of the Act make it clear that 
regulations may be made not only to ensure the proper 
conduct of employment agencies and businesses but to 
protect the interests of persons availing themselves of 
their services. That means hirers as well as workseekers. 
Although hirers are frequently in a better position than 
workseekers to ensure that agencies do not act against 
their interests, matters cannot be left entirely to be settled 
between bureaux and hirers.
<P>
The existing regulations protect hirers in a number of 
ways. First, they create an obligation to supply written 
terms of business. Secondly, they require bureaux to take 
all reasonably practicable steps to obtain sufficient 
information to establish the suitability of a worker for the 
post. I need not remind the Committee of the potential for 
harm if unsuitable persons are supplied to work as 
nannies, school teachers, or carers for the elderly.
<P>
Thirdly, the regulations oblige bureaux to make all 
reasonably practical enquiries to ensure that those workers 
who must by law be qualified to do their job doctors, 
pilots, lorry drivers are so qualified. That is an important 
protection for both hirers and the general public. The 
regulations also contain several other provisions to protect 
hirers' interests.
<P>
Any or all of those necessary provisions could be said 
to relate to the commercial relationship between the 
bureau and the hirer, as the need to take them into account 
could affect the terms and charges agreed in that 
commercial relationship between them.
<P>
The Government firmly believe that regulation should 
be confined to where measures are strictly necessary. 
Hon. Members will find in the draft consultation 
document measures that we suggest should be withdrawn 
because they are no longer needed, such as those that 
place restrictions on hiring an employer's former workers 
back to him or her.
<P>
We intend to withdraw other measures precisely 
because the parties involved can fully protect their 
interests. Such measures include those that deal with 
duties of confidentiality to hirers. I appreciate that hon. 
Members will need to analyse that themselves. 
Nevertheless, in some areas regulation remains essential 
to protect the interest of hirers, and it goes without saying, 
of third parties to whom the hirers owe a duty of care.
<P>
Section 6(1) of the Employment Agencies Act 1973 
prevents work-seekers from being charged for 
work-finding services. The Government are firmly of the 
view that people looking for work should not have to pay 
to find work, except in certain strictly limited 
circumstances, such as in the entertainment sector, in 
which it is common for workers to retain an agent.
<P>
The new provisions, which replace existing Section 
6(1), make it clear that work-seekers should not have to 
pay in three basic circumstances when an employment 
agency helps find a job for someone, when an 
employment business places someone as a temp, and 
when an employment business recruits someone to 
become a temp. The new provisions do not extend the 
intended coverage of Section 6(1) of the 1973 Act, but 
spell it out to avoid loopholes.
<P>
New subsection (1)(a) under clause 28(4) spells out 
how the prohibition on fee charging applies to 
employment agencies, that provide services for the 
purpose of bringing work-seekers and employers together. 
Those services may encompass anything from the active 
promotion of the worker to prospective employers, to the 
provision of job vacancy information.
<P>
New subsections (1)(b) and (1)(c) explain how the 
prohibition on fee charging applies to employment 
businesses, which engage work-seekers and hire them out 
on a temporary or contract basis to act for and under the 
control of hirers.
<P>
New subsection (1)(b) provides that fees may not be 
charged by an employment business to persons with 
whom it has already contracted on whatever basis, who 
are called employees for the purposes of the Bill, although 
hon. Members familiar with the legislation will know that 
the definition of "employee"	 in the Employment Agencies 
Act 1973 is considerably wider than the definition in the 
Employment Rights Act 1996.
<P>
New subsection (1)(c) makes similar provision in 
respect of work-seekers with whom the employment 
business has not yet entered into a contract. The 
prohibition on fee charging could easily be escaped by 
employment businesses if that provision were removed. It 
has no effect on the business relations between 
employment businesses and hirers.
<P>
I hope that, in view of the rather lengthy explanation 
of the Government's intentions that I have given, the hon. 
Member for South Dorset may be willing not to pursue 
the amendment to a vote. However, if he does so, he will 
not be surprised to hear that I shall vote against it.

<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I thank the Minister for that explanation; 
he is good at pouring oil on troubled waters. We need to 
carry out detailed investigations into the nature and 
quality of the oil that he has poured, and to read the draft 
regulations in detail.
<P>
The most significant thing that the Minister said I 
shall not use his exact words, but read them when the 
record is published was that he does not want to regulate 
in this area more than is strictly necessary. If he succeeds 
in that, it will help us a great deal. We shall examine the 
draft regulations with the criterion that he has adopted 
very much in mind. Although it is entirely for my hon. 
Friend the Member for South Dorset to decide, I would 
not be disposed to press the matter at this stage, but I 
should like a commitment to further consideration.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I did not intend to speak, but I listened 
patiently to the Minister following my intervention early 
in his lengthy speech. He offered me the hope and 
expectation that he would deal with the point that I raised, 
but, unless I am mistaken, he failed to deal with it in 
any sense.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
I would like to press the Minister further on what may 
be the dangerous and unintended consequences of the 
legislation. I refer not to the case that the Minister raised 
at the beginning of his speech, but to comparable 
circumstances in which an employee is supplied by an 
employment agency. Under the regulations suggested by 
the Minister, an employment agency would be open to 
legal action were some damage or injury to arise because 
employees were not properly qualified for their work. I 
would like him to deal with possible transfers of liability. 
An employer may see a benefit in bringing in a temporary 
worker from an agency to transfer the potential liability 
for a dangerous employment situation. That may cause 
difficulties that the Minister has not anticipated. I have a 
feeling that he now has a little more information than he 
had when I first raised the question, and I would be 
interested to hear his response.



<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I apologise to the hon. Gentleman. I 
intended to address his concern, but I had to deal with a 
long and complex set of issues and it slipped my mind. I 
am happy to deal with it now.
<P>
The intention is not that there should be any such 
transfer. An employer has a liability different from that of 
an agency. An employer has responsibility for what 
happens on the spot in the workplace, but an agency has 
responsibility for ensuring that the worker is suitably 
qualified when that is relevant. The regulations seek to 
make it clear that a bureau will not escape liability if those 
regulations are breached. I hope that that reassures the 
hon. Gentleman.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> The Minister is being helpful. My concern 
is slightly allayed. None the less, employers who would 
normally accept liability in those circumstances would be 
able to say in court, "But the agency supplied somebody 
who was not suitable."	 Therefore, they would have some 
comfort in the knowledge that their own liability had been 
diminished by the contributory negligence I may be 
using the legal term incorrectly of the agency.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I think that I have substantially addressed 
the issue already, but let me reassure the hon. Gentleman 
that employers or agencies that are in dereliction of their 
duty need take no comfort, based on anything in the 
legislation, from the idea that they might be able to escape 
their liability.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Bruce:</B> We have had a full debate, and I am 
grateful to you, Mr. Atkinson, for keeping everything in 
order. There was an interesting contribution from the hon. 
Member for Corby, who has been challenged to come 
clean about the name of the organisation involved in all 
three or four different versions of his story. As I 
understand it flourishing a document in Committee means 
that it should be put on the record. He refuses to tell the 
Committee which organisation in his constituency uses 
such a contract. That suggests that he is afraid of anyone 
looking into the case. He is willing to make three speeches 
on it, but not to tell the Committee what it is about.
<P>
It was interesting to talk about Manpower the 
contractor working at No. 10 Downing street before it lost 
the contract. I am not in the business of badmouthing any 
other organisation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Does not the unusual reticence of the 
hon. Member for Corby leave open the possibility that the 
agency in question is the very agency that supplied him 
with his former constituency secretary, who is taking him 
to an industrial tribunal?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> That is an interesting point. I hoped that 
the hon. Gentleman would realise that the regulations 
could catch even the most well meaning and wonderful 
employer, who could find himself before a tribunal. 
Clearly, as an honourable Member, he cannot be guilty; 
we honourable Members would never do something like 
that. However, he is still facing that difficulty.
<P>
If oil is being poured, it is being poured on a fire. In 
no way has the minister allayed the industry's fears. I 
have been told that his officials have been talking to 
organisations such as FRES. I suspect that he has gone in 
exactly the opposite direction to that which was 
suggested.
<P>
If an agency has employed a group of workers for many 
years and supplies those individuals, for example, to No. 
10 Downing street and supervises them but loses that 
contract, it is normal for those people to transfer to the 
new contractor, assuming that they are suitable. They 
must be treated in that way under the TUPE regulations. 
In those circumstances, some agencies would have wanted 
someone to pay a temp to perm fee.
<P>
My understanding of what the Minister has said is that 
temp to permanent fees could be charged in those 
circumstances, because the employees are, in effect, on 
a permanent contract. Many of them are transferring to 
permanent contracts from temporary contracts. Indeed, 
someone in the company might tell those workers, "I have 
other work for you to do elsewhere"	, but they would 
probably not want to leave all their workmates.
<P>
In the circumstances that the Minister has described, 
the individual agency could charge a temp to perm fee, yet 
the industry is saying that it is happy that no fee should be 
paid if a long-term relationship exists and a group of 
workers transfers from one supervising business to 
another.
<P>
The problem is not that someone might take on a temp 
for 20 weeks, make a reasonable profit from doing so, but 
then lose a permanent fee. What the Minister is doing is 
completely undermining the way in which employment 
agencies work. Basically, employment agencies spend all 
the money up front on recruitment, advertising, premises 
and so on. They make absolutely no money until they put 
someone into a company and it decides to take on that 
person either permanently or temporarily.
<P>
The Minister suggests that under the regulations people 
could ring up on a Monday morning, saying, "I need a 
temp. Please send me one quickly"	 so all the recruitment 
would be done and, after being employed for only a day, 
that temp could be transferred, with his or her agreement, 
to either a temporary or a permanent contract. The 
employer would then be liable to pay only for the day that 
was contracted with the employment agency. I am sorry 
that the Minister is not listening to what I am saying, 
because it is crucial. What he has said undermines the 
nature of the way in which employment agencies can 
charge fees.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that it would 
be grossly unfair to the agency if it was caught by the 
regulations in such circumstances? That is not consistent 
with the Minister's assurances.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> Precisely. The Government want the 
maximum number of people to be employed at any one 
time. It is essential, therefore, that an employer who 
suddenly loses an employee and needs someone quickly 
can consult a professional who has a database of suitable 
people. That professional can, in turn, pick up a telephone 
and tell someone to jump in his car and turn up at the 
place of employment by 11 am. That is the flexibility of 
the market. If agencies cannot provide such services, 
vacancies will be left unfilled. The productivity of 
organisations will decrease. Industry and commerce must 
have that flexibility.



<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am sorry to intervene again. Earlier 
referred to emergency or relief milkers or stockpersons. 
Does my hon. Friend agree that, in the circumstances that 
he described, questions could be raised, for example, 
about the welfare of animals? Health and safety 
considerations would make it imperative to secure a 
replacement at the earliest possible moment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> Indeed. Such a procedure undermines the 
ability of companies to contract sensibly. I ran an 
employment agency in Yorkshire called Bos Recruitment. 
It still exists, as I think does its contract with the company 
that trades under the names of Ben Shaw's and Suncharm, 
which produce fizzy drinks. When the sun shines, it runs 
every possible line; when the sun stops shining, it runs 
only one or two lines. The company has a good turnround; 
it has a permanent staff and uses an employment agency 
to bring in temporary staff quickly. At the beginning of 
the year, we would negotiate an open contract on the 
money that we would charge the company and on the 
wages of the individuals.
<P>
Also included in the contract was a clause that said that, 
at the end of the company's busy summer period, it could 
take on permanently any of the temporary workers whom 
we had provided over the winter and for the rest of their 
working life without being charged a fee. Terms were 
negotiated between the company and the temp supplier. If 
the company lost any permanent staff during the summer, 
it would tend to replace them with temporary workers but, 
at the end of the year, it could take on permanently those 
temps whom it considered had worked the hardest. They 
would receive a better rate of pay and know that they had 
a job for as long as they wanted.
<P>
The Government are saying that everyone will be in 
that situation. Whatever the length of a temporary 
worker's contract, and by whatever means they were 
introduced to a company, the company will not be charged 
a fee for permanent placement, even if the workers were 
employed on temporary contract. That undermines 
flexibility. We have discussed the matter at great length. 
When the Bill is debated on the Floor of the House, 
Madam Speaker will want to know whether this matter 
has been discussed and voted on. I shall withdraw my 
amendment, not because I do not believe that it is a proper 
amendment, but because I want to encourage Madam 
Speaker to allow us a full debate on Report after we have 
read the regulations and related to them to the clauses.
<P>
The small trickle of letters that we have so far received 
from employment agencies will become a flood. I have 
even suggested what the Government could do, not really 
expecting them to do it, but the Minister has thrown the 
petrol on the flames and demonstrated that the 
Government have no idea how employment agencies 
work. They will destroy that industry and its flexibility 
and the unintended consequences that will flow from the 
Bill will be enormous. I hope that Madam Speaker will 
pay heed to my words and that we shall have a full debate 
on the Floor of the House. I beg to ask leave to withdraw 
the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>

<B>Mr. Ian Bruce:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 121, in 
page 16, leave out lines 17 to 49.
<P>
I thought that I might have time for a rest, Mr. Atkinson. 
The amendment is simple. It goes to the heart of the 
Department's inspection powers. It is set down in the 
Employment Agencies Act 1973 that when an inspector 
checks out an employment agency, he does so to find any 
breaches of the Act. Proposed section 11A will allow the 
Government to use any information that they gain from 
such visits to prosecute an employer for virtually any 
reason.
<P>
I accept that the Government may need to amend the 
1973 Act, but I believe that they have gone far too wide, 
because they are effectively giving the inspectors the 
power to inspect for virtually anything. It is a power that 
not even the police have. Without a warrant, inspectors 
will be able to enter someone's business offices and check 
every record.
<P>
I have experienced the regular checks that used to be 
made of an employment agency. An inspector would 
make a visit every few years and go through the books 
literally from top to bottom; it is not a particularly 
pleasant experience. However, I also experienced 
someone complaining that I had advertised 1,000 sales 
vacancies who was quite convinced that I did not have 
anywhere near that number. After a great deal of work, 
the inspector discovered that I had something like 2,600 
sales vacancies and I was fully exonerated. I was just 
being my usual modest self, rather than exaggerating what 
the agency was doing.
<P>
I assure members of the Committee that they would not 
like to if, as parliamentarians, someone could knock on 
the door and say, "I am from the parliamentary inspection 
agency. I am going to go through every single document, 
and I have absolute access. By the way, I can also report 
everything to the prosecuting authorities, and have you 
prosecuted for tax evasion,"	 or for this, that or whatever. 
Allowing people Unwarranted access I mean that in the 
technical sense that they can enter without a warrant to 
look for evidence within a company and the power to use 
that evidence in any way that the inspector decides, is too 
wide. I suspect that the Bill may contravene the European 
convention on human rights in those terms.
<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> I wonder whether my hon. Friend 
might want Labour Members, and perhaps the national 
executive committee of the labour party, to take up the 
proposal for a vetting scheme for Members of Parliament? 
I am sure that they would like to take that up in the light 
of this morning's news.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I shall not go down that route; I wanted 
to be brief to allow the Minister time to respond to a 
genuine concern.
<P>
I am not trying to be difficult. For instance, if an 
inspector discovered that people were not being paid the 
minimum wage, I am sure that the Government would not 
see it as an inappropriate use of the inspector's power to 
say so. We accept that employment agencies are more 
regulated than direct employers because of the flexibility 
of the labour market, to protect the agencies' employees. 
We are not worried about that, but we are worried about 
the powers being used oppressively.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I concur with my hon. Friend, especially 
about his concerns on civil liberties. I noticed exchanges 
in the weekend press with which many of us, as 
constituency Members of Parliament, may have 
sympathy about the relationship between the Child 
Support Agency and the Revenue. I have dealt with cases 
in which the errant, non-supporting parent ducks and 
dives through the Inland Revenue, which properly, under 
the present rules, declines to give information to the CSA. 
It is a vital element of our civil liberties that bits of 
Government do not go on fishing expeditions with one 
another. The Minister needs to explain, in the brief time 
available, what remedy is provided for that.
<P>
Proposed section 11A(2) in subsection (6) sets down a 
longer period for reporting an alleged offence. There is a 
balance to be struck; the old provision was for six months 
and the new for three years. I agree that some employment 
agencies may feel oppressed or unable to organise matters 
in time and that a longer period may be appropriate. My 
proposal although it has not been framed in an 
amendment, I offer it to the Minister might be one year 
or six months after the date on which sufficient evidence 
had come to the Secretary of Stae's attention. I am 
conscious of the dangers of trawling up past events as 
evidence slackens; the Minister will know that 
employment tribunals' normal, though not universal, 
practice is a three-month period for complaint. Will he 
comment on that?
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I hope that I can reassure Opposition 
Members.



<P>
Subsection (5) alters a restriction in section 9(4) of the 
Employment Agencies Act 1973. At present, the Secretary 
of State's inspectors may disclose only information 
obtained under the powers contained in section 9(1) of the 
Act, in the limited circumstances set out in section 9(4). 
Disclosure may occur; first, with the consent of the person 
concerned; secondly, to the Secretary of State or to other 
officers exercising functions under the Act; thirdly, if 
information is being given back to the person carrying on 
the business; or fourthly, for the purpose of instituting 
criminal proceedings under the Act itself or for the 
purposes of proceedings under sections 3A, 3C or 3D, 
which deal with procedures for prohibiting unsuitable 
people from operating employment bureaux.
<P>
The hon. Member for South Dorset is under a 
misapprehension. Subsection (5) provides that 
information may be disclosed for the purposes of any kind 
of criminal proceedings. It is disclosure that we are 
discussing.
<P>
The employment agency industry is diverse. In addition 
to the well-known high-street agencies, there are many 
other types of agency, such as executive head-hunters and 
actors' and artists' managers. In the entertainment sector, 
agents frequently receive and handle workers' earnings. 
The vast majority behave in a responsible way. However, 
I regret to inform the Committee that every year, the DTI 
investigates many dozens of cases in which workers' 
earnings have been siphoned off never to be seen 
again by a small number of dishonest operators. In some 
instances famous ones, of late the earnings lost 
amount to tens of thousands of pounds, and sometimes 
more. Entertainers or musicians receiving fees for 
programmes or recordings sold abroad may frequently be 
unaware of their earnings and are highly dependent on the 
honesty of their agent.
<P>
After investigation perhaps as a result of a worker's 
complaint the DTI's inspectors often discover that the 
misappropriation of earnings at a particular agency is 
widespread and systematic. In such cases, the Department 
should be able to bring charges for theft or fraud or to 
report the outcome of its investigation to the police. There 
are other cases in which matters ought to be reportable to 
the police, including cases in which model agencies are 
used as fronts for vice rings. There have been recent press 
reports of temp agencies being used by criminals to target 
banks and other enterprises.



<P>
The current wording of section 9(4)(a)(iv) of the 
Employment Agencies Act 1973 limits the Secretary of 
State to using information uncovered by the inspectors 
in exercise of their powers to prosecute breaches of the 
employment agencies legislation for which the maximum 
penalty is only £5,000. Clause 28(5) will allow that 
information to be used to ensure that offences with more 
severe penalties do not go unpunished.
<P>
The amendment would also delete clause 28(6). The 
existing provisions on time limits for prosecution follow 
section 127(1) of the Magistrates' Courts Act 1980, under 
which information relating to an alleged offence is triable 
only if laid within six months of the date of the offence. 
Clause 28(6) provides that offences under the 
Employment Agencies Act 1973 are triable by magistrates 
courts, provided that the information is laid within three 
years of the offence, or within six months of the Secretary 
of State having sufficient information to justify 
proceedings, whichever is the shorter. The clause makes 
similar provisions for proceedings in Scotland. Such 
provisions are not without precedent in statutes dealing 
with offences of which the commission is not immediately 
apparent, such as the Gas Act 1972 or the Insolvency 
Act 1986.
<P>
For a variety of reasons, an interval of several months 
may elapse between the date on which an offence is 
committed and the date on which the victim complains 
about it to the DTI. Those reasons might include 
deliberate concealment by the agents, workers' reluctance 
to complain about agencies on which they are wholly 
dependent, or the fact that a bureau's failure to check a 
doctor's qualifications or a lorry driver's licence may not 
become apparent until the worker in question reveals 
himself to be incompetent or unsuitable. Every year, the 
DTI uncovers hundreds of cases in which offences have 
been committed that cannot be actioned because they have 
either been concealed or have lain undiscovered for not 
much more than 180 days.
<P>
In a spirit of openness, I should inform the Committee 
that the Government propose to make a further 
amendment at a later stage to the provisions in clause 28 
relating to the enforcement of the regulations. That 
amendment, which we hope to be able to table in time for 
the Report stage, is intended to amend section 9 of the 
1973 Act by updating the inspectorate's powers of entry 
by enabling documents to be photocopied while on 
agency premises.
<P>
I am sorry that we have not been able to table the 
amendment in time for consideration at this stage, but we 
needed to examine the wording extremely carefully. Hon. 
Members will appreciate that we needed to ensure that 
our proposed amendment was fully consistent with the 
Government's commitment in respect of the European 
convention on human rights. In the light of what I have 
said, I hope that the hon. Member for South Dorset will 
withdraw his amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Ian Bruce:</B> I am grateful for the Minister's 
response, which was made in the same spirit as that in 
which the amendment was tabled. However, I am more 
worried about the clause's catch-all nature, and wonder 
whether he will consider that when considering the 
Government's proposed amendment. A police officer 
must have reasons for entering premises to search them. 
If, while analysing an employment agency's books, 
inspectors were to find some gold bullion holding down 
the filing cabinet, apparently they could, under the Bill, 
report that information perhaps that would be a good 
thing. That is a flippant example, but the clause contains 
a catch-all provision, and I am worried that if the police 
decide that it is a good idea, they will all become

then enter premises and search them thoroughly from top 
to bottom. Perhaps in protecting employee's rights, that is 
a necessary evil, but I ask the Minister to consider it 
carefully. In the spirit of his response, I am happy to beg 
to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
