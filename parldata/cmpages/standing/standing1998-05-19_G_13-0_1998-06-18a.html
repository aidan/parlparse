<P>
<H5>10.30 am  </H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Brooke </B>(Cities of London and Westminster): On a point of order, Mrs. Roe. I warmly welcome you to the Committee. I draw attention to column 394 of the Hansard report of our proceedings on Tuesday 16 June in that I may have inadvertently misled the Committee when referring to the non-copying of documents that were removed from homes and the offices of a company in my constituency.  
<P>
I did not say that that case involved the Office of Fair Trading, but I might have implied that. Having verified my constituency case notes in the interim, I now know that the case involved the Serious Fraud Office. Incidentally, personal computers were also removed from homes. I plead in mitigation that the Under-Secretary referred to other past analogous legislation when he was arguing for certain powers in the Bill.  
<P>
<B> The Chairman:</B> Thank you, Mr. Brooke, for making the Committee aware of that correction. I am sure that it has been noted.  
<P>
<B> Mr. John Redwood (Wokingham):</B> On a point of order, Mrs. Roe. Have you or has one of the other Chairmen of the Committee received notification of the Minister of State's absence from our proceedings? He was absent on Tuesday. It is understandable that busy Ministers or shadow spokesmen have to be absent from Committee from time to time, but this Minister of State has been more absent from our proceedings that he has been present. I wonder whether he has extended the courtesy to the Committee of explaining why and letting you know when he will next be in attendance. 
<P>
<B> The Chairman:</B> That is not a matter for the Chair. The Government can put forward any Minister that they choose to take the Bill through the Committee.  
<H4><center>Clause 46  </center></H4>
<H4><center>The Competition Commission </center></H4>
  
<P>
<B> Mr. Redwood:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 15, in page 23, line 40, at end insert   
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(8): The cost of administration and remuneration of the office of the Director, the Competition Commission and the Appeals Tribunal shall not exceed 30 million pounds in the first year of operation and any rise in the cost of these thereafter shall be limited to the rise in the Retail Price Index'.<P>
</UL></FONT>  
<P>
The purpose of the amendment is to impose control on the costs of the new quango that wil be established under the Bill. We are worried by the proliferation of quangos under the Government. [Laughter.] Labour Members should check their facts more carefully before implying something by their laughter. Between 1979 and 1997, successive Conservative Administrations reduced dramatically the number of quangos.  
<P>
It is also true that some large quangos did rather well under the previous Administration and they were rightly criticised strongly by the then Opposition. I always sympathised with such criticism and I remind labour Members that, when I was Secretary of State for Wales, I made sure that the Welsh Development Agency, the biggest and most powerful quango in Wales, was substantially reduced in size and had its budget cut against the wishes of the then Opposition, I hasten to add.  
<P>
<B> Mr. John Bercow (Buckingham):</B> I fear that my right hon. Friend's natural, self-effacing manner prevents him from drawing attention to his own good record in such matters. If circumstances had been different and he had felt able to remain within the Government for a further two years, does he agree that his good record would have been an outstanding record?  
<P>
<B> Mr. Redwood:</B> I could not possibly endorse such a comment, but I know that my hon. Friend meant it nicely.  
<P>
The previous Government did reduce the number of quangos and, now that we are in opposition, we are worried that the Government have not learnt the lesson of how quangos grow and grow. They see quangos as an answer to all their problems. There is a quango to run monetary policy. We are to have a quango to operate food policy that should be run by Ministers in the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. A quango called the Low Pay Commission was set up to advise on the minimum rates of pay, to do the job of Ministers at the Department of Trade and Industry. However, we now understand that the Chancellor of the Exchequer is capable of doing that job. Under this Bill, another super-quango is about to be set up, to do the work of the President of the Board of Trade in matters of competition. We wish to make sure that it is kept under control.  
<P>
<B> Mr. Tim Boswell (Daventry):</B> I was going to intervene on a point that my right hon. Friend has already touched upon. If he can imagine himself unimaginably with the persona of a quango, he would be extremely demoralised, having taken large quantities of expert evidence as, for example, the Low Pay Commission has done to be completely sandbagged by a Government that had set one up only six months before.  
<P>
<B> Mr. Redwood:</B> My hon. Friend is absolutely right. It would be a great worry.  
<P>
I shall return to the strict terms of the amendment. Whey they introduced the Bill to the House and the Committee, Ministers made great play of the fact that it would bring about a massive simplification of the competition regime and of competition legislation. They said that basing British law on European law for domestic matters, as well as it falling under European law for inter-state matters, would result in simplifications and savings for business.  
<P>
We wish to ensure, by means of the amendment, that some controls will be placed on the servicing of that new regime, based on its cost to the taxpayer. If Ministers were right to say that the new regime would be much simpler for all involved, they will find the rather generous sum of money suggested in the amendment to cover the cost of the Competition Commission and the appeal tribunal more than enough for the purpose, and they will therefore be happy to welcome the amendment or even to suggest a lower figure.  
<P>
<B> Mr. Boswell:</B> My right hon. Friend is generous in giving way twice. Would he not concede that the modesty of his requirements should stagger the Committee, given that the estimate of additional expenditure is given in the explanatory memorandum as £6.5 million. The amendment would provide a sum four or five times larger that amount. Does not that limit seem entirely reasonable?  
<P>
<B> Mr. Redwood:</B> My hon. Friend is beginning to worry me, leading me to think that when we first thought about the matter we were too generous. We may have to move a further amendment to lower that sum, because £30 million is a lot of anyone's money. It is certainly a lot of taxpayers' money. When it comes to setting up the Competition Commission, that money represents a substantial operation.  
<P>
The Under-Secretary would be wise to tell the Committee, and the general public, a little more about how he proposes to abolish the Monopolies and Mergers Commission and the other elements of the present competition regime that he wishes to remove, how he proposes to recruit new staff into the Competition Commission, how that might differ from the present structure and job descriptions, and what sort of control he will be able to exercise over them.  
<P>
The background to those changes will not be terribly favourable to a Government trying to recruit high quality and good calibre people to undertake that work. The Government will be aware that they have already unleashed substantial wage inflation. Average earnings are rising by 5.2 per cent. and in the overheated parts of the country, including London and the South-east, wage growth is considerably higher than that.  
<P>
I have been talking to people in the Thames valley and in north Hampshire during the past week, and they report that they anticipate having to make wage awards of between 7 per cent. and 10 per cent. in the forthcoming year just to retain the staff that they already have. They also report enormous staff shortages. If it is decided that the Competition Commission should be based in London or the south-east, as a I suspect it will be, the Under-Secretary should be aware of those recruiting difficulties, and of the need to be extremely careful about the amount of money needed to set up the new organisation.  
<P>
It would be good if the Under-Secretary were to take this opportunity to reassure staff working in the competition authorities, as presently constructed, that they are likely to be transferred to the new authority. It would be good for them and their families to know that they will have a continuing job under the new regime. It would solve some of the otherwise intense recruiting problems that the Government will face if they keep the people that they have, rather than sacking them and then discovering that it is difficult to hire new people in the marketplace.  
<P>
A further part of the background is that because the Bill will churn up all the existing arrangements and agreements and will force businesses to spend more time and effort on ensuring that they are not pursuing an anti-competitive path, there will be intense pressure in the recruitment marketplace for people with competition authority skills. While that is good news for the people whom the Under-Secretary may sack, it is not good news for the competition authorities, which will be trying to hire good staff at a sensible price. We need a statement from the Under-Secretary now, both to reassure the staff of the current competition authorities, to the extent that he can, and to reassure the taxpayer that he will be keeping an eye on the total cost of the staff that he will be hiring.  
<P>
It would also be useful if the Under-Secretary would tell us what he has in mind in respect of property. Can existing properties be used for the new Competition Commission, or is the idea to surrender the leases or to sell the freeholds depending on what are the current property arrangements and to look for a big, new, smart building to house the new commission? In my experience, if the Under-Secretary opts for the latter route, it will turn out to be extremely expensive. IT may also prove difficult to get rid of all of the existing property on acceptable terms. Often, although existing public sector property is perfectly reasonable for its current uses, it is not immediately attractive to other users, given the different pattern of office use by a regulatory body from that of the free-enterprise, competitive sector.  
<P>
I should like to know what ground rules the Under-Secretary plans to set out concerning office accommodation, and where the physical presence of the Competition Commission will be felt. Does he have any thoughts on regional representation? I know that the Government are keen on government in the regions. Does he think that the Competition Commission will need regional offices, so that businesses based in the north-east or the north-west have more direct access to people at an office that they can recognise, or does he think as I fear that he might that that would represent an unnecessary complication and expense? Perhaps he will explain how the iron rule of the Treasury matches up to the desire to provide government in the regions for the regions, which is a national policy.  
<P>
The amendment would provide a generous total sum of money to operate the system in its first year. I would hope that that could be done for considerably less money, but we are pessimistic about the fabled savings that Ministers suggest may be made, because we expect the new system to be more complicated and more expensive than the outgoing system, rather than less so.  
<P>
It is also important to limit the increase in cost and complexity after the first year of operation. We have suggested limiting the rise in cost to the retail prices index. The Under-Secretary will probably tell me that wages usually rise by more than prices; that is clearly true. We therefore imply by the amendment that other fixed costs in particular, property costs should be locked for a reasonable time, so that they do not escalate to such a great extent. Also, once the system starts to settle down, as it should after the initial year, there should be productivity benefits form a lower case load.  
<P>
It is clear that the first year of operation will be especially complicated and expensive, because of the change and churn in the system that businesses will experience. We expect the first year of the Competition Commission to be fraught, because many businesses will want guidance and advice from the competition authorities about whether their current practices meet the requirements of the new legislation.  
<P>
That is a series of questions for the Under-Secretary to answer. I hope that he will accept either the spirit or the letter of our amendment; if he does not, he should at least give us proper reassurances about the cost of the operation, and how he intends to handle staff recruitment, staff retention and property.

<P>

<B> The Minister for Competition and Consumer Affairs (Mr. Nigel Griffiths):</B> We, too, warmly welcome you to the Committee, Mrs. Roe.  
<P>
I am happy to accept the spirit of the amendment, but I cannot accept the breathtaking hypocrisy that lies behind it. The record of the right hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood) on quangos shows why he has acquired such great expertise in the field. He said that he was at one time the Secretary of State for Wales. His record for the years 1993, 1994 and 1995 shows that eight new quangos were created, ranging from the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales to the Welsh Economic Council and the advisory committee on staffing matters.  
<P>
<H5>10.45 am  </H5>
</P>
<P>
In August 1994, when the right hon. Gentleman was at what might be considered the height of his powers in Wales, the administrative costs of the top 10 quangos in Wales revealed that more than £26 million was spent on administrative costs. By August 1996 their costs had doubled a situation for which I know he will accept no blame.  
<P>
The subject of the amendment is MMC and OFT spending. I am sorry to say that for the early years of the previous Conservative Government, 1979-80, the MMC and the OFT cannot provide me with their costs. Presumably Ministers did not ask for or require the costs. However, they can provide me with the costs for 1991-92, when they spent £21.6 million. In the 1996 financial year, costs rose to £26.2 million, so there was no cap on spending then, as the right hon. Gentleman now suggests. There was no mere inflationary increase, as suggested in the amendment. As the proof of the right hon. Gentleman's record and the record of Opposition Members in government is not to abide by the spirit of the amendment, I have little hesitation in urging the Committee to reject it.  
<P>
Let me go further and add some substance to those criticisms. The business community has emphasised to us the need for the competition authorities to be properly resourced for the system to run effectively. We have listened; we do not expect Opposition members to listen. The Confederation of British Industry has made that point strongly and we have listened to it.  
<P>
This year spending on the two bodies, the OFT and the MMC, taken together is about £30 million the cap that the right hon. Gentleman wants to place on them, but that he and his predecessors did not seem able to force those authorities to live with during their term of office. Let me give a strong message to those bodies and authorities. We expect them to account for every penny and to hold their expenditure down, as befits organisations that are responsible for spending public money in, we hope and trust, the public interest. However, to propose in opposition a firm cap, when Conservative members in government imposed no such cap although as the right hon. Gentleman boasted, he wanted to apply such a cap shows that he failed to do so because it was not possible. That does not stop us welcoming the message   
<P>
<B> Mr. Redwood:</B> If the Under-Secretary checks the record more carefully, he will discover that when I was a Secretary of State, not only did I impose a cap on overhead costs for each quango, but I had regular review meetings with the management and boards of those quangos to ensure that they were holding or reducing their overhead costs. The record is clear; I was successful in running down the numbers in those when that was possible, or holding down costs in those when it was not. I hope that the Under-Secretary will allow me to correct the record. Will he now tell us whether he will do something similar for the commission when it is established?  
<P>
<B> Mr. Griffiths:</B> It is sad, but not untypical, for the right hon. Gentleman to blame his successor now the Leader of the Opposition for letting expenditure on the top 10 quangos almost double in the two years between August 1994, when he last presided, and August 1996. It increased by 94 per cent. from £26 million to £51.66 million, when the retail prices index was not rising by 94 per cent., but by 6.1 per cent. Does the right hon. Gentleman want to defend that? I note that the right hon. Gentleman does not defend the eight extra quangos that he created.  
<P>
Of course, we expect the commission and the director general to make the fullest possible use of the resources that they have. They have built up valuable staff resources, which we would not want to be lost. There is no intention that they should be lost. We trust that they will continue to occupy and make the best possible use of their buildings. If they wish to cease to use any part of them, they should offload them in the best possible way. That could not be clearer. We cannot accept the amendment; it is founded on rhetoric alone rhetoric which contrasts with a woeful record.  
<P>
<B> Mr. Redwood:</B> Before the Under-Secretary finishes his speech, will he answer the points that I made about staffing? Will he reassure the existing staff about their jobs? What arrangements will he make to recruit new or additional staff?  
<P>
<B> Mr. Griffiths:</B> The right hon. Gentleman is not a good listener. I said that the current staff constitute the best resource possible for both those organisations and that I would not wish to see them lost. Of course, as with any transition, extra staff might be needed. They might also be needed to administer the new prohibitions effectively to reflect the increased work load.  
<P>
The very matters that the CBI and business discussed with us as being vital to ensure that the regime is effective will mean that whatever staff are needed will be recruited to supplement current skills or staff. It is right that there should be proper staffing and resourcing. We have listened to business, and it is important not to hamstring the new organisation and frustrate the wishes of the CBI and other businesses in that way that the amendment would, and I urge my hon. Friends to reject it.  
<P>
Amendment negatived.  
<P>
Clause 46 ordered to stand part of the Bill.  
<H4><center>Schedule 7  </center></H4>
<H4><center>The Competition Commission  </center></H4>
<P>
<B> Mr. Andrew Lansley (South Cambridgeshire):</B> I beg to move amendment No. 180, in page 63, line 5, leave out `Secretary of State' and insert  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`Lord Chancellor in consultation with the Lord Advocate'.<P>
</UL></FONT>  
<P>
<B> The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 181, in page 63, line 25, at end insert   
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(4a) A member of the Commission appointed in accordance with sub-paragraph (1)(a) shall not exercise (or, in the case of a person who was a member of the MMC immediately before the commencement date, shall not continue to exercise) any functions of the Commission other than in relation to appeals.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>  
<P>
<B> Mr. Lansley:</B> May I say what a pleasure it is to be a member of the Committee on the first occasion under your chairmanship, Mrs. Roe?  
<P>
Clause 46 introduces us to the Competition Commission as a body. Schedule 7 fills out all the details of its composition and functioning, in so far as that is set out in the Bill. The commission is intended to have executive and judicial functions. Interestingly, in the European Union, the executive and judicial functions are exercised separately. The Commission is the executive, which corresponds to the role of the Office of Fair Trading and the reporting role of the Competition Commission, whereas the judicial functions, which will be embraced within the Competition Commission, are exercised by the Court of First Instance and the European Court of Justice.  
<P>
It is not necessarily desirable for the executive powers proposed for the commission they include such wide-ranging powers as merger and monopoly reference, utility referrals and licence modifications which are proposed by regulators and referred to the commission to be incorporated into the same body, with judicial or quasi-judicial processes, for fear that activity on the reporting side of the commission would eventually compromise the objectivity of its appeal and tribunal side. The Under-Secretary will correct me if I am wrong, but I think that there will be instances of the commission's appeal tribunal hearing appeals against decisions made by its reporting side. It does not look as though the Minister is going to disabuse me of the notion that that is likely to happen.  
<P>
The amendments do not seek to separate the functions into different bodies that would dismember the intentions of the legislation. They seek to work within the proposed format, but in a way that results in a better separation of powers within the commission. They would not prevent the senior, policy-making, managerial levels of the commission from operating coherently; the functions of chairman and deputy chairman of the commission would not, for example, be bifurcated into executive and quasi-judicial functions. However, under the schedule it is possible indeed, unless the Minister tells us otherwise, I imagine that it is contemplated that persons appointed under paragraph 2(1)(a) as appeal panel members could also be appointed by the Secretary of State as members of a panel dealing with general functions. We would therefore have commission members exercising both executive and quasi-judicial functions which would mix up the jurisdictions. Under paragraph 4, the chairman and president of tribunals are required to have legal qualifications, but even in that regard there is no apparent demarcation between members appointed to sit on the appeal panel and those appointed to carry out functions on the executive side. Persons appointed to be chairmen or even president of tribunals might, therefore, also exercise a function on the reporting, executive side.  
<P>
The first purpose of the amendments is interrogative, to find out whether the Minister will give us assurances about the Government's intention to preserve a distinction between the membership of the reporting panels, which exercise general functions, and of the appeal tribunals. If the Minister is unable to give us satisfactory assurances, I would be happy to move the amendments in a substantive way. Under the schedule, the Secretary of State will appoint panel members and, in consultation with the Lord Chancellor and, where appropriate, the Lord Advocate, make appointments that require legal qualifications for the president and chairmen of tribunals, for example. Amendment No. 180 would give the Lord Chancellor, in consultation with the Lord Advocate, the power to make appointments to the commission, rather than the Secretary of State. I am sure that the Minister will be able to draw on specific instances of a Secretary of State making appointments even of a quasi-judicial character to tribunals. Before the Under-Secretary does so, will he tell us what is the balance of precedent? From what I know of the matter, the balance of precedent appears to be that appointments of a quasi-judicial character to appeal tribunals for example, to the financial services tribunal are made by the Lord Chancellor, together with the Lord Advocate, rather than by the departmental Secretary of State.  
<P>
<H5>11 am  </H5>
</P>
<b> Mr. Redwood:</b> My hon. Friend makes a powerful and elegant case. We on the Opposition Front Bench entirely agree that it is an important principle in British law that there should be clear independence. We are discussing a quasi-judicial appeal tribunal, which would be greatly strengthened if the Under-Secretary were to accept my hon. Friend's amendment in the spirit in which he moves it.

<br>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B> Mr. Lansley:</B> I am grateful for my right hon. Friend's expression of support. I hope that it will move the Under-Secretary further towards accepting the amendments.  
<P>
Amendment No. 180 would not directly affect the Secretary of State's appointment of general panel members, nor would it remove the Secretary of State's ability to select the president or the chairman of appeal tribunals from among the members appointed to appeal panels. Does the Under-Secretary intend or expect the president of the appeal tribunal to be a High Court judge?  
<P>
It has been suggested to me, and I agree, that in so far as the appeal tribunal exercises a judicial or quasi-judicial function, it ought as far as possible to do so in the manner of a court. That would be likely to minimise the number of appeals from the tribunal to the courts. If it fails to do so and appears to be a rubber stamp, to put it crudely, for the decisions of the director general or the reporting side of the Competition Commission, there will be many appeals to the courts, which will reduce the efficacy of the procedures introduced by the Bill.  
<P>
Finally, amendment No. 181 is equally important, and a little more straightforward. It is designed to carry through the separation of functions. Under the amendment, people appointed to an appeal panel would be allowed to exercise functions only in relation to appeals. As my right hon. Friend rightly said, important principles are at stake here principles that I hope that the Government would endorse which have not been given effect in the schedule as drafted and ought to be incorporated in it. I hope that the Under-Secretary will either agree with the amendments and encourage the Committee to support them or give us some cast-iron assurances about the demarcation of functions within the commission.  
<P>
<B> Mr. Nigel Griffiths:</B> I understand the intention behind the amendments, and I welcome the opportunity to explain to the Committee how we decided on the wording in the Bill, and why I have grave reservations about accepting the amendments.  
<P>
Amendment No. 180 deals with the provision for the Secretary of State to appoint members of the appeal tribunal. In the case of those qualified for appointment to the panel of tribunal chairmen, the Secretary of State is required to do so in consultation with the Lord Chancellor.  
<P>
As the tribunal will have to deal with complex economic and commercial issues, the Government's view is that the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry will be well placed to identify and select candidates with the necessary blend and breadth of experience to lead the tribunal. Whoever is appointed as president of the tribunal will be of a standing at least equivalent to a High Court judge, and our arrangements will open up a wider range of potential candidates. That is important in such a specialist field. Advocacy will, of course, be less important than in the High Court.  
<P>
The right hon. Member for Wokingham will remember from his experience in Government that the number of people suitably qualified and with the experience to sit on the present MMC is rather limited. The calibre of those who come forward is generally exceptionally high, but they are few in number. It is therefore vital that the Secretary of State has the power to appoint people.  
<P>
The placing of the tribunal alongside the reporting arm of the Commission will not undermine the independence of the tribunal. The tribunal wil obviously not hear appeals against conclusions reached by the reporting arm, and the reporting arm will have nothing to do with cases brought under the prohibition. It is a clear separation. There will be a finite pool of people able and willing to become panel members who have the necessary skills and experience.  
<P>
Amendment No. 181 is unacceptable, because it would bar members of the appeal panel from being appointed also as members of the reporting pane. It would not be right to impose such a restriction. If people have the right skills for both jobs, they should be allowed to be members of both the appeal and the reporting panels. The new organisation would thus benefit from cross-fertilisation, which will facilitate the transference of expertise. That will promote a consistent approach to competition matters, which is so important to business.  
<P>
I hope that, having heard the reasons for our policy, the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley) will reflect on the amendments and agree that they are unnecessary, and I mean no offence that amendment No. 181 is slightly unhelpful.  
<P>
<B> Mr. Boswell:</B> Before inviting my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire to comment on what the Minister has just told the Committe, I shall share with the Committee some of my experiences of tribunals and appeals.  
<P>
I am still troubled by this dual capacity. The Under-Secretary rightly sets out the tension between the need for suitably qualified people I accept that there are not many of them and the need to show a degree of transparency and independence, so that people will not feel that they can be nobbled or that Chinese walls might not be completely in place. In a sense, all experiences that I adduce have some relevance.  
<P>
For a year or two, I was an expert serving member of the agricultural land tribunal. Although I am not a lawyer, I had experience of some rather technical matters, on which I brought my farming expertise to bear. I served under a chairman with a legal remit that derived from the Lord Chancellor rather than from the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. I subsequently had the privilege of serving in that Ministry, initially as a special adviser and subsequently as a Minister.  
<P>
I mention that because, when I started as a special adviser, the concept of milk quotas was being developed, and it was important to have a procedure in place. Nothing could be more technical and complex and immaterial than milk quotas. We prescribed that a distinguished judge the then Lord Grantchester should hear tribunal cases under a completely separate procedure. Of course, we were able to draw on the services of agricultural experts, but the law was in the driving seat.  
<P>
When I was an Under-Secretary at the then Department for Education, I helped to establish the special educational needs tribunal, partly because I had taken an interest in tribunal work. That tribunal has been effective. Again, there was an interest in perceived separation for example, even to the extent of locating the tribunal and its secretariat in a separate building from the then Department for Education.  
<P>
These are troubling matters. I understand the balance of what the Under-Secretary is trying to say, but in a litigious world there will be a growing interest in perceived separation and in the legal input into such matters, whether or not he or I like it. Given what he has said, I still reserve judgment on whether it is absolutely necessary to go down this route. I have considerable sympathy with the amendment moved by my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire.  
<P>
<B> Mr. Lansley:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for contributing to the debate in that helpful and interesting way. I thought that, in the main, the Under-Secretary responded generously to the debate, but I was not entirely content with the assurances that he gave. He said that the person appointed as the president should be if not a High Court judge, someone with equivalent standing. That begs many questions, as does the Government's intention, as expressed by the Under-Secretary, that those appointed as members of appeals panels could also be members of the panels on other reporting functions.  
<P>
In the same speech, the Under-Secretary gave assurances about the independence of appeal tribunals, while talking about cross-fertilisation between appeal tribunals and the reporting side. Many outside the House think that that is a difficult balance to strike when establishing a new organisation, especially as the management, policy and, sometimes, membership of the two sides of the Competition Commission will be intermingled in that way.  
<P>
I understand that whereas in the past appeals have been made on points of law, and hence had an exclusively judicial character, the appeals that the Under-Secretary outlined will be substantive in that economic arguments will be presented. Clearly, it is right that the appeals panel should contain members who have economic expertise. As someone who, in the past, played a small part in advising on the membership of the MMC, I know that it is difficult to find people with appropriate economic expertise to become members of such panels.  
<P>
The amendment is not intended to exclude from the appeals panel those who have the appropriate economic expertise to hear appeals that have substantive as well as legal characteristics. It is intended to ensure independence and provide a distinction between those who carry out their executive and investigative functions in pursuing monopoly and merger references and those who hear the appeals.  
<P>
I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for clarifying that appeals will not be heard against any decision by the Competition Commission. Therefore, the commission will not be prosecutor on the one hand and judge on the other. My confusion arose from my understanding of how complex monopoly cases will be handled, on the one hand, under the Fair Trading Act 1973, and on the other under the chapter II prohibition. We shall deal with that in a later debate, so I shall not expose my ignorance of that subject any further. The essence of what the Under-Secretary is saying is that, given that the quasi-judicial decisions that the new body makes will have both an economic and a legal character, there will be a blurring of the characters of those who will operate within the appeal tribunals.  
<P>
I referred earlier to the necessity for confidence above even consistency in the appeal tribunal to be such that those who are affected by its operations do not consider that they should have automatic recourse to the courts to establish points of law relating to decisions that were made about them. If the appeal tribunal is bypassed or superseded regularly on legal grounds, it will become a no-man's land between the director general, who is making substantive economic decisions, and the courts, that are making substantive legal decisions. If the tribunal is to have a role in such matters, it should be a credible, independent legal function so that recourse to the courts is rarely undertaken, other than in exceptional cases when seeking to set important legal precedents.  
<P>
<H5>11.15 am  </H5>
</P>
<P>
The debate has been useful in that such issues have been exposed. I do not wish to delay the Committee, so I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.  
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<B> Mr. Nigel Griffiths:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 148, in page 64, line 31, after `12' insert  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and paragraph 5 of Schedule 8'.<P>
</UL></FONT>  
<P>
<B> The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendment No. 154.  
<P>
<B> Mr. Griffiths:</B> The amendments make minor drafting changes to schedules 7 and 8. I am happy to explain them to the Committee, but I am sure that the reason for such changes is obvious.  
<P>
Amendment agreed to.  
<P>
Question proposed, That this schedule, as amended, be the Seventh schedule to the Bill.  
<P>
<B> Mr. Boswell:</B> Old hands on the National Minimum Wage Bill, which is on our minds today, may recall a point that I raised at a less convenient hour of the morning than now. Parliamentary draftsmen should pay attention to such matters. Part IV of schedule 7 includes provisions for disqualification of Members of the House of Commons and members of the Northern Ireland Assembly. It is becoming increasingly anomalous with the Scotland Bill, which is being considered in another place, the Government of Wales Bill and the parallel consideration of a revamped assembly for Northern Ireland by that I mean the revamping of the old assembly to which the Bill refers and which has been in disuse for several years.  
<P>
In the interests of openness and no conflict of interest, members of the Competition Commission should be disqualified from serving in those legislative bodies. That is not at issue, but there are peculiar provisions for excluding such people. There is specific disqualification for Members of the House of Commons and there would be for members of the Northern Ireland Assembly, but there is no provision for members of the Scottish Parliament or members of the Welsh Assembly. The drafting of the provision is untidy.  
<P>
In response to such a point at a somewhat early hour in the morning when discussing the National Minimum Wage Bill, the Minister of State said that provisions would be made in the Scottish and Welsh Bills to secure the same effect by an implementing order. It would be a pity if the draftsmen do not get their act together and the provision is not tidied up in due course. If such a provision were let through in its present form, we would almost immediately have de facto to amend it.  
<P>
<B> Mr Griffiths:</B> My hon. Friend the Minister of State covered a similar matter raised by the hon. Gentleman during discussions on the National Minimum Wage Bill. I would not want to go beyond that, but, if necessary, I shall write to the hon. Gentleman and other members of the Committee about the matter.  
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

</UL></FONT>  
<P>
<B> Mr. Boswell:</B> In the spirit of earlier exchanges and of the reticence of my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire in moving his amendment No. 180, the amendments should properly be treated as probing amendments about the conduct of the appeal process.  
<P>
<B> Lorna Fitzsimons (Rochdale):</B> On a point of order, Mrs. Roe. I, too, add my welcome to you as our new Chairman; it is nice to see a woman in the Chair of such a male-dominated Committee. The right hon. Member for Wokingham commented on the non-attendance of the Minister of State. The amendment is tabled in the right hon. Gentleman's name, but the right hon. Gentleman is not present. Can the hon. Member for Daventry move an amendment that is not tabled in his name?  
<P>
<B> The Chairman:</B> Any member of the Committee may move anything.  
<P>
<B> Mr. Boswell:</B> May I respond briefly to the point of order without trying your patience, Mrs. Roe? The presence of my right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham in the Committee has been assiduous and telling, and I dare say that he has had rather more to say than the hon. Member for Rochdale (Lorna Fitzsimons), either about the Bill or about student loans, in which we have a common interest.  
<P>
<B> Mr. Bercow:</B> Although I certainly would not want to try the patience of our admirable new Chairman, Mrs. Roe, does my hon. Friend agree that the spiritual presence of my right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham is of infinitely greater significance than the physical presence, rare though it is, of the Minister of State?  
<P>
<B> Mr. Boswell:</B> I should not continue such speculation. Suffice it to say, as the Romans would say, and as my right hon. Friend the Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Brooke) will remember, that there is a spirit about numenem est and leave it at that.  
<P>
I should like to clarify an important point. Because of the grouping about which I make no complaint, because the amendments are probing two concepts march together. The first is that of appealable decisions of the director general, and the second is that of decisions of the commission that are appealed on points of law to a court normally the Court of Appeal in England under clause 50. The two are bracketed together, but it is important to use the group to tease out a little more about how the process will work in practice.  
<P>
Amendments Nos. 70 and 71 are intended to make the point that, in an appeal to the tribunal, the director general's actions and decisions should be considered on their substance, in the sense of whether it was right for the director general to make that decision, and/or with respect to how that decision was reached. If it has been reached casually, without full consideration, that is a slightly different issue from whether the right decision on economic grounds has been taken. It is important that the Under-Secretary should tease that out and explain whether both can be covered. That is, broadly at least, our intention with amendments Nos. 70 and 71.  
<P>
We shall discuss clause 48 substantively in a moment, but in relation to the difficult area of third party appeals, the intention of amendment No. 73 is to tie that to considerations that I fear may arise in which disaffected persons, such as competitors, may try to establish a locus standi with the director general for an appeal, and he may reject that. That is a fraught area, and it is therefore provided in proposed subsection (6) that we should consider such cases there.  
<P>
Amendments Nos. 75 and 76 bring us to what we may term the full monty the actual procedure of going to the Court of Appeal on a point of law. The purpose of the amendments is to probe how that will work in practice. Amendment No. 76 goes further, because it would provide that the court of law the Court of Appeal, for example should eventually be empowered to consider the director general's decisions under clauses 47 and 48. Perhaps the Under-Secretary can explain whether that may occur under the Bill. As I understand it, that is likely to be moderated through the tribunal itself, and could then be appealed up, but only on a point of law. If the director general not necessarily the reasonable one that we have now were to have an obsession about a particular course of conduct and reached a series of decisions based on that obsession, at some point a court of law must be able to blow the whistle and explain why his decisions were not right.  
<P>
For the sake of completeness, I now come to new clause 2. That would simply provide that,  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The Secretary of State may, after consulting such persons as he considers appropriate, make rules with respect to appeals."<P>
</UL></FONT>  
<P>
Again, that is an attempt to provide a mechanism for setting out some of the ground work for example, how leave may arise or which level is to consider which matters.  
<P>
As I said, those are a complex of small interlocking items. The amendments are an attempt to respond to the concern that has been expressed that the appeal process should be seen to be as effective and as independent as possible. I am sure that the Under-Secretary will want to reply positively. We all look forward to hearing an explanation of how the various bits will fit together and will be seen to be fair by the parties involved.  
<P>
<B> Mr. Griffiths:</B> I am concerned about the impact of the amendments, which I understand parallel amendments tabled and discussed in the other place. They go to the heart of the way in which the tribunal will work. They are intended to ensure that appeals against the director general's decisions are heard by the courts, rather than by the appeal tribunal within the Competition Commission, as is proposed in the Bill.  
<P>
<B> Mr. Boswell:</B> These are points of some complexity, but my understanding of the effect of our amendments would not be that the tribunal would be excluded; they would develop a conduit by which cases could proceed, if that were appropriate. We also seek the Under-Secretary's clarification of which cases could proceed to full consideration by the Court of Appeal.  
<P>
<B> Mr. Griffiths:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for that explanation, but I am not sure that that would be the impact of the amendments. I want to make it clear that the Government see the right to a full and independent appeal process as an essential part of the balance, fairness and transparency of the new regime. Arrangements in the Bill will ensure that right. The tribunal approach set out in the Bill is a more flexible system than an appeal to the courts, and better able to deliver efficient, fair, effective and expert appeals. It will be able to draw on a much wider pool of expertise and experience, including that of lay members. At the same time, it is important that the chairman be legally qualified and have appropriate experience and standing which means that the tribunal will have a status equivalent to that of the High Court.  
<P>
Overall, we believe that the Bill will make the most efficient and effective use of resources and expertise and will promote consistency across competition policy.  
<P>
Amendment negatived.

<B> Mr. Boswell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 72, in page 24, leave out line 13.

<P>
(m) as to whether he has complied with the requirements of section 60,'.<P>
</UL></FONT>  
<P>
<B> Mr. Boswell:</B> I shall speak briefly and in the spirit of these probing amendments. Rather maddeningly for its tabler as, I am sure, for the Minister, amendment No. 218 refers as legislation often does to other clauses in the Bill and is consequently difficult to unravel.  
<P>
The clause deals with appeals against the director general's decisions and amendment No. 72 seeks to remove the specification on the period fixed under clause 4(3)(b). The Minister may recall that we had some partially helpful exchanges in our debate on that clause and that reservations were expressed about the implications of amending, with retrospective effect, exclusions from the prohibition under chapter I. A reasonable period of notice was suggested.  
<P>
It would be helpful if the Minister explained how the clause will work. In our earlier debate we were concerned that there should be a reasonable period of notice and we are concerned now that, if matters were reconsidered on appeal particularly if a third party were involved in the decision an unreasonable burden could be placed on a company to comply with the new ruling, or to withdraw the exclusion, within a short period. That is what I am probing and I would be grateful for the Minister's response.  
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire has put forward some interesting proposals in amendment No. 218, with which I have sympathy, and I shall let him speak to it.  
<P>
<B> Mr. Lansley:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry for referring to amendment No. 218. I shall speak to it briefly.  
<P>
Amendment No. 218, which had a previous incarnation as amendment No. 179, is rather like the amendment from hell I keep getting the cross-references wrong. Before the Minister or his colleagues point it out, my reference to  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"requiring the production of a specified document under section 23(1)";<P>
</UL></FONT>  
<P>
should in fact read as I realised last night section 27(1). Although that makes it technically deficient, it is of no consequence in the sense that the amendment is merely a probing one.  
<P>
Clause 47 sets out the decisions of the director general that may be the subject of an appeal. Those are relatively widely drawn. They include decisions on whether either of the two prohibitions have been infringed, on exemptions my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry referred to the period of exemptions and on penalties, responses to third-party appeals and enforcement, including interim measures.  
<P>
That seems comprehensive. However, when one looks at it in detail, it is clear that other decisions will have to be made. Some of them are comprised within the list of decisions that are appealable, but others may prove to be outside it. For example, in the first instance, the question of whether a dominant position exists is not appealable in itself; but a decision on whether an abuse of a dominant position has occurred is appealable. The director general may decide that there is a dominant position, but may conclude that there is no abuse. However, for the purposes of an undertaking so affected, the decision that a dominant position exists may be a relevant decision, and one to which that undertaking may wish to appeal.  
<P>
Likewise, on the vexed question of the production of a specified document under clause 27(1), it may be of considerable importance to a company whether it should surrender a document to the director general. I lay greater stress on the question of whether the director general should disclose documents. Clause 55(3) lists the circumstances under which the director general can disclose a document without the consent of the party, and clause 55(2) lists those from whom that consent is to be obtained.  
<P>
Under those circumstances, it may properly be a subject of considerable interest to an undertaking whether its documents are to be subject to disclosure by the director general. I stress that under clause 58, the director general's findings are findings of fact. Findings of fact will be important to the undertakings concerned for example, in determining parallel proceedings. A sector regulator might make a finding of fact in relation to the competition legislation, and carry that forward into some of the sectoral statutes that regulate the industry. The undertaking may want to appeal against that.  
<P>
Perhaps the most important of the decisions listed in amendment No. 218 is in paragraph (m), which is whether the director general  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"has complied with the requirements of section 60",<P>
</UL></FONT>  
<P>
which is whether he has acted in accordance with EC jurisprudence.  
<P>
An undertaking may wish to appeal against the director general on the ground that clause 60 required him to behave in a particular way. The Under-Secretary may put me right on this, but if an undertaking believes that the director general has not undertaken his functions in accordance with clause 60, the appeal would lie not with the tribunal, but with the court.  
<P>
If we are to have a relatively consistent and unified structure, under which the tribunal will exercise not only substantive but legal functions, it is desirable for the party to be able to make an appeal to the tribunal. If it is the Government's intention to bring clause 60 into effect consistently throughout the jurisdiction, that ought to be one of the decisions that is appealable to the tribunal.  
<P>
I raise those matters not only so that Ministers can justify the inclusion of decisions that should be the subject of an appeal to a tribunal, which might be relatively straightforward, but also so that they can justify the exclusion of some decisions. If the occasion and the argument demand it, perhaps the Under-Secretary will reflect upon that question between now and Report.  
<P>
<B> Mr. Nigel Griffiths:</B> Amendment No. 72, moved by the hon. Member for Daventry, would remove what we consider to be an important right of business and affected third parties to appeal. For example, a company might be granted an exemption from the chapter I prohibition for five years. If the company felt that the exemption should properly last for, say, seven years, under the Bill it could appeal to the tribunal to have the period of the exemption extended. Amendment No. 72 would remove that right. The company might have good grounds for thinking that an exemption for five years would not be commercially advantageous, and that an extra two years were necessary.  
<P>
<B> Mr. Boswell:</B> My concern is not so much to limit the ability of the party to appeal against the director general's decision as to limit third party appeals. As I construe clause 48, it would be open to a third party to say, "You're letting these people off lightly. They've got five years to change."  In fact, if a material change is made to an earlier ruling, it may be reasonable for a party to have such a period of notice. Our concern is that there should be a partial limit on third party appeals.  
<P>
<B> Mr. Griffiths:</B> I accept that that is the hon. Gentleman's intention; I did not mean to raise an issue that he perhaps had not considered. To tackle the substance of his argument, it is important that firms and consumers affected by decisions albeit as third parties should have the right to challenge them. That is part of the fairness and equity of the new system. I would expect those parties to exercise that right with due responsibility, but I would certainly not want to deprive them of the right of appeal. I know that the hon. Gentleman will acknowledge the drafting problems to which I alluded.  
<P>
Amendment No. 218 would add to the list of appealable decisions. We intend that only substantive decisions should be appealable to the tribunal. By that, I mean final decisions by the director general at the conclusion of a procedure or investigation a stage at which the interested parties will be affected. We do not intend to provide an appeal to the Competition Commission on intermediate steps in the director general's proceedings or his analysis on the way to making decisions. To do so would be to open up endless and unnecessary scope for delay and obstruction. Our proposals provide for a full and fair appeal once a substantive decision has been taken. None of the items listed in the amendment are substantive decisions.  
<P>
<B> Mr. Lansley:</B> The Under-Secretary will correct me if I am wrong, but may not the director general make a substantive decision by determining that an undertaking has a dominant position as a finding of fact, as it were but is not abusing that dominant decision? Ought not such a decision to be appealable by the undertaking concerned?  
<P>
<B> Mr. Griffiths:</B> At the end of the day, once the director general has reached his final conclusions, an appeal to the tribunal must be made on grounds of law. The director general will collect evidence of a dominant position there are decades of experience of collecting evidence of what position companies hold in the marketplace. It is important that that investigation proceeds to its conclusion and that the findings are given to the affected party and to other parties who may also want to comment before further action can be taken.  
<P>
The amendment, which would make requiring the production of specified documents appealable, could bog down the director general's investigators in a morass of detail and delay. If a company could appeal  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"on a Director's finding within the meaning of section 58" ,<P>
</UL></FONT>  
<P>
as the amendment also provides, that would allow a field day for the company's lawyers to challenge the director general's findings and appeal against them before he could reach a final decision. The question of whether the director general  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"has complied with the requirements of section 60" ,<P>
</UL></FONT>  
<P>
as suggested in paragraph (m) of amendment No. 218, does not affect the substantive decisions that must be made under the core powers in the Bill. We want to ensure that the fair appeals procedure deals with such decisions.  
<P>
The issues were extensively discussed in the other place, and we have given due and careful consideration to the points that were made. Those points would not enhance the Bill, but would pose problems, allow delays to be created and make it even more difficult to reach timeous resolutions, which may then be the subject of an appeal. I therefore urge the Committee to reject the amendment.

<P>

<B> Mr. Boswell:</B> I would not advise my hon. Friends to press the amendment to a vote. The Under-Secretary's explanations have been broadly helpful in clarifying his position, but still leave on the table our anxieties about the effects of amendments to exemptions that have already been given but are subsequently withdrawn from the companies involved. I am sure that from time to time   competitors will, as a commercial tactic, attack the director general's decision to try to shorten periods of notice or of expiry of exemptions. However, given that that is a wider set of problems, I would not advise my hon. Friends to pursue it here.  
<p4>The Under-Secretary's answers on amendment No. 218 establish a rational basis for a response. One point may have been left slightly hanging in the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire. I shall not invite the Under-Secretary to respond now unless he wants to; he may want to reflect on it. If the director general reaches a conclusions of fact, he may pass it to a third party for example, a sectoral regulator which may use it as the basis for a decision. Presumably, the basis on which that decision was taken, which was informed by a finding of fact from the other regulator assuming that they talk to each other, as they should would be challengeable in an appeal, or ultimately in the courts in relation to the conduct of the sectoral regulator, rather than that of the director general. What I am saying, in English, is that at some point that would have to come out in a decision by a regulator or a third party, in which the director general's conclusion to use the distinction phrase would play some part. At that point, it might be appealable under that procedure.  
<P>
<B> Mr. Lansley:</B> I hope that the Under-Secretary can help me with an additional question, as I am not entirely clear about the matter. Let us suppose that an undertaking wants to appeal on the grounds that in arriving at a substantive decision such as the one to which the Under-Secretary referred, the director general did not comply with clause 60, and that corresponding EC jurisprudence is interpreted differently in the mind of the appellant. I understand that appeals on such a basis could be made only to a court, which, in this instance, would mean not the tribunal but the High Court. If so, it would surely be preferable for such an appeal, based as it is not on a point of law but on the application of the principles of the administrative structure of the director general's activities, to be comprised within the Competition Commission and considered by the tribunal.  
<P>
<B> Mr. Griffiths:</B> It will be possible to appeal against the director general's decision to the tribunal on the grounds that his decision was not in accordance with the requirements set out in clause 60. I hope that the hon. Gentleman finds that reassuring. I hope too that his hon. Friend the Member for Daventry will find reassurance in the fact that, when we reach schedule 8 in our deliberations, the Government will move two amendments that are intended to clarify the tribunal's powers in relation to setting aside parts of a decision or findings of fact.  
<P>
I hope that those explanations have persuaded the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.  
<P>
<B> Mr. Boswell:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<B> The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss amendment No. 209, in page 25, line 9, after `Commission', insert `appeal to that Commission'.  
<P>
<B> Mr. Boswell:</B> We now come explicitly to the issue of third party appeals. Considerable concern exists within industry and in particular within the CBI about how the clause will work and whether it will prove vexatious.  
<P>
During his response to an earlier set of amendments, the Minister expressed a worry that the granting to companies of permission to appeal against the director general's findings on matters of fact that were not themselves decisions would result in a flood of paper and further traffic in the appeal process. Unfortunately, that argument may play against the Government's provisions.  
<P>
Along with large chunks of industry and responsible players, we are worried that the third party appeal process may become vexatious. As I said earlier, it is a well-known tactic for a competitor to challenge decisions. That tactic is virtually cost-free because the value to the competitor of an adverse decision against a third party may be so great that the temptation will be to go down the route of challenge rather than of competition.  
<P>
I do not want to make too much of the matter. The Minister will have noted that we have resisted what was a real temptation to seek to strike out the clause altogether, or to say that no provision should exist for third party appeals. Indeed, at the back of our minds is the practical consideration that third parties can at any time convey their unhappiness about a particular matter by making representations to the director general, or to the Secretary of State through the political net. The director general could not, therefore, close his mind to any representations that third parties might make, even in the aftermath of a decision.  
<P>
However, appealing against a decision is not the same as making representations as to why that decision might be changed. As the Minister knows, if it were to be changed there has to be a further procedure. In the case of an exemption, the director general would have to prescribe that exemption. In the case of an exclusion, the Secretary of State would have to provide for that exclusion.  
<P>
The amendments are limited in scope. They seek to provide some filter, in order to avoid aggravation tactics on the part of disaffected third parties. As it stands, the Bill will require the director general to make many decisions on the conduct of companies, or on the anti-competitive action of companies in respect of their agreements, under chapters I or II. All those decisions will be appealable, provided that appellants satisfy the director general on their interest or standing, which they must do. The problem is not that we can stop them from making the appeal unless we decide to scrap the whole idea, which I am not advocating nor that the director general has to consider their standing in the matter, but that, if they are vexatious, they can appeal to the competition commission and set up another round of a legal arms race.  
<P>
The purpose of the amendments is to concentrate the Minister's mind on filtering out frivolous appeals. There is nothing to stop the commission having to consider an appeal and there is no filter on frivolity. We do not know how clause 48 will work in practice. I am sure that the Minister wants to avoid people messing about and frustrating the Bill's intentions, but he needs to show the Committee how he wil avoid numerous third party appeals clogging up the work of the commission and thereby reducing its efficacy.  
<P>
<B> Mr. Nigel Griffiths:</B> We believe strongly in a fair and transparent system in which third parties, including businesses, consumers and representative groups, with a sufficient interest in a decision of the director general may appeal a decision to an independent tribunal. Clause 48 delivers that.  
<P>
I invite the hon. Member for Daventry to move 37 pages on in the Bill to schedule 8 paragraph 7 which specifically provides against "vexatious proceedings"  and  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"vexatious applications of any proceedings." <P>
</UL></FONT>  
<P>
I hope that he accepts that safeguard. The draft Bill published by the Conservatives in 1996 similarly made provision for appeal rights for any person with a sufficient interest, and for representative appeals. I expect that they had a similar safeguard, and I hope our safeguard reassures the Committee, the CBI and others.  
<P>
<B> Mr. Boswell:</B> I suppose there had to be one sooner or later: I regard that as an almost entirely satisfactory response. I do not intend to press the matter further unless and until the CBI or others feel that there is more to be done. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.  
<P>

<P>
<B> Mr. Griffiths:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 144, in page 25, leave out lines 32 and 33.  
<P>
This is a minor technical amendment. Clause 50 provides for appeals against the tribunal's decisions on points of law or the level of penalty to the courts of appeal in England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. The amendment relates to time limits within which appeals against the tribunal's decisions are to be brought. Clause 50(3) requires that the tribunal rules must contain a provision to limit the time within which such appeals may be brought. The amendment removes that requirement. Limits on the time for bringing appeals to the courts is normally dealt with under the rules of the Supreme Court. We wish that normal practice to apply in relation to appeals against decisions of the tribunal.  
<P>
<B> Mr. Boswell:</B> Is the Under-Secretary saying that if there were good reason for example, because of the complexity of the case or the disability of some party the normal time limits could be suspended, as I think they can in normal legal proceedings, but that it would be a decision of the court?  
<P>
<B> Mr. Griffiths:</B> The procedures for applications for leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal are usually dealt with under the rules of the Supreme Court. Order 59 contains detailed provisions governing such procedures, including the time limits within which such appeals should be brought. The time limit is four weeks at present.  
<P>
There is no reason why the appeal tribunal should be out of line, so we hope that the hon. Gentleman will be satisfied and that the amendment will be accepted.  
<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<B> Mr. Griffiths:</B> These three amendments make further minor and technical refinements to clause 50. I have explained the purpose of the clause, and the amendments clarify which will be the appropriate appeal court to hear appeals against the decision of the tribunal. For example, amendment No. 146 makes it clear that where the tribunal proceedings took place in Scotland, appeals should be to the Court of Session in Scotland.

It has always been our policy that appeals should be handled in this way but we think that it is sensible to ensure absolute clarity, which is the reason for the amendments.

</UL></FONT>  
<P>
<B> Mr. Griffiths:</B> Amendments Nos. 132 and 158 refer to appeals on points of procedure. It may be helpful if I explain how we intend the appeals process to operate in that respect.  
<P>
It is our intention that the tribunal should be primarily concerned with the correctness or otherwise of the conclusions contained in the appealed decision and not with how the decision was reached or the reasoning expressed in it. That will apply unless defects in how the decision was reached or the reasoning make it impracticable for the tribunal fairly to determine the correctness or otherwise of the conclusions or of any directions contained in the decision. Wherever possible, we want the tribunal to decide a case on the facts before it, even where there has been a procedural error, and to avoid remitting the case to the director general. We intend to reflect that policy in the tribunal rules.  
<P>
This is an important aspect of our policy, and I shall explain the rationale behind our approach. The Bill provides for a full appeal on the merits of the case, which is an essential part of ensuring the fairness and transparency of the new regime. It enables undertakings to appeal the substance of the decision including in those cases where it is believed that a failure on the part of the director general to follow proper procedures has led him to reach an incorrect conclusion. The fact that the tribunal will be reconsidering the decision on the merits will enable it to remedy the consequences of any defects in the director general's procedures.  
<P>
A failure on the part of the director general to follow his own procedural rules would be an error of law, or law and fact, which could form an element of an appeal to the tribunal in its notice of appeal under paragraph 2 of schedule 8. However, the main point is that we want the tribunal to have to look beyond such procedural points to the substantive merits of the director general's conclusion. The purpose and effect of paragraph 3(1) of schedule 8 is that the tribunal must determine the appeal on the merits that is, on the economic substance of the case.  
<P>
I hope that my explanation is helpful.  
<P>
<B> Mr. Redwood:</B> I welcome the amendment and the Under-Secretary's explanation. The Opposition are keen to see the widest possible range of grounds on which an applicant can appeal. As the hon. Gentleman said, errors of fact, errors of procedure or a judgment based on facts that are difficult to marshal on either sides of the argument are all legitimate grounds under the amendment. We welcome that and there seems no need for further debate.  
<P>
<B> Mr. David Chidgey (Eastleigh):</B> I am pleased, even at this late hour, to welcome you to the Chair, Mrs. Roe.  
<P>
The Under-Secretary has covered a lot of the ground that I want to raise on amendment No. 158, but it is important that some of our concerns are on the record. As the hon. Gentleman knows, appeals to the Competition Commission are limited to the grounds set out in paragraph 2(2) of schedule 8. In the normal case of a decision establishing a violation, the grounds of appeal are limited to a decision being based on an error or facts being wrong in law. The concern raised by the CBI is that that contrasts with EC rules under article 173 of the EC treaty, which I am advised includes infringement of an essential procedural requirement as a ground for appeal against a commission decision.  
<P>
It has only recently come to light that the distinction exists, could be significant, and could mean that procedural violations will be subject to challenge only by means of judicial review of administrative action, which for most practical purposes means not at all. The CBI has assumed that procedural errors would lead to a decision being wrong in law, but reflecting on the specific divergence from the EC rule makes us think that while that might be the case in some circumstances, it will not necessarily be true in respect of all procedural errors.  
<P>
I welcome the Under-Secretary's opening comments, but it is important specifically to address those concerns and I look forward to his response.  
<P>
<B> Mr. Griffiths:</B> I want to make it clear that nothing in the Bill interferes with the right to seek judicial review in the High Court. For example, failure on the part of the director general to follow proper procedures and his own rules might be challenged in that way before or after he makes the decision. That, alongside the right of a full appeal to the tribunal on the merits of a decision, strikes the right balance and protects the efficiency and effectiveness of the new regime. However, we have fairly covered the concerns of the Committee in amendment No.149. Amendments Nos. 132 and 133 are in part redundant and could have some unwitting, damaging effects on the Bill.  
<P>
I hope that my earlier assurance will allow the Committee to accept amendment No. 149 and not to press the other amendments in this group.  
<P>
Amendment agreed to.  
<P>
<B> Mr. Griffiths:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 150, in page 71, line 20, leave out `reverse' and insert `set aside'.  
<P>
<B> The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 151 to 153, 155, 166, 167, 156 and 168.  
<P>
<B> Mr. Griffiths:</B> These amendments, which will make detailed adjustments to schedule 8, are designed to ensure that the appeals process operates efficiently and effectively.  
<P>
I draw the Committee's attention to the main substantive changes, which are contained in amendments Nos. 150 and 167. Amendment No. 150 sets out the power of tribunals in relation to the final decisions that they make. The Bill allows a tribunal to reverse the director general's decisions. Under the amendment, the tribunal will be allowed to set aside the director general's decision so that it has no effect. Our concern is that the power to reverse a decision suggested that the tribunal should reach a definite alternative finding from that of the director general. That would not always be sensible or practical.  
<P>
Amendment No. 167 will make it an offence to fail, without reasonable excuse, to comply with certain procedural instructions that the tribunal will have the power to make. I refer to the power to require people to attend the tribunal to give evidence and to the power to order the disclosure of information between the parties, both of which may be contained in the rules made under paragraphs 9(c) and 9(e), The Bill contains no sanction for refusing to comply with instructions if the tribunal, rather than the director general, were to take those powers. The amendment provides for an offence liable to a fine not exceeding level 3 currently £1,000.  
<P>
Amendment No. 151 will make it clear that the tribunal may confirm, vary or set aside any part of the director general's decision. Similarly, amendment No. 152 will ensure that the tribunal has the same powers as the director general to give directions to remedy infringements. Amendment No. 153 will provide clarification similar to that of amendment No. 151 and has the same aim. Amendment No. 155 will make a small drafting change by removing a redundant "also" . Amendment No. 156 is technical it will require that any money that the tribunal receives in fees is paid into the Consolidated Fund. My right hon. Friend the Chancellor will welcome that greatly.  
<P>
Amendment No. 166 will make express provision on the rules of the tribunal. It will allow the tribunal to fix time limits for any aspect of the appeal proceedings and to make rules about the evidence that may be required or admitted in proceedings. Amendment No. 168 provides clarification and is designed to ensure that the tribunal's powers to grant interim orders pending the conclusion of its proceedings will be as wide as those of the director general. I hope that the amendments are acceptable to the Committee.

<P>

<B> Mr. Redwood:</B> I am again grateful to the Under-Secretary. The Opposition are happy with most of the amendments. I agree with the substantive change that will be made under amendment No. 150, but I have a query about the drafting of amendment No. 152. The Under-Secretary might like to answer this point.  
<P>
If agreed to, amendment No. 152 would introduce two sub-paragraphs (d) and (e) into paragraph 3(2). Sub-paragraph (e) contains only the word "make" . Therefore if that word is governed by the original "may"  in line 21, under the amendment, the Bill will simply state that the tribunal "may make" , which is not terribly helpful. If the word "make"  is also governed by the word "or"  in sub-paragraph (d) of the amendment, the Bill will state that the tribunal may give such directions "or...make" .  
{**fc 
<p4**}I think that I understand what the draftsmen have in mind, but the wording is rather odd, extremely clumsy and might cause difficulties. Perhaps the draftsmen might reconsider the amendment because the word "make"  is rather lonely.    <P>
<B> Mr. Griffiths:</B> I bet that you were not told that the Committee would be this much fun, Mrs. Roe.  
<P>
I am studying with care the wording of the provision. I understand the right hon. Gentleman's argument and I am sure that assistance will come speedily to hand. The word "make"  runs into the remainder of line 26, so as to read:  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"make any other decision which the Director could himself have made" .<P>

I take it that that satisfies the right hon. Gentleman's point.

<H4><center>Rules </center></H4>
  
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.  
<P>
<B> Mr. Boswell:</B> The clause paves the way for schedule 9 and sets out provisions for the director's rules on matters that are being debated extensively. Clause 52 then makes provision for guidance, which most of us and most businesses consider instinctively as being even more important than the rules. It is important that companies receive good guidance, that they comply with it and that the rules are invoked only when they have manifestly failed to do so.  
<P>
Under the clause, as much information as possible should be made available to the general public and there should be widespread consultation. It contains order-making powers. I invite the Under-Secretary to say a little more about the likely schedule and nature of such information both by way of guidance and as a taster for the rules to be envisaged. I am sure that all members of the Committee appreciate the real efforts that are being made by the director general to consult by way of guidance and intimation. I am not being derogatory. The process has started well and we want to ensure that that continues.  
<P>
Subsection (4) covers concurrent matters, which will be debated later in our proceedings. However, it is important in consultation and explanation not only that the director general should talk to the regulators, but that it should be made as clear as possible both in the rules and in the guidance what companies are expected to do, and in what form. If humanly possible, one set of provisions should apply to both cases so that companies do not find themselves having to produce information twice or having to produce slightly different information for different regulators unless there is a manifest need to do so.  
<P>
My remarks are simply precautionary. I am sure that everyone wishes things to go as smoothly as possible. I look forward to the Under-Secretary's response.  
<P>
<B> Mr. Lansley:</B> I want to add one question to what was said by my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry. Under clause 51, the director general can make rules, after consultation with and in a manner approved by the Secretary of State. However, under subsection (9) the Secretary of State can  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"by order vary or revoke any rules" ,<P>
</UL></FONT>  
<P>
and under subsection (10), she can  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"direct the Director to exercise his powers ... and make rules" .<P>
</UL></FONT>  
<P>
I do not dispute that the Secretary of State should have such a power.  
<P>
The director general, in exercising powers under part I of the Bill, will, under clause 60, have to operate in accordance with the principles of EC jurisprudence. The Secretary of State, however, will not be so bound. It seems that a difference could arise between what the Secretary of State requires of the director general under clause 51(9) and (10) and what view the director general may take of his position under clause 60.  
<P>
My question is straightforward. The director general may take the view that he should make rules in a particular manner, but realises that the Secretary of State could direct otherwise. Would the provisions of clause 60 override the Secretary of State, or would the director general simply have to proceed under clause 51 in the manner required by the Secretary of State?  
<P>
<B> Mr. Griffiths:</B> I welcome the constructive remarks of the hon. Member for Daventry. Clause 51 enables the director general to make rules about procedural and other matters in connection with the carrying into effect of the provisions of part I of the Bill. The clause also introduces schedule 9, which specifies some of the matters for which the rules may make provision. Subsection (2) makes it clear that the schedule is not to be taken as restricting the director general's powers under the clause. Rather, it illustrates the sort of matters on which rules may make provision and signposts those matters that we regard as particularly important.  
<P>
For example, the rules may make provision on the form and manner in which guidance or decisions are to be sought and given, or on the procedure to be followed when the director general cancels individual or block exemptions or takes enforcement action. We discussed on previous occasions a number of more detailed matters for which I would expect the rules to make provision for example, for a timetable, when dealing with applications; and the right of undertakings subject to investigation to be given a reasonable time to seek legal advice.  
<P>
Those are all important matters, and they will form much of the basis for businesses' dealings with the director general. For example, they will cover the forms that businesses will have to complete when seeking a decision. It is right, however, that such detailed matters should be dealt in the director's rules rather than in primary legislation. The rules will need to be sufficiently detailed to deal with the various scenarios, and they must be capable of being readily refined. Those are matters in which business and lawyers will take a considerable interest. As a result of a Government amendment made in another place, subsection (3) therefore requires the director general to consult such persons as he considers appropriate when he is preparing rules.  
<P>
Although such matters are not, in my view, a matter for primary legislation, as they will have the force of law, it is right that they should be subject to appropriate ministerial and parliamentary control. Subsection (5) therefore provides that no rule made by the director general is to come into operation until it has been approved by an order made by the Secretary of State. Clause 70 makes the Secretary of State's power exercisable by statutory instrument, subject to annulment by a resolution of either House.  
<P>
Proper accountability also means that the Secretary of State must have the power to direct the director general to make rules about a particular matter and to vary or revoke any rules he has made. Those powers can be found in subsections (9) and (10). Naturally, one would not expect the Secretary of State to exercise those powers often and perhaps not all.  
<P>
On the matter of concurrence, raised by hon. Friend the Member for Daventry, just as there is only one Bill, there should be only one set of director's rules, setting out procedural matters for carrying into effect the Bill's provisions. The director general's powers under clause 51 are not exercisable concurrently by sector regulators. However, consultation on the rules is clearly needed between regulators, and subsection (4) therefore provides that if the proposed rules relate to a matter in respect of which a regulator exercises concurrent jurisdiction, the persons consulted must include that regulator.  
<P>
In practice, a joint working party from the Office of Fair Trading and the regulators, chaired by the OFT, had been set up to develop the rules and the advice and information for which clause 52 makes provision. The working party has already met several times to discuss drafts of the rules.  
<P>
I hope that that explanation satisfies hon. Members.

<P>

<B> Mr. Griffiths:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 219, in page 74, leave out lines 21 to 24.  
<P>
<B> The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss Government amendment No. 220.  
<P>
<B> Mr. Griffiths:</B> These are exactly the sort of amendments that will warm the cockles of the right hon. Member for Wokingham's heart. They are necessary and pedantic they correct the tense used in relation to a decision about the infringement of the prohibitions. They make similar corrections to those made in Government amendments to earlier parts of the Bill. They also make further minor drafting changes to the schedule.  
<P>
<B> Mr. Redwood:</B> As the Under-Secretary knows, we spend most of our time making points of substance, but there has been the odd occasion when we thought that the drafting could be improved and we have been happy to share that wish with the hon. Gentleman. On this occasion, I am happy to welcome the improved drafting. The change of tense helps a proper understanding of the Government's intentions. Furthermore, on this occasion the amendment does not leave two "makes"  following each other, which was rather confusing.  
<P>
<B> Mr. Griffiths:</B> That was helpful. I hope that it allows us to move on speedily.  
<P>

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.  
<P>
<B> Mr. Brooke:</B> I noticed a little earlier that the hon. Member for Eastleigh (Mr. Chidgey) was not in the Room. I had thought that he might want to speak on clause 52; indeed, he may still want to. In his absence, I regarded myself as an inadequate potential substitute, for the hon. Gentleman has brought engineering expertise to the Committee. Although I served in the Royal Engineers, I think of myself as a pale imitation of the hon. Gentleman.  
<P>
<B> Mr. Chidgey:</B> I am grateful for the right hon. Gentleman's interesting introduction. He may have noticed that we tabled some amendments to clause 52, but they were not selected. Sadly, therefore, I cannot contribute to the debate as I would have wished.  
<P>
<B> Mr. Brooke:</B> The hon. Gentleman may still wish to allude to the matter on which I shall speak if you, Mrs. Roe, regard it as being in order. I raise the point on behalf of my constituents who are in the Association of Consulting Engineers. As the hon. Member for Eastleigh will know, the association has long been based in my constituency. It was set up there to enable consulting engineers to walk to the House to give evidence on railway Acts in the last century.  
<P>
The association is concerned by the unduly onerous terms of engagement that in recent years have been imposed by some clients on contractors and suppliers in the construction industry. Those forms of contract are often extremely bulky and difficult to assimilate. Smaller firms of construction consultants do not have the resources to analyse such documents nor do they have the funds to engage legal advisers to do so on their behalf.  
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm  </H5>
</P>
<P>
The association has acted on behalf of its members and has attempted to persuade clients to remove or otherwise ameliorate the more extreme contractual conditions. In cases where it has not been successful, it has issued health warnings to its members about the perceived unacceptable nature of specific clauses in such conditions of engagement. Members are not bound by the association's rule of association to take that advice; they decide on a commercial basis whether to accept the risk inherent in such conditions of engagement.  
<P>
In the association's view, its action does not represent a collective refusal to bid and its effect is not the prevention or distortion of competition. Usually it takes action to prevent a client with a dominant market position from abusing its power. Clearly a balance must be struck so that competition exists in the marketplace that is fair to purchasers and suppliers of construction services alike.  
<P>
Any advice and guidance by the Director General of Fair Trading should recognise that trade associations serve a crucial commercial purpose. They provide members with legal advice, act as a vehicle for the exchange of information, collate and prepare statistics and liaise with and lobby the Government to facilitate cross-border trade with overseas associations and undertakings. Through their close contacts, they also often help to maintain quality standards and help to protect consumers.  
<P>
The association's view is that the guidelines to trade associations should be specific on what they may or may not do when advising members. It would regard it as intolerable if it had to refer to the Director General of Fair Trading every piece of advice that it gave its members. Given the competitive pressures that are involved in responding to the contractual conditions of tenders, does the Under-Secretary think it reasonable for the director general to give some idea of when he will be able to provide advice?  
<P>
<B> Mr. Chidgey:</B> I endorse everything that the right hon. Gentleman has said. I declare an interest as I am a consulting engineer. However, in the famous words of the Register of Members' Interests, I am non-practising. I presume that I will get better.  
<P>
We discussed some of the issues that the right hon. Gentleman mentioned earlier in the debate, so I shall not delay the Committee by repeating them. However, I want to add a few words based on my many years experience in the industry that will reinforce what the right hon. Gentleman said. The Association of Consulting Engineers considers itself to be a trade association. It acts in the interests of not just its members but its clients, and it engages in complex work. There are great difficulties in dealing with contracts between the association's members and clients and in advising them on how to raise standards in the industry. That is in the interests of everyone involved in it. It would be wrong to assume that the Association of Consulting Engineers is in any way a professional body that exists solely to protect the interests of its members; it is quite the reverse. It is a broad church and the spirit of civil engineers' work is to serve the community.  
<P>
Although we considered the detail of the issue at an earlier sitting perhaps that is why my amendments were not selected it does no harm to bring the Committee's attention back to the important points of principle that underlie the contribution made by the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster. I hope that the Under-Secretary will be able to offer us some reassurance.  
<P>
<B> Mr. Nigel Griffiths:</B> The points made are fair and valid. Clause 52 deals with the preparation and publication of advice and information in what we call the guidelines. Gearing up for the new regime is especially important. It affects the businesses that the hon. Member for Eastleigh and the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster rightly mentioned.  
<P>
So far, five draft guides have been published for consultation. They cover the major provisions of the Bill; market definition; dual notification; de minimis rules; and European Commission comfort letters. In addition, form "N" , which businesses will use to notify agreements and conduct to the Office of Fair Trading, has also been sent out for consultation. The Government and the director general are committed to full consultation with businesses and practitioners. So far, the guidelines have been sent to 400 interested parties, including consumer bodies, local authority associations, the business community and its advisers.  
<P>
Some amendments have not been selected, but I emphasise that mentioning a specific subject in the clause could undermine the director general's ability to issue advice and information on subjects that are not explicitly mentioned. I am sure that the Committee would find that undesirable.  
<P>
We take seriously the points that have been raised. I hope that, in the light of those reassurances, the Committee will accept the clause.   
<P>
<B> Mr. Brooke:</B> I want to express my appreciation for the way in which the Under-Secretary responded. I did not table an amendment about trade associations and a timetable in which the Director General of Fair Trading should operate for the reasons that the Under-Secretary outlined. I am satisfied with his response.  
<P>
Question put agreed to.  
<P>
Clause 52 ordered to stand part of the Bill.  
<H4><center>Clause 53  </center></H4>
<H4><center>Fees  </center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.  
<P>
<B> Mr. Redwood:</B> Before we approve the clause, it would be useful to receive some information about the magnitude of the fees and the sort of regime that the Under-Secretary would like to be instituted.  
<P>
Earlier, we learnt that the competition authority will cost more than £30 million a year to run. Do the Government hope to recoup a specific proportion, or all of that? If they hope to recoup the whole sum, the fees could be high. Can the Under-Secretary offer the Committee any guidance he will have to offer guidance to the director general about the proportionality of the fees to the complexity of the case, and the size of the company or industry that seeks advice or a decision?  
<P>
It is important that businesses feel that they can turn to the competition authority before they begin a practice, or continue a previously approved practice, to ascertain whether it is all right, likely to be wrong, or, in a limited number of cases, a grey area that requires further probing.  
<P>
The previous Government established a system for merger control. Through the competition authority, we offered business informal guidance. A company would seek guidance when, for example, it was considering taking over another company. Confidentiality was guaranteed. The competition authority would say that it was likely or unlikely to refer the case. In a limited number of more difficult cases, it would be unable to reassure the company because grey areas had to be considered in detail. In most cases, the competition authority could advise on whether the action was reasonable or likely to cause problems, and thus save time and trouble for companies that had been sensible enough to seek informal guidance.  
<P>
I trust that under clause 52 and clause 53, which deals with fees, there will be a similar facility for companies to seek informal guidance. If so, what pricing structure, if any, does the Under-Secretary have in mind?

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B> Mr. Lansley:</B> Does my right hon. Friend agree that any fee structure should not exceed the cost attributable to the activity for which a fee is charged?  
<P>
<B> Mr. Redwood:</B> Indeed that is a good point. The clause is loosely drafted. Size appears to be a consideration. Turnover is twice mentioned, but it is not specified does it mean group turnover world wide, group UK turnover or the specific turnover of the business seeking advice or guidance or coming before the competition authorities? Subsection (2) refers to the turnover "of any party"  or "of a person" . However, in the case of a company or group of companies, we need more clarification of what level of turnover is envisaged world-wide group level, UK group level or subsidiary level when the subsidiary is seeking guidance? We need to know more about the Government's proposals to deal with that.  
<P>
The clause allows different amounts to be charged for different functions. Again, it would be helpful to know what fee scales are envisaged and what functions will attract different levels of fee.  
<P>
<B> Mr. John Hayes (South Holland and The Deepings):</B> The issues that my right hon. Friend raises are dependent on the Government's overall business plan. In rejecting our amendment to limit size, the Under-Secretary gave no idea of his notional view of the likely size. This part of the Bill is, as my right hon. Friend said, woolly and vague because the Government's notional plans are not revealed. The fees are likely to be determined by the size.  
<P>
<B> Mr. Redwood:</B> The Government believe that trading at a loss is likely to be indulging in predatory pricing, so I am worried that the director general might enter the spirit of that and propose high prices to avoid the accusation of trading at a loss. We must know whether the intention is to cover all or only some part of the costs. Will there be a formula, and how will it be applied to different types of business and different types of actions? As it stands, the power is too wide ranging. We should not have to wait until the Bill is passed: Parliament should know in advance at least the principles on which the fees will be based.  
<P>
<B> Mr. Boswell:</B> Apart from endorsing my right hon. Friend's comments about the principle of charging I should like to raise two specific points. First, subsection (2) (d) states  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"that an application or notice is not to be regarded as duly made or given unless the appropriate fee is paid." <P>
</UL></FONT>  
<P>
The Minister will be aware that some other clauses provide relief from penalties if, for example, an application has been made in certain circumstances. If someone has filed an application and has mistaken the fee because the schedule was not at hand, or if someone running a small business has forgotten to sign a cheque and the omission is corrected within a reasonable period, the payment should be treated as having run from the date on which the application was made rather than the date on which the cheque was written. Will the Under-Secretary clarify the position?  
<P>
Secondly, I want to make a wider point. Before the Under-Secretary leaps to conclusions. I hasten to say that I am making no prophetic or political point in asking whether the director general will accept fees tendered in foreign currencies, including the euro, as the Inland Revenue used to do. That is not purely a debating point, because companies that have their main base in the European Union or elsewhere may have branch activities in the United Kingdom, and may have occasional dealings with the director general. They may not have a sterling bank account, because they may have decided to conduct all their activities in euros. In such circumstances, will it be possible for the director general to set up a schedule to enable them to handle their business with expedition and convenience?  
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm  </H5>
</P>
<P>
<B> Mr. Griffiths:</B> The Government have not taken a decision on whether fees should be charged. However, that option should be available; that is why clause 53 gives the director general powers to  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"charge fees, of specified amounts, in connection with the exercise by him of specified functions"<P>
</UL></FONT>  
<P>
under part I of the Bill. The amounts and functions will be specified in the director's rules to be made under clause 51.  
<P>
When we debated charges in Committee on 11 June, it was recognised that it may be appropriate to charge fees where the public sector has to provide a genuine service. It was also recognised that fees for giving guidance and a decision may be a way of managing the director general's work load. Of course, any charge would be subject to approval by order of the Secretary of State, under clause 51, and would be subject to annulment by Parliament. Under subsection (3), the director general would have to consult on any such rules, as my hon. Friend the Minister of State made clear to the Committee on 11 June.  
<P>
The hon. Member for Daventry asked whether the director general would have to set up a schedule to take fees in euros. As long as he does not have to set up a bank account and his private affairs are not involved, that will be all right. I am sure that his acceptance of fees in euros will progress in line with Government policy, and according to the requirements of European law.  
<P>
<B> Mr. Redwood:</B> That was not a satisfactory answer. By this stage, after exhaustive debate in the other place and lengthy debate in Committee and on the Floor of the House of Commons, Ministers should have formed a view on whether they intend to exercise the important powers in clause 53.  
<P>
The Opposition are not against the principle of charging. There would be a case for sensible charges that are proportionate to the work done and to the size and riches of the companies involved. There is nothing wrong with some of the cost being recouped in that way.  
<P>
I find it difficult to believe that Ministers have not yet come to any view on the matter. From helpful leaks in newspapers, we know that the public expenditure round for the next three years is well advanced. We have already been given a parliamentary statement on the overall magnitude of public spending, and we know that the Government are fleshing out the detail of each departmental programme.  
<P>
Will the Under-Secretary tell us, at least in general terms, what proportion, if any, of the costs of what will be a pretty expensive body will be recouped from fees and charges? He must know the answer, because under the rules set out by the Chancellor, that forms part of the Government's public expenditure planning for the remainder of the life of the Parliament.  
<P>
If the idea is to recoup all the costs, that is a different proposition from the idea to charge a modest handling fee in each case.  
<P>
<B> Mr. Lansley:</B> I am slightly perplexed. If the Under-Secretary has no idea whether fees will be charged or how much the will be, how can the Government have satisfactorily concluded their compliance cost assessment of the impact of the Bill on industry?  
<P>
<B> Mr. Redwood:</B> That is a superb point. We have had an extensive debate in which we sought to show that the compliance cost assessment is a load of nonsense; this is merely another example that demonstrates that it is. We are not told whether the costs will be internal to the Government and fall on all taxpayers, or external and fall directly on the companies that want the service or that are trying to avoid being hit by the competition authority.  
<P>
I hope that the Under-Secretary will lift the veil a little more. We need to know the Government's general thinking. From my understanding of the pressure being put on the Department of Trade and Industry budget, Ministers will be very keen to find as many offsetting charges as possible. There will be lots of back-door taxation and I imagine that the Government will want to use the power quickly. We should still like to know on what basis they will do so.  
<P>
<B> Mr. Griffiths:</B> I am sure that I can aid the right hon. Gentleman and answer the question from the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire. Of course, when assessing compliance costs one considers all the possible costs that might be involved if all elements were taken into account. It can be seen from the compliance cost assessment that it is out of the question to recover the complete costs of running the organisation; the figure of about £30 million suggested by the right hon. Gentleman reflects, I think, the current costs of the two organisations. It is, however, right for it to be open to the director general to decide what reasonable fees might be set, following consultation and subject to the Secretary of State's approval of any of the activities. That is the usual way of doing things and has been for many years. I have not heard too many squeals from the Opposition about that.  
<P>
<B> Mr. Hayes:</B> The Under-Secretary says that the entire cost will not be recouped, and that is understood, but we are being led to believe that the Government have no notional figures in mind; that they have taken no view on scale or on notional income and costs and no view on fees. It is surely inconceivable that the Government have no model or agenda or is the measure a leap in the dark and a step into the unknown?  
<P>
<B> Mr. Griffiths:</B> I know that for the hon. Gentleman and many of his hon. Friends the notion of consultation and allowing one's judgment and decisions to be informed by listening to people's views is alien. However, the director general will consult on rules on fees. What would be the point of a consultation process if I were to announce now that we had issued instructions for a definite set of scale fees which the director general was to publish?  
<P>
It is important to appreciate the director general's responsibilities. We have no intention of duplicating his work. He has said that he will consult about the rules. I hope that when the consultation takes place the Conservative party will not fall into the trap that it has already fallen into during our consideration of the Bill, namely, scaremongering with unrealistic figures and wholly inaccurate press notices. The bodies that are being consulted might then focus not on the director general's consultation but on spurious press notices and letters from the Opposition.

<P>

<B> Mr. Lansley:</B> I fear that I cannot agree with the Under-Secretary on the question of the compliance costs. I have a copy of the compliance cost assessment. As we learned in an earlier debate, it is an item of serious accuracy. At least if Ministers had some knowledge of the maximum level of the fees in the arrangement that is proposed, some genuine accuracy could have been incorporated into the compliance cost assessment.  
<P>
Annex A to the compliance cost assessment sets out the number of agreements that the Government believe will be affected and the compliance cost per agreement. The material provided to justify that consists of a discussion of lawyers' costs and other legal costs associated with an agreement, and an allocation for the time of managers in the relevant businesses. No allocation is made for the payment of fees to the director general, so nothing is carried through to the global totals which in any case, as we know from previous debates, are misleading. Nothing is carried through into the regulatory appraisal to reflect any fees chargeable and there is no specific reference to fees.  
<P>
<B> Mr. Griffiths:</B> It would be premature to speculate on what fees would be charged and what functions they would be charged for when the director general will consult on the rules for charging fees. It is not our intention to pre-empt the director general. Any opposition to the clause would remove his power to charge for fees of specified amounts in connection with the exercise that he will conduct in pursuing his functions. As in the previous Administration's draft Bill, it is important that there is a power to charge fees. It should be up to the director general to consult on the level that he intends to levy. I do not hesitate to commend clause 53 to the Committee. It is necessary to ensure that the director general has such powers.  
<P>
<B> Mr. Lansley:</B> The Under-Secretary is in a hole and he is still digging. The force with which he asserts the necessity of the clause seems inversely related to the justification that he offers for it. The one justification that he ventures, apart from the obvious one of raising money for the Exchequer to offset the costs of managing the system, is that it might act as a means of managing the work load for the director general. We must think carefully about that because, in effect, the Under-Secretary is contemplating a level of fees that would act as a deterrent to the presentation of cases to the director general or to seeking notifications and so on. Such a proposition is very debatable.  
<P>
Leaving that aside, the Under-Secretary has not justified the clause by referring to a financial requirement whereby the Government are unable to meet the costs or by referring to a general principle that industry should bear such costs. If there were such a general principle, the Government should have established it rather than leave the matter up in the air to be decided by the director general at a later stage.  
<P>
Moreover, the Under-Secretary aserted that a maximum figure would be put into the compliance cost assessment just in case it was needed but, when we examine the matter in detail, we find that no allowance is made in the compliance cost assessment. The hon. Gentleman should have admitted that the compliance cost assessment in this respect, as in so many others, is deficient.
