<P>
Before we start, I have an announcement to make. Members of the Committee know that Hansard writers are infallible, but occasionally gremlins get into the works. Those who have read the report of our first sitting may have found some gobbledygook and repetition in columns 32, 33 and 34. That will be corrected in the final version of the Official Report.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael Portillo </B>(Kensington and Chelsea): You introduced the final part of my speech most aptly, Mr. Gale, because it is about gobbledygook that I wish to speak. It may well be that when the Hansard writers review parts of the letter that I am about to quote, they will see that it contains gobbledygook, which requires no correction by them, although it should have been corrected by the Minister who wrote it. I am referring to the letter that the Minister for Transport, Lord Macdonald, sent to my hon. Friend the Member for North Essex (Mr. Jenkin) on 20 December. The crime committed by my hon. Friend was that he had read the Government's explanatory note on the Bill and had observed that the proceeds were expected to be about £350 million, that the debt of the National Air Traffic Services was £300 million and that the administration costs of setting up the new company would be about £35 million. He then deduced that that left £15 million.
<P>
In his letter, however, Lord Macdonald stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``it is not true to say that we will only get a few million for NATS. We estimate that we will receive several hundred million from the strategic partner for its proposed 46 per cent stake. And this is net of any effects of re-financing at the time of the PPP.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The letter drips with gobbledegook and is riddled with obfuscation. When I was a Minister, I would have put a line through such a draft if it were given to me. I fear, however, that the noble Lord meant his letter to be obscure. He went on to say:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``NATS currently has loans from the NLF of around £300 million which must be extinguished when the PPP is put in place'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
which is precisely what my hon. Friend had said. The letter goes on:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``This is to avoid any hidden subsidy to the PPP from the public sector''—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
which is absolutely right—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``This may be achieved by repayment, or by writing them off and replacing them with new commercial debt.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I wonder what the noble Lord meant by ``writing them off'. If I said to my bank manager that I wanted to write off my overdraft, he would say, ``Well, if you give me the money that you owe me, I would be happy to write it off''. In other words, ``writing off''is not a cost-free option, but an option that costs money.
<P>
One of the problems that we have with peers who have not previously been associated with the House of Commons is that they are not used to being accountable or having to explain themselves. Lord Falconer, refers to ``ordinary people'', does he not? We in the House of Commons are commoners. You, Mr. Gale, are an ordinary person; you are a commoner. I expect that Lord Macdonald, thought that there was no point explaining such a matter to commoners, because they were probably too stupid to understand it. I am certainly as stupid as any other former Chief Secretary to the Treasury. The letter gives the most ample justification for the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for North Essex, all of whose figures the letter confirms. Furthermore, it seems that the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster) is as stupid as I am, because he reached the same conclusion as me.
<P>
At the end of the letter, the noble Lord said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The estimate of £350 million is based on one set of assumptions and refers only to the equity and not the value of any debt retained.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In the previous line, he wrote:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``It is too soon to estimate precisely the value of that part of NATS to be sold to the selected strategic partner''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Suddenly, at the end of the letter, a little beacon of light glimmers through the fog, a little shining lamp of truth, a good deed shining in a wicked world. The noble Lord is indeed right to say that it can be only estimated. As the health warning on all shares issues says, ``The value of your investment may go down as well as up.'' He is right to point out that £350 million is only an estimate.
<P>
If the noble Lord intended to explain something to us that we had not understood, he should perhaps have made it clear in the explanatory notes to the Bill and he should certainly have sent a letter making it plain. As I read the letter, it confirms what my hon. Friend the Member for North Essex said—but there we are. We will have the pleasure in a moment of hearing a fellow commoner try to explain it to us in terms we can grasp.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bernard Jenkin </B>(North Essex): I am grateful to my right hon. Friend for drawing the Committee's attention to the letter I received from the noble Lord. Another interesting little ambiguity comes at the beginning of the third paragraph, which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``That said, it is not true to say that we will only get a few million for NATS.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I wonder who ``we'' are. Does he mean the Government, or does he have a rather grander vision? He talks about a £1 billion 10-year investment programme, which is ambiguous. As my right hon. Friend implies, the letter is intended to blur the simple logic that can be used to analyse the exploratory memorandum.
<P>
Another error is to put a bald figure on the value of 46 per cent. of the National Air Traffic Services. It will make the negotiations with any of the partners rather difficult. It is not as though the business was going to be taken to the stock market with a tender issue, or a public issue of shares that the banks would value at the point of flotation. No, the Government stuck a peg in the ground that any bidder will attempt to knock out. It will be interesting to see whether they get that sum. One wonders how the Government can realise only £15 million on a business that is obviously worth about £1 billion, based on the cash that it generates at present.
<P>
The key aim of this group of amendments is to promote what is becoming a familiar acronym­an IPOC, or independent publicly owned company. IPOC is an oxymoron: being publicly owned, it is by definition not independent. It is therefore the epitome of the third way, so one wonders why the third way party did not choose it. It is a have-your-cake-and-eat-it option—a way of having all the benefits of privatisation without the commercial discipline. It is not a permanent option for NATS.
<P>
Public ownership will deny the benefits of commercial discipline. That means that the discipline will have to be applied through political control and control of the company's borrowing. If any publicly owned corporation takes on liabilities that are ultimately liabilities on the taxpayer, they must be agreed by the Treasury; immediately, the strings of political control are back on the organisation. There is currently a great vogue for bonds. I hate to point this out, but privately owned corporations can issue bonds too.
<P>
Some people are confused and believe that if a publicly owned corporation issues bonds, it is different from the Treasury borrowing money through the gilts markets or letting a company borrow from a national loans fund, as happens at present. They also believe that a bond issue is cheaper than raising equity finance in the city. In fact, the yield one has to pay on a bond is much higher than the average dividend yield on an equity share. In revenue terms, therefore, a bond is more expensive than equity.
<P>
In any case, those who want to issue bonds might as well borrow directly on the Government's balance sheet because the gilt yield is below the bond yield. If the objective is to have a cheap loan balance, one might as well issue more gilts and give the money to the company in that fashion. Bonds are greatly attractive to people who cannot be bothered to work it all out. We need some honesty about that.
<P>
The real give-away about the new clause is the belief that it provides a soft alternative to privatisation. One of the objectives under subsection (1)(c)(iv) is
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``to achieve a commercial rate of return for the Crown''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If the company's objective is achieve such a rate of return, it might as well do so for shareholders. What is the difference between achieving a commercial rate of return in the open market in the private sector and trying to achieve it in the public sector­unless it is intended to provide a cushion against commercial disciplines and realities, which will of course undermine its efficiency?

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Portillo:</B> I have been repenting of my generosity to the hon. Member for Bath, who referred to the record of good management of NATS. We should consider the unholy mess that broke out in trying to organise the project at Shanwick. The hon. Gentleman is unable to grasp the additional and useful pressure that the private sector applies to management. One cannot imagine that the management would have got away with such as mess if they had been subject to commercial pressures.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Exactly. There is an argument from the 1960s, when Prime Minister Harold Wilson was under pressure to nationalise the major retailers. When he said, ``Do you really want Marks and Spencer to be like the Co-op?'' it was a jibe aimed at his own party.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Snape </B>(West Bromwich, East): Once again, the hon. Gentleman provokes me to correct him. In the interests of accuracy—I realise that it was long before the hon. Gentleman's time, as I can tell from his youthful and fresh approach in Committee—it was Anthony Crosland who said that, not Harold Wilson.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I apologise, although Harold Wilson was already treading the third way in 1960s fashion.
<P>
If the discipline of a commercial rate of return were not enough, there is another give-away in the new clause. The hon. Member for Bath knows that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``a commercial rate of return for the Crown''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
is not a proper discipline, so he obliges the company to produce a five-year rolling plan, echoing Gosplan in the former Soviet Union. Every Kolkoz in Stalin's Russia was a form of independent, privately owned company, subject to a five-year plan. The people involved were not called stakeholders, but peasants.
<P>
<B>Mr. Snape:</B> We call you Kulaks.
<P>
<H5>2.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Oh no. I can spot the Kulaks in this modern version of the socialist state—they are the people who have their trusts offshore when the Government are trying to close down offshore trusts.
<P>
This proposal is not the future of National Air Traffic Services. It would give it neither the commercial freedom that it wants nor the commercial disciplines that it needs; nor, ultimately, would it give it access to private capital. However, as an interim solution perhaps, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Kensington and Chelsea (Mr. Portillo) suggested to allow time for the Shanwick air traffic control centre to get up and running so that the business is in better shape for flotation at a later date—it may be a useful proposal to have on the table.
<P>
I would be interested to hear the Under-Secretary explain why we should not adopt such a solution until the company is in better shape for full privatisation and why we should go instead for this fudged proposal, which will raise a fraction of the real worth of the company and could also deliver it to foreign control because the Government are so wedded to the idea of selling a stake to a trade investor, rather than allowing it to take control of its own affairs as a new Great British company as my right hon. Friend suggested.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies </B>(Croydon, Central): Given that the hon. Gentleman was talking about the financial prospects of the public-private partnership for the Government, what assessment has he made of the value of the public sector's 49 per cent. share under the Government scheme, say, five or 10 years down the track, given all our aspirations for expanding a successful NATS into the European arena and beyond? Does he not think that it will end up being a very good deal for the public sector and that to reduce the arithmetic to the figure of £250 million or £300 million is naïve and myopic?
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> It would be alarming were I to adopt the hon. Gentleman's position and presume to know the value of a minority stake in such a company. Effectively, someone will be buying minority control of an organisation that is subject to legislation under which, in certain circumstances, the Government can step in and take control.
<P>
The big question in the management's mind—it is perhaps a question for later on in our proceedings, so I shall just make a brief comment now—is, who will sack them when things go wrong? Will it be the Government, or the minority private-sector shareholder, or do a majority of shareholders have to agree? Will the 5 per cent. hold the balance of power and sack the management? The one thing that the public-private partnership does not deliver is clarity about who is in charge. I suggest to the hon. Member for Croydon, Central (Mr. Davies) that the proposal will reduce the value of the stake and of the proceeds, which will go to the Treasury, even though the Deputy Prime Minister would like to be able invest the proceeds in other transport projects.
<P>
<B>Mr. Portillo:</B> The hon. Member for Croydon, Central might have let the cat out of the bag. The Government are trying to show that there are important safeguards in their approach, including a 49 per cent. public stake and a golden share. We know that the golden share is not worth the paper it is written on—we could dispatch with it by lunchtime if the Government one day convened the House to put through an order that would get rid of it. The Bill provides for precisely that. Now the hon. Gentleman says that the point of keeping the 49 per cent. is so that the Government can flog it for much more money a few years down the road. Thus, the other half of the Government's guarantee in respect of their proposal is thrown out of the window.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman is right; when we kept 49 per cent. of British Telecom and sold it a few years later, we made a great deal of money. However, although his logic is right, it completely undermines the basis on which the Bill is being presented to the House. He has done us a great service by being so candid.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> My right hon. Friend raises an interesting point. As an aside, I note that when we sold 51 per cent. of British Telecom, it was called a privatisation. However, when the Government dispose of 51 per cent. of NATS—albeit 5 per cent. to the staff and 46 per cent. to a trade partner—it is a called public-private partnership. We are in the realms of spin rather than fact.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> For clarification, given the comments made by the right hon. Member for Kensington and Chelsea, I was referring to dividend income from the expansion of the business, not to income from selling 49 per cent. That would be the last thing on my mind.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I am pleased for the hon. Gentleman's sake that he has made that correction, because he seemed to be momentarily off-message.
<P>
<B>Mr. Portillo:</B> I did not hear the pager. Did my hon. Friend?
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> No. It is interesting that the hon. Gentleman is thinking of a role that we do not envisage for the Government—that of fund manager. It is not the job of the state to amass investments in companies just because they provide a good stream of dividends. The state is not very good at running anything commercially. The history books show us that every time the state has tried to accumulate a fund of investments—whether with the National Enterprise Board or the portfolio of nationalised industries in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s—it has been a failure. The right place for a thriving commercial business is in the private sector.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> The Government's objective is not to raise lots of money—that is a by-product. I originally asked the hon. Gentleman whether he had put a value on what that might mean for the public sector, but he has obviously not done so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> No. I would want to take professional advice before putting a firm figure on the value of National Air Traffic Services. I presume that some of the £35 million that the Government have been spending on consultancy fees for that public-private partnership has been spent on taking similar professional advice to that which we always took when privatising industries, for which the Labour party used to lambast us as though we should have worked out the figures on the back of a fag packet. The explanatory memorandum looks as though it was worked out on the back of a fag packet, which the letter seems to confirm.
<P>
I am amused by the consistency that we should now seek in the voting record of the hon. Member for Bath. I shall check the record. We are in favour of separating operation from regulation because it is a good safety principle. However, I shall not look for consistency in his line of attack on such matters and, if he presses the amendment to a Division, we shall not support it.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (Mr. Chris Mullin):</B> I shall not dwell on the fate of the Liberal Democrat hovercraft, even though it was entertaining, or on the fact that the hon. Member for Bath cannot remember which Lobby he went into during any of the previous privatisations, or even on his throwaway line that £100 million over 10 years is not much money—it is where I come from.
<P>
The Liberal Democrats want to spend public money on many good causes, as do we, but choices have to be made. As the right hon. Member for Kensington and Chelsea said, if a stream of private finance is available for some of what we want to do, it makes sense to use it, thereby reserving public money for those projects for which private finance is not available.
<P>
It is not true that the policy introduced under the Bill represents a U-turn. We made it clear in our manifesto that we would seek private sector solutions where appropriate. London Underground was named specifically. My right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister has played a pioneering part in PFls, with which we have had more luck than Conservative party.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Let us clear up the semantic point about whether this is a privatisation. If 51 per cent. of the shares are being transferred to the private sector, the company will be owned in the private sector. If it was privatisation for British Telecom, it is privatisation in this case. If something is a duck because it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, then this is surely privatisation. I am sure that in his previous existence the Minister would have called it that.

<P>

<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> Today, we are going to call it a public-private partnership. It is true that day-to-day operational control will be in the hands of the private sector when the sale has gone through—we make no secret of that. The Government have reserve powers and Government directors will be on the board to protect the Government and the public interest, but the private sector will have operational control.
<P>
<B>Mr. Portillo:</B> Does the Minister believe that the expression ``our air is not for sale'' was an accurate description of a situation in which day-to-day operational control is in the private sector?
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> No, but the Bill accurately reflects what was in the manifesto, and the manifesto said nothing about our air being, or not being, for sale.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robert Syms </B>(Poole): It said nothing.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> It made it clear that we would not hesitate to use private sector solutions where appropriate and we deem such a solution appropriate in this case. I do not think that Opposition Members dispute that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Owen Paterson </B>(North Shropshire): I have a brief question. May we have the Labour Government's definition of a full privatisation?
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I hesitate—[hon. Members: ``Answer''] Well, when 100 per cent. of the shares are sold, that is a full privatisation. I do not think that you, Mr. Gale, would want us, Mr. Gale, to dwell on what was described only a moment ago as semantics.
<P>
I wish to clear up a few points that were raised and then deal with the substantive point about the independent publicly owned company proposed by the Liberal Democrats. First, on the proceeds, a point has popped up several times that we have done our best to explain.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Explain again.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> It is not complicated and I am confident that the hon. Gentleman will be able to grasp the details. Before Christmas, I had an exchange in the House with the hon. Member for North Wiltshire (Mr. Gray) on that point: I made it clear to him—it is on the record for anyone to see—that the £350 million was net of the debt. I agree that the explanatory notes are confusing and inadequate on that matter. However, I do not agree about Lord Macdonald's letter.
<P>
I shall give a clear explanation and hope that we will not have to keep returning to the point. The sale will raise an estimated—one must, for reasons that I am sure members of the Committee will understand, emphasise ``estimated''—£650 million. When the debt is removed from that, because the buyers must finance the debt, £350 million will be left. An estimated £35 million of costs then have to be paid, and we are left with a net estimated gain of around £315 million. I should emphasise that raising that money for the Exchequer is not the main purpose of the exercise. There are many purposes, but one of the main ones is to raise the required £1 billion of investment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster </B>(Bath): I do not wish to score points, but this is such an important issue that we should have a clear statement from the Minister. He says that the explanatory note is ``confusing''. Will he confirm that the explanatory note is wholly wrong? It states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Income from the partial sale of NATS to a strategic partner could raise in the region of £350 million. Against that, NATS has outstanding loans of around £300 million''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Could the Minister confirm that the explanatory note should have said £650 million, not £350 million. That is wholly wrong, not merely confused.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I will go so far as to say that it could have better expressed in the explanatory notes. However, the one that I described is the one that Lord Macdonald described in his letter to the hon. Member for North Essex. I hope that it is now clear to hon. Members—[Interruption.] The word ``net'' features in the letter. I believe that the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster) has a copy.
<P>
I was asked by the hon. Member for Poole (Mr. Syms) whether Shanwick could be expected to open in the spring of 2000. It is on schedule to do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> In 2000?
<P>
<H5>3 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I sorry, I meant 2002. The scale of investment needed means that we shall have to look for private finance sooner rather than later, but we do not anticipate problems.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Kensington and Chelsea asked about foreign ownership. In view of one of his previous incarnations, he will especially appreciate that national security considerations mean that we must look carefully at any bid from any company, but especially from any non-UK company. Whoever buys NATS will be bound by the licence, whether it is a foreign company or a domestic one. If the licence is breached, the company will lose it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> The Minister mentioned the licence. He may be coming to the point, but is that ``the licence'' or is there a regime with a lot of licences?
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> The hon. Gentleman is right that I am coming to the matter of licences, both plural and singular. The Government have taken powers to direct NATS in an emergency and those powers will apply no matter who is the owner. There will be a substantial public stake, there will be Government-appointed directors and there will be various other safeguards. Having said that, there is a possibility of foreign ownership, as would undoubtedly be the case in a free market.
<P>
I do not have the same fear of foreigners as some hon. Members. British shareholders earn substantial assets in other countries, and it is inevitable that foreigners should buy shares in this country, not least in industries that were privatised by the previous Government. What matters is the effectiveness of the regulatory regime. We believe that we have got that right.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I am slightly taken aback by the Minister's incredible complacency about foreign ownership and control. We are not dealing with a factory that makes buttons. We are not even dealing with something that we can buy somewhere else, such as arms or defence equipment, which might be of strategic significance. We are dealing with the organisation that controls our airspace. It seems quite extraordinary that the Government should contemplate that. Would any foreign organisations be ruled out? For example, would a substantially state-owned French organisation be on the list, given that French defence interests have sometimes during the past 50 years been at great variance with ours?
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> If the hon. Gentleman will forgive me, I shall not pick and choose between various hypothetical situations. I merely repeat what I said, which is that national security considerations, which we take very seriously, mean that we must look carefully at all bids, whether they come from British companies or from non-UK companies. Far from being complacent, it is a serious matter, as the hon. Gentleman said. However, as he proposes to sell off 100 per cent., not merely the same proportion as we propose to sell off, he will not find it a problem.
<P>
The hon. Member for Poole asked whether it is one licence or two. We propose one licence now, which will cover the UK and Shanwick, but not other NATS activities at airports, for which competition must continue. Subject to future technological developments, scope for competition may exist later in what are now monopoly services. The plural is included to cover that possibility.
<P>
The hon. Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale asked about staff and management. Our proposals represent no threat to staff, whose skills will obviously continue to be vital. NATS' plans anticipate an increase rather than a decrease in the number of air traffic controllers over the next few years. We have every confidence in the management of NATS as an operator, but we believe that the history of Shanwick shows the need for improved project management and that such skills are most likely to be found in the private sector.
<P>
The amendments raise several substantive issues about IPOC. The hon. Members for Bath and for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale have tabled several amendments designed to change references in the Bill to the operating licence and the licence holder from the plural to the singular. The hon. Member for North Essex has kindly assisted them by picking up in his amendments a couple of points that they missed.
<P>
The amendments pave the way for new clause 3, which would allow NATS to become an independent publicly owned company that can issue bonds to finance its operations. I assume that the new clause replaces new clause 2, which, it was discovered on reflection, had some defects. The new clause contains several features that we propose to introduce, through either the licence or the public-private partnership framework, such as the planning and monitoring arrangements and the stakeholder council. It does not refer to an employee shareholding, which came as rather a surprise, because I had assumed that the Government and the Liberal Democrats were at one in wanting NATS employees to hold a stake in the company to which they have contributed so much.
<P>
The Government have considered public sector solutions for NATS, including the possibility of an IPOC, which, as hon. Members will know, Labour Members have raised, too.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I do not know why that item was left out, but perhaps those involved realised that the employees would be slightly wary of accepting shares in a business of which the Government own the remainder, which would be rather unusual. I do not know of a case in which employee share options have been granted in a 100 per cent. state-owned company. Can the Under-Secretary give an example?
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> The hon. Gentleman may have put his finger on it, but I shall leave the explanation to the hon. Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale.
<P>
The Government considered public sector solutions for NATS, but concluded after much deliberation that public sector status was not the most desirable solution. In considering options for the future of NATS we wanted to achieve several outcomes, which I shall detail in a moment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Syms:</B> Will equal 5 per cent. shares be given to all employees, or will it be adjusted so that the management receives more shares than those who man terminals? Will ex-NATS employees be included? Does such a scheme exist?
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> The details have yet to be worked out, and discussions are being held with employees about that, but we aim to give equal shares to all employees, regardless of their status in the company.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> That means, ``I do not know''.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> The hon. Member for Poole asked whether existing employees will receive equal shares, and I said that they will. I should have thought that that is about as clear as it is possible to be.
<P>
If the hon. Member for North Essex will allow me, I shall list the outcomes that we wanted National Air Traffic Services to achieve. We aimed to release it from Government financial restriction, which is important given that we have to raise £1 billion and that the Chancellor is not likely to write a cheque. We wanted to separate air traffic regulation and service provision, establish a structure of incentives and disciplines to maximise efficiency and give NATS commercial opportunities and the management skills to make best use of them. Our objectives were also to maintain the Government's ability to address public sector interests such as national security and international relationships, allow the taxpayer to share in the success of the company and allow other transport schemes to benefit from a share of the sale's proceeds.
<P>
We could achieve some of our aims through an IPOC, including limited borrowing freedom, but we could not achieve them all through a public sector solution. There would be no proper economic regulation and no real efficiency driver for public sector bodies. Private sector motivation with strong, independent regulation to secure service and safety standards would provide an incentive to keep costs as low as possible.
<P>
As we have discussed, NATS is keen to extend its operations into new markets, and its operational skills should enable it to stand a good chance of success. Commercial freedom is not compatible with public sector status, however, because the Government stand behind NATS financially. NATS has considerable operational strengths, but lacks top-level skills in key areas such as project management and investment and financial management. It would be difficult to bring those qualities into the public sector at all, or to use them well if they were brought in. A public sector solution would not release proceeds to benefit other transport schemes.
<P>
Those are the main reasons why we regrettably had to reject an IPOC, although it was among the solutions that we considered.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> The Minister said that the benefit of the Government's proposals is that there would be an opportunity for other transport schemes to benefit from NATS' success. Will he explain what he meant? Is the implication that revenues generated from the part sale of NATS will be ring-fenced for use inside the transport sector?
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> Yes, that is correct.
<P>
As the hon. Member for North Essex mentioned, the proposed new clause would provide for the issuing of bonds as an alternative means to introduce private capital to NATS. The Government considered that option, but it did not wholly meet the situation's needs. A bond issue would raise capital, but not private capital. However the bonds were structured, the entire sum of any bond issue would add to public borrowing because NATS would still be in the public sector. Getting the investment outwith public sector financial controls is an important consideration, although it is not the only one.
<P>
On all those grounds, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I do not want to detain the Committee for long. The debate on the future structure for NATS, an important aspect of the Bill, has been helpful. From the Minister's response, it is clear that what I sought to establish—that all hon. Members want to meet a series of objectives with their proposals for change—was correct. Although his list of objectives was worded somewhat differently, he can check to see that it is identical to my list.
<P>
We disagree on our interpretation of which way forward meets those objectives most appropriately. I was disappointed that the Minister, in the opening part of his speech, seemed to persist in giving the impression that our proposal would rely on the state for the provision of funding. That is not true. I suspect that many members of the Committee, including some Labour Members, were slightly surprised by his suggestion that the Labour party had not made a U-„turn. He is right to say that there has been no U-„turn between the Labour party's manifesto for the 1997 election and now, but there was a significant U-„turn between the statement being made by his right hon. Friend the Member for Oxford, East (Mr. Smith) in 1996 and the drawing up of the manifesto in 1997. That is the U-turn to which I referred and which many of his hon. Friends will acknowledge has taken place.
<P>
<H5>3.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I found myself in slight difficulty when the right hon. Member for Kensington and Chelsea told me that I was as stupid as he. I have not yet worked out whether I should feel flattered or insulted—no doubt, as our proceedings continue, I shall be able to judge.
<P>
I was also somewhat taken aback by various elements of the speech of the hon. Member for North Essex who, having spent some time castigating the proposals in our amendment, nevertheless stated specifically that it was useful to have our proposals on the table. In that small way, he gave them some welcome—as a staging post for what he was looking for—so I welcome his remark.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I emphasise that it was only a temporary resting point on the way to preparedness for proper privatisation. Does the hon. Gentleman feel, as I do, that we have not have had a sufficient explanation of why more than one licence might be required? I do not think that the Minister gave us anything like a clear answer on that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> No, I was about to come to that point, but before doing so I will take up a couple of others.
<P>
The debate has been helpful in that it has clarified a number of issues and made important statements about others. Most important was the Minister's statement that the explanatory note is wholly inadequate in respect of the proceeds from the sale; it has misled many of us. At least now we understand that the estimate is £650 million, against which the loan of £300 million will be set, and that the explanatory note was wrong.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I do not think that I used that expression: I said that it could have been better.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> If the Minister checks the record I think he will find that he initially said that it was confused, and then used that expression.
<P>
<B>Mr. Portillo indicated assent—</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I am grateful for a sedentary confirmation from the right hon. Gentleman.
<P>
Another important point was certainly new to me, and, as the Minister spoke, I looked around and noted some surprise—albeit welcome surprise—on the faces of hon. Members sitting behind him. I refer to his announcement that the proceeds of sale of NATS will be ring-fenced for use in the transport sector. That is welcome news to many of us. I look forward to hearing whether this has received Treasury approval and whether in due course it comes to pass. That commitment from the Minister is most welcome.
<P>
We have had interesting debates on many issues on which there was a less satisfactory response. The hon. Member for North Essex rightly drew our attention to the issue of plurality of both licences and companies. I agree that we have not had a satisfactory explanation. The explanation appears to be that, for the time being, we intend there to be only one licence and one company, but that we need to retain the plurality because circumstances may change in future.
<P>
We have not been given significant assurances on a key concern about safety. In the gap between sittings I was able to have a productive meeting with representatives of the Airline Group. I do not wish to suggest that it supports my proposal. Nevertheless, the airlines clearly agree with us about safety. They are anxious that the cost of investment through that route may, for example, impact on an organisation's ability to make the investment necessary to maintain and improve safety. They are also anxious about how the investment may be targeted at new ventures or initiatives, thereby starving investment in the safety of UK airspace. That ties in with the point about possible foreign ownership. Guaranteeing the safety of our airspace is the key issue for Committee members, whatever change takes place.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> Assuming we take the PPP route—as seems likely—would the hon. Gentleman prefer a stakeholding from the Airline Group, given the commercial benefits of vertical integration and the group's vested interest in safety and more investment, as opposed to a short-term approach? Does he favour an industry-wide stakeholding as a way forward?
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. However, I hope that he will not be offended if I do not reply.
<P>
Like the Minister, I believe that it is not appropriate to second-guess what bids may be made. Of course, significant benefits may result from that form of integration. Indeed, the Airline Group told me that safety was its number one priority—as it is for Committee members, I suspect—even though ensuring a high-quality level of safety may increase airline costs. It would be inappropriate to judge the best way of progressing until we know what the bid offer and which organisations have come forward.
<P>
Our debate has been interesting and useful. Our questions have not always been clearly answered, and there are disagreements between members of different parties. Many of us would like to return to the matter, bearing in mind the Government's admission that they examined the proposal in detail. To allow for that, I shall beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
However, before doing so, I shall tackle the Minister's question about why we are not debating new clause 3 rather than new clause 2. I could explain that new clause 2 was framed to address employee shareholding, as mentioned by the Minister. I could then say that that would involve the possibility of the matter not remaining in the public sector, so that it would not fit our definition of an IPOC. However, in short, we changed from new clause 2 to new clause 3 because new clause 2 was wrong.

<B>The Chairman:</B> The hon. Gentleman concluded his speech before the Committee's leave to withdraw the amendment was sought. He seemed to be saying that his withdrawal was conditional on the Chairman agreeing to further debate on the subject. He must realise, however, that he is not in a position to strike such bargains.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Gale. Of course, I am not remotely seeking to do that. You will be aware that withdrawing the amendment leaves the opportunity for a similar amendment to be tabled later in our proceedings. I was referring to that and to debates in another place. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 156, in clause 9, page 6, line 10, at end add—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(c) the right of action in respect of negligence by the Secretary of State or the CAA, as the case may be.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> This is the first of many points that I hope to be able to dispense with quickly as we progress through the Bill. The amendments seek clarification that the public bodies—including the Secretary of State—involved in exercising powers and duties under the clause are accountable not only to Parliament but in the courts. Amendment No. 112 would add a new subsection, which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The duty in this section is owed to any party who may be affected by a contravention of it.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Amendment No. 113 would add a further new subsection, which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``A breach of the duty of this section which causes such a person to sustain loss or damage is actionable by him.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That means that if the Secretary of State fails to do his duty and causes someone a loss, he can be brought to account for such loss in the courts.
<P>
Similarly, amendments Nos. 117 and 118 apply the same strictures to the Civil Aviation Authority in respect of its general duty under clause 2. Amendment No. 156 would insert a new subsection (2)(c) in clause 9. I hope that Ministers are listening, as I am now mentioning a clause that is deep into the Bill The clause deals with the breach of duties or conditions. Proposed new subsection (2)(c) refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the right of action in respect of negligence by the Secretary of state or the CAS, as the case may be.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is a clarifying amendment to ensure that failures by the Secretary of State can be taken to the courts. If we can have assurances on those amendments, we can move swiftly on.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Member for North Essex, and I am sure that we can dispose of these matters fairly quickly. His amendment would introduce a provision that was not laid down by the previous Government in the enabling legislation for any of the other public utilities. It sets out that the duty of the Secretary of State under clause 1, and of the CAA under clause 2, is owed to any person sustaining loss or damage as a result of breach of that duty, and that the person can bring an action for such breach.
<P>
However, the purpose of clauses 1 and 2 is to establish a framework for the exercise of the Secretary of State's and the CAA's functions under chapter I of the Bill The appropriate remedy, were the Secretary of State or the CAA to exceed or to fall short of the requirements laid on them, would be judicial review. The amendments would curtail the ability of those affected to challenge the decisions of the Secretary of State or the CAA, as judicial review may not be allowed if other remedies are available.
<P>
The hon. Member for North Essex may realise, on reflection, that that would be undesirable. I know of no other instance in utility regulation of the Secretary of State's or the sector regulator's liability being curtailed in the way proposed by the amendments. I therefore invite the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for his response, but I am still not clear why the amendments would curtail the possibility of judicial review. I am not sure, either, whether judicial review can lead to the payment of damages. Will the Minister explain the position?
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> We have been advised that if any other penalty is included in the Bill, we would lose the possibility of judicial review.
<P>
I am sure that the hon. Member for North Essex will agree that such a remedy should be available to an aggrieved party should the Secretary of State or the Civil Aviation Authority fail in their obligations. If what the hon. Gentleman proposes is such a good idea, the previous Government, when introducing the sale of utilities, would have inserted something similar in their legislation, but they did not—presumably because they received the same advice as me.
<P>
<H5>3.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I am still not clear why other remedies preclude judicial review. Will the hon. Gentleman clarify the advice that he received?
<P>
The system of general non-political regulation set up for utilities in previous privatisations is not being observed in this Bill or in the utilities Bill, which I believe will be published today. The Government use regulation much more as a political tool. For example, we shall find later in the Bill that the rail regulator will be subject to political guidance—the guidance of the Secretary of State. We are dealing with a more political environment.
<P>
It is important that, when regulators or politicians do things that cost people money, people should be able to recover their costs if they were incurred because of the failure of a public authority or the Secretary of State to observe their duties. Will the Minister assure the Committee that the remedy of recovery of loss or of damages remains open to third parties when such a failure has occurred?
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> The point about judicial review is that the court may quash a decision made by the Secretary of State if he or the CAA have been found to has overridden their powers. I do not have advice that enables me to deal with whether compensation will be available. I suggest that the hon. Gentleman withdraws the amendment; I can make inquiries and answer him later. I hope that that will help.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I would be most grateful if the Minister were to do that. I am quite happy for him to write to me and other members of the Committee. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
THE CHAIRMAN, being of the opinion that the principles of the clause and any matters arising thereon had been adequately discussed in the course of debates on the amendments proposed thereto, forthwith put the Question, pursuant to Standing Order No. 607, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
Question accordingly agreed to.

<H4><center>CAA's general duty</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 116, in page 2, line 29, leave out `in the manner it thinks is reasonable', and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`with all reasonable care.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Clause 2 lists the CAA's general duties. Subsection (3) is slightly odd; it seeks to reconcile subsections (1) and (2)—that is, safety vis-à-vis its other duties. Subsection (3 ) states that the CAA must exercise its functions
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``in the manner it thinks is reasonable''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We propose a simple change. We would say: ``with all reasonable care''. We believe that it sounds better—that it better expresses the meaning. I should be interested to hear the Minister's comments.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (Mr. Keith Hill):</B> Subsection (3) requires the CAA to determine a conflict in the application of subsections (1) and (2) in a manner that it thinks is ``reasonable'', having taken account of the preceding subsections' provisions as a whole. The amendment seeks to replace that with a requirement to act with all reasonable care. Before we realised that it was a cosmetic amendment, we thought that the hon. Gentleman might have it in mind that the CAA should not have a degree of discretion when resolving conflicts that might arise because of the differing requirements of the clause. We now discover that the amendment's purpose is simply to make the provision sound better. The amendment requires the CAA to carry out its functions with all reasonable care, which, as we know, it always does. When resolving conflicts, the CAA must, given the facts available to it at the material time, be able to resolve such conflicts in a way that it deems reasonable.
<P>
For those cogent reasons, and because we are not persuaded that it does indeed sound better, I invite the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I thank the Under-Secretary for his comments. It was a probing amendment, to discover whether the Government had thought the matter through. The difficulty of reconciling subsections (1) and (2) remains, but I am sure that the CAA carries out its duties with reasonable care. We believe that the CAA has a legal duty of care and that it should be held to account for any negligence. That is in line with amendments to clause 1, which we withdraw after receiving an assurance about further investigations. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 119, in page 2, line 33, at end add—

<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss amendment No.120, in page 2, line 33, at end add—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(4D) The environmental objectives referred to in subsection (1)(e) above shall only apply if specified by order, which shall be approved by resolution of both Houses of Parliament.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> The amendment stands in the names of my hon. Friends the Members for North Essex, for Poole and for Hexham (Mr. Atkinson).
<P>
I do not want to be a spoilsport, Mr. Gale, but everything that we have said so far may be made redundant by discussions taking place elsewhere. That fact was first drawn to my attention when I had the honour to serve on the Select Committee on European Scrutiny. A document came before the Committee in December 1999—EC 5127/99—about Community recognition of aviation services. It first came to the Committee on 24 February 1999, but it seems that the response time of the Department for the Environment, Transport and the Regions is the same as the human gestation period. The Committee expressed its regret that the Department's reply had taken nine months.
<P>
The Committee asked for a response to the fact that the Commission had argued for air safety agreements with third countries to be based on article 133—about common commercial policy, in which the Community has already exclusive competence—rather than article 80, which is about transport, in which the Community does not yet have exclusive competence. In his reply, the Minister confirmed that the proposal would give the Commission a new competence to decide on behalf of the Community whether to approve agreements made or proposed by member states with third-country organisations. It is also envisaged that the Community will be able to conclude agreements that would supersede member states' bilateral safety arrangements with third countries. It seems that the Government are happy to see the Community acquire that new competence on the basis of article 80, which deals with transport, rather than article 133, which deals with common commercial policy.
<P>
A further point was made by the Committee about the AETR principle—which states that the adoption of internal measures by the Community can give rise to a power to act externally in the area covered by the measures. In this case, the internal measures would be the harmonised EU safety standards annexed to regulation 3922/91.
<P>
The plot gets even darker and more complicated. The European Court of Justice ruled in 1994 that the Community derives exclusive competence from the inclusion of such express provisions in its internal rules. The court said that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``there is nothing in the Treaty which prevents the institutions from arranging, in the common rules laid down by them, concerted action in relation to non-member countries or from prescribing the approach to be taken by the Member States in their external dealings''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There are three grounds in the one document, which was sent back for further comment from the Minister. The Government appear to be content to hand over jurisdiction of our airspace to European competence.
<P>
The matter has been further complicated by another organisation called Eurocontrol. In 1955, the European Civil Aviation Conference was established by the European civil aviation administrations on the initiative of the Council of Europe. In 1996, 33 countries were involved, including all the member states. Eurocontrol, which is an abbreviation for European Organisation for the Safety of Air Navigation, is the international organisation responsible for the detailed technical operation of air traffic control in Europe. It was originally established by a convention, signed in Brussels on 30 December 1960, between Belgium, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Great Britain. The first convention provided for the compulsory ceding of upper airspace of all member states to Eurocontrol. Before the convention even came into force, France and the United Kingdom reclaimed control of their upper airspace, and Germany largely followed suit. In practice, only the Benelux countries and the northern part of Germany accepted the transfer of the control of airspace over 8,000 metres to the air traffic control centre based in Maastricht.
<P>
The European Union comes back into the picture because some Eurocontrol decisions can be taken directly into EU law, under powers delegated by the Council under directive 93/65 adopted on 19 July 1993. Those Eurocontrol standards relate to communication systems, shared use of radar facilities and other minor matters. Because the principle of Eurocontrol decisions being taken into EU law has been conceded through that directive, any further and more significant extension of EU competence will be justified on that basis. That is another element allowing Europe to take over competence in that vital area.
<P>
In 1988, the Commission issued a communication on air traffic system capacity problems. The proposals have since been withdrawn. The matter was examined by the House of Lords European Communities Committee, which doubted whether the Community had the necessary legal competence or expertise to become a full member of Eurocontrol. The Council did not adopt the Commission's 1988 proposals, but regarded multilateral co-operation within the European Civil Aviation Conference as the best way forward. We take that line too, as we believe that collaboration between independent sovereign states is a better approach. The amendment would retain ultimate decision making in the United Kingdom Parliament.
<P>
Since that decision by the House of Lords European Communities Committee, the European Commission has said that articles 71 and 80, together with article 300, would form the legal base for EU membership of Eurocontrol. The EU has applied to join, which could be agreed by Ministers at the meeting on air traffic services in Europe to be held next Friday. That would mean that the EU would effectively dominate Eurocontrol, which now has 28 members, including 15 EU member states.
<P>
There has been a further development. In December, the European Commission published its formal communication entitled, ``The creation of a single European sky'', which perceives EU membership of Eurocontrol as a vital part of the process. Ministers may soon be redundant: much more punchy and ambitious people are attempting to take powers over their remit. Ministers may laugh, but I shall read the document, which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The Community must assume its responsibilities by bringing its management of the airways in line with its economic and political integration. At a time of a single currency, when the Community is embarking on greater and greater co-operation between judiciaries and police forces and initiatives to create a Europe for defence are gaining in ambition, the management of Europe's skies rests on antiquated methods and principles.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Government believe in modernisation. The document continues:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Europe cannot keep the frontiers in the sky that it has managed to eliminate on the ground; it must allow the freedom of movement of persons, goods and services beyond such frontiers . . . the Community shall exercise its competence in all areas where common rules are necessary.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<H5>3.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
That project has the favour of President Prodi and his vice-president. I hesitate to pronounce Spanish when one of my right hon. Friends is here, but I shall have a shot. According to her website, she is called Loyola de Palacio del Valle-Lersundi. She is a most glamorous Spanish lady, whose expertise seems to be in the law and press associations.
<P>
That brings me back to the amendment. What expertise does the EU have in running air traffic control? We have easily the most successful record on air traffic control in the world. We have an extremely good system with a safety record that is second to none. I do not believe that we should hand over responsibility for air traffic control to an organisation that has given us the disasters of the common agricultural policy and common fisheries policy. What are the benefits to this country? Where do the Government stand? It is a bit like a Katyusha rocket, which lets fly about eight different projectiles. There are eight different routes by which the EU could take over competence of our skies, which makes all our discussions today redundant.
<P>
That could also affect third countries. We have agreements with America and there is an expanding market to Asia. What will be their reaction if we lose competence of our own airspace? There is also a powerful defence argument. Half the members of Eurocontrol are not NATO countries, and not all EU members are members of NATO. Where does that leave us on defence and security if we lose control of the medium by which wars are now fought? We all saw that air was the medium in Kosovo, for example. I have asked some detailed questions, but my fundamental one is: what is the Government's policy on control of the air?
<P>
I turn briefly to amendment No. 120 on the environment. Section 5 of the Civil Aviation Act 1992 states clearly that responsibility for environmental matters rests with the CAA, especially with reference to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``noise, vibration, atmospheric pollution or any other cause attributable to the use of aircraft for the purpose of civil aviation.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am aware of the problem, as RAF Shawbury, which is in my constituency, has the tri-forces helicopter training school under the flight path at Manchester airport. I should have thought that that matter should stay firmly within the competence of both Houses of Parliament.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for North Shropshire (Mr. Paterson) on the able way in which he explained a complicated matter, which has an alarmingly simple outcome. The European Union is involved in a back-door manoeuvre to gain legal competence over our air traffic control system, with all its consequent commercial and international security implications.
<P>
When the Prime Minister was Leader of the Opposition, he wrote an article in The Sun that stated that Labour did not believe in signing up to everything that came out of Brussels, contrary to myths peddled by what he described as the Tory lie machine. I was therefore surprised to discover, when I asked the Secretary of State
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``what plans the Government have to give decisions of Eurocontrol direct applicability and direct effect in the United Kingdom'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
that I did not receive a no, but an answer from the Under-Secretary, the hon. Member for Sunderland, South (Mr. Mullin), which read:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Eurocontrol is currently undertaking a legal assessment of the feasibility of its decisions being directly applicable within member states. The UK is participating in this work and the Government will consider carefully the results of this study.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I asked another question, whether
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``it is the Government's policy to support the European Union's application to joint Eurocontrol''?<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The answer was:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The Government support Community membership of Eurocontrol because it is the most appropriate way for the Community to exercise its competence and express its views with regard to air traffic management in Europe.''—[Official Report, 11 November 1999; Vol. 337, c.695-96W.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If the EU becomes a member of Eurocontrol, it will receive exclusive legal competence of not only air traffic control, but aviation safety and, ultimately, the control of landing slots at Heathrow and all the commercial advantages derived from insisting on that. That means that the crown jewels of British civil aviation, especially Heathrow's landing spots, will be pawned in some phoney deal about freedom of the skies between the Commission and the United States. That is exactly what the US wants, because we will not be able to protect the interests of UK aviation, as we have done.

<P>

<B>Mr. Snape:</B> Does the Conservative party object to the principle of Eurocontrol or to the EC's involvement in the business of Eurocontrol? For my benefit, if not for that of my hon. Friends, will he define whether the plot is European or American?
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Britain should be an enthusiastic member of Eurocontrol, which was the policy of the previous Administration. Whenever we were confronted with the question of whether the European Commission or the European Union should take legal competence over civil aviation matters, especially with regard to negotiations with third countries, we declined. We think that it is in Britain's national interests to remain in control of her own airspace, and especially of transatlantic civil aviation negotiations.
<P>
I am in favour of international co-operation and Eurocontrol, but it is not an EU body and its agreements are directly applicable and binding only in international law. That means that the UK can more easily negotiate the obligations that we accept under Eurocontrol. Eurocontrol has done an extremely good job as a wholesaler and is an integral part of the air traffic control system for a large number of countries, not all which are in the EU, as my hon. Friend explained.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> I shall refer to the Rev. Awdry again. My hon. Friend might remember that Bertie Bus did not listen well. I clearly stated that Eurocontrol was set up in December 1960, after the Conservatives won the 1959 election, and we have backed it ever since.
<P>
<B>Mr. Snape:</B> That was before you were born.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> No, it was slightly after that. It is an example of international collaboration between independent sovereign states.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I totally agree with my hon. Friend. The problem with European Union membership of Eurocontrol, to which we are opposed, is that each member state is already a member of Eurocontrol and the only reason why the EU wants to join it is that it will automatically gain the right to negotiate on behalf of all EU nations in Eurocontrol. That means that we will lose our independent voice in Eurocontrol. Here we are, the United Kingdom, the foremost aviation country in the European Union, the third most important aviation country in the world, and we are to give up our independent voice on that most important organisation, which deals primarily with air traffic control, despite the fact that we have the best air traffic control system in the world.
<P>
I know why Ministers may have been seduced into thinking that that is all a terribly good idea. It is all part of the public-private partnership and the growth scenario that they imagine for NATS. The Under-Secretary made it clear that he sees opportunities for British air traffic control in overseas countries and mentioned Europe. I do not think that there is any possibility that we will gain control of French air traffic control. Let us just think about it—is there any possibility of France letting a foreign country take over its air traffic control? No, but we might be mug enough to let the French take over ours.
<P>
<B>Mr. Snape:</B> I should try to resist temptation, but I have to say to the hon. Gentleman that he is giving a pretty muddled speech. May I remind him that, thanks to the activities of the previous Government, the French run—not very well—our commuter railways?
<P>
To return to the point that I was making before the cannonball behind the hon. Gentleman intervened, while accepting that Eurocontrol has been around since 1960, is the hon. Gentleman seriously saying that because the EU seeks to join that organisation, Britain is giving up more control over its own airspace than it already does as a member of it in its own right?
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> That is absolutely the nub of the question. There is a legal precedent for this in EU law. When the EU takes on a responsibility of a member of an international organisation, it automatically acquires, not just the competence for negotiating on behalf of all EU countries within that organisation, such as the World Trade Organisation, but an internal competence. At the moment, therefore, while the law of the skies is governed by international law and the EU does not have any legal competence to make laws and regulations, except in limited circumstances under particular directives, it will suddenly acquire a blanket, exclusive competence to make laws so that the laws we make in this place—the law that we are discussing now—will cease to be relevant to any regulation or directive that it then chooses to pass. Furthermore, because of the nature of the articles under which the powers are taken, it will be done by qualified majority voting.
<P>
That means that at a stroke of the pen, on 27 January—the hon. Member for West Bromwich, East laughs, but is he denying what I am saying? It may be a revelation to him, but we will lose legal authority and control over our own airspace. I remember the former Foreign Secretary, now Lord Hurd, saying how people in this country were getting fed up with the EU interfering in the nooks and crannies of our daily life—well, the very air that we breathe is now going to be taken over. It means that we will no longer have the ability to protect the commercial interests of our national airlines or our national security interests.
<P>
In later clauses, we will discuss the powers of the Secretary of State to suspend the activities of the air traffic control operator and to take over the responsibilities of the CAA, in order to secure national interest in a national emergency or at a time of international tension. However, those clauses will also be subject to directives that can be issued by the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament, which will give the power to the Commission—just as some little veterinary committee in Brussels can suddenly ban our right to sell beef to South Africa, we will suddenly find that some other little committee in Brussels can pass a regulation that removes the right of Ministers to exercise control over our airspace during a time of national emergency. I do not think that the Government have considered the implications of that at all. Some Ministers do not seem to understand the implications of what they are doing.
<P>
<H5>4 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Atkinson </B>(Hexham): Will my hon. Friend explain what effect the measure would have on the distribution of slots at Heathrow airport or Gatwick airport, for example? Presumably, the European air traffic control centre has an influence on aircraft movement and could also influence the disposal of slots.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> That is exactly right, and we know that the Commission has already contested that area, having made several attempts to claim that slots at Heathrow do not belong to the companies concerned. The legal question of who owns the slots is an interesting one, and the Commission has won that argument in the courts. The removal of some British Airways slots during the negotiations on the American Airlines merger came as a shock to the British aviation establishment, which did not realise that the EU had a legal say in who owned slots. The EU fought that matter on the grounds of competition. It will use any means it can to take over and expand competence—and here is a golden opportunity. It may negotiate with the United States on future air traffic agreements, and will surely then take control of the slots at Heathrow. As night follows day, if that goes ahead, the EU will control the law of the skies.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> Is the implication of what the hon. Gentleman is saying that he would have preferred the airlines to own the slots, which would have meant that the public purse had to buy back the slots at a commercial rate if it wanted to change them in the interests of competition? Is that really what he is saying?
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> No. The question of who owns slots is extremely complicated and needs to be approached with great care. I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman has ever visited British Airways and discussed slot allocation and how it has a three-year annual rolling programme that works internationally on the basis of slot allocation, or whether he has discussed with his hon. Friends how fantastically important it is to Britain's national interests to maintain control of the negotiations with the United States because our British airlines are leading world airlines. On the question whether this is a European plot or an American plot—
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> The hon. Gentleman now seems not only to have a preference for the airlines rather than the public owning slots, but to be acting as a spokesperson for British Airways. Surely the primary interest are interests public and competition?
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I totally agree, but the hon. Gentleman is trying to obscure the real issue, which is that our ability to control who comes and goes internationally at Heathrow is a vital national asset. If the hon. Gentleman votes against the amendments, he will vote to hand over that national asset to the EU. The hon. Member for Shipley (Mr. Leslie) is scoffing; perhaps he would like to disprove what I am saying.
<P>
<B>Mr. Christopher Leslie </B>(Shipley): The hon. Gentleman's conspiracy theories, and the wild and phantasmic theories now emanating from the Opposition Front Bench, make me scoff.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin rose—</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> Will my hon. Friend give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I owe it to the hon. Member for West Bromwich, East to return to the plot, but let me deal first with the Shipley scoffing.
<P>
To provide another parallel, UNECE, the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, is the international organisation that negotiates the uniformity of car parts. In a case that involved UNECE, the court established that when the European Community joins an international organisation, it not only acquires the competence to negotiate on behalf of all member states, but assumes exclusive internal competence.
<P>
Eurocontrol has responsibility for aviation safety and traffic management. The European Union already has competence for trade. Incidentally, it seems anomalous that, despite the fact that the EU has exclusive competence for external trade, and negotiates on behalf of all EU countries at the World Trade Organisation, it does not negotiate with third countries about airlines. That is why it chafes at the bit. The EU already has that competence. We have handed over aviation safety and air traffic control. Is the hon. Member for Shipley seriously suggesting that if the EU joins Eurocontrol we shall be able to hold out and that the EU will not be able to claim legal competence for slots, too?
<P>
The development of a federal legal order in Europe involves a process of creeping competence, known as the doctrine of the occupied field. Once the EU has acquired a competence, it cannot give it back. The federal united states of Europe was built on the commerce clause, and the same thing is happening now, in this case by reasonable decisions apparently being offered to member states—

<P>

<B>Mr. Snape:</B> So it is a plot.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Yes, it is.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. It may surprise hon. Members to know that I listen to every word that is said, and enjoy every magical moment. I have been listening carefully to the debate, and I am reaching the conclusion that we are moving off the beaten track in relation to the CAA's general duties and, indeed, to the amendment, which is much more important. May I bring the hon. Gentleman back to the amendment?
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Yes, Mr. Gale.
<P>
I have explained the dangers of accepting that we should be required to comply with any international obligation without a filtration system. The amendments propose that Parliament have the opportunity to second-guess what international obligations others might require us to adopt, by inserting a new clause, clause 4C, which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The international obligations referred to in subsection (l)(d) above shall only apply if specified by order, which shall be approved by resolution of both Houses of Parliament.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That seems a sensible safeguard to prevent international obligations, in European Community law in particular, from taking over the regime that the Bill should establish.
<P>
I can imagine what advice the Under-Secretary, has been given on the matter—
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> Do not look at me.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> So we are to have the pantomime dame for this one. How very appropriate.
<P>
The Under-Secretary, the hon. Member for Streatham (Mr. Hill), may have been advised that the EU obligations that can already be enforced under the directive that my hon. Friend the Member for North Shropshire mentioned might create a conflict between UK law and EC law. What international obligations are currently envisaged in the subsection? What further international obligations will arise, whether applicable or not, as a result of the EU's accession to Eurocontrol next week? It is incumbent on the Minister to explain the purpose of subsection (4) before we move on. My hon. Friend the Member for Poole will want to enlarge on some of the environmental aspects of amendment No. 120.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> Under subsection (1)(d), the Secretary of State will have to inform the CAA of its international obligations. We believe that it is important that Parliament, as well as the CAA, should understand those international obligations. It would be useful if the matter came to both Houses of Parliament to be approved by positive resolution.
<P>
As my hon. Friends the Members for North Shropshire and for North Essex so eloquently put it, there is a change of policy on Eurocontrol in Europe. As we heard, we have signed the treaty for Eurocontrol. Much of the money collected from charges comes through Eurocontrol. It is important that, with the EU joining, Eurocontrol does not become part of the greater European empire in its impact on aerospace policy. Britain has an excellent record in aerospace and air traffic control, but some of the greater European organisations reach for the lowest common denominator rather than the highest. It is our intention that we should still have the safest airspace in Europe.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> Do I correctly understand that the hon. Gentleman would happy to see different airspace regulations in every member state? As planes flew over, they would have to find out which laws applied. Such complexity would not be in the interests of safety. Is it not complete gobbledygook?
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> No, Eurocontrol is based on treaty by sovereign states. The treaty sets out rules and guidelines, and a charging regime from which the air traffic service receives some of its money. Our main worry is that the European Union is not a nation state, which may have an agenda to change the nature of the organisation. That is our principal concern.
<P>
When the Secretary of State informs the CAA of its international obligations, we wish them to be put to Parliament by order, so that all hon. Members are made aware of the important matters raised by my hon. Friends—[Interruption.] Members of the Committee have been treated to a lecture on aerospace policy by someone who knows far more about the subject than most Members of Parliament. It is incumbent on us to be aware of our obligations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> May I help my hon. Friend after that rather inept sedentary intervention? I have found the Eurocontrol website, which clearly states two of its main objectives. The first is:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the development of harmonised safety regulatory objectives and requirements for the ATM system''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The second is:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the reinforcement of cooperation between civil and military authorities''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is what it sets out to do; it has been doing it since 1960.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend.
<P>
Eurocontrol has a charging regime under which the Secretary of State collects and contributes fees. At pages 35 and 36 of the draft licence, mention is made of the payment of fees and Eurocontrol's financial year. It even defines the national contributions that the Secretary of State has to pay. Although our international treaty obligations are in the name of the Secretary of State, I presume that the CAA will still continue to be represented on Eurocontrol, and that the money would go through the CAA and not necessarily through the Secretary of State. I hope that the Minister will elucidate on that matter.
<P>
On the environmental point, the general duties listed in subsection (1) include, at paragraph (e), taking account of
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``any guidance on environmental objectives given to the CAA by the Secretary of State''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Civil Aviation Act 1982 imposes general environmental duties on the CAA. I should be grateful if the Minister would tell us—if not now, by letter—what those environmental objectives are. There is much concern in various parts of the country about aircraft flying over, aircraft noise and the routes used by aircraft. I am sure that paragraph (e) would include environmental advice about noise and nuisance. Will the Minister let us know more clearly what is the Government's policy on the environmental objectives to be given to the CAA by the Secretary of State?
<P>
<H5>4.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the amendments is to allow a short debate on the Secretary of State's advising the CAA in the performance of its general duties, on our international obligations and making them clear to Parliament, and on the environmental objectives, which should be listed because they are not mentioned in the Bill. Indeed, on 11 January, noise and other problems near Gatwick airport were debated in Westminster Hall. Although technology has allowed us to make quieter aircraft, which has improved matters over the years, those other questions are important to many of us in the political process.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> May I extend my thanks to the hon. Member for Poole, who, in the context of a debate about aviation, brought us down to earth with some serious and practical environmental matters? I shall come back to them at the end of my few remarks. Otherwise, we have been wandering through cloud-cuckoo land and the realms of fantasy.
<P>
It may not be entirely welcome to you, Mr. Gale, in your non-chairing, partisan capacity, but I say again, thank God we won the last general election. Had those of my hon. Friends who joined us at that election been Members of Parliament previously, they would have been treated to the same sort of thing that we have been treated to for the past hour, not for days but for months—even for a year over Maastricht. The hon. Member for North Shropshire, a new Member, spoke in the same tradition of that Europhobic mania that lost the Conservative party the general election. Like all other Europhobes, he demonstrates a formidable attention to detail and a total lack of connection with reality.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Is the Minister now prepared to give an assurance that the EU's accession to Eurocontrol does not represent any extension of EU competence, and that the landing slots at Heathrow are not at risk of takeover under EU law?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I shall return to that point in due course. The hon. Gentleman will be perfectly at liberty to raise the matter again if he thinks that he has not received a satisfactory reply.
<P>
If it is a comfort to the hon. Member for North Shropshire, I can tell him that it is absolutely not the Government's intention—he seemed to suggest that it was—to hand control of our airspace to the EU. In the background notes, to which more that one reference has been made, I am described as a moderate pro-European a description that I do not disavow. However, the Government have absolutely no intention of going down that road.
<P>
We heard from the hon. Member for North Shropshire about Mr. Jack, in David Copperfield, who was obsessed with a King Charles' head. He was followed by the hon. Member for North Essex—perhaps there is something about the northern parts of counties—who also displayed the same preoccupation with the King Charles' head of the European Union. It is impossible to understand why the hon. Gentleman imagines that the UK would be likely to prove bigger patsies than France over the ownership of air traffic control. It is a preposterous suggestion. All the anxieties that he described about the accession of the European Union to Eurocontrol seemed to be grossly overegging the pudding. There is no question of our forfeiting control over landing slots at Heathrow, to either Eurocontrol in the immediate future or to the European Union in the foreseeable future; nor is there any proposal in the foreseeable future to extend the EU's competency with regard to Eurocontrol.
<P>
As the hon. Gentleman well knows, the Commission is coming from a long way behind—it is only just about to acquire membership of Eurocontrol. This is a flexing of the muscles. If there are to be any serious changes, that will be a matter for negotiation; it will also be a matter for the House. We have perfectly adequate scrutiny procedures, to which the hon. Member for North Shropshire referred. I find it difficult to imagine a development of such moment as hon. Members described not being subject to much more extensive discussion and debate in this House.
<P>
I offer those assurances, but they have nothing to do with clause 2 because it has nothing to do with the European Union. The key point is that the CAA must have regard to international obligations, however they come to be agreed, and it must be certain what those obligations are. The clause in no way changes the procedures by which obligations are agreed or the safeguards included in those procedures; it simply ensures that the CAA will take account of and pursue any obligations that are laid on it.
<P>
The hon. Member for North Essex asked me to enumerate our international obligations.

<P>

<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I have here an explanatory memorandum issued on 3 November 1999 by Lord Macdonald. It concerns consultation on the communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament regarding the application of Eurocontrol standards. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The Government . . . has some reservations about the justification for the need to adopt EUROCONTROL standards through the use of regulation rather than a directive''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That suggests that Eurocontrol standards are going to be made directly applicable in EU law, so the assurance that the Minister gave the Committee is incorrect on the basis of evidence that the Department has already circulated.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> It is a fact beyond dispute that the United Kingdom is a member of Eurocontrol, but membership of Eurocontrol—even the imminent membership of the European Union—does not imply, as the hon. Gentleman seems to suggest, that we are subject to uncontrolled, un-negotiated direction by the European Union in these matters. He has got it wrong. As I am sure he knows, our primary international obligation, which is relevant to clause 2, is the Chicago convention—specifically article 28, which requires the UK to run an air traffic control service.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman also asked what further obligations I thought might ensue. I am afraid that one of my examples refers to the dreaded Eurocontrol. We think that the CAA will need to take cognisance of possible changes in Eurocontrol charging rules. That is a possibility. It is not an EU takeover, but changes in those charging rules have happened in the past.
<P>
Similarly, our agreement with the Republic of Ireland on the operation of air traffic control in the Shanwick Oceanic region may in future change to a new type of obligation. That is exactly the sort of change to which we may have to adjust under the clause. My briefing note starts with the words, ``We recognise the underlying concerns of the party opposite.'' I have to reject them, however, because the concerns of the Conservative party are grossly exaggerated. Such matters will be subject to negotiation and full-scale discussion in the House and elsewhere.
<P>
The details of our international obligations in aviation and of our environmental objectives are liable to change at the margin. However, parliamentary procedure, especially an affirmative resolution as called for in amendment No. 20, would be too cumbersome a way in which to deal with such matters. It is absolutely not my intention to be discourteous to the Committee or the House, but such a procedure would not improve the effective operational provisions of the clause. Instead, it would make it more difficult for the CAA to discharge its duty with confidence and certainty.
<P>
The hon. Member for Poole asked about the environmental objectives envisaged in the clause. He suggested that, if I could not provide that information today, I let him know in correspondence, and I undertake to write to him in due course. Having made that offer, I ask the hon. Member for North Essex to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for his fulsome assurances, but he will find that they are hostage to fortune. We are discussing an international obligation, which the clause applies directly to the CAA. It will include provisions provided for by the European Community under article 71 of the treaty, which is the legal base for EU accession to Eurocontrol. When the EU joins Eurocontrol, the Eurocontrol convention will become part of EU law. If the hon. Gentleman disagrees with that, I should be delighted to hear why. More important, Eurocontrol secondary law will become EU law in that the Council of the EU will, at the time of the EU's accession to Eurocontrol, put into place a protocol mechanism whereby Eurocontrol secondary law will, as it is made, be automatically transposed into EU law subject to commentology procedure. Thus, Eurocontrol obligations become automatically translated directly into European Community law. It follows the parallel with UNECE that I described earlier.
<P>
If that were not enough, once the European Union has established its competence in aviation, article 80 of the treaty states that:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The Council may, acting by a qualified majority, decide whether, to what extent and by what procedure appropriate provisions may be laid down for sea and air transport.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Majority voting has been covered under what was formerly article 84 of the treaty. I look forward to the Minister having to recant and pay a heavy price for the assurance that he has given the Committee today. I am sure that my hon. Friend the Member for North Shropshire will join me in wanting to press the amendment to a Division.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> I am deeply disappointed by the Minister's response. He drew attention to his chairmanship of the Labour movement for Europe. I was also president of a European organisation, and I am proud to have brought four non-EU nations into its ambit. I have some experience of collaboration at European level, travelling abroad approximately 140 days a year. I find the Minister's cheap jibes lamentable—he will be a push-over for President Prodi and Mrs. Loyola de Palacio del Valle-Lersundi. It was appalling: he did not know what was going on.
<P>
<H5>4.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The document that I read was presented to the European Scrutiny Committee on 24 February. It took nine months for the Department to reply. The reply came from the Under-Secretary, the hon. Member for Sunderland, South (Mr. Mullin), who has kept admirably silent throughout our debate. I went to some trouble to go slowly through the various articles that would give the European Union competence for airpace. Fine intentions are very well, but talking about cloud-cuckoo land is childish. If the European Commission manages to establish that air safety comes under article 133 and not article 80, the game is up. The Under-Secretary, the hon. Member for Streatham (Mr. Hill) can wave his arms in the air and make jokes as long as he likes, but he will have lost game, set and match.
<P>
That is only one issue. I went on to the AETR principle, but the Under-Secretary did not mention that at all. This is not cloud-cuckoo land. The Commission will have the ability to adopt internal measures externally. I could not express the point in simpler language, but the Under-Secretary did not mention it. He failed to mention the court case of 1994 in which the European Court of Justice clearly established:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``there is nothing in the Treaty which prevents the institutions from arranging . . . the . . . rules 1aid down by them''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I shall not rehearse my entire speech: that was the third issue that I raised. I then mentioned Eurocontrol. Two or three articles in the treaty enable the Commission to take over power, but he did not mention that once. I am not giving vent to Europhobia: this is real, live politics now.
<P>
The final point relates to a document entitled, ``The creation of a single European sky''—nothing could be stated more clearly than the title. This is no conspiracy theory. It is clearly stated that the ambition of the President of the European Union and his Vice-President is to establish total control of the European sky. The document states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the Community shall exercise its competence in all areas where common rules are necessary''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is clearly stated that the Community
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``must assume its responsibilities by bringing management of the airways in line with its economic and political integration''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I repeat that this is no Europhobia. It is fact. It is happening now. It will probably happen next Friday.
<P>
We failed to secure a single serious response to any of those points, even though I went to some trouble to set out my case in simple language.
<P>
We have an admirable record in air safety. I regret that some of our European partners do not. I have flown around Europe and used air facilities for 20 years.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The fascinating thing is that the Minister has made it clear that it is not the Government's intention to hand over power to the European Union under European Community law in respect of international obligations on air safety. That demonstrates, not that the Government are part of a conspiracy, but sheer incompetence. They simply do not understand what they are doing. That is how the European Union takes advantage of this country, time and again.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> My hon. Friend makes an admirable point. To be so ignorant of an issue of critical national interest and to dismiss current political actions shows that President Prodi and Vice-President Palacio have got it made. The Government do not realise what is going on and there is to be a powerful drive by the European Commission to establish power and competence in this sector. The only solution is to vote for amendment No. 119.

Our questions about licence or licences related to limiting the Bill, as does amendment No. 7, which would insert ``en route'' in subsection (1).
<P>
Clauses 3 and 4 are important because they provide a mechanism for the economic regulation of the national air traffic service. Will the Minister explain how they interplay, and how the regime will work? Our amendment is probing, designed to elicit more about the Government's thinking.

<P>

<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I can help the hon. Gentleman. The Government intend to license only those air traffic services provided on a monopoly basis. There should be no need for licensing when services are provided by contestable commercial contract—at airports, for example. We are therefore at one with the hon. Member for North Essex in our desire that en route traffic services only should be licensed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Presumably any air traffic control service has a de facto monopoly in the area that it controls. If BAA operates air traffic control services in and around Stansted, how can it be subject to competition apart from that from other airports? I do not understand how competition applies in that instance.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> The matter may become clearer if I continue my explanation. If it does not, perhaps we can return to the drawing board.
<P>
``En route'' is an operational term generally understood by the aviation industry. However, in legal terms, it is an imprecise expression. In fact, it is that portion of the flight between the end of take-off and the initial climb phase to the commencement of the approach and landing phase. The difficulty is that there are no fixed points at which the initial climb ends, the en route part of the flight begins and ends, and the approach begins. In fact, they vary from airport to airport. Even at one airport, they can vary daily for different aircraft, depending on several factors including traffic mix and weather conditions.
<P>
There are good safety reasons why the operational need is for maximum flexibility, and fulfilling that need must not be jeopardised. That is why the Bill does not define ``en route'', and why the Government believe that it would be unhelpful for the Bill to talk about an en route licence.
<P>
Amendment No. 7 would create a criminal offence based on the term ``en route''. In the Government's view, that would be highly undesirable for legal and safety reasons.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> The Minister is right to say that the Bill does not define ``en route'', but the draft licence attempts to describe it within a United Kingdom airport. Presumably, he is happy that the matter be left to the licence regime rather than being in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> Yes, that is the position.
<P>
Amendment No. 130 would mean that only the provision of en route air traffic services could be licensed. As I have explained, the term ``en route'' is imprecise. We must account for the fact that the nature of air traffic services might change, and that developments might lead a Government to reconsider the structure of licensing and granting exemptions. Air traffic services provision is a dynamic activity in every sense of the word, and the regulatory framework that the Bill establishes must be able to respond to change.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman said that his amendment was a probing amendment. I ask him to withdraw it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I thank the Minister for that detailed explanation, and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 121, in page 2, line 40, after `exemption', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`issued by the Secretary of State under section 4 below.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 127, in Clause 4, page 3, line 20, after `order', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`approved by resolution of both House of Parliament'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 128, in clause 4, page 3, line 34, leave out from `exemption' to end of line 36 and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`shall be renewable annually.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No.129, in clause 4, page 3, line 36, at end add—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(4A) Ten days prior to laying an order under subsection (1), the Secretary of State shall publish a justification for such an order.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I hope that the Minister can answer several questions about drafting.
<P>
Amendment No. 121 would improve the Bill's drafting, as it would make it clear that the exemption was
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``issued by the secretary of State under section 4 below.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is not intended to change the meaning, but to clarify it. No doubt the Minister will say that the amendment is superfluous, as that is usually the form, but I have taken advice on the matter and I think that the amendment is valid.
<P>
Amendment No. 127 applies to clause 4 and deals with a more substantive point related to accountability. The exemptions to be issued under the licence regime are significant. It would be a big deal for there to be an operator of air traffic control services without a licence, so the exemption would obviously be a great gift to bestow and represents a considerable power for the Secretary of State to exercise. I understand that he cannot exercise it under the 1982 Act, as the CAA is the regulator. As there is currently no licensing regime, the system of regulation that has grown organically, over the years, under which NATS is part of the CAA, has left the matter unaddressed. The power will effectively transfer to the Secretary of State, so there is a case for making it accountable. The amendment simply suggests that the order to grant an exemption should be
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``approved by resolution of both Houses of Parliament''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I imagine that, on the issue of the initial licence, the Government will suggest a large number of initial orders. There would be a one-and-a-half-hour debate in Committee, and the House of Lords would carry out its scrutiny procedure, which would provide an interesting opportunity to make Lord Macdonald do his job as Minister for Transport and to explain which exemptions would be allowed. That would be the end of it. I should not imagine that issuing an exemption would be a very common occurrence. For that reason, it is perfectly reasonable to ask the Government to allow that extra element of accountability to be applied.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Amendment No. 128 is an alternative. It questions whether exemptions are to be of indeterminate length or of a particular length, and how they can be terminated if an exemption is to be disapplied. Clause 4(4) requires the exemptions to be renewable annually. Why should not an exemption be renewable? Is there no system of checking and performance assessment? What system of performance assessment will there be of exempt air traffic services? How will their safety be monitored and what redress is there to ensure that they maintain the required standards? Obviously I do not denigrate any of the likely candidates for exemption, but they should be properly regulated. The only serious sanction that can be applied is a curtailing of their exemption. What are the arrangements for curtailing an exemption, and would not it be better to have a regularly renewable exemption rather than an exemption that continues for an indeterminate period?
<P>
Amendment No. 129 would add a new subsection—again, this is an accountability point. It requires that:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Ten days prior to laying an order under subsection (1), the Secretary of State shall publish a justification for such an order.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If we are not to get any other concessions on this group of amendments, surely the Minister can give us this one. It simply requires the Secretary of State to publish the justification for providing an exemption. The justification would have to be prepared internally, so, with all due respect to the hon. Member for Shipley, no crippling costs will be associated with the extra publication. I have worked out what the problem is with the hon. Gentleman. Under this Government, anything published has to be so souped up, glossed, photographed and puffed that it is an expensive business. But that is not necessary. A bit of photocopied foolscap will do. [Interruption.] I will allow the hon. Gentleman to use the photocopier or even to put it on the website. That is pretty cheap.
<P>
People should have the opportunity to examine the reasons for which an exemption has been issued so that there can be open government—which is very new Labour—or at least lip service paid to the concept, and people can challenge whether it is appropriate to issue an exemption. I hope that from the riches on his table the Minister might be able to drop a small morsel to the hungry heathen on this side of the Committee and perhaps accept one of the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Portillo:</B> Following directly from what my hon. Friend the Member for North Essex has said, I want to make a point to the Minister about personnel management. My hon. Friend is quite right to say that these are all reasonable amendments. They clearly do not damage the Bill but amplify its meaning. When I was a Minister, I always tried to find an amendment or two proposed by the Opposition that I could allow. What is the harm, after all? Rather as we are advised that unless we allow some deduction from prisoners' tariff sentences, it is difficult to manage people in prisons, so it is with the Opposition: if we are not allowed to win some amendments, it becomes increasingly difficult to remain orderly.
<P>
My second point about personnel management is that, although I cannot see it, I know perfectly well that the Minister's brief says in respect of each amendment ``Resist''. That is the ultimate cliché and it never varies: resist anything from the Opposition. The Under-Secretary of State, the hon. Member for Sunderland, South (Mr. Mullin) will dutifully read from a piece of paper saying ``Resist'' and explain why the Government cannot possibly accept a given amendment. But the Minister who one day says to his civil servants, ``Damn it —I'm going to use my own mind and apply my own judgment. In my judgment, it does no harm to accept this amendment'', will gain the respect of his officials. I have been watching the body language in this Committee and it is clear that the Minister could do with a boost to the respect in which he is held. I am offering him that opportunity.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> My right hon. Friend is putting the Under-Secretary under undue pressure.
<P>
<B>Mr. Portillo:</B> I know what my hon. Friend means. I, too, have been worried about the Minister's robustness or lack of it during his responses to the amendments. There is no disgrace in accepting Opposition amendments. He is a Minister so that he can have control of the Government machine, not the other way round. The respect in which he is held by hon. Members on both sides of the Committee and in official circles will rise when, in a moment, unexpectedly—casting aside the bit of paper that says, ``Resist''—he goes his own way. I look forward to it.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Syms:</B> We know that the Minister will give us a treat, but will he give us an idea of how many exemption orders will be granted? We know that the CAA will have to keep a file, a licence and other bits and pieces, but will that duty be very onerous? Will lots of exemption orders be moved?
<P>
We are trying to understand Government's thinking. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for North Essex—I, too, am not sure that an annual report would necessarily be the right way of proceeding. We are trying to understand how onerous a regime that would be, how many exemption orders will be granted and in how much detail, and whether reasons will be given.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> Let me at them. I am a veteran of the Committee that scrutinised what became the Water Industry Act 1991. Our sittings lasted for about 170 hours, but I do not remember any of the philosophy so touchingly outlined by the right hon. Member for Kensington and Chelsea applying in those days. However, things can only get better. Who could fail to be moved by the touching manner in which the hon. Member for North Essex and, indeed, the right hon. Member for Kensington and Chelsea put their case? I am not a hard man; I shall see what I can do.
<P>
First, the brief. Amendment No. 121 would add specific reference in clause 3(3) to the granting by the Secretary of State of exemptions under clause 4. As drafted, however, the amendment adds nothing to the Bill because clause 4 clearly states that it is the Secretary of State who grants exemptions.
<P>
On amendments Nos. 127 to 129, with the greatest respect to the House, affirmative resolution is a weighty procedure that should be used for similarly weighty matters. In some circumstances, it is only right that Parliament should be asked explicitly to consider an issue and explicitly to give its consent. One example in the Bill is the provisions in clauses 49 and 89, which make it impossible for the Secretary of State to dispose of the special share in the proposed NATS PPP unless he obtains the consent of both Houses. The Government are not, however, convinced that making an exemption order, important as it is to those affected, would fall in that category.
<P>
Nevertheless, Parliament is perfectly entitled to know how the Government intend to use the powers to make the exemptions that they propose. To turn the question on its head, we intend to licence only those air traffic services that are provided on a monopoly basis—in other words, although the words are not used in the Bill, the provision of en route air traffic services. Where competition exists or the risk of monopoly abuse does not apply, there will be no need for licensing for the purposes of economic regulation.
<P>
We intend to grant exemptions to all other providers of air traffic services. As hon. Members will know, the definition of air traffic services in clause 84 is very wide, we intend to exempt providers of air traffic services at airports, flying schools and instructors, people who provide services temporarily in an emergency or for a planned event, aircraft manufacturers providing air traffic control services to aircraft on test flights, and, primarily to avoid doubt, visiting forces and the emergency services whose activities may fall within the scope of clause 84.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Does that include air traffic services provided from the back of a van on the gliding airfield near Nayland, in my constituency? It is an amateur and jovial operation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> To be perfectly honest, I do not have a clue, but I am sure that the hon. Gentleman is not suggesting that we should introduce an affirmative order to deal with that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Will the Under-Secretary give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> If the hon. Gentleman can contain himself for a moment, he might be pleasantly surprised. We are up against the clock.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman suggested that exemptions should be renewed annually. I fully accept the principle that some exemptions should not be indefinite, but I believe that annual renewal would be going too far. Providers are entitled to expect some degree of certainty about whether they will be regulated. Annual renewal would remove that certainty. It would be incompatible with contractual arrangements between airport operators and the companies, including NATS, that provide air traffic services at their airports. It would be equally incompatible with the Conservative party's professed belief in reducing burdens on business. For the sake of completeness, I should add that an exemption will be an exemption from the requirement to hold a licence under the Bill, not from any requirement of the Air Navigation (No. 2) Order 1995.
<P>
I hope that that explanation of the Government's intentions offers reassurance that we will not hand out exemptions willy nilly. Where licensing and economic regulation are the best—or the only—way to protect the interests of users of air traffic services, we shall look to licensing, but we want to regulate where necessary, and exempt where possible, without prejudice to those interests.
<P>
Now we come to the exciting bit. My brief does not say ``Resist'', even though, at times, I thought that I might simply write it in. It says that there is no harm in considering amendment Nos. 121 and 129. We do not think that they will add a great deal, but I am content to consider them. I hope that the Opposition do not have too much of a party on the strength of that. I hope also that it will show them that, as my hon. Friend the Minister of State said at the outset, we have come here in a spirit of co-operation. We are in the market for sensible suggestions, and I agree with the right hon. Member for Kensington and Chelsea that trench warfare can be very debilitating. That is the spirit in which I offer to consider those amendments.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I shall write home to my mother, and report my latest triumph. I think that the Under-Secretary was referring to amendment No. 129.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> Amendments Nos. 121 and 129.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkins:</B> That reflects the Under-Secretary's genuine commitment to open government, which, although it might be churlish to say, differs from that of the normal, run-of-the-mill Minister, none of whom are present. I am grateful to him for his kind words and for the grace with which he delivered his response. Therefore, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Gale. I am a little confused because the Under-Secretary has said that he was running out of time and watching the clock. I notice it is now two minutes past 5. I had understood that we would take a break if we were to carry on beyond 5 o'clock.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am not sure whether that is a point of order for the Chair, but without wishing to reveal too many trade secrets, I think that the agreement was that, in return for not taking a break between 4.30 and 5 o'clock, the Committee would rise promptly and finally for the day at 5.30.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I am grateful to you, Mr. Gale, for providing that information, which shows that those of us in the trenches, to which the Under-Secretary referred, are probably the last to find out what is happening.
<P>
I beg to move amendment No. 124, in page 3, line 6, leave out subsection (6).
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 125, in page 3, line 12, leave out subsection (7).
<P>
No. 126, in page 3, line 16, leave out `in England and Wales or Northern Ireland'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Under amendment No. 24, the phrase, ``managed area'' would be deleted from the clause. It is a probing amendment, designed to discover what the Government mean by that phrase. Some obscurities have arisen because it is not commonly known that aircraft in other countries' air traffic control areas take instructions from United Kingdom air traffic control and vice versa. How does the Bill relate to services that the licence holder provides outside the managed area? How is that legal unless the definition of managed area is clear? The Under-Secretary will understand my confusion about the fact that the managed area must be bigger than the managed area. A lacuna exists, for which no provision is made in the Bill.
<P>
Amendment. No. 125 relates to subsection (7). Under clause 3, it will be an offence to provide air traffic control services without either an exemption or a licence. Subsection (7) specifies the likely sanctions. The person committing such an offence is liable
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding the statutory maximum; on conviction on indictment, to a fine.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Can the Minister say what the fines are likely to be? We are dealing with corporations, so presumably the fine must relate to the size of the corporation. I am not suggesting that British Airways goes around collecting parking tickets, but if the company gets a parking ticket, it matters little, apart from the damage to its public image. If someone small gets a parking ticket, it matters a great deal. I should like the Minister to clarify the nature of the penalties.
<P>
Subsection (3) refers to the way in which proceedings to obtain a conviction might be commenced. They may be started in England and Wales or in Northern Ireland for an offence under the section only by, or on behalf of, the Secretary of State. I am concerned not about the Secretary of State and the CAA but about Scotland, because it is part of the managed area. I do not understand what the interrelationship with Scottish law will be. I should be grateful if the Minister could explain.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I have similar concerns. Subsection (6)(a) states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``air traffic services are to be treated as provided at the place from which they are provided''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That sounds simple but what does it mean and why did it have to be in the Bill?
<P>
Another question arises about the managed area, the definition of which is the United Kingdom and other airspace for which we have international treaty obligations. We know that aircraft will pick up over northern France outside areas where we may have treaty obligations. Issues such as that concern us. Subsection 6(b) refers to services being provided
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``whether or not the aircraft concerned is in that area when they are provided''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Sometimes aircraft in, say, Holland are outside our managed area, but if they move into it there might be a problem. Is the wording couched in these terms to deal with such concerns? We need a little more explanation, especially about subsection (6).
<P>
As my hon. Friend said, subsection (8) provides that proceedings may be started in England and Wales or in Northern Ireland, but not in Scotland. We should be grateful for an explanation from the Minister.

<P>

<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I will do my best to assist with inquiries.
<P>
Managed areas are defined in clause 39(3). It is drawn widely to include the UK and any area outside it in respect of which the UK has undertaken to provide services.
<P>
The hon. Member for North Essex asked me about fines. The statutory maximum fine is £5,000. The fine referred to in subsection (7)(b) is unlimited—the court is not limited by a statutory maximum.
<P>
I can help as regards Scotland. Criminal proceedings in Scotland are commenced by the Lord Advocate, who is a member of the Scottish Executive; they cannot be commenced by anyone else. In the remainder of the UK, criminal proceedings may be started by a private individual.
<P>
Subsection (6)(a) makes it clear that the offence is committed at the place at which the services are provided, not at the place where the aircraft is located. This is necessary to establish the jurisdiction of the UK court to try the offence. Subsection 6(b) makes it clear that the offence is committed even if the aircraft in question is not in UK airspace at the time. Again this is necessary to establish the jurisdiction of the UK court.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> According to subsection (3)(b), an offence is committed at the place where the air traffic control service is provided. Does that mean that the offence is committed by the person speaking into the microphone, even if he or she is outside this country, but providing air traffic control services into this country? Or is it committed by the person providing the radar facility where the signal is received and the instruction issued? The London Area and Terminal Control Centre is in London, but the radar is in Scotland. In future, air traffic control services may be provided from this country to the other side of the world. In such circumstances, where is the air traffic control service deemed to be provided?
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I am afraid that I shall come back to the hon. Gentleman on that. The matter is complex and I cannot give him an answer off the top of my head, so I shall write to him.
<P>
Amendment No. 124 would delete clause 3(6) from the Bill. It would make a successful prosecution virtually impossible, so I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw it.
<P>
Amendment No. 125 would delete from the Bill the penalty for the offence of providing air traffic services in a relation to a managed area. The Government believe it necessary to create a criminal offence to underpin the licensing regime, and it is vital that people likely to be affected know when an action becomes an offence. However, as I have said, there must be certainty about what constitutes the offence and the penalty for committing it. It is standard practice for legislation that creates an offence to specify what the maximum penalty should be. An offence without a penalty is not much of a deterrent. An offence without any limit on penalties leaves the courts without guidance. Therefore, the amendment is not workable, so—despite the previous air of consensus—I must ask the hon. Gentleman not to press it.
<P>
Amendment No. 126 deals with the Lord Advocate commencing procedures in Scotland. I have already tackled that matter, so I ask the hon. Gentleman not to press the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I am grateful for the Minister's explanation and beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Clause 3 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
Clause 4 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 5</center></H4>
<H4><center>Licences: general</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 131, in page 4, line 2, leave out subsection (4).
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, we may discuss Government amendments Nos. 32 and 33.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Our amendment is probing. It would delete subsection (4), which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``A licence is not valid unless it is granted to a company which is limited by shares and formed and registered under the Companies Act 1985 or the Companies (Northern Ireland) Order 1986.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is hard to imagine that any person or organisation would want to take on the obligations of an air traffic control licence. However, what is the intention behind the subsection? Which PPP companies are interested in bidding for the licence? There have been rumours, but the Government have made no public statement. It is only fair that we should have that information. The Minister has not denied that foreign companies may be involved. He has also said that such companies, like UK companies, must be treated on their merits. Has he considered the option of a bid from the management, or has the management been encouraged to make its own bid rather than seek the assistance of a trade investor?
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
During the closing stages of Second Reading, the Under-Secretary, the hon. Member for Streatham (Mr. Hill), gave the assurance that the bidding company could be a non-profit organisation. However, such an organisation is usually either a mutual company or a company that is limited by guarantee, which would not qualify under the clause. I should be grateful if the Minister could clarify the position and explain why those other options were considered and dismissed—if, indeed, they have been dismissed?
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> May I move amendments No. 32 and 33?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The Minister may speak to those two amendments, but they will be moved formally in due course.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I am sorry to say that word ``Resist'' features in my brief on amendment No. 131. At least a letter will not have to be sent home to mum about that.
<P>
The hon. Member for North Essex asked me to name the interested companies, but I am sure that he realises that I cannot possibly do so at present. No doubt, we shall know their names in due course. He asked to what offers the Government would be open. We will be open to any reasonable offers, including ones from the management and the consortium of the airlines. All sorts of possibilities have been mentioned. I do not rule any in, or any out, at this stage. It is far too early to do that. I repeat the assurance about bids from non-profit-making organisations made some time ago by my hon. Friend, the Under-Secretary.
<P>
The Government seek to clarify and broaden the scope of clause 5(4) by allowing a company formed and registered under legislation preceding the Companies Act 1985 to hold a valid licence. The Opposition's amendment would remove the requirement that the licence holder be a company formed and registered under the 1985 Act or the Companies (Northern Ireland) Order 1986. I accept that clause 5(4), as drafted, is incorrect, which is why the Government are proposing to amend it. In our view, the provision is essential.
<P>
If we had a licence holder that was not a company formed and registered under the Companies Act 1985 or predecessor Acts, we could not ensure the effective enforcement of the special administration procedure under clauses 26 to 33, in the highly unlikely event of such a need ever arising. If the licence holder became insolvent or was in serious contravention of a duty under clause 8, prompt action would be needed to ensure the safe continuation of the provision of air traffic services and the United Kingdom's continued compliance with its international obligations.
<P>
Clause 5(4) is not in the Bill to rule out a non-United Kingdom licence holder. The Government are well aware of their obligations in that respect, as they are well aware of their duty to protect the public interest and national security. The purpose of the provision is to underpin the special administration regime. It is a crucial provision and I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I am a little confused because I thought that the Minister would deal also with the Government's amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I think that that comes next, does it not, Mr. Gale?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The Minister is entitled to speak to his own amendments, but they will be called formally when we come to them on the amendment paper. If he wishes to speak to them, he should do so now.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> As I explained, we accept that clause 5(4) was drafted incorrectly and that the purpose of the amendments is to correct that mistake. It is not a big matter. However, it is not a good idea to eliminate it altogether, which why I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I accept what the Minister said, and I am grateful for his explanation. However, even under the clause as amended by the Government amendments, the company holding the licence would have to be a limited company. Am I right that would be the effect of subsection (4) as amended?
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> Yes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I am grateful to the Minister. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I beg to move amendment no. 132, in page 4, line 8, leave out subsection (6) and insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(6) Neither a licence nor the beneficial ownership of a licence may be transferred.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We are trying to find out what security there is in the granting of a licence. The definition of ``control'' has been taken from section 840 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``in relation to a body corporate . . . the power of a person to secure<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) by means of the holding of shares or the possession of voting power in or in relation to that or any other body corporate; or<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(b) by virtue of any powers conferred by the articles of association or other document regulating that or any other body corporate, that the affairs of the first-mentioned body corporate are conducted in accordance with the wishes of that person''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In plainer language, we are concerned with the ultimate day-to-day control of a company. Change of control would catch someone who bought control of ``LicenceCo'', or the holding company of ``LicenceCo''—[Interruption.]

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I know that we are nearing the end of the day, but we must be able to hear the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> As it would clearly be a material change in the nature of the provision of air traffic services in the united Kingdom, a change in the day-to-day control would obviously be a matter of public interest. The Bill would not catch ``LicenceCo'' being transferred to A Ltd, or B Ltd where both were owned by C Ltd, as ultimate control would remain with C Ltd, The Secretary of State would not have granted the licence in the first place if he was not satisfied that C Ltd was acceptable as the ultimate controller of A Ltd. Indeed, the Secretary of State would be held accountable for that decision.
<P>
I have to admit that that brief was written by a lawyer. It is clearly better drafted than the Bill, which would allow a licence to be vested in ``LicenceCo'' but permit the ownership of that company to vary widely. The amendment would provide a better lock against that happening. I should be interested in the Minister's answer. He may like to reflect on what I have read into the record and give an answer in writing.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I recognise that amendment No. 132 was proposed in the right spirit and with the intention of strengthening the clause that prohibits the transfer of a licence. I have every sympathy with that intent. Unfortunately, the amendment would not achieve what is intended. ``Beneficial ownership'' is a legal concept in relation to property law. However, it is meaningless in the context of the licence that we are discussing today. The licence does not convey any property rights, so the concept of beneficial ownership would be irrelevant.
<P>
I am sorry to appear dismissive of an amendment that was proposed in such a positive spirit, but I ask the hon. Gentleman to accept that the existing provision does the job. The licence holder may not transfer the licence. Provisions in the licence itself would provide for its revocation in the event of a change of ownership. I humbly suggest that the amendment is unnecessary and invite the hon. Gentleman to withdraw it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I thank the Minister for his answer. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

Clause 5, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.
