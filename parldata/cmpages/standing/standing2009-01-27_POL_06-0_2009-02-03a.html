<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020369000398"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport (Jim
Fitzpatrick):</b> Will the hon. Lady give way on that
point?</div><a name="09020369000024"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020369000399"></a>Miss
Kirkbride:</b> By all
means.</div><a name="09020369000025"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020369000400"></a>Jim
Fitzpatrick:</b> I thank the hon. Lady for giving way. She
raised a small point in her comments before we broke that niggled me at
lunchtime. She referred to some Welsh forces&#146; obsession with
dealing with speed. I know what point she was trying to make, but does
she agree that when investigations show that speed was clearly a
contributory factor in the deaths of 700 people in 2007, resources must
be directed to ensure that we save lives by restricting something that
can be
restricted?</div><a name="09020369000026"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020369000401"></a>Miss
Kirkbride:</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman for that point. I am
glad that he has got it off his chest, if it was troubling him during
lunch. I have a great deal of sympathy with his point. My own family
has experience of a fatal road traffic accident, so I know only too
well how heartbreaking they can be. I am glad to put it on record that
resources certainly need to be applied to traffic and speeding
enforcement.</div>
<a name="09020369000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">My point, to
reprise quickly what I was saying, is that there is a democratic
deficit in police representation of all the views in the community. My
concern involves exactly such cases as when a chief constable has a bee
in his or her bonnet about a particular issue. Accountability from the
public&#146;s point of view as to whether that is the correct
priority is somewhat unclear. It must go through the police authority,
which may be happy with how precious, scarce resources are being spent.
Despite the speech made by the hon. Member for Chesterfield, who called
for communities to be allowed to raise as much of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column175" />Column number: 175</div>their own resources as they see fit, resources will always be limited,
because the public have only a certain appetite for paying taxes and
have other priorities. Policing must live within its means and decide
on its priorities. The question is, how do the public make those
priorities their priorities, and what accountability is there in
respect of the police having to ensure that that
happens?</div><a name="09020369000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
all parties have agreed that there is a problem of democracy and
representation, it is disappointing that the Government have come up
with a damp squib after they had suggested that they would do something
more exciting. To be fair to the Government, I agree that it is a
difficult and complicated area of public services to reform and that we
need to proceed with caution. Democracy is highly desirable, but it
could have some malign consequences if reform does not proceed as we
would like it
to.</div><a name="09020369000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
of the questions brought out in this morning&#146;s debate was,
&#147;If we were to democratise police accountability, how would we
organise that?&#148;. The first problem is the police force area. In
some places it is very distinct and clear-cut: it is a county force,
there is already a county council, everyone sees a community of
interest and it becomes much clearer to administer. In my constituency,
it crosses county boundaries. It is not obvious that people in
Bromsgrove have a community of interest with other parts of the West
Mercia force area. It is therefore more difficult to find one person
who can speak for everybody and in whom everybody has
confidence.</div>
<a name="09020369000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">Similarly,
that one person who might seem to represent a police force area could,
in foreseeable circumstances, be encouraged to inflame incidents to
attract votes come the all-important election. That leads to the
question of when the elections should be. Should they be tied to other
local authority elections? What turnout would we expect, hope or desire
to achieve? Were they to be stand-alone elections, turnout would be a
worry to anyone interested in democracy, because there is often a
disappointing turnout at local authority elections and occasionally
even at general elections. If the public had not bought into the idea
of electing their police representatives, would they have a proper
mandate? How would one try to increase the
turnout?</div><a name="09020369000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those
are difficult issues. I was interested in the arguments advanced by the
hon. Member for Chesterfield. I am sure that he will not be surprised
to learn that I do not agree with all of them, but I did think that
there was something in the idea of an elected representative
representing a smaller area, where there is a more obvious community of
interest. Having more than one elected representative in control of a
police area reduces the prospects of what the hon. Member for
Stourbridge talked about&#151;a single BNP candidate, who has been
elected and therefore is sacrosanct, taking charge of one of our
primary police forces. That would be an area of interest if we were to
proceed down the democratic road. It is disappointing that the
Government did not have more ideas. As I said, I sympathise with the
reasons why. We might all have to wait for a general election to hear
more elucidation from all sides of what we might do with police
forces.</div><a name="09020369000032"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09020369000402"></a><b class="B">Mrs.
Nadine Dorries</b> (Mid-Bedfordshire) (Con): I speak as a
representative of a constituency that is ranked next to bottom in a
national rating of forces, so it will come as no surprise to the
Minister that constituents 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column176" />Column number: 176</div>in Bedfordshire feel very strongly about this issue. We do not like the
fact that our police force came next to bottom, in terms of all its
rankings, in the UK. The one thing that disappointed me more was that
when the chief constable was held to account for the reasons why we had
come next to bottom, there was nothing but total support from the
police authority for both the chief constable and the force. There was
no questioning of why we were in that position, just closed ranks and
total support of the chief
constable.</div><a name="09020369000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
clause 1, we have missed a golden opportunity to allow people, and
particularly my constituents in Bedfordshire, to pass judgment on the
person whom they see running their police force and delivering policing
in their area. When people go to the ballot box, they know exactly
which MP they are voting for. If the incumbent MP is a bad MP, people
will go to the ballot box and vote them out. Exactly the same would
happen if we had an elected chief constable as opposed to an
authority.</div><a name="09020369000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
do not think that the residents of any of our constituencies would
flock to vote for a police authority. I do see them flocking to vote
for the person who, along with their MP and councillors, be it a
unitary authority, county council, district council or whatever, will
make a difference to how efforts to tackle crime are delivered on their
streets. Surely if we had one person, a directly elected chief
constable, which the Green Paper hinted at but which the Bill fails to
provide, policing budgets would also be far more assiduously examined
by the person responsible for delivering the services that the budget
was to pay for. I am not sure that an authority would have the same
attention to detail as there would be under an elected chief
constable.</div><a name="09020369000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will
an authority be accountable in the same way? There will be no members
of the public on it, so it will be a quango. They will all be elected
by the senior appointments panel. Will the authority be accountable to
the people and, if so, in what way? I ask that because I do not see
anyone who wants to make an issue of policing on their streets using
this route to do that. They will do it in exactly the same way as
residents do it at the moment. They will come to their MP or go to
their councillor. They will not think of going to their authority
because it will not be giving regard to their views. The regard will be
given to the elected person&#151;the MP or the councillors. I fail to
see how this clause takes note of anyone who lives in 16 Russell street
in Bedfordshire. I cannot see how it takes account of that person being
concerned about the fact that knife crime on their street has gone up
over the past 12 months.</div>
<a name="09020369000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">How will
people&#146;s views be taken account of in this clause? Will people
have the opportunity to go and stand in front of the people who should
have regard to their views? Will the general public have a chance? Will
all my residents in Russell street be able to go and stand in front of
this authority and say, &#147;Take regard of our views because we
want more visible policing on our streets. We do not want you bringing
speed cameras to the end of our street when there are knife crimes
taking place there.&#148; Is that what the clause will do? I fail to
see how it will. We have missed a golden opportunity here
and I fail to see why the Government have not grasped it.</div>
<a name="09020369000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">When I saw
the Green Paper, I could envisage the voting booths. I could see a
voting ballot with the councillors, with the MP and the directly
elected chief 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column177" />Column number: 177</div>constable. Everyone knows who my chief constable is and one of the
reasons for that is that our police force performs so badly. People
have no regard to his views at the moment and I cannot see how this
clause will change that. At the moment, our chief constable is
protected by the police authority and the general public can only go to
councillors or the MP. Where does the clause change that? Where does it
change the route by which the general public can go to change this
particular disregard? Where does that
apply?</div><a name="09020369000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
of the reasons that we have been given is that if any other method, or
mechanism, were in place, it could politicise the police. The police
are politicised; every one of us was lobbied about 42-day detention.
Every one of was lobbied over various other issues by our local police.
The police have their own representatives who lobby us, politicise the
issues and come to speak to us. We want democracy, not politicisation.
We want our police to be accountable. They are politicised anyway, so
if the Minister&#146;s response is that we do not want to politicise
the police force, what does he think about the fact that the police
came here to lobby us on 42 days? Is that not politicisation? My police
came to lobby me over the fact that they were one of the worst police
forces in the country and about what is happening in their police
force. Are they not politicising the issue by involving me in it? They
are already politicised; we want to make them less politicised, more
independent, less accountable to us and more accountable to the
individual that people may get the chance to vote for to represent
their particular views in their area.</div>
<a name="09020369000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am sad that
this clause is going to stand. I hope that the views of the people will
be known through the media and all Members of the House when the Bill
comes to its final stages. It is a golden opportunity missed and I fail
to understand why the Minister has done
that.</div>
<a name="09020369000040"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09020369000403"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Ian Cawsey</b> (Brigg and Goole) (Lab): I was not going to
speak in the debate, but I was sparked into doing so by the last
contribution. I mentioned to the Committee earlier on that I chaired a
police authority for four years before coming to the House. People
should be cautious about running down the road of directly electing the
chief of police.</div>
<a name="09020369000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">I pray in aid
just two simple points. When I chaired my police authority, the chief
constable was a chap called Tony Leonard. He was an extremely good
chief constable and is now retired. When he came to our area, one of
the things he did was to discover that there was a practice going on in
our force area&#151;it was going on in lots of other force areas as
well&#151;which was to pretend that they were solving crimes that
they were not. They were getting police officers to go around jails to
persuade already convicted people to cough up to crimes that they
almost certainly had not committed, in order to make the figures look
better. Our chief constable thought that that was wrong and that we
should record the crimes that people report and then the ones that are
solved.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"></b><a name="09020369000404"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Simon Burns</b> (West Chelmsford) (Con): I am intrigued by
that. What happened when the prisoners did&#151;to use the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s phrase&#151;&#147;cough up&#148;? 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column178" />Column number: 178</div>Were they then taken to court, and, if they were, what incentive was
there for them to cough up? If they were not taken to court, on what
legal basis were they not taken to court, having admitted to committing
a
crime?</div><a name="09020369000043"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020369000405"></a>Mr.
Cawsey:</b> They were certainly not taken to
court&#151;quite the reverse. I think they were encouraged to believe
that their life in prison might be better if they did cough up. More to
the point, the crimes were written off as solved crimes; victims were
told they had been solved, and they were no longer on the books as
unresolved. This is a common practice across the country; it is not
just happening in my
area.</div><a name="09020369000044"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020369000406"></a>Mr.
Burns:</b> Can the hon. Gentleman explain under what legal
basis such people were not taken to court if they coughed
up?</div><a name="09020369000045"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020369000407"></a>Mr.
Cawsey:</b> All those things are a matter for the Crown
Prosecution Service. It is not at all unusual for someone to be
prosecuted for one crime, and lots of others to be taken into
consideration. It does not necessarily change the sentence.</div>
<a name="09020369000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">Irrespective
of the mechanisms, the point is that it was a dishonest practice
employed so that police forces could put out better figures on crime
than was the reality. Do not tell me that once bosses are been elected,
they are not going to start to bend in the wind under those pressures
when elections are close, because they
will.</div>
<a name="09020369000047"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020369000408"></a>Mrs.
Dorries:</b> Does the hon. Gentleman realise that, if there
were a directly elected police commissioner, residents would have the
ability to choose the kind of policing that they wanted on their
streets? Policing would be delivered in a much more diverse and locally
required way. There would not be any need to go around getting
prisoners to cough up for things they had not done, because such
statistics would not be the basis of people&#146;s votes when
directly electing the chief commissioner. They would be voting on the
basis of how safe their streets were, and how safe they felt, not on
statistics.</div><a name="09020369000048"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020369000409"></a>Mr.
Cawsey:</b> Much as I like the hon. Lady, I think that is an
extremely naïve view. It also implies that crime and disorder in
a neighbourhood are all just about the police, which they most
certainly are not. The way to get good crime reduction in an area is
through partnerships, in which the police are only one partner. I agree
in this regard: it is about what local people do in their
neighbourhoods in conjunction with the people who actually deal with
crime. The idea that only police deal with crime is nonsense. To blame
the police for crime is like blaming an umbrella for the rain. They are
only one of the partners in this.</div>
<a name="09020369000049"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020369000410"></a>Mrs.
Dorries:</b> I like the hon. Gentleman him very much, too. I
grew up on a very rough council estate in Liverpool and I assure him
that, at the end of almost every street in my estate, there was a blue
and white police car. We did not dare to misbehave: if we did, we quite
often got a belt in the bizzie. But they were ever-present and the
high-level, visible policing on our streets acted as a deterrent that
meant that we as kids 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column179" />Column number: 179</div>owned the streets we played in, not the criminals. If we had somebody
accountable, residents would have that power to reclaim the streets for
themselves and their children, because they would be able to demand
high-level, visible policing. It would make a huge
difference.</div><a name="09020369000050"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020369000411"></a>Mr.
Cawsey:</b> The hon. Lady should, if she can access the
records, look at the number of calls to the police for service in the
days when she was a young girl, compared with the situation now, when
she is a mature lady. I think she will see that there has been a
significant change, and it is those sorts of demands on police which
have led to changes in the way they do their jobs. I do not disagree
with her about accountability, but am simply saying that if the top man
is elected personally, the grubby electoral process will have its
effect. We will see the sorts of practices that brave chief constables
like Tony Leonard kicked out of the system. When Humberside&#146;s
figures came out, they were right down at the bottom, because they
stopped counting all the crimes they previously wrote off. He was
castigated for that, but he was the one who was doing it honestly. Do
we really want to return to a time when all the incentives were
perverse?</div><a name="09020369000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
once had the great honour of going out in America with the
International Association of Chiefs of Police, and meeting lots of
police officers there. They have elected chiefs of police there. When
we spoke to police officers at a lower rank than commissioner, I can
say that they all, to a person, said, &#147;Why do we have to be
involved in a system in which if we want to go higher than
lieutenant&#148;&#151;I think it is lieutenant in
America&#151;&#147;we have to become politicians? That is wrong; we
are professionals who do a professional job, and it is not for us to
enter the world of politics. That is for politicians. We should do our
job professionally and under the accountability of politicians, but not
as
politicians.&#148;</div><a name="09020369000052"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09020369000412"></a><b class="B">Mr.
David Ruffley</b> (Bury St. Edmunds) (Con): I want to ensure
that the hon. Gentleman is clear that the policy of Her
Majesty&#146;s Opposition is not for the election of a sworn officer
or of a chief constable&#151;<i class="I">[Interruption.]</i> If he can contain
himself, in his sedentary position, I will explain. Some Back Benchers
and Opposition Members have said that that should be the case,
following the pure American model, but that is not official
Conservative party policy. Our view is that there should be a lay
commissioner who is not a sworn officer. We are not in the business of
electing sworn officers. I wanted to make that clear, and I would be
grateful if he acknowledged that he is clear on
that.</div>

relevant.</div><a name="09020369000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that the Committee will bear it in mind that it is easy to get
sucked down the route of greater accountability and more elected posts,
but that the police provide an important service to all our communities
and what they do deserves all our support. We need to find ways of
making them accountable without having the perverse incentives that end
up giving us dishonest figures. Such figures might make us feel better,
but the reality on the streets would be much
worse.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020369000414"></a>The
Minister for Security, Counter-Terrorism, Crime and Policing
(Mr. Vernon Coaker):</b> May I welcome you to the
Chair, Mr. Bayley? It is the first time that you have
chaired the Committee&#146;s formal proceedings, and I am sure that
we all look forward to serving under
you.</div><a name="09020369000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
debate has been interesting and I must say to all who have taken part,
including Opposition Members and my hon. Friends, that it has been good
and brought several relevant issues to the fore. There is no one on
this Committee, in this Parliament or outside, who is not reflecting on
what we need to do to improve the accountability of police officers and
on how to ensure that the public have an effective and informed voice
in trying to influence how the police operate. The police are also
reflecting on that. If one goes to different police forces, one will
see that they are trying all sorts of different ways of involving the
public, through face-to-face meetings, more leaflets, the internet,
neighbourhood policing and mobile police stations. They have longer
opening hours at police offices, make greater use of civilians and go
into schools. All those things are going on as the police strive to
give to policing the public face that people want, and try to ensure
that people feel that there is a proper response when they contact the
police.</div>
<a name="09020369000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Bury St. Edmunds challenged me on an issue on which there is
real disagreement, but he knows that there are difficulties with all
the various models. One reason why he knows that is because his hon.
Friend the hon. Member for Bromsgrove has said that she sees why the
Government are acting with caution, and that she is worried about some
issues in respect of her Front Bench. The hon. Member for
Mid-Bedfordshire showed a much more robust and dynamic desire and
passion for directly elected commissioners. That is why the hon. Member
for Bury St Edmunds had to intervene to clarify that that is not
official Conservative policy, which is for a lay commissioner, albeit
elected, and for the abolition of police authorities. Conservative
policy is not for an elected police chief who would have operational
control, whereas the hon. Member for Mid-Bedfordshire appeared to be
going down that
route.</div><a name="09020369000058"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020369000415"></a>Mrs.

<a name="09020369000059"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020369000416"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> The hon. Lady is nodding, so that is clearly what
she wants. I have problems with the idea of an elected lay
commissioner, so I think that the idea of having an elected police
chief would be fraught with difficulty in this country, as do her
Front-Bench colleagues. That is why her colleague was quick to
intervene.</div><a name="09020369000060"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020369000417"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> To be clear, I hope that the hon. Gentleman is
not criticising a Bank-Bench Member, from any part of the House, for
expressing interesting views. Labour Back-Bench Members, too, might
legitimately back the New Local Government Network and Local Government
Association proposition. It has not been mentioned today, but is a
valid take on enhanced accountability: it would match basic command
unit areas with second-tier local district and borough councils and
allow elected councillors to hire and fire BCU commanders. That is
another model of which I urge him to take account. It is yet another
contribution to a very wide-ranging and variegated
debate.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column181" />Column number: 181</div><a name="09020369000061"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020369000418"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> The hon. Gentleman is right to put that on the
record. A variety of views are held across Parliament and within
parties. However, is that not a good reason for the Government to take
stock and consider the way forward, rather than rush headlong towards
the direct election of crime and policing representatives, which we
originally proposed? Given the difference of views and the fact that no
consensus exists across the political spectrum, is not the mature and
responsible course not to continue to charge towards a road crash, but
to consider ways of improving accountability and to take stock and
reflect more calmly and rationally on how to take the debate forward?
We withdrew the proposals in the Bill so that we can do
that.</div><a name="09020369000062"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09020369000419"></a><b class="B">Lynda
Waltho</b> (Stourbridge) (Lab): Following on from that point
and to some extent a discussion this morning, will my hon. Friend
describe, so that I can tell my constituents, what it would be like to
have a BNP chief constable, lay commissioner, or whatever? We should
bear in mind that Nick Griffin said on &#147;Newsnight&#148;
recently:</div><a name="09020369000328"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;You
can&#146;t possibly separate the hard drugs trade from the question
of Islam and particularly Pakistani
immigration&#148;.</div><a name="09020369000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will
my hon. Friend describe the effect of such thoughts and background on
policing policy in the west midlands? It would be
horrendous.</div><a name="09020369000064"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020369000420"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> My hon. Friend is right to point out the danger of
such a person becoming either a lay commissioner or a more directly
involved commissioner responsible for an entire police force. Nobody
wants a BNP candidate elected to office. I do not want to negate the
serious point being made, but we are talking about providing the
opportunity for BNP candidates to be elected to such positions. We can
all recognise the danger of that. As law makers and legislators, we
have a responsibility to decide whether to take that into account when
developing laws. One can only begin to imagine the consequences, not
only for the various communities in the west midlands, where my hon.
Friend&#146;s constituency is situated, but for London and all the
other areas of the country. It would be
catastrophic.</div><a name="09020369000065"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020369000421"></a>Mrs.
Dorries:</b> For the record, my Front-Bench colleagues were
well aware of my views. However, I support their position on lay
commissioners. Nobody wants to see a BNP commissioner or even a
councillor, but, in effect, the Minister is saying that we cannot trust
the people to
vote.</div><a name="09020369000066"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020369000422"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> That is where we start to get into difficulty. The
hon. Lady makes a reasonable point about trusting the electorate, but
we have to be extremely careful when we are talking about the police.
Let me show how careful we have to
be.</div><a name="09020369000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">Conservative
Front Benchers are concerned about the problem, so they have come up
with proposals to overcome it. Suppose an extremist is elected, or
somebody who wants to ban road humps&#151;every one of us could think
not only of extreme politicians but particular issues. Members can
imagine what would happen if debate on such an issue happened to
coincide with the election of a police chief. I do not know what the
question is in Bedfordshire&#151;perhaps it is to ban farm 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column182" />Column number: 182</div>animals walking down the road. In Durham, it could be to ban lap
dancing, and so on. At a particular time, someone could get elected on
that single issue. The more extreme case involves the BNP. That is a
real issue, and those who want a single elected person must decide what
to do
about.</div><a name="09020369000366"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.30
pm</div><a name="09020369000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Tory Front-Bench proposal&#151;the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds
may say more about it&#151;is reasonable, but it demonstrates that
there is a problem. Their position is that the election would be rerun
if a BNP candidate, or someone who says no to lap dancing in Durham, or
anybody who is not regarded as acceptable were elected. I take the
point about democracy, but there are consequences that have to be
thought
through.</div><a name="09020369000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
is a serious debate, and I am not trying to score points. The
Government have taken a hit, but it was the right thing to do. We have
withdrawn from direct elections for crime and policing representatives
because we need to proceed with caution. Others who continue to propose
direct elections in whatever form are wrestling with the same problems.
If they were in Government, I believe that they would step back and
reflect on how to deal with those
problems.</div><a name="09020369000070"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020369000423"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> I do not wish to interrupt the Minister&#146;s
flow, but on a point of clarification, my predecessor in this post, my
hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs (Nick Herbert),
indicated that we would consult on a power of recall, of the sort that
is found in California, as a possible check and balance. There would
not be an automatic recall if a left-wing or right-wing extremist were
elected. The power of recall would operate as it does in the United
States, particularly in California: if a certain percentage of those
who voted at the previous election petitioned for a rerun of the
election&#151;a recall election&#151;that would happen. Certain
triggers are required before a rerun could happen. I hope that that is
of assistance to the Committee when considering the Minister&#146;s
comments.</div><a name="09020369000071"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020369000424"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> Of course that is of assistance to the Committee,
but it also demonstrates the point that I am trying to make. Others who
are thinking about models for taking the proposal forward are concerned
about some of the dangers that my hon. Friend the Member for
Stourbridge and the hon. Member for Bromsgrove raised. The hon. Member
for Mid-Bedfordshire asks, &#147;Don&#146;t you trust the
electorate?&#148; but people from every political party and in every
area of the country are concerned about the matter and are trying to
find a balance&#151;to square the circle. If there are direct
elections and somebody is elected who is unacceptable by any stretch of
the imagination&#151;I prefaced my remarks by saying that nobody
wants a BNP candidate to be elected&#151;what would we actually do
about
it?</div><a name="09020369000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
be fair to the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds, he recognises the
problem and is trying to find a way to deal with it. Because we are in
government, we do not think it acceptable, when we are putting a Bill
through Parliament, to say that we are wrestling with the issues to see
whether we can produce a reasonable set of proposals. We were concerned
that virtually every authority, council and police force in this
country opposed what we said we would do. In government, one has to
make a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column183" />Column number: 183</div>choice. The hon. Member for Chesterfield rightly said that we have to
show leadership. I agree with that, but sometimes we have to show
leadership by saying that perhaps we ought to think
again.</div><a name="09020369000073"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09020369000425"></a><b class="B">Ms
Sally Keeble</b> (Northampton, North) (Lab): Does my hon.
Friend agree that sometimes the police have to police to protect
minority interests? That could pose a real difficulty if somebody has
to answer in an election that is just around the corner. I am thinking
of the policing of some of the early fascist marches in Birmingham and
around the black country. Someone who had to stand for popular election
later might not have taken the position that the police did then. They
were absolutely right to take that position and have now got public
opinion with
them.</div><a name="09020369000074"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020369000426"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> We could go on and on about this and replay the
record again and again, it is such an important issue. Mr.
Bayley, I know that this morning, Sir Nicholas felt that we had not
made much progress, but the quality and importance of the debate is
such that it deserves the Committee spending a considerable amount of
time on it. Nobody has abused
that.</div><a name="09020369000075"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020369000427"></a>Mr.

spatio-temporal terms we may have not made as much progress as Sir
Nicholas wished, in terms of the quality of the arguments and the way
in which they have been teased out, we
have?</div>
<a name="09020369000076"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020369000428"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> I normally understand what the hon. Gentleman
means, but I am not sure that I do on this occasion. I normally
understand his questions, even if I am not totally sure of the answer.
However, I think I understand him and I agree with him on that
point.</div>
<a name="09020369000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon.
Friend the Member for Northampton, North makes my point exactly.
Sometimes what sounds good and in the short term makes someone popular
is actually the wrong thing to do. As politicians, we almost accept
that, but what about a police officer or an elected commissioner who
stands for election at a particular time? We can all cite issues that
incite populist rage&#151;for example, setting up a paedophile hostel
or housing for drug addicts and ex-offenders. The police say,
&#147;Actually this is a good thing to do,&#148; but someone might
say, &#147;No, it&#146;s a terrible thing to do,&#148; and get
elected. It is a difficult issue.</div>
<a name="09020369000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">As my hon.
Friend said, sometimes the police have to stand up for minority opinion
and minorities. That is why in this country for years&#151;police
officers will say this&#151;police officers have been agents of the
Crown. That is why police officers will say it is so important to them
that the allegiance they swear and the oath they take are to the Crown.
In effect, the police are saying that it is for them to police
according to the law, without fear or favour. As my hon. Friend said,
that means protecting and policing difficult situations in a way that
is sometimes hugely unpopular. We should consider changing that balance
only with great care, because if we get it wrong, we could have all
sorts of
problems.</div><a name="09020369000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am reminded of the question of accountability. I am sure that we have
all seen young girls or boys play football: they chase the ball and
when it goes over one side, everyone chases it and there is nobody on
the rest 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column184" />Column number: 184</div>of the pitch; all of sudden, somebody boots it over the other side and
everyone runs over the other side. If we are not careful, we are in
danger of creating a situation in which everyone just chases the ball.
That does not make good football and it would not necessarily make good
policing. We have to consider that. The hon. Member for Bury St.
Edmunds rightly challenges me, asking, &#147;Why did you drop that
proposal?&#148; Whether or not he agrees with why we dropped it, that
is why we did. That is why we changed
it.</div><a name="09020369000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman asked me about the role of my right hon. Friend the
Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett) in what we
do. We dropped the matter&#151;although perhaps dropped is not the
right word. We have put the question to one side so that we can reflect
on direct elections and see whether we can move forward in a way that
takes account of the various problems that have been raised. We must
proceed with caution, but we cannot do that and take account of the
various problems that people have raised in the Committee and beyond if
clause 1 of the Bill is about direct elections. It would be
irresponsibility of the highest
order.</div><a name="09020369000081"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020369000429"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> The Minister has given a perfectly fair reply to
one of my questions: why, between the Green Paper and publication of
the Bill, were the Green Paper measures dropped? For the benefit of the
Committee, will he explain again what exactly the right hon. Member for
Sheffield, Brightside is working on? What is his remit? Will his work
be published anywhere in a way that this Committee can look at? I am
not being argumentative or seeking to make a political point. I just
want to know what he has been asked to do by the Home
Secretary.</div><a name="09020369000082"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020369000430"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> The Home Secretary has asked my right hon. Friend
to conduct a review in relation to the Labour party. I think that I
have mentioned this to the hon. Gentleman before. A review is being
conducted of whether we can come up with a model that meets all
concerns and that can be included in our manifesto for the next general
election. To do that, my right hon. Friend will talk to various
people.</div><a name="09020369000083"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020369000431"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020369000432"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> Before the next general election. Clearly, there
will need to be something for the
manifesto.</div><a name="09020369000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have read and reread the complicated new clauses tabled by hon. Member
for Chesterfield. They would put in place different systems in
different parts of the country: police authorities in Cumbria,
Hertfordshire, Lincolnshire, Norfolk, Northamptonshire, Suffolk and
Warwickshire would be brought entirely under the auspices of the county
councils, but the other 35 authorities would have a different system.
That seems strange. Furthermore, the proposal to have no statutory
requirement for independent members is a mistake, because they bring an
awful lot to police authorities. I am surprised by that aspect of his
proposals. He has devised an incredibly complicated system that most
people would find difficult to
understand.</div><a name="09020369000086"></a><div class="hs_Para"></div><a name="09020369000087"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09020369000433"></a><b class="B">Paul
Holmes</b> (Chesterfield) (LD): On the latter point, as we
have discussed at some length, single transferable vote elections elect
much more representative bodies of people, as has been shown in all the
countries of the world where they are used. Most of the independent 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column185" />Column number: 185</div>appointees currently in place would therefore not be needed. However,
there would be scope in the new clause to appoint people such as
magistrates. On the Minister&#146;s point about the proposals being
complicated, the Government&#146;s proposals in the Green Paper,
which have now been dropped, would have imposed another layer of
complication on top of the existing complicated layers of local
government in this country. Unless we start from scratch and rewrite
the whole local government system in England and Wales, we will have no
option but to lay down a complicated system over an already complicated
system, as the Government themselves proposed to
do.</div><a name="09020369000088"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020369000434"></a>Mr.

complicated. We wanted to try to come up with something simpler. If we
want people to participate, we must make the system one that they can
understand.</div><a name="09020369000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have spent some time replying to questions about why we removed our
proposals in the Bill for direct elections. We have talked about the
need to proceed with caution and some of the difficulties that we are
all having in trying to devise an acceptable model that will enable us
to move forward. None the less, clause 1 will help to make a
difference. Much emphasis has rightly been placed on subsection (1),
which strengthens the requirements in the Police Act 1996. As I have
said, police authorities will have to &#147;have regard&#148; to
the views of the public, rather than merely obtain those
views.</div>
<a name="09020369000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection
(2), which sits alongside that provision, will require Her
Majesty&#146;s inspectorate of constabulary to inspect police
authorities, and that will be done much more vigorously from April. We
will require the inspectorate to look specifically at police
authorities to see how well they have done on subsection (1). I say to
the hon. Member for Mid-Bedfordshire that if what she says about the
police authority in Bedfordshire is correct, and I have no reason to
believe that it is or is not, under the terms of the clause, it will be
appropriate for people to request that the inspectorate look at what
has happened. That will be one way forward.</div>

answer the kernel of the debate. Hon. Members will have to decide
themselves about direct elections and how we can take that forward.
Serious problems would emerge from directly electing people to policing
positions, whether as an elected commissioner, a lay commissioner or
along the lines that we proposed and that the Liberal Democrats now
propose. Surely, while we work to resolve the problems of extremists or
single-issue people being elected and all the other questions that we
are concerned about, it is much more sensible to step back, to reflect
and to try to build a consensus than to just drive forward, ignoring
all the warnings that we have been given and all the views that have
been put to us by everybody, except some people in every
party.</div>
<a name="09020369000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">At the
Association of Police Authorities conference, which the hon. Member for
Arundel and South Downs, the hon. Member for Chesterfield and I
attended, someone put it to me that the only people who agree with each
other on direct elections are a few people at the front of every major
political party&#151;that a few people at the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column186" />Column number: 186</div>top of the Labour, Conservative and Liberal parties were the only people
who agreed with direct elections. All the other local government
members of every party, all the police forces and all the bodies that
represent local government in all its guises oppose it. I have said
this before, but I shall repeat it because it is crucial: sometimes
leadership is about saying, &#147;Let&#146;s stop and
reflect.&#148; Leadership is not only about saying, &#147;Everybody
disagrees with me, so the only way I can show that I&#146;m a leader
is by charging them and taking them on.&#148; Sometimes it is about
reflecting on what they tell us, and with that, I beg to move that the
clause stand part of the Bill.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020369000450"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> I beg to move amendment 50, in
clause 2, page 2, line 12, after
&#145;of&#146;, insert</div> <div class="hs_brev">&#145;up to ten persons
nominated by the Secretary of State after consultation with the
Association of Police Authorities and the Association of Chief Police
Officers.&#146;.</div><a name="09020369000115"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020369000451"></a>The
Chairman:</b> With this it will be convenient to discuss
amendment 49, in clause 2, page 2, leave
out lines 13 to
16</div><a name="09020369000117"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020369000452"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> The amendments relate to a clause whose general
purpose we support. As many hon. Members will be aware, under the
current appointments system, senior chief officer roles, covering the
posts of chief constable, assistant chief constable and deputy chief
constable and their equivalents in London, are advertised by police
authorities. Eligible candidates then choose for which posts they wish
to apply and the successful candidate is appointed by the relevant
police authority, subject to approval by the Home Secretary.</div>
<a name="09020369000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
ministerial approval follows advice from the senior appointments panel,
which currently operates on a non-statutory basis. It is made up of
people drawn from the Association of Chief Police Officers, the
Association of Police Authorities, the Metropolitan Police Service and
the Home Office. In addition, there is one independent member. Until
December last, the chairman was Sir Ronnie Flanagan in his
role as Her 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column187" />Column number: 187</div>Majesty&#146;s chief inspector of constabulary, although my
understanding is that the Home Office has indicated that he has agreed
to continue chairing the SAP in an independent capacity since stepping
down from that post.</div>
<a name="09020369000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">The thrust of
the clause that we are seeking to amend, and the reason why we like it,
is that the current system needs reform. That is argued for across the
police community on the grounds that, under the current regime, there
is insufficient career management and succession management to get the
right individuals with the right skills into the right jobs in the
right forces at the right time. The system also lacks true
transparency, which most of the public service reform debate is tasked
to deliver.</div>
<a name="09020369000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">HMIC and some
police authorities argue that reform needs to ensure a better supply of
chief officers to match the posts to be filled. I do not agree with all
that ACPO says on this subject, but its response to the Green Paper
states that
the</div><a name="09020369000329"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;chief
officer appointments system needs to be looked
at&#148;,</div><a name="09020369000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">especially
in relation to</div>
<a name="09020369000330"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;succession

<a name="09020369000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">and talks

APA makes a separate point, which I believe is correct, that</div>
<a name="09020369000332"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;police
authorities do not always set the best possible lists of candidates
for</div><a name="09020369000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">the posts
that authorities are advertising, that</div>
<a name="09020369000333"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;many good
superintendents are not selected as eligible to become chief
officers&#148;,</div><a name="09020369000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">and
that</div>
<a name="09020369000334"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;there is wide
agreement that we need better talent
management.&#148;</div><a name="09020369000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
was in the APA&#146;s response to the Green Paper published in the
autumn.</div><a name="09020369000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
bring this alive with real-world examples, one has only to look at a
report in <i class="I">The Times</i> of 19 June 2007 on the difficulties that
police authorities said they encountered under the existing SAP regime,
which the clause seeks to reform, when trying to fill senior vacancies.
It
states:</div><a name="09020369000335"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
vacancy for Chief Constable of Lincolnshire attracted just one
candidate, despite being advertised twice. In Dyfed-Powys, where the
police chief
resigned&#148;</div><a name="09020369000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">in
interesting
circumstances,</div><a name="09020369000336"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;only
two people applied for the
job&#148;.</div><a name="09020369000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
article also observed that only four people applied for the post of
chief constable of the Greater Manchester force. The understanding was
that the police authority had hoped for a longer shortlist for what is
a key strategic role.</div>
<a name="09020369000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hasten to
add that, in my experience&#151;I have met and spoken to
them&#151;the individuals who took up the roles were very good
candidates, but the point is that there is insufficient competition
when there are so few applications for vacancies, as the report made
clear. To give another example: although the current chief constable,
Sara Thornton, is excellent, when the post of chief constable of Thames
Valley police was advertised while she was acting chief constable, she
was unopposed for that full-time role. Those are observations of police
authority members to whom one speaks and to whom ACPO
speaks&#151;they think that there is a problem with how SAP operates
at the moment.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column188" />Column number: 188</div><a name="09020369000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">Tacking
towards amendments 50 and 49, the first amendment, in seeking to limit
the number of members of the SAP to &#147;up to 10 persons&#148; is
designed to tease out from the Minister how he sees the new, improved,
reformed SAP operating in practice. In a minute I shall get to some of
things that the new SAP will need to do and what his views are on the
new roles, but let us stick with the amendments for the time being,
working out the cost and how top-heavy the management will
be.</div><a name="09020369000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
regulatory impact assessment published in conjunction with the Bill
says of the
clause:</div><a name="09020369000337"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Home Office will require four staff which is expected to cost
&#163;0.8m per annum. These staff will support the
panel&#148;.</div><a name="09020369000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are talking not about the panel itself, but about the Home Office
secretariat. It
continues:</div><a name="09020369000338"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
independent chair and independents will receive allowances totalling
approximately &#163;0.1m per
annum.&#148;</div><a name="09020369000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
other words, the four members of staff are expected to cost
&#163;800,000. Is that figure to be reviewed in the light of any
public expenditure survey round or efficiency savings that the Home
Secretary will be conducting across her Department? I am rather
interested in those figures in the impact assessment and in the
arrangements for the new panel and for the secretariat that, we are
told in the notes, is necessary to support
it.</div><a name="09020369000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
second amendment in the group relates to something entirely different:
the status of those whom the clause seeks to include on a statutory
basis as members of the panel, both the APA and, in particular, ACPO.
Amendment 49, which would delete a statutory membership for
ACPO and others on the new reformed panel, is a probing
amendment.</div><a name="09020369000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
goes to the heart of something that my hon. Friend the Member for Epsom
and Ewell (Chris Grayling), the vigorous and hugely impressive new
shadow Home Secretary, said. I do not say that because I am a
lickspittle jobsworth, but because in his very first outing, within
hours of being made shadow Home Secretary on 19
January&#151;the Minister will remember&#151;and in his opening
speech on Second Reading, my hon. Friend said something that bears
repetition in relation to the clause, which seeks to put ACPO&#146;s
membership of the new, reformed SAP on a statutory basis. Asking who
should be on this new panel on a statutory basis, he
said:</div><a name="09020369000339"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
principle of an appointments panel is sensible, but it is strange that
it gives the Association of Chief Police Officers a statutory position
in advising on appointments when the status of ACPO itself remains
undefined.&#148;</div><a name="09020369000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">Liberty
made the same point to the Committee in the evidence session last week
and in its written evidence. I hasten to add that I think that it is a
question for us to reflect on and for the Minister to give us his views
on; I still ponder myself what the definition of ACPO is. As my hon.
Friend went on to
say:</div><a name="09020369000340"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Is
it an external reference group for Home Office Ministers, or a
professional association protecting senior officers&#146; interests?
Is it a national policing agency, or is it a pressure group arguing for
greater police powers?&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report</i>, 19
January 2009; Vol. 486, c.
528.]</div><a name="09020369000368"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5
pm</div><a name="09020369000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
those of us who have looked at it and those of us who are boring
ex-lawyers, I was also struck by the fact that ACPO is not governed by
any statute. It is instead a company limited by guarantee, which is a
little known 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column189" />Column number: 189</div>but interesting fact. In addition, the Freedom of Information Act 2000
does not apply to that interesting, important
body.</div>
<a name="09020369000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">I wish to
place it clearly on the record that the current head of ACPO, Sir Ken
Jones, is someone for whom I have a great deal of respect. The ACPO
leads with whom I have occasion to come into contact weekly and
continually are men and women of calibre. I do not seek to criticise
much of the excellent work done by ACPO to improve advice not just to
Ministers but to members of the Opposition, including me, but we must
go to first principles and look at the structure of what ACPO is. As my
hon. Friend the Member for Epsom and Ewell pointed out, there are
interesting questions.</div>
<a name="09020369000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon.
Friend went on to
say:</div><a name="09020369000341"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Unless
ACPO&#146;s status is sorted out, we shall have some doubts over
whether it should have this
role&#148;&#151;</div><a name="09020369000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">that
is, sitting on the
SAP&#151;</div><a name="09020369000342"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;on
a statutory basis. I hope that Ministers will be able to provide more
information about that in Committee, and that we shall have more
opportunities to debate it then.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official
Report</i>, 19 January 2009; Vol. 486, c. 529.]</div>
<a name="09020369000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 49
should be taken in the spirit of probing and honest inquiry eloquently
set out by my hon. Friend on Second Reading. As I pointed out, similar
questions about the constitutional position of ACPO were raised by
Liberty, to take just one
example.</div><a name="09020369000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before
I conclude, because we might not have the opportunity for a debate on
clause stand part, the Conservatives have one or two questions for the
Minister. Having granted that the SAP needs reform and that we give
general support to the thrust of the clause, we need to understand what
the SAP, in its reformed guise, will do that is new. My amendments make
serious reservations about the composition of the panel. The Government
and ACPO believe that not enough emphasis is always placed on chief
officers contributing to national work, so the SAP will certainly have
a weather eye on that.</div>
<a name="09020369000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government acknowledge that the Association of Police Authorities has a
point when it says that it is essential to retain the centrality of the
police authority role in chief officer appointments, but it will not be
quite as central as formerly, will it, if the new SAP will exercise a
more strategic view for certain posts? There will be an inherent
tension between the greater&#151;I use the word
advisedly&#151;centralised powers that the clause will bring forth
and the pure or relative autonomy enjoyed now by police
authorities.</div><a name="09020369000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
also need to pay advertence to something mentioned in the Green Paper.
It is not in the Bill, but it is an interesting idea, and I should be
grateful if the Minister shed some light on it: the creation of a
national college of police leadership. Presumably, it would build on
the police college at Bramshill. How might that operate in conjunction
with the SAP? It would be interesting to hear what the timeline is for
creating the new national college, branding it and consulting on how it
might work. This is an apposite moment to hear from the
Minister.</div><a name="09020369000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
also need to pay advertence to what Sir Norman Bettison said in
evidence to the Committee last week when responding to one of my
questions, because it is really important if we are to get a handle on
the SAP&#146;s new activities. Sir Norman said that</div>

was sceptical about whether the clause would have the effect that we in
Committee hope it will, which is to improve the flow and numbers of

that</div>
<a name="09020369000345"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;unless talent

will not deal with the problem that we are all interested in
solving.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official Report, Policing
and Crime Public Bill Committee, </i>27 January 2009; c. 9,
Q5-6.]</div><a name="09020369000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
wondered what the Minister thought the SAP might do on directing
individuals, because Sir Norman used the words
&#147;direction&#148; and &#147;military approach&#148;. Is
that on the end of spectrum at which the new SAP will operate? I do not
know the answer, and I am not even sure that I agree with it, but,
conceptually, we need the Minister to be clear about it. Will the SAP
have anything like that power to direct?</div>
<a name="09020369000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">I conclude my
remarks by citing the Home Office&#146;s impact assessment of the SAP
reforms:</div>
<a name="09020369000348"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Currently,
the system is one in which police authorities exercise one of their
relatively few powers&#151;of chief officer appointment&#151;in a
context which is in practice very lightly managed from the centre. Many
police authorities are likely to see the changes to a much more managed
system&#148;&#151;</div><a name="09020369000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">that
is what the clause will
do&#151;</div><a name="09020369000349"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;as
encroaching heavily on a core role and protest
accordingly.&#148;</div>
<a name="09020369000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">It went on to
state:</div>
<a name="09020369000350"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Likewise,
currently individual aspiring chief officers are fairly lightly
managed. The new system would be more directive&#151;but also more
supportive and
transparent.&#148;</div><a name="09020369000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
new arrangements should be more directive, which is why we support the
clause, and the amendments, which would be supportive, certainly would
not undermine the purport and force of the clause in any way. However,
the impact assessment is also correct to state that the new
arrangements will be more supportive and transparent. The critical
issue is not whether the new system will be more directive, but the
extent to which it will be so, and on that I seek the Minister&#146;s
views.</div><a name="09020369000157"></a>

Holmes:</b> I have two or three brief observations and
questions. We all know that there are great difficulties in getting
enough people for the post of chief constable. The problem is related
not only to the police; it applies to head teachers&#146; jobs
throughout the country, too. However, I am not quite clear how
amendments 50 and 49 relate to improving the flow of applicants. The
Association of Police Authorities and Liberty separately raised the
same concern about making the senior appointments panel a statutory
body, rather than non-statutory. I should welcome the Minister&#146;s
comments on why the Government feel the need to make it into a
statutory body and how that would improve its performance, as opposed
to what has happened so far. The Bill states that the panel should
consist of representative members made up of three groups of people:
those 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column191" />Column number: 191</div>nominated by the Secretary of State, by ACPO and by the APA, although it
does not go into detail about actual numbers and relative balances. I
would also welcome the comments of the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds
on
that.</div><a name="09020369000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
50 and 49 go down the road of giving more central power to the
Secretary of State by saying that the senior appointments panel would
have 10 representatives. Unlike the Bill, they define the
figure and say that the members would definitely be appointed by the
Secretary of State, rather than a mixture of
sources.</div><a name="09020369000159"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020369000454"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> If it assists the Committee and the hon.
Gentleman, I want to explain that the amendments are probing in nature.
The purpose of the amendment concerned with 10 persons is to tease out
the cost and manpower implications. I was at pains to explain that the
purpose of amendment 49 was to tease out the statutory basis of the
membership.</div>
<a name="09020369000160"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020369000455"></a>Paul
Holmes:</b> I accept that, as probing amendments, they will
not be put to the vote, but I remain alarmed by provisions that would
give more direct power to the Secretary of State, and alarmed that she
would have the sole power to appoint the representatives&#151;10
persons, under the amendment&#151;to the senior appointments panel.
It is a movement of power in the opposite direction from the one for
which we have been arguing: we should be devolving and decentralising
power, and creating more independence within the police force and
police authorities. Under the amendment, the power would be
centralising and that would be in the wrong
direction.</div><a name="09020369000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">How
does the Minister regard the number of representatives from the three
different bodies mentioned in the Bill? How would that turn out in
numbers, and what would be the balance between the three groups? What
is the Government&#146;s reasoning for saying that we need to move
the senior appointments panel on to a statutory basis, as opposed to
the current, non-statutory
basis?</div><a name="09020369000162"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020369000456"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> I start by thanking the hon. Member for Bury St.
Edmunds for his general welcome and support for the clause. It is
important to clarify that point. I am not sure whether the hon. Member
for Chesterfield took the same approach, but I shall respond to a
couple of the points that he made. The reform is important.
Mr. Bayley, is it all right if I curtail my remarks a
little? We are having a clause stand part debate later, so I shall keep
some of what I want to say generally until that debate, while answering
some of the questions asked by the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds.
Would that be appropriate and helpful? I shall make a few remarks
before turning to amendments 50 and 49 and the next set of amendments
before the clause stand part
debate.</div><a name="09020369000163"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020369000457"></a>The
Chairman:</b> We could have a separate debate on such
matters.</div><a name="09020369000164"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020369000458"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> Absolutely. I welcome the support of the hon.
Member for Bury St. Edmunds. I am a big supporter of the Association of
Chief Police Officers. I appreciate his point, so I preface my remarks
by saying that I am not arguing that he is not a big supporter of ACPO.
No 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column192" />Column number: 192</div>doubt people will say that it is a body limited by guarantee and that
that makes a big difference. Since I have been in my post, it has acted
in the most professional way; again, I know that the hon. Gentleman
agrees. ACPO has given advice and told us its thoughts on policy. It
has challenged the Government. It has said what it thinks, and we have
asked it for help. At times, it has been difficult&#151;in the proper
sense of the word&#151;because it thinks that we are perhaps not
going in the right direction. It will do exactly the same if the
Government change at the next election. If there is a Liberal Democrat
Government or whatever kind of Government, it will do exactly the same.
It recognises that its role is to reflect the interests, as it sees
them, of ACPO and policing in general, but it also recognises, quite
properly, that irrespective of which party is in power, it is for
Governments to govern and Governments will make decisions about what
they believe is the appropriate policy to
pursue.</div><a name="09020369000369"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.15
pm</div><a name="09020369000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">Sir
Ken Jones, as ACPO president, has done an excellent job, as have the
other ACPO officers who advise me on a range of issues, as well as the
general body known as ACPO. It works exceedingly well. What also works
well is the tripartite governance of policing, which is part of the
debate that we started to have before. I am referring to the balance
between the Home Office, ACPO and the APA. That tripartite policing
governance structure, despite its difficulties and the criticisms that
people make of it, works pretty well. We have tried to reflect
that&#151;I will come on to this in more detail&#151;in the
structure of the clause relating to the reformed senior appointments
panel. Those elements are an important part of the existing SAP, which
is on a voluntary basis, and the new enhanced statutory set-up for the
SAP should reflect that as well. Some of the detail will have to be set
out in various arrangements. Hon. Members can read the Bill as well as
I can. It sets out that we will do just
that.</div><a name="09020369000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">May
I update the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds? I am told that the
estimate for the cost is now &#163;500,000. We will keep that under
review. He is absolutely right. Sometimes, we spend two or three hours
on clause 1, which is a very important debate. This clause is extremely
important. If we get it right, no one will disagree when they read the
functions, and we shall discuss
that.</div><a name="09020369000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
answer the hon. Member for Chesterfield, the reason why we have put the
SAP on a statutory basis is to try to ensure that we put down exactly
what we want it to do and that we help it to be more effective at
delivering the things that we all want. We all talk about the need for
a greater pool of candidates. The hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds was
right to point out that, notwithstanding the ability of some people who
have been appointed to the position of chief constable in this
country&#151;Sara Thornton, whom he cited as an example, is an
excellent chief constable&#151;we want more people to come forward.
We hope that a strengthened SAP is one way in which we can achieve
that.</div><a name="09020369000168"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020369000459"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> The Minister was kind enough to say that my
question about the cost was pertinent and  he helpfully said
that the cost estimate had been reviewed downwards from
&#163;800 million to &#163;500 million. <i class="I">[Interruption.]</i>
Perhaps he could repeat the figures.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column193" />Column number: 193</div><a name="09020369000169"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020369000460"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> The estimate has gone from &#163;800,000 to
&#163;500,000, not &#163;800 million to &#163;500
million.</div><a name="09020369000170"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020369000461"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> I am most grateful to the Minister. On what basis
has the figure gone from &#163;800,000 to &#163;500,000? It seems
to be a very recent renewal of the figure since the impact assessment
was
published.</div><a name="09020369000171"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020369000462"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> That has been done on the basis of an up-to-date
assessment of what we think will be appropriate, but I will keep that
figure under review and to ensure that it is appropriate in terms of
ensuring that the SAP has the resources to deal with the important
functions that we are setting out for it. I should like to reassure
anyone reading our proceedings that the Home Office will absorb those
costs. I want to be clear about that. We will keep the matter under
review.</div>
<a name="09020369000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me
respond to the hon. Member for Chesterfield&#146;s points. We all
agree that these matters are important, and we are trying to ensure
that we will have a strengthened, improved and more independent SAP,
instead of it simply being a sift for senior appointments. We want it
to be a more dynamic organisation that can help to drive forward change
and other things that we want. That will help to make a
difference.</div>
<a name="09020369000173"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020369000463"></a>Paul
Holmes:</b> The Minister might be coming to this point, but
let me ask him about the more independent, dynamic panel that he has
mentioned. I have asked exactly what proportion of the representatives
it is envisaged will be drawn from the three groupings that are listed.
The APA has
said:</div><a name="09020369000351"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Home Secretary appointees on the panel should not be capable of
outnumbering police community appointees. To have credibility it needs
to be seen to be a genuine tripartite
body.&#148;</div><a name="09020369000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">How
many will come from each of the three
legs?</div><a name="09020369000175"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020369000464"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> We want a proper balance among the various people
who are nominated to the panel.</div>
<a name="09020369000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">A significant
and important change that has generated debate is the independence of
the panel&#146;s chair. The hon. Gentleman alluded to that. One
reason why we have asked Ronnie Flanagan to be the interim chair, as we
move from the current system to the system that we want, which is
subject to the passage of this Bill, is to assuage concerns about the
current system.</div>
<a name="09020369000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman asked about functions, which are laid out in the Bill. We can
debate which are the most important, but he will know that I have been
particularly interested in trying to increase the pool of
candidates&#151;he rightly raised that issue&#151;as well as the
number from different ethnic backgrounds. We are trying to deal with
that, and it will be an important part of the work that the panel tries
to do. The police service is working hard to change that, and the SAP
might look at that work to see what advice it could give to move that
issue forward. The hon. Gentleman will note that the Bill contains an
important power, under proposed new section 53D, to confer additional
functions should that be necessary.</div>
<a name="09020369000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Bury St. Edmunds asked about the national college of police
leadership. We expect it to have started by March of this year. The
college will be at Bramshill and will work through the National
Policing Improvement Agency; it is about training people, giving 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column194" />Column number: 194</div>them the skills that they need, and helping them to develop and move
forward. The system adopted by the national college for school
leadership has been successful, and we think that the new college will
be a successful innovation. It will bring together leadership
programmes in the NPIA, and it will be headed by a deputy chief
constable, with the board chaired by ACPO from March this
year.</div>
<a name="09020369000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman raised the issue of helping people to consider moving around
the country. I do not want to get into semantics or dance on the head
of a pin, because I think that I agree with him. We should not be about
directing people, but we should be about ensuring that they are aware
of all the opportunities and possible advantages that are available to
them. If we are not careful, we may get into semantics. I do not think
that people should be able to say, &#147;You have to go here or
there,&#148; but an important role for the new, involved SAP could be
to make people more aware of available opportunities and advantages.
The SAP will not necessarily have the power to direct, but it will be
able to advise the Secretary of State on any particular matter that it
thinks is relevant. Of course, let us remember&#151;the hon. Member
for Chesterfield needs to remember this&#151;that the current process
is that we have the assessment and strategic command calls, the police
authority advertises, then the senior appointments panel looks at that
and determines whether they are the appropriate people for the position
they have applied for. Then it goes back to the police authority. The
fact is, at the end of the day, it is still the police authority that
will actually select who they want for the job. The new, reformed SAP
process is simply about trying to ensure that there is a greater number
of candidates for the posts on offer.</div>
<a name="09020369000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">The purpose
of amendment 49 is to make the senior appointments panel wholly
appointed by the Secretary of State. The ability of the APA and ACPO to
nominate members to the panel reflects the tripartite leadership of
policing and the balance to be struck in oversight of the senior
leadership pool between the national interest of Government, the
interests of senior officers themselves, and the interests of police
authorities seeking strong leadership of their force. APA and ACPO
membership is a key basis of the non-statutory panel which currently
exists. Leadership at all levels of the service is crucial to
delivering for the public. There is important work for the new panel to
undertake in taking a strategic approach to senior leadership, to help
ensure that all senior officer posts have an appropriate range of
candidates and to provide clarity to potential candidates about the
skills and needs of the service. The centralisation implied by the
amendment would not, in my view&#151;and I appreciate that this is a
probing amendment&#151;command the confidence of candidates
considering progression to the senior ranks or police authorities
seeking the best
candidates.</div><a name="09020369000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
purpose of amendment 50 is to limit the number of representative
members on the senior appointments panel to 10, and for the Secretary
of State to consult with ACPO and APA before making these appointments.
We do not envisage a large panel&#151;it is difficult to say exactly
what number&#151;but we do not see a particular need to define an
upper limit of representative numbers in legislation, especially as the
amendment does not define an upper limit for the independent members.
We need more flexibility than that. More importantly, the amendment,
when taken together with amendment 49, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column195" />Column number: 195</div>also in the name of the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds, would have the
effect of centralising the appointments process. Again, I do not think
that would command the confidence of candidates considering progression
to the senior ranks, or police authorities seeking the best candidates.
Nor do I believe that it recognises the proper role of police
authorities and chief officers in the appointments
system.</div><a name="09020369000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">With
the remarks I made before, but more formally at the end, I ask the hon.
Gentleman to withdraw his
amendment.</div><a name="09020369000183"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"></b><b class="B"><a name="09020369000470"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> These two amendments go to the question of how
the new arrangements will be inspected and assessed. The whole question
of independent inspection is one that the Opposition have been looking
at for some time. In the Government&#146;s green paper, they
discussed a more independent HMIC, reporting to Parliament in a way it
does not do at the moment. The concept of having an MPC-style committee
as part of the HMIC regime was floated. All those things go to the
heart of independence, and the amendments probe how we will
independently assess the operation of this new regime. Will there be
more people suited to certain jobs applying for key jobs? Will the
object of the new regime be delivered and how will we measure its
success?</div><a name="09020369000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
answer that question we need to go back to one or two of ACPO&#146;s
concerns about the change that is proposed in the clause. In relation
to the SAP changes outlined in the Green Paper, ACPO said that there
should be a key role for HMIC in many aspects of career development of
senior officers, in particular the performance development review
process. It also said
that</div><a name="09020369000352"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
continuation of SAP under the chairmanship of
HMCIC&#148;</div><a name="09020369000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">is
something that it wants to be continued. The clause deals with an
independent chairman under the new regime. However, ACPO and others say
that it should continue to be a sworn officer, and that the head of the
inspectorate&#151;HMCIC&#151;should chair SAP. Its argument is
interesting because it says that</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column196" />Column number: 196</div><a name="09020369000353"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;HMIC
should continue to lead on PDR completion utilising their professional
judgement borne from practical experience and knowledge of the
challenges that are faced everyday by Chief Officers within the police
service.&#148;</div><a name="09020369000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
goes to the heart of my amendments. In relation to the Green Paper,
ACPO said that the suggestion that there would be a conflict of
interest for HMIC in a new role is spurious. That is to say that the
Government believe&#151;as do I&#151;that if HMIC is involved in
the PDR process and appointments, it might look a bit odd perhaps for
the inspectorate to be inspecting some of the appointments and PDRs for
which it was largely responsible. The Government thought that that
might be a conflict of interest, and ACPO said that that was
spurious.</div><a name="09020369000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
use its own analogy, ACPO wants more of a parallel with GP assessments.
It says that in the health service, assessments are always done by
clinicians rather than those governing the service. ACPO likes the idea
of sworn officers of HMIC doing the inspecting. My amendments would
have HMIC inspecting the new regime, but not chairing the panel. My
understanding is that Ministers want an independent chair so that the
alleged conflict of interests to which I have referred does not
arise.</div><a name="09020369000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
need to have inspection without fear or favour. The Minister might say
that it is implied in the clauses, but these two
amendments&#151;particularly amendment
52 &#151;spell out that</div>
<a name="09020369000354"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Her
Majesty&#146;s Inspectors of Constabulary shall submit an annual
report to the Secretary of State on the operation of the Senior
Appointments process in each police force
area.&#148;</div><a name="09020369000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
other words, through the amendment, HMIC would not chair the panel, but
could go in and inspect what the panel does without fear or favour.
That inspection should be published and submitted to the Secretary of
State. We also suggest that reports are explicitly laid before
Parliament.</div>
<a name="09020369000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">The role of
HMIC will be strengthened anyway. The non-statutory changes&#151;the
HMIC reform that I referred to at the start of my remarks&#151;do not
require primary legislation, which is why they are not in the Bill, but
I understand that they will take place this year. What might this
inspectorate be inspecting force by force? There are a couple of things
that it might want to focus on. How is the fixed term appointment
regime operating? We have heard from Sir Norman Bettison, and others,
that the fixed term appointment regime is not an unalloyed benefit for
senior appointments. Clause 3 says that new arrangements have to be
made for senior officers who want to terminate their service before the
end of a fixed term appointment. There is a lot of debate about the
fixed term appointment regime. I proffer no particular view myself; it
seems to work quite
well.</div>
<a name="09020369000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
suppose that fixed-term appointments of five years were seen to be a
bar to flexible movement. Sir Norman said in his evidence last week
that that was true in some cases. To paraphrase, he said that a
five-year window might not be appropriate for certain high flyers. The
implication was that it might be a bit of a straitjacket. The reports
that I propose would tackle such issues, so that there is a clear
examination of how the regime is working, perhaps even probing current
assumptions. It is certainly my assumption that the fixed-term
appointment regime is here to stay, but others in the wider policing
community say that that is not so.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column197" />Column number: 197</div><a name="09020369000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
other things that these reports and inspections will need to lay bare.
In its response to the policing Green Paper in October 2008, the APA
said:</div>
<a name="09020369000355"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
concept of fixed-term contracts should be reviewed in order to better
reflect those used in other public service
organisations.&#148;</div><a name="09020369000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
supports what I have just argued. Once again, let us hear ACPO&#146;s
response:</div><a name="09020369000356"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Green Paper raises the question of constraints upon the development of
sufficient numbers of Chief Officers of good quality. However, the
Green Paper fails to acknowledge the impact and influence of Fixed Term
Appointments (FTAs) of a maximum of five years. FTAs have increased the
turnover of Chief Constables so that there is a constant churn of
leadership, which ACPO considers to be detrimental to organisational
development and partnership building. FTAs, more than any other factor,
put a strain on the pipeline of
talent.&#148;</div><a name="09020369000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
do not necessarily agree with that. Being an honest kind of fellow, I
openly admit that I need to reflect on that more, but there certainly
seems to be evidence from ACPO that the FTA is not an unalloyed
benefit. Surely, the reports, laid bare for everyone to see, could
tackle some of the big structural of issues that are being talked about
in terms of getting better talent management, better succession
planning and the right high-calibre people in the right jobs at the
right time, which is what the new panel is supposed to do.</div>
<a name="09020369000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">We disagree
with ACPO, which believes that the head of the panel should be HMCIC.
We believe that the inspectorate should be more independent, and we
would achieve that by having a chair of the panel who is not HMCIC. We
would also like a force-by-force report to be produced to assess
ruthlessly how succession planning is working, year on year, force by
force, not just in relation to the chief and deputy chief constable,
but in relation to the other senior ranks, too. On that non-probing
basis, I end my remarks on amendments Nos. 51 and
52.</div><a name="09020369000202"></a>

Coaker:</b><b class="B"> </b>I thank the hon. Gentleman again for his
support for the independence of the chair of SAP. I agree that it is
important. As I said, I tend to agree with ACPO a lot, but not always.
I was trying to make the point in the previous debate that it will
sometimes in the end say, &#147;This is our view, but you are the
Government and you govern.&#148; That is a sensible, grown-up
approach.</div><a name="09020369000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
would not be appropriate for HMCIC to hold the role under the new
system, as it takes on its strengthened role of performance
improvement. That changes the situation. Of course, it does not mean
that HMIC, and the chief inspector in particular, will not play an
important part in the senior appointments process and how all of this
will work. The hon. Gentleman is right, however, about the chair of the
panel.</div><a name="09020369000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
always, the difficulty is moving from one system to another. As we all
know, that is often where the greatest difficulty occurs, even when
people agree with the changes. That is why we have tried, in the
interim, to use the high regard that everyone has for Sir Ronnie
Flanagan and put him into that position to help us move to where we
want to be. That seems to have helped
somewhat.</div><a name="09020369000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
welcome the hon. Gentleman&#146;s support for the greater
independence of HMIC from the Government. It is not only a case of it
being independent so that it can hold the police to account, and help
the police to improve by inspecting them. It is also about us saying to

<div class="Column"><a name="Column198" />Column number: 198</div>HMIC, &#147;You have that new strengthened independent role from
us.&#148; It is beneficial to have that set out much more
clearly.</div>
<a name="09020369000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman asked about fixed-term appointments. No evidence has come to
me in the Home Office to say that that is a particular problem. It
sometimes gets raised, but people have not said that it is a real issue
that is causing problems. Other aspects of the appointments
process&#151;how we encourage and develop it&#151;are much more of
a problem. Of course, as the hon. Gentleman knows, the five-year term
can be extended should the police authority wish to do so. Although I
understand the sentiment of what he is trying say with respect to
publicising the work of SAP, part of the way in which he is trying to
do that could give rise to an unnecessary level of
bureaucracy.</div>
<a name="09020369000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">The purpose
of amendment 51 is to ensure that the reports of the senior
appointments panel are published and laid before Parliament. I do not
think that I will assuage all of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s doubts,
but it was always our intention to publish its reports to increase the
transparency of the senior appointments process. I am happy to put on
the record our commitment to doing that. The requirement will be set
out in SAP&#146;s constitutional arrangements, which will be made
under clause 2. Although the theme of the amendment is in line with
that transparency, requiring a report to be made to Parliament is not
the appropriate mechanism to achieve it. The Home Office annual report
will make appropriate reference to the work of the senior appointments
panel in
future.</div><a name="09020369000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
keeping with the theme of probing for transparency in the senior
appointments panel, amendment 52 would place a duty on HMIC to provide
an annual report to the Secretary of State on the operation of the
senior appointments process in every police force area. In my view, it
is the panel itself that will publicly report on the functioning of the
appointments system and the strategic challenges to address, taking
into account the views of APA, ACPO and others, as well as the
professional input of the inspectorate. Moreover, the Secretary of
State already has the power&#151;an important point, which I am sure
the hon. Gentleman knows&#151;under section 54 of the Police Act 1996
to require HMIC to prepare reports on particular functions of a police
authority, which could include, where the Home Secretary felt it was
appropriate, the workings of the senior appointments process in that
force.</div><a name="09020369000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
the light of my comments, and my commitment to publish the senior
appointments panel&#146;s reports, I hope that the hon. Gentleman can
see that, although I have some support for his amendments, they are
unnecessary and, potentially, overly
bureaucratic.</div>

the points of Her Majesty&#146;s Opposition. Therefore, I beg to ask

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020369000473"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> Having regard to your earlier ruling or
indication that you would allow a clause stand part debate,
Mr. Bayley, I point out that I raised all the 
issues of a clause stand part nature that I wished to raise in my
speeches to the two groups of amendments that we have just debated. The
Minister indicated in his speeches that he wanted to pick up in the
clause stand part debate on some of the things that he did not cover in
reply to me during the amendment debates. I am happy to reiterate that
there is broad support on the Opposition Benches for reform and
enhancement of the SAP, but I would be grateful if the Minister fleshed
out in a bit more detail what the nature of the new directive powers
will be and whether he can describe how this greater direction will
operate. In short, does it go as far as the militaristic-style
direction of individuals into certain posts at certain times that Sir
Norman Bettison
indicated?</div><a name="09020369000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
it is not that&#151;I imagine that the Minister will say, &#147;It
is not&#148; and I agree that it should not be&#151;in what way
will the clause deliver more directive power than the existing regime
that the clause seeks to reform? I am unclear how the new regime will
enhance things. Sir Norman, wearing his ACPO hat, suggested
that he is not clear how the clause will improve things. I repeat:
short of militaristic-style direction&#151;his words, not
mine&#151;it is difficult to see how the new regime can make a
significant difference. I would be grateful to hear the
Minister&#146;s
views.</div><a name="09020369000215"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020369000474"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> I try very hard to answer the questions put. I
recognise that I do not always answer them to the satisfaction of hon.
Members, so I apologise profusely for not specifically answering that
question about militaristic-style direction. The hon. Gentleman is
absolutely right. We do not believe that the measures should lead to
militaristic-style direction in which people are ordered to go to
different parts of the country in order to take up various positions. I
hope that that is
clear.</div><a name="09020369000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
thought that the hon. Member for Chesterfield was going to make a
couple of remarks. The clause is extremely important. There is no doubt
that everybody accepts that there is a need to increase the number of
candidates putting themselves forward for senior positions and to
encourage greater diversity among candidates. How do we deliver that?
It must be said that the response, given that we do not have and would
not want the ability to order people around, can often appear almost
weak. It sounds good, but what difference will it make?</div>
<a name="09020369000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
of the reasons why we are saying that we should move from the current
basis to a statutory basis is that we can then start to influence the
work of the senior appointments panel and give it greater clout,
greater credibility and a greater sense of importance. I think that
that is what it will do. The current membership of the SAP is seven.
They are important and good people, but we want to have a much broader
membership than is currently the case.</div>
<a name="09020369000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">Currently,
we have an independent chair, representatives from ACPO and APA,
independent members, somebody from the Home Office, a representative of
Her Majesty&#146;s inspectorate of constabulary and somebody from the
Metropolitan Police Authority. When there is something that the SAP
particularly wants to discuss, other people 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column200" />Column number: 200</div>are invited along. However, we are saying&#151;we can all read the
clause for ourselves&#151;that the panel will consist
of</div><a name="09020369000357"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a
chair and other members appointed by the Secretary of
State&#148;.</div><a name="09020369000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
could include people with particular expertise, judgment or points of
view to bring. They will not represent any body in particular, but they
might have a particular opinion or skill that makes a
difference.</div><a name="09020369000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
panel will also include representative members. They will be nominated
by the tripartite Government system that I mentioned earlier,
consisting of the Home Office, APA and ACPO. To answer the hon. Members
for Chesterfield and for Bury St. Edmunds, the SAP will have much
broader membership, bringing together people with a much greater
diversity of views and opinions, and it will be tasked specifically
with certain things to do, rather than sifting appointments as its
primary function.</div>
<a name="09020369000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">I point out
to the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds that, importantly, although the
SAP does an admirable job sifting through appointments, members of
police authorities consider appointments to senior police positions in
their own area and then give them to the SAP to look at. Instead, the
SAP will take a much more proactive role. Rather than reacting to the
people sent to it, the SAP will be charged with increasing the number
of people that police authorities consider in the first place. That is
a significant and fundamental change in how the new body will operate.
Instead of being a passive organisation&#151;I must be careful,
because I do not want people to read this and think that I am having a
go&#151;it will be a proactive, dynamic body charged with doing
something to make a
difference.</div><a name="09020369000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
the Home Secretary is concerned about something, she could refer it to
the new body, so that matters relating to the training needs of senior
officers could be considered. People would be considered not only on
the basis of whether they were any good for a job, but on the basis of
what would need to happen for their training needs to be improved,
developed and supported, so that the pool
increases.</div><a name="09020369000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am surprised that police officers have not been saying for decades,
&#147;Why don&#146;t we have what is regarded as good practice in
other professions, so that we are helped to develop?&#148; Perhaps
they have been saying that, but they have not been heard. I was a
teacher&#151;I think some other members of the Committee were
too&#151;but I have worked in different professions. The first thing
that a person wants in their profession is to be supported in
developing the talents, abilities and skills that they need to
progress. That happens to a certain extent within the police force, but
charging a body with the function, aim and objective of increasing the
number of people who come forward for senior appointments is
fundamentally different from what happens
now.</div><a name="09020369000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are lots of papers on black and minority ethnic recruitment, including
one that I helped to put together. We should tell people to support
that work&#151;I am not saying there has been no progress&#151;so
that, instead of our being surprised when somebody from an ethnic
minority is appointed, the surprise will be when there is no ethnic
minority candidate. Getting to such a position would be a significant
change. Surely a new, high-profile SAP is part of delivering
that.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column201" />Column number: 201</div><a name="09020369000225"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020369000475"></a>Paul
Holmes:</b> I have listened with great interest to the
Minister. He has thrown more light on what I said earlier&#151;I was
not sure how having an SAP of 10, 15, 20 or however many people would
solve the problem of the lack of people coming forward for positions
such as chief constable. He referred to his background in education. I,
too, was a teacher, and there was a much more decentralised system. All
the way through schools, middle management were encouraged to develop
people&#146;s skills. The Government set up the National College for
School Leadership in Nottingham, which was very effective, but things
are more decentralised now. There are 3,000 secondary schools, whereas
there are only 43 chief constables and police authorities, but to what
extent is relying on one small panel of people, rather than embedding
career development all the way through the system, the
answer?</div>
<a name="09020369000226"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020369000476"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> Change has taken place in the police service in
this country, and it is trying to embed career development. We can see
that if we look at the training and development that is taking place in
forces up and down the country. The police service is trying to do many
of the things that I am talking about from a national perspective
through the SAP. We are attempting to give development a strategic
direction. If I were to sum up what it is about, I would say that we
always need something to be the catalyst for change. Things will not
necessarily happen if people simply wish for them to happen. If we want
something to happen, we must create a mechanism and some sort of
process to drive it.</div>
<a name="09020369000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">To be fair to
the hon. Members for Chesterfield and for Bury St. Edmunds, they have
supported the SAP. If we get it right&#151;there will be tension
about that&#151;it will act as a dynamo, or as a catalyst for change.
It cannot change things from the centre, but it can create momentum
from the centre to support the work of individual forces. That and the
power to confer additional functions, should it prove necessary, are
important parts of the reform programme that is taking
place.</div><a name="09020369000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">Notwithstanding
some of the debate about the independence of the chair and the role of
this or that, the police service should sometimes take more credit for
the way in which it is trying to embrace some of the reforms. The
service is not the always the last bastion of resistance to proposals;
rather, it embraces change. However, sometimes, rightly, it asks us to
reflect on what a proposal will mean.</div>
<a name="09020369000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">We had a
great debate about clause 1, but clause 2 is a hugely significant
change. If the SAP works, which I believe it will, it will support the
police in bringing about the changes with respect to senior officers
that they, we and the communities of this country
want.</div><a name="09020369000230"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020369000477"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> I do not wish to detain the Committee too long. I
had not planned to speak to clause 3, but I noticed that it makes
provision
for</div><a name="09020369000358"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;payments
to senior officers who cease to hold office before the end of a fixed
term appointment.&#148;</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column202" />Column number: 202</div><a name="09020369000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">That caught my eye
because of the debate that we have just had, in which I quoted remarks
by the APA and ACPO about the current operation of the FTA regime. I
said that I was not strongly against it. Helpfully, the Minister added
that he had seen no empirical evidence that there were problems with
FTA. He said that there was anecdotal evidence, but that no evidence
had come across his desk that would lead him as a Minister to
reconsider the whole regime. Fair enough; so far, so good. I wonder,
therefore, why clause 3 takes specific steps to make such payments as I
just quoted. Is it because more and more senior officers are exiting
fixed-term appointments before the end of the due term? Otherwise, why
do we need this clause? I would have thought that that would be
provided for under existing legislation. I would be very grateful,
therefore, if he could explain why the provision in clause 3 is
necessary. Is it because there are more breaks in fixed-term
appointments than was the case
formerly?</div><a name="09020369000235"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020369000478"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> No. That is not the reason for this clause, as far
as I am aware&#151;I make that caveat. I have seen no evidence that
more breaks are occurring before the five years of a fixed term
contract are up. It is funny: when I looked at clause 3, I thought,
&#147;I know what the hon. Gentleman will ask: why are you saying
this when you have clause 3?&#148;</div>
<a name="09020369000236"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020369000479"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> You were one step ahead of
me.</div><a name="09020369000237"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020369000480"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> I only just thought of it, but the hon. Gentleman
probably thought of it earlier, which is why he asked the
question.</div><a name="09020369000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
all seriousness, there is no ulterior motive for the clause. It does
not seek to fix any problem. Given the focus on performance, the
enhanced role of police authorities and the operation of PDRs for chief
constables, which is being looked at by Her Majesty&#146;s
inspectorate of constabulary, it seems appropriate to include in the
Bill the possibility of building in flexibility. Were more terminations
to occur&#151;I do not expect or desire that to happen&#151;the
clause would provide the flexibility for police authorities to act
appropriately and properly with respect to chief officers. It will give
them the opportunity to pay the appropriate compensation to chief
officers, should they choose to leave or should it be agreed that they
leave before the end of their fixed term contract. I hope that those
remarks satisfy the hon.
Gentleman.</div><a name="09020369000239"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020369000481"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> I am struggling to understand why there are not
arrangements under existing statute or common law in respect of a
senior officer who wishes to terminate his service before the expiry of
the fixed term. I do not know how the system operated before the Bill
was drafted. What problem is the clause seeking to deal with? Did
provisions under statute or certain cases cause difficulty so that such
a clause was required? I am genuinely puzzled about whether such
matters were catered for prior to the
Bill.</div><a name="09020369000240"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020369000482"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> Again, the answer is no. The hon. Gentleman might
be surprised to know that such matters were not dealt with under
statute but, given some of the proposed changes in the performance
framework, the Bill has 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column203" />Column number: 203</div>provided the opportunity to include a provision so that there is
legislative ability to deal with matters should it be necessary in
future. First, there was not a statutory ability to take such action.
Secondly, a problem has not arisen but if a problem arose in the
future, we will have the ability to deal with it if we wish to do
so.</div><a name="09020369000241"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020369000485"></a>Paul
Holmes:</b> With a mind to what Sir Nicholas said at this
morning&#146;s sitting about the fact that we had had an extensive
debate and that we wanted to make some progress on the Bill, and with a
view to the fact that in most Committees of which I have been a member
in the past eight years, all too often, we only get through the first
two thirds of the Bill and do not reach the important parts, I shall be
brief about the amendments and new clause 3. We went through all the
arguments that lie behind those provisions this morning and there is no
point in repeating them in detail two or three hours later given that
anyone can read the record of our
proceedings.</div><a name="09020369000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
a nutshell, amendments 59, 60 and 61 would remove the power for the
Secretary of State to oversee and have the final say over approval of
the appointment of assistant commissioners of the Metropolitan police.
New clause 3 would do the same, in effect, in respect of the Secretary
of State&#146;s power to have the final say about the appointment of
chief constables and assistant 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column204" />Column number: 204</div>chief constables the length and breadth of England and Wales. Our
argument is the same as it was in respect of new clauses 2 and 4, which
is that that there should be a major devolution of power away from the
centre&#151;from London and central Government&#151;to local
authorities and local communities. It is hard therefore to understand
why there should be a need for the Secretary of State to exercise power
over the appointment of the most senior police officers, whether in
Derbyshire, Northumberland, Wales or London. All the arguments about
decentralising power that were made this morning apply to the
amendments under
discussion.</div><a name="09020369000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am sure that the Minister will explain in a minute why he disagrees
with my argument. I shall not press the amendment to a Division because
we know that the Labour party and the Conservative party would oppose
it, albeit for different reasons. Before the Minister explains why I am
completely wrong, which we can take as read from this morning&#146;s
debate, will he pick up on a couple of points about the existing powers
of the Secretary of State with regard to senior police officers and
chief constables? We recently had a debate about the position in London
with the Metropolitan police. There is a slightly strange situation, as
both the Secretary of State and the Mayor of London are supposed to
make the decisions about the final appointment of the Metropolitan
Police Commissioner and the dismissal of the person in that post. We
had a two-way debate and hoo-hah about exactly who should be pulling
the plug on Sir Ian Blair, for example. The Mayor took the initiative
on
that.</div><a name="09020369000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">What
exactly does the Minister see as the role of the Secretary of State in
deciding who should be the most senior police officer in London? I
accept that that is complicated by the fact that, unusually, all chief
constables in London are automatically heads of the Government&#146;s
anti-terrorist strategy for the whole nation. With regard to chief
constables throughout England and Wales in general, in the other 42
police authority areas, will the Minister explain why the Secretary of
State needs that power? Why does a central Government Minister need to
decide, yes or no, whether someone should be the chief
constable?</div><a name="09020369000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is also the power to dismiss chief constables. I believe that that was
last used in Derbyshire in 1990, nearly 20 years ago. The power is not
widely used at all, and I am not sure when it was last used before
1990. I would be interested to know why the Government believe that the
Secretary of State should be the person to exercise that power, rather
than the local police authority which, by whatever process&#151;its
members are elected or appointed at the moment&#151;represents its
local community and does the interviews for that senior post, yet can
then be gainsaid and overruled by the Secretary of State from
London.</div><a name="09020369000252"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020369000486"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> Why in the amendment and in the clause do Liberal
Democrat Members and the Minister not see fit to refer to the Mayor of
London in relation to the appointments? This relates particularly to
the appointments below that of Metropolitan Police Commissioner. I
mention it only for highly topical reasons, which I am sure the
Minister will want to reflect on in his
remarks.</div><a name="09020369000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">Constitutionally,
the appointment of a new Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis is,
under British law as it is currently extant, a matter solely for the
Home Secretary&#151;in this case, the right hon. Member 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column205" />Column number: 205</div>for Redditch (Jacqui Smith). Of course, that was the case until the
current Mayor of London cleverly and brilliantly in many ways kicked
the door down and got a seat at the table at which the Home Secretary
interviewed candidates for the post of Metropolitan Police
Commissioner. Even though he had no constitutional basis for being
involved, he was involved by the Home Secretary. I think that she was
right to do that. Almost in defiance of what statute says, she
indicated that as a pragmatic move it would be unhelpful if any
Metropolitan Police Commissioner whom she appointed did not get on with
the Mayor of London, so what we have is an extremely interesting
constitutional grey area. The facts are manifest. It is clearly the
case that there has been some derogation of the power of the Home
Secretary solely to appoint the Metropolitan Police Commissioner; and
if there is an interesting grey area in relation to that post, the
Metropolitan police force appointments that are the subject of clause 4
might equally well be at
issue.</div><a name="09020369000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">Has
the Minister given any thought to putting the matter on a proper
statutory footing so that there is devastating clarity on the issue of
Metropolitan police force appointments? I am referring to the
appointments below Metropolitan Police Commissioner under
clause 4, but equally, for the avoidance of doubt, will the
Minister say what the position is now, so far as this Home Secretary is
concerned, when it comes to making an appointment to the position of
Metropolitan Police Commissioner? In the light of those topical events,
it would be useful to hear the Minister&#146;s views on the way in
which what happened in that case impacts on the other, more junior
appointments that are the subject of the
clause.</div><a name="09020369000255"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020369000487"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes an interesting point. I
point out to him that Boris Johnson would not be Mayor were it not for
the Government&#146;s reforms, which included making him chair of the
Metropolitan Police
Authority.</div><a name="09020369000256"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020369000488"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. I am drawing a line under the discussion
of the role of the Mayor of London. I ask hon. Members to return to the
amendments.</div><a name="09020369000257"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020369000489"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> The point that I was trying to make,
tongue-in-cheek, was that, of course, the Metropolitan Police Authority
is responsible for the Metropolitan police. Furthermore, on the issue
of Metropolitan police appointments, I would have thought that the hon.
Gentleman welcomed the fact that we have ensured in legislation that
the Mayor of London, whoever they are, chairs the Metropolitan Police
Authority.</div>
<a name="09020369000373"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.15
pm</div>
<a name="09020369000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">At the nub of
the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Chesterfield is the fact
that they would remove any provision to consult the Secretary of State.
They are good amendments in the sense that they would, for the first
time, give the Metropolitan Police Commissioner a role in the
appointment of some  ranks in which he&#151;or she, sometime
in the future, I hope&#151;has not been involved before. With due
respect to the hon. Gentleman, his amendment misses this point: the
three ranks of the Metropolitan Police Service&#151;
<div class="Column"><a name="Column206" />Column number: 206</div>commander, deputy assistant commissioner and assistant
commissioner&#151;to which the amendment refers, are equivalent to
chief constable, deputy chief constable and so on. The hon. Gentleman
does not need me to go through all that&#151;they are ACPO-ranked
officers.</div>
<a name="09020369000259"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Met is
important, because it comprises one quarter of the police service, but
many Met officers, and other senior police officers in the rest of the
country, hold responsibilities not only in the Metropolitan Police
Service, important as that is, or in their own force, but in ACPO for a
number of different things. For example, they have responsibilities for
knife crime and gangs, and national responsibilities for a range of
different things. That point also relates to the national
responsibilities of the commissioner and the deputy commissioner. I
have said this to the hon. Gentleman before, and I do not mean it
pejoratively or nastily, but if he, or the hon. Members for Hornchurch
and for Bury St. Edmunds, were in power and people were appointed to
positions that were not only important to the individual force but had
national implications, they would want to ensure that they had some
role in the appointment.</div>
<a name="09020369000260"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020369000490"></a>Paul
Holmes:</b> I have still not heard an explanation why the
Government feel they have to micro-manage the appointment of senior
police officers, whether they are senior officers in the Metropolitan
police, or assistant chief constables and chief constables throughout
the country, as in new clause 3. If professional people are to go for
the posts, having come up through the grooming process of the senior
appointments panel, and they are to be interviewed and appointed by the
relevant police authorities, whether in London or elsewhere, why do the
Government feel that they must micro-manage and second-guess the
process, saying, &#147;No, you&#146;ve made a bad appointment.
We&#146;re not going to accept that person&#148;? It may, or may
not, have happened with Sir Ian Blair recently, with the Mayor moving
in on that appointment, but the last time that it had happened in the
country was 1990 in Derbyshire. Why do the Government feel that they
must micro-manage these individual personnel
appointments?</div>
<a name="09020369000261"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020369000491"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> In the vast majority&#151;in fact, in almost
all&#151;cases, there is no micro-management, because the
recommendations of the police authority, or whoever it is, are
approved. However, as I have said, the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
amendments would remove any role for the Secretary of State, and many
of these people play important national strategic roles in serious and
organised crime, counter-terrorism and such things. The issue is not
about micro-management, but about ensuring that the Secretary of State
has a reserve power for the employment of those people. It is not about
their appointment to an individual police force. Given the seniority of
the role, it is about reflecting on the contribution that they would
make to the national policing agenda. That is a point of difference
between us. It is certainly not about trying to ensure that we are
involved in every single appointment of a senior police officer in this
country; it is about trying to ensure that we have the opportunity to
be involved where necessary.</div>
<a name="09020369000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">In certain
circumstances, it may be necessary for the Home Secretary to take
action directly to secure the removal of a chief officer under section
42 of the Police Act 1996. The hon. Gentleman made that point, and I 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column207" />Column number: 207</div>want to put this on record: there are cases where efficiency and
effectiveness questions are so severe that the Home Secretary needs the
power to act in the public interest, notwithstanding the actions of the
police authority. Examples of cases where that could have been required
include the need to restore confidence in Humberside police after the
Soham murders and in Sussex police after the shooting of James
Ashley.</div>
<a name="09020369000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although the
amendment would not necessarily affect the power in section 42, it is
clear for the reasons that I have given that the Secretary of State has
a role in relation to the removal of chief officers. That role should
be retained. With those comments, I urge the hon. Gentleman to withdraw
his amendments.</div>

clauses allow for separate collaboration agreements for police forces
and authorities, an arrangement carried over from current legislation
that preserves the important distinction between the functions of
police forces and police authorities. The amendment further clarifies
the position by ensuring that when police authorities make
collaboration agreements, the agreements will not capture staff under
the direction and control of a chief officer. To do otherwise would
lead to an intrusion from the police authority on a chief
constable&#146;s operational independence: in other words, the
independent control that he exercises over his staff. The amendment
seeks to make that distinction clear.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020369000495"></a>The

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020369000496"></a>Paul
Holmes:</b> The logic and rationale for amendments
56 to 58 can be taken as read from the detail of this morning&#146;s
debate. They are all part of the same principle. On amendment 56, for
example, we do not see why the Secretary of State should have to be
consulted if more 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column208" />Column number: 208</div>than six police forces decide to collaborate. I am not quite sure why
the arbitrary figure of six was chosen. Why not four or eight? Why is
it felt to be necessary that the Home Secretary should have the power
to say, &#147;Yes, we can have six police forces, or seven, or eight,
collaborating.&#148; It seems to be a completely unnecessary degree
of central control in a system that we would prefer to be devolved
completely to directly elected, responsible and powerful local police
authorities.</div><a name="09020369000274"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
same point arises in amendment 57. We do not see why the Secretary of
State should have the power to direct the police authorities in
collaboration arrangements. It is the same for amendment
58.</div><a name="09020369000275"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
response to amendment 57, the Minister might talk about the need to get
authorities to collaborate on terrorism issues. However, in July 2007,
when there was the terrorism issue, the Metropolitan Police Service
worked very closely with the police force in Leeds, for example,
without the need for prescribed direction from the centre. At the time
of the tube bombings, police forces all over the country worked very
closely with the Metropolitan police&#151;regular and ad hoc
collaboration&#151;because of that emergency. The following year, a
friend of mine, whose is a detective in Chesterfield, spent a lot of
time in London on a semi-permanent basis working with the Metropolitan
police to swell the ranks of the Criminal Investigation Department and
to investigate that major act of terrorism.</div>
<a name="09020369000276"></a><div class="hs_Para">Collaboration,
therefore, can and does take place, without the need for the Secretary
of State to make directions&#151;to say yes, to say no and so on.
That is all part of this morning&#146;s debate on new clauses 2 and 4
and, more recently, new clause 3. I do not see the rationale for
central Government having that degree of control over every decision
and action taken by police authorities around the
country.</div><a name="09020369000277"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020369000497"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Before I call the next speaker, I should say
that I have received indications that colleagues want to move fairly
quickly through the remaining three groups of amendments to clause 5,
which are largely technical in nature, in order to have a stand part
debate to discuss the general principles of
collaboration.</div><a name="09020369000278"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020369000498"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> Thank you for that clarification, Mr.
Bayley, of the order of business. I rise briefly to speak to amendment
55 in my name and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Hornchurch. It
would spell out that, in circumstances where the Secretary of State
might wish to terminate a collaboration agreement, the length
of</div>
<a name="09020369000359"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the period of
notice shall be such as the Secretary of State sees
fit&#148;.</div><a name="09020369000279"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
some circumstances&#151;perhaps not a national
emergency &#151;a collaboration agreement might be wholly
inadequate. I am thinking perhaps of pressing serious organised crime
problems or concerns. If the Secretary of State wished to terminate an
agreement, one would not want it to drag on for an unnecessarily long
time. The Opposition would not want the Secretary of State to be tied
to onerously long notice periods, which would fetter his ability to
take action in the face of an immediate problem, perhaps of a regional
or even a national kind. The wording in the amendment is for the
avoidance of doubt.</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column209" />Column number: 209</div><a name="09020369000280"></a><div class="hs_Para">Proposed new
section 23H(1)
reads:</div><a name="09020369000360"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Secretary of State may terminate a collaboration agreement by notice to
the parties to the
agreement.&#148;</div><a name="09020369000281"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
could construe those words to mean that the notice period should be
determined by the Secretary of State. In the circumstances that I have
outlined, that would seem to provide for the proper discretion that
Ministers will seek in responding to short-term and pressing problems.
I hope that those do not occur, but the unforeseen sometimes
does&#151;if that is not self-contradictory. In that spirit of
clarification and enhancing the drafting of the clause, I offer my
amendment.</div><a name="09020369000374"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.30
pm</div><a name="09020369000282"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020369000499"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> I shall run quickly through the amendments,
bearing it in mind that people have asked to get to the clause stand
part debate. Amendment 55 adds detail to the Secretary of
State&#146;s power to terminate an agreement. That detail, should the
scenario arise, would help to ensure that the Secretary of State makes
clear to those collaborating the time frame within which the joint
arrangements should cease. There is something in that amendment, but I
ask for it to be withdrawn. I will have a look at the issue and come
back to it on Report, if necessary. It is a reasonable amendment to
have made, however, and it might add something to the clause.</div>
<a name="09020369000283"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 56
would remove the requirement for a chief constable or police authority
to consult the Secretary of State when making a collaboration agreement
involving six or more forces. Six is the biggest number in a police
force region. We are not saying that such an agreement should not
happen; but if a limit is not established, we could be talking about
something almost the size of the north of England. We therefore think
it necessary for there to be a limit above which the Secretary of State
should be consulted. That does not mean that such a thing should not
happen or that we would say no, but if it starts to get beyond that
size, it is appropriate that the Secretary of State should have a role
and be consulted.</div>
<a name="09020369000284"></a><div class="hs_Para">I oppose the
idea of removing all the Secretary of State&#146;s direction-making
powers or her ability to terminate an agreement; that is not the right
way to proceed. The ability to direct agreements or to terminate those
that have gone wrong is not something that one necessarily wants, but
we cannot have a situation in which the Secretary of State does not
have that power.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020369000501"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> I will give way to the hon. Gentleman, but I know
the point that he is going to make. When he is Home Secretary, I will
get someone to sit on the Committee of the relevant Bill and ask him
whether he thinks he should give up that power. I honestly do not
believe that he would.</div>
<a name="09020369000287"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020369000502"></a>Paul
Holmes:</b> I appreciate that we are talking about a whole
culture change. It would be a huge culture shock for any
Minister&#151;be it policing, education, or health&#151;to give up
micro-managing all these aspects of life. The Minister said that it
could not happen and it could not work, but it does in most western
democratic countries, where central Governments do not have power over 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column210" />Column number: 210</div>decisions on local health provision, the police force, education and so
forth. It is a culture shock that one day, hopefully, the British
Government will get to grips
with.</div>
<a name="09020369000288"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020369000503"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> I am interested in the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
local decision making. If I may digress slightly, the next time he has
a debate and he goes on about postcode provision, I shall come back to
him about local delivery of services. Again, when he is Home Secretary,
he will get not only what I have just said, but the demand for the
local services that I have just asked for. When it comes to postcode
provision, with one thing being available in one area and not available
in the next, he will then get a demand for him not to give local
democracy out, but to take it back, because people do not always like
difference. Perhaps that is also something for him to think
about.</div>
<a name="09020369000289"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020369000504"></a>Mr.
Burns:</b> The Minister said that amendment 55 could possibly
have merit and gave the Committee the commitment that he would look at
it again to see whether it should be incorporated into the Bill,
without giving any commitment that that would happen. Given that he is
a decent and honourable man, if, on reflection, he comes to the
conclusion that amendment 55 has merit and should be included, will he
be kind enough on Report to table the amendment, standing in the name
of my hon. Friend the Member for Bury St. Edmunds, who dreamt it
up?</div><a name="09020369000290"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020369000505"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> I am not sure that I can go that far, if I am
really honest. It is a kind offer and I know that the hon. Member for
West Chelmsford is only trying to save me a good deal of work. Should
that not be possible&#151;I have reservations about whether it will
be&#151;but should I, on reflection, find it appropriate for the
Government to table an amendment similar if not identical to amendment
55, I shall be profuse in my praise. Perhaps that would
help.</div><a name="09020369000291"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020369000506"></a>Mr.

Coaker:</b> I am sorry, Mr. Bayley. We have been at
it a long time and I know that we are due to finish. The serious point
is that amendment 55 is something we need to look at; it is an
important point. I do not see how we could remove any requirement for
the Secretary of State to be consulted. There is a need for the
Secretary of State to be consulted above six forces or more, which is
the size of the biggest region. It is important for the Secretary of
State to retain powers to direct where necessary and to terminate an
agreement where
necessary.</div><a name="09020369000295"></a><div class="hs_Para">With

procedures for achieving a settlement of all outstanding financial and
legal liabilities between parties upon a party terminating its
contractual obligations under a collaboration
agreement.&#146;.</div><a name="09020369000299"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am conscious that we need to whip through the amendments, but I would
like to take a little more than a minute to speak to my amendment,
which is of a technical nature. I want to spend a bit of time saying
why it is important. I hope that the Minister will humour me with this
amendment as much as he did with the last. If he takes my earlier
amendment on board, and gives me credit for it, it will be his personal
contribution to my personal development review process. I would be
hugely
grateful.</div><a name="09020369000300"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
53 is important because we all believe, whichever political party we
represent, in the critical importance of partnership working in
tackling and fighting crime. As we have said before, and as everyone
knows and understands, the police cannot solve, prevent and detect
crime on their own, but require co-operative efforts with parts of the
health service, local government and so on. Delivering greater
partnership working&#151;this would be true no matter which
Government were in office&#151;requires a certain amount of pooling
of budgets. The issue of pooling of budgets is the same with police
authorities and police
forces.</div><a name="09020369000301"></a><div class="hs_Para">Alongside
the concept of putting money into a pot, as Sir Norman Bettison last
week and many others have indicated, is the issue of what he called the
net donor problem. When different forces and authorities in policing
come together in a collaboration agreement, there will be winners and
losers&#151;different authorities have different cost bases, and his
net donor point was well set out in his
evidence.</div><a name="09020369000302"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
us look at how pooling arrangements operate outside a police
collaboration set-up&#151;I am arguing by analogy here. Crime
fighting partners might be a drug action team, a local authority or a
parish council that has earmarked money for crime fighting from its
parish council precept. There are now pooling arrangements or
agreements under which different partners come together and put their
money into the crime fighting pot to achieve an
objective.</div><a name="09020369000303"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
anyone who has looked at the pooling of crime fighting budgets&#151;I
know that the Minister has&#151;will understand that it is pretty
much a hit-and-miss affair. It can be shambolic if the pooling
arrangements are not set down clearly in a contract and,
crucially&#151;this is what the amendment is about&#151;unless
there are clear procedures for what happens on exit. If any one partner
that brings x to the pot wants to go away with that money halfway
through the arrangement, it can be a mess. That is the experience of
those in local government and those involved with crime and disorder
reduction partnership arrangements to whom I have spoken. There will be
legal arguments about who owes what to whom and so
on.</div><a name="09020369000304"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
is an argument by analogy: in the Children Act 2004, there are clear
arrangements that encourage and support local authorities and their
partners to pool budgets when that will improve delivery, especially of
health care. However, the arrangements pursuant to that Act have shown
us that it is absolutely critical to write down the arrangements for
pooling up front.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column212" />Column number: 212</div><a name="09020369000305"></a><div class="hs_Para">People in the
Local Government Association have advised me that best practice would
involve a written, up-front agreement. The agreement should say to all
signatory partners that there should be a clear objective, a clear set
of service standards, an agreed performance framework and a clear
statement of the expected life of the pooling
arrangements.</div><a name="09020369000306"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
agreement should also say how any underspend or overspend in the pool
will be dealt with, how accountability and responsibility will operate
in relation to the pool and how to work with the differing VAT and
charging arrangements and different budgetary cycles that might apply
to each partner. It should deal with the use and disposal of fixed
assets that are brought to the pool by partners who wish to co-operate
in a pooling arrangement. Those arrangements should all be written
down.</div><a name="09020369000307"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
agreement should also include the delegation of financial
responsibility and say whose standing orders should be used. It should
set out in advance human resources arrangements for transferring staff
and whether TUPE&#151;the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of
Employment) Regulations 1981 and 2006&#151;applies. It should say how
to build staff time and capacity into spending the pooled
budget.</div><a name="09020369000308"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09020369000512"></a><b class="B">James
Brokenshire</b> (Hornchurch) (Con): My hon. Friend makes a
clear case for certainty, but does he agree that we should consider not
only the legal challenge, but the performance target challenge? Various
organisations seek to pool services and budgets at local level have
told me that they find it quite difficult because, in essence, a budget
that one partner agency&#151;for example, a primary care
trust&#151;might wish to use could be used externally to satisfy a
different performance target. It is almost as if a partner is brought
into the pool in a hidden way: even if it wants to join to achieve a
wider end, it is a question of ticking the right box to achieve
it.</div><a name="09020369000309"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020369000513"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> My hon. Friend makes an excellent point, because
the burden of my argument, in a different context, is that pooling
throws up all sorts of issues&#151;he has added one to the list that
I was
enumerating.</div><a name="09020369000310"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
experience of parts of public service outwith policing is that many
bodies think that they are operating a proper, formal pooling
arrangement in partnership. We applaud and embrace such collaborative
working and cross-cutting departmental efforts. To repeat: we do not
believe that the police should be the only people tasked with
delivering crime reduction and crime fighting. However, in contexts
outwith law and order, those who have no formal arrangements or
agreements&#151;if they do not have an up-front, written agreement
about what happens on exit or withdrawal&#151;can suddenly find that
they have let themselves in for all sorts of
liabilities.</div><a name="09020369000311"></a><div class="hs_Para">Anecdotal
evidence suggests that disagreements can be difficult to resolve, but,
in addition, arguing over compromises about what should happen if one
partner prematurely, for unforeseen reasons, wants to exit can take up
a lot of management
time.</div><a name="09020369000375"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.45
pm</div><a name="09020369000312"></a><div class="hs_Para">Arguing
by analogy, then, it seems that the same problem might be in the offing
if we have more and more collaborative agreements involving police
authorities, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column213" />Column number: 213</div>chief constables and their forces. That is why my amendment
53 says that any such collaboration
agreement</div><a name="09020369000361"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;shall
include procedures for achieving a settlement of all outstanding
financial and legal liabilities between parties upon a party
terminating its contractual obligations under a collaboration
agreement.&#148;</div><a name="09020369000313"></a><div class="hs_Para">Rather
like my earlier amendment, this amendment seeks to strengthen, improve
and build on the thrust of the clause, rather than to undermine it. We
need that clarification about collaboration arrangements, of which I
hope there will be many more, whether under this Government or a future
Government of whatever stripe.</div>
<a name="09020369000314"></a><div class="hs_Para">We must
ensure that such agreements are carried out in a wholly professional
way, and we should not rely on good will or that things will be alright
on the night. As I have said, too many co-operation and partnership
agreements fall foul of the highest standards of planning and
governance. While one would not want to be bureaucratic, my amendment
signals that collaboration agreements will be written&#151;we will
get on to this in the clause stand part debate&#151;that they will be
very detailed and that they will have to cover as many eventualities as
possible. That is why clear procedures should be written into
contractual arrangements.</div>
<a name="09020369000315"></a><div class="hs_Para">I know of
individuals who have been on one side of contractual negotiations in
private finance initiative contracts, though not in relation to the
Home Office. In one PFI contract, the most obvious, boilerplate clause
was seen to be so blindingly obvious that neither the legal advisers to
the financiers on one side of the negotiations nor the civil servants
on the Whitehall side of negotiations thought of putting it in, and
there were problems as a result. When push came to shove and the
unforeseen happened, there was disagreement and argument with the
attendant waste of management time in working out what was to be done.
In the spirit of tightening arrangements for collaboration agreements,
I proffer this amendment in my name and that of my hon. Friend the
Member for
Hornchurch.</div><a name="09020369000316"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020369000514"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> Having received my orders from two separate
sources, I shall be brief. Without wishing to carry on the love-in, I
accept what the hon. Gentleman has just said and that he seeks to add
value to the clause, but there is an issue with the amendment. I accept
that financial and legal liabilities might be issues, but there might
be other areas to be sorted out, such as staffing and equipment. I draw
his attention to proposed new section 23F in clause 5, which is on page
7. It refers to guidance with respect to collaboration agreements,
which is something that I will emphasise in the clause stand part
debate. Regarding the amendment, I make a commitment to include some of
the points he made in the guidance, because that is
important.</div>
<a name="09020369000317"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also stress
the importance of the second part of proposed new section 23F, which
states:</div><a name="09020369000362"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In
discharging their functions, chief officers and police authorities must
have regard to the guidance.&#148;</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column214" />Column number: 214</div><a name="09020369000318"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that that answers
the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point and with that I ask him to withdraw
his
amendment.</div><a name="09020369000319"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020369000515"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="09020369000320"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,
by leave,
withdrawn.</i></div><a name="09020369000321"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020369000516"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> I beg to move amendment 54, in clause 5,
page 7, line 21, leave out paragraph (b). I
will be brief. We seek to firm up the obligation for the collaboration
agreement to be published. The amendment deletes what I consider a
weakening of that overriding obligation to publish the agreement
because the sub-clause that I seek to delete states that the
alternative to full publication would be
to</div><a name="09020369000363"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;publish
the fact that the agreement has been made and such other details about
it as the person thinks
appropriate.&#148;</div><a name="09020369000322"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
the world of transparency in which we all say we believe and want to
work towards, there should be a straightforward commitment and duty to
publish the agreement, not to state the fact that an agreement exists.
Again, in the spirit of honest and probing inquiry, I rest my
remarks.</div><a name="09020369000323"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020369000517"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> I understand the point that the hon. Member for
Bury St. Edmunds is trying to make about transparency with respect to
collaboration agreements. However, the Bill as drafted does balance the
need for transparency and operational effectiveness and I believe that
the balance as currently constructed in the Bill is right. I know that
this is not his intention, but I am concerned that if his amendment
were accepted and the argument was taken to the logical conclusion of
saying that collaboration agreements carte blanche have to be
published, there might be a case in which the location of firearms
units, firearms officers and other sensitive policing matters might
have to be put into the public domain. I do not think that it is his
intention to compromise operational integrity, but it might be an
unintended consequence of his amendment. I hope that he will withdraw
the amendment. It is my intention, because I believe it is important,
that as much as possible should be published without compromising the
operational effectiveness of those police forces that have put together
that
agreement.</div><a name="09020369000324"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020369000518"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> Having regard to the Minister&#146;s comments,
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="09020369000325"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,
by leave,
withdrawn.</i></div><a name="09020369000326"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Ordered,

adjourned. &#151;<i class="I">(Mr.
Austin.)</i></div><a name="09020369000376"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.54
pm</div><a name="09020369000327"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Adjourned
