<a name="09030427000013"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09030427000139"></a><b class="B">John
Robertson</b> (Glasgow, North-West) (Lab): This is the first
time I have spoken under your chairmanship, Mr. Amess. I
feel I should have something like in a Perry Mason court case, where
one can ask the stenographer to repeat the last sentence the last
person said. I was getting so enthusiastic about my speech that I
forgot to mark exactly where I did finish. I know you have missed the
whole thing, so perhaps I should start from the beginning&#151;and
then again, perhaps I had better not. I suspect that people have heard
it before.</div>
<a name="09030427000014"></a><div class="hs_Para">But let me
just recap what I was trying to say: &#147;Government wrong, me
right&#148; would be a short summary. Grandparents are most
important: as one myself, as I said earlier, I may have a vested
interest, but I think that interest has certainly opened my eyes to
something important. I was going to say that there is obviously a
question of fairness and equality to be looked
at.</div><a name="09030427000015"></a><div class="hs_Para">When
a person is caring for a child in a family instead of working, whether
it is a parent or a grandparent, why should we discriminate in regard
to their pension? I know that has been said, but it should be repeated:
why do we discriminate against grandparents? Perhaps my right hon.
Friend the Minister will be able to tell me in his reply. This new
clause is not about paying someone for the care; after all, there is no
gain for someone who is already receiving the full state
pension.</div>
<a name="09030427000016"></a><div class="hs_Para">The current
situation means that, if a mother stays at home to care for a child,
she will get a weekly credit toward her pension. But if she returns to
work and her own mother provides the child care, the grandmother will
get nothing. It is not clear to me why that should be the case, and I
hope my right hon. Friend will explain. The mother in that scenario is
in work, and will probably be paying tax and national insurance, and
not claiming. Working parents also help to raise the family&#146;s
income and tackle child poverty, one of the Government&#146;s
fundamental goals.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column282" />Column number: 282</div><a name="09030427000017"></a><div class="hs_Para">It might be
suggested that there is an element of double claim here. But
grandparental child care means that the mother will not be claiming
child care tax credit, because informal child care does not qualify. It
seems as though we have got the incentives wrong.</div>
<a name="09030427000018"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Pensions
Act 2007 was groundbreaking, giving unpaid care the same status as paid
work for the first time. That was particularly welcome to women, who
bear the brunt of caring roles in our society. Only 35 per cent. of
women currently retire with the full basic state pension. That is a
shockingly low percentage, and I am glad to say that my Government and
my party are trying to do their best to alleviate the problem. This is
the kind of reform for which we sometimes do not receive the credit we
deserve. I am now looking for my Government and my party to pass this
new clause, in order to look after grandparents in the same way we look
after everybody else.</div>
<a name="09030427000019"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030427000140"></a>The
Minister for Employment and Welfare Reform (Mr. Tony
McNulty):</b> It is a great pleasure to welcome you in the
flesh as well as in the spirit, Mr. Amess, as I am sure you
were with us this morning. As my hon. Friend has said, new clause 9
seeks to give contribution credits to help people caring for a
grandchild under 12 to build up their state pension. It seeks also to
give similar rights to people caring for 20 hours a week for a partner,
relative or friend who is sick, frail or disabled, which is in fact
already Government policy.</div>
<a name="09030427000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would say
to my hon. Friend in the nicest way possible that his new clause is
deficient in a number of ways on both counts&#151;in terms of
grandparents and carers of the disabled. Let me explain why and review
them both in turns. As he said, a wide power exists in section 23A of
the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992. That allows
regulations to be made to define people engaged in caring with a view
to awarding them credits. He also perfectly fairly said that
regulations are currently being drafted under the provision, which will
be laid before Parliament this year. We think those draft regulations
will go further than his new clause does in terms of the part about
caring for a sick or disabled person.</div>
<a name="09030427000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
regulations propose that contribution credits be awarded to someone
caring for one or more persons for a total of 20 hours a week where
each person is receiving one of a range of attendance-related benefits,
or where the need for care is certified by a health or social care
professional. They also propose cover for periods when care ceases for
a time to allow for, among other things, holidays, respite care and
sickness. In that respect, therefore, the new clause offers nothing
more and will almost certainly restrict the conditions under which
credits can be given to someone caring for a sick or disabled
person.</div>
<a name="09030427000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">I turn now to
the proposals to award credits to grandparents caring for a grandchild
under 12. We recognise the significant contribution&#151;as my hon.
Friend has said&#151;that grandparents make to the community.
However, they are not a homogeneous group. Many grandparents will be
over state pension age and unable to benefit from credits; many of the
younger grandparents will be combining caring with employment. We
sincerely believe, like my hon. Friend, that the improvements we have
already introduced will greatly increase the likelihood that those
younger grandparents will qualify for a full 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column283" />Column number: 283</div>basic state pension. In most cases they will have received home
responsibilities protection when bringing up their own children, and
that is to be converted to qualifying years of credit from 2010. That,
together with the reduction in the number of qualifying years for a
full basic state pension to 30, and the opportunity introduced in the
most recent Pensions Act to buy voluntary contributions for past
periods, will mean that very few grandparents will need additional
credits. It is estimated that by 2025 almost half a million extra women
over state pension age will be entitled to full basic state pension as
a result of these reforms. I will, therefore, ask my hon. Friend the
Member for Glasgow, North-West to withdraw the clause.</div>
<a name="09030427000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am,
however, aware of the strength of opinion favouring some special
recognition for grandparents who may, in some cases, give up their own
prospects so that they can help their children. We are considering
whether any further provision is needed for them and we will not limit
that consideration to grandparents since similar care may equally be
given by aunts, uncles and older siblings. We are satisfied, though,
that if we do conclude that such provision is useful, there is already
scope to provide that within secondary legislation. I am happy to work
with my hon. Friend both on the forthcoming regulations and on any
consultations we make in terms of a special recognition of grandparents
and other groups. In that spirit I ask that he withdraw the new clause
but am happy to continue working with him on the matter because I agree
with the sentiment and thrust of his
argument.</div>
<a name="09030427000024"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030427000141"></a>John
Robertson:</b> I thank my right hon. Friend for his gracious
offer, which I am glad to take up. I will consider what he has said and
in the same spirit of helpfulness, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
motion.</div><a name="09030427000025"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Clause,
by leave,
withdrawn.</i></div><a name="09030427000008"></a>

is a pleasure to see you here in the flesh, Mr. Amess, as
well as having you here in spirit this morning. Members will recall
that on Second Reading, the Secretary of State, in answer to a point by
another hon. Member, said that he would consider the idea of a claimant
charter. He
said:</div><a name="09030427000109"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I
am aware that the idea has been suggested by Gingerbread, as well as by
my hon. Friend, and it has a lot of promise. We want to consider how we
can make sure that it is not restrictive and does not become a
lawyer&#146;s charter. As I will argue, we want to move towards a
more flexible system based on personalised conditionality. If we are to
do so, we need to look at how individuals can know that they will be
treated fairly.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official Report,
Welfare Reform Public Bill Committee, </i>27 January 2009; c.
182.]</div><a name="09030427000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
last statement from the Secretary of State is pertinent to the new
clause which has been prepared in conjunction with the Disability
Alliance, which includes Gingerbread, Citizens Advice and Child Poverty
Action Group. With the new clause, we seek to set out clearly the
rights and obligations of the jobcentre and the various private
providers and voluntary organisations that work under contract with
Jobcentre Plus. It would also set out clearly the claimant&#146;s
rights and responsibilities.</div>
<a name="09030427000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am sure
that the Minister for Employment and Welfare Reform knows, from his
time at the Home Office, that when people arrive in or leave the UK,
they can see a clear charter on a board, at every Border and
Immigration Agency entry point, setting out what the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column285" />Column number: 285</div>agency will and will not do, and how someone who is dissatisfied with
the service that it has provided can deal with those regrets. Many hon.
Members feel that, given the groundbreaking nature of the Bill, a
similar charter should be produced for claimants. Our probing new
clause, with which we hope to establish how far the Government are
prepared to consider these ideas, sets out our belief that claimants
should be handed a copy of the charter at the first stage, at their
first interview, so that they know what is involved. It should not
matter whether they are dealing with Jobcentre Plus or an independent
agency.</div><a name="09030427000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
second provision concerns an issue that we have discussed this
morning&#151;how any sanctions that are imposed might impinge on a
claimant&#146;s ability to subsist. We think it important to set out
that sanctions should not force a person into a situation in which they
or their family are unable to subsist. If that happens, the sanction
system is not working.</div>
<a name="09030427000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">The third
provision is about being treated with dignity and respect. That is the
kind of treatment that one should expect from JCP officers anyway, but
such expectations are clearly stated in most charters. Again, the next
provision states that claimants should not be subject to degrading or
discriminatory treatment. During these debates, we have discussed how
people with disabilities, and people with drug and alcohol problems,
might be treated. The Minister has assured us that agendas will be
personalised and will take account of such issues. If so, there should
be no problem with stating up front that that should
happen.</div><a name="09030427000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
next provision is about what should happen after the initial meeting
and after the contract has been agreed. Once it has been set out what
must happen in the next few weeks, which of the three categories the
claimant might be put into, and what action is required, there should
be a clear, written statement setting out what will happen next. A big
and common complaint of people dealing with Government Departments is
that it takes an age for paperwork and agreements to be dealt with; I
am sure that other hon. Members have experienced that. What we are
saying is that once someone is registered and an agreement has been
made, they should be provided with timely and accurate information and
benefits, so that they do not end up in the situation that currently
occurs with benefits and other payments such as housing benefit, in
which applicants are forced to take out crisis loans because of delays.
Clearly, the system is not working if that situation
arises.</div><a name="09030427000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
next provision is about monitoring the process. I know that it is
common practice for Government Departments and bodies such as Jobcentre
Plus to monitor and record phone calls. From my experience of dealing
with such issues, recording such calls has made it possible to resolve
disputes, so we want that to happen. One slight change is something
that I feel strongly about&#151;the use of 0845 numbers. Currently,
people who need to phone up to get information about their benefits
spend disproportionate amounts of money getting through. The Government
are reviewing the use of freefone and 0845 numbers, but the new clause
states that such phone calls should be free, so that exercising a claim
or dealing with a query does not cost the claimant any
money.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column286" />Column number: 286</div><a name="09030427000114"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.15
pm</div><a name="09030427000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
next provision is about an appeal against a decision&#151;when the
claimant feels that the sanction or the agreement is unfair. Members of
the Disability Alliance want the establishment of a separate employment
services ombudsman, but we think that that would be a duplication. The
parliamentary ombudsman&#146;s remit has this year been extended to
include health care issues, and when a claimant feels that they have
been hard done by they should be able to go to the parliamentary
ombudsman. She would be able to set out the situation clearly. The
ombudsman would not deal with day-to-day issues; they would be dealt
with through the internal appeals process.</div>
<a name="09030427000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am sure
that the Minister will agree with the next measure, which would ensure
high-quality provision that was tailored to the individual&#146;s
needs. During the passage of the Bill, we have raised many concerns
about the ability of JCP to deliver that high-quality, personalised
service, so the charter should say clearly, &#147;This is the level
of service and this will take full account of your needs. If not, there
is a process through which you can go in order to
appeal.&#148;</div>
<a name="09030427000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">The next
provision in the charter would deal with the issues surrounding someone
who was involved in the process. Will there be adequate child care? On
the issue of including lone parents, we have voiced concerns to ensure
that there will be adequate child care with which the parent is happy,
not something that the Department imposes. If the parent has to travel
to an office, reasonable transport costs should be reimbursed, and the
measure sets out provisions for any interview costs that might be
incurred.</div>
<a name="09030427000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">The next
provision deals with the situation when appropriate child care or
support is not in place. If the claimant is a carer, they should not be
forced into undertaking an activity that prevents them from discharging
their wider activities.</div>
<a name="09030427000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">The next
point, which the TUC raised in its submission, refers to the situation
in which work experience becomes work. No one on work experience should
substitute for a real worker. If they do, they should receive the going
wage for that job. That is a reasonable point to build into a
claim.</div>
<a name="09030427000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, the
claimant should be able to get free, independent and appropriate
advice. If a claimant were involved in drugs or had a mental health
problem, organisations such as Mind would be appropriate for the
provision of independent advice to the claimant. It often does so
already, and the claimant should get advice on where to go.</div>
<a name="09030427000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
provisions of the charter are not fixed. I hope that the Minister will
accept the way in which the new clause has been introduced. Given the
Secretary of State&#146;s willingness to consider a charter, I hope
that if the Minister is not able to accept the measure, he will advise
us how it will be put on the statute book, so that we have a clear
claimants charter that sets out those rights and responsibilities by
Report stage or by the time the Bill completes its stages in both
Houses and the scheme is in
operation.</div><a name="09030427000042"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09030427000143"></a><b class="B">Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030427000144"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I call James
Purnell.</div><a name="09030427000044"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030427000145"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:</b> There is a slight difference between us,
Mr. Amess. I have listened carefully to the speech by the
hon. Member for Rochdale, and it sounds as though he has presented us
with something of a long wish list for a state of perfection right
across the whole benefit system. What he has described is what many of
us might, indeed, wish to see, but will he accept from me that in
reality the benefit system works pretty well for the large majority of
claimants who use
it?</div><a name="09030427000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although
I agree with the hon. Gentleman that we should always strive to improve
the quality of service that we offer to claimants, I can see problems
in the charter that he is proposing&#151;for example, with
workability, costs and the bureaucracy that would arise from several of
his proposals. The main point to which I want to see if he will respond
is, if we are going to seek to improve the benefit system by
introducing a charter, does he accept that it should be half a charter?
He seems to have written a charter that focuses on rights but says
nothing at all about responsibilities. Although I wonder why he is
proposing what is in the regulations list, if we look through his
charter, it is not balanced by the responsibilities that exist in
relation to claimants. If we are going to go down the road of having a
charter, does he accept that both need to be set out?</div>
<a name="09030427000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to
give some examples of where the hon. Gentleman would need to balance
rights and responsibilities in the draft charter that he has presented.
For example, why are paragraphs (c) and (d) of subsection (3) not
balanced by an obligation on the part of claimants not to be abusive to
jobcentre staff? In relation to paragraph (e), in which he talks about
information, why does he not balance that with an obligation on
applicants to provide all the relevant information to someone who has
tried to process their benefit at the time they are seeking to do so?
Why does he not balance paragraph (f) with an obligation on claimants
to provide timely information to support their application, or balance
paragraph (i) with a commitment to take up all the appropriate training
and work-related courses to which one is directed? Why not balance
paragraph (n) by a reference to following through all the relevant
advice that is given? My main point is&#151;I shall be grateful if
the hon. Gentleman will respond to this&#151;does he think that if
there is to be a charter, it needs to cover both sides of the
equation?</div><a name="09030427000047"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030427000146"></a>Paul
Rowen:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving me
an opportunity to reply. I agree totally with the point he has made. I
was careful in my remarks to say that the new clause was being proposed
to stimulate discussion following the Secretary of State&#146;s
statement on Second Reading. I accept, as I said during my speech, that
it is a matter of rights and responsibilities. I do not see my
proposals as being written in tablets of stone. I hope that we can
agree to take something away from the debate and come back at some
future stage with a charter that has had input from a wide group of
people and that does exactly what he is saying. Such a charter should
set out not only the duties of the Department and providers, but the
duty of the claimant. I have focused on the rights of the Department,
the JCP and private providers because, in many respects, the Bill
considerably changes the relationship between them.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column288" />Column number: 288</div><a name="09030427000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill sets
out in great detail what the claimant can and cannot do. We have had
much discussion about a personalised agenda, but the concerns we have
raised throughout the progress of the Bill have been that the other
side of the coin, of protecting the claimant to ensure that that level
is delivered, is not set out in the Bill. I accept the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s point&#151;this new clause is not prescriptive, it
is meant to stimulate discussion; I merely wanted to right the balance
because clear duties and responsibilities are set out in the Bill for
claimants, but not so explicitly for what JCP and its partners have to
deliver. I have tabled this new clause to stimulate debate about
that.</div><a name="09030427000049"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030427000147"></a>John
Robertson:</b> I wish to make a couple of points. Following on
from my hon. Friend the Member for Warwick and Leamington and the hon.
Member for Rochdale, I have no problem with wish lists. Wish lists put
forward ideas, and as such we hope that the people who put the law
together will listen to them and put them on paper. That is how we make
laws; they all come from somebody&#146;s wish list somewhere down the
line.</div><a name="09030427000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
would like to emphasise the point about those 0845 numbers. As somebody
who has worked in the communications business all his life and as chair
of the all-party communications group since 2002, I have come across
many cases of people who have been ripped off by those numbers. It is
important that the Minister allays my fears on this. It is a disgrace
that any Government body would use 0845 numbers, particularly when
calls from mobiles cost a lot more. The people we try to protect the
most are the poor, who are the most inclined to have top-up mobiles. It
therefore costs even more for them to phone those telephone numbers. I
would look at
that.</div><a name="09030427000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
would also be interested in using an ombudsman. I have some sympathy
with the concept, which is a tried and tested structure to ensure that
best practice is followed, empowering the people who are best placed to
know how these services are used. The services that will be provided to
empower people will come from various bodies. Surely, then, an
ombudsman would be quite
useful.</div><a name="09030427000052"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030427000148"></a>Mr.
McNulty:</b> Like the Secretary of State&#151;Mr.
Purnell, not Mr. Plaskitt&#151;I have some sympathy with
the notion of a customers charter or a claimants charter; whatever you
wish to call it, I think it makes sense. I take issue with the point
that the hon. Member for Rochdale raised about the lack of equivalent
rights and responsibilities in the Bill for Jobcentre Plus. To be
straight with the hon. Gentleman, that is a fatuous
point&#151;Jobcentre Plus has those rights and responsibilities as an
organisation all the time. The way in which Jobcentre Plus should treat
people&#151;with dignity and other elements that people have
suggested&#151;has not changed because the focus of the policy has
changed. People have an absolute right to expect that level of
behaviour, respect and dignity from Jobcentre Plus, notwithstanding
what is in this or any other Bill. We do not have to have a whole
telephone book of what is expected of Jobcentre Plus because it should
be expected in all circumstances anyway. I think that there are
sufficient redress and appeal provisions in the Bill and in the wider
context of how Jobcentre Plus conducts its business to resist the
notion of an ombudsman being involved.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column289" />Column number: 289</div><a name="09030427000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">Hon. Members
will know and understand that an ombudsman is not a dispute resolution
process. The ombudsman role has always been to find either
maladministration or that due process has been followed in any given
circumstance. That is constantly a disappointment sometimes&#151;if
you can be constant sometimes&#151;to my constituents when they go to
the ombudsman because part of the brand is precisely that it is a
dispute resolution process. It is not. You will have seen the responses
from the ombudsmen and they are often detailed, tortuous, but very
accurate about processes and whether due process was followed by a
range of authorities. In order to enable them to slip into a whole
array of areas involving individualised disputes and to seek to resolve
those disputes, we would need to go back to the root legislation and
change the whole focus and statutory footing of the ombudsman. I do not
think that that is either appropriate or desirable, given that the
redress of grievances is already suitably accounted for in the Bill and
the way that Jobcentre Plus
operates.</div><a name="09030427000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have this tension. Our end game, with this Bill and everything else
that we do, is to introduce as personalised and as supportive a
provision for each individual as we possibly can&#151;not just for
those involved in welfare reform and the longer-term unemployed,
towards whom the Bill is geared, but for all customers, all
individuals, who present themselves to Jobcentre
Plus.</div><a name="09030427000115"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.30
pm</div>
<a name="09030427000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Committee
will understand straight away how introducing the flexibility to afford
Jobcentre Plus such personalisation would look strange next to a
statutory and rather rigidly drawn charter of rights and
responsibilities for each and every customer&#151;there would be
tension. I should resist a statutory provision. The new clause is
unclear about whether, just because it is in the Bill, a claimants
charter established through regulations would be advisory, statutory or
somewhere in between. We have had seminars&#151;we have more to
come&#151;with Disability Alliance and others to which the hon.
Gentleman referred to look at how we can ensure that, whether this is
called a claimants charter, a customers charter or whatever, people are
absolutely clear about what they can expect from Jobcentre Plus. I am
entirely with him about what people can expect from each programme and,
more generally, from Jobcentre Plus, but I include the caveat that my
hon. Friend the Member for Warwick and Leamington suggested about the
accompanying responsibilities that pertain.</div>
<a name="09030427000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">It was
interesting that the hon. Member for Rochdale prayed in aid my right
hon. Friend the Secretary of State and his quotation about not being
restrictive and not coming up with a lawyers charter, because the more
I look at the terms of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s new clause, the more
they seem restrictive and, secondly, a lawyers charter. I do not doubt
the good intent, but some provisions are narrowly drawn, while others
are broadly drawn. We should not dwell on them unnecessarily, but
proposed new paragraph (m) states
that</div><a name="09030427000110"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;claimants
must be able to access free, independent and appropriate advice in
relation to all aspects of the
Act.&#148;</div><a name="09030427000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is a fine aspiration, but why on earth should someone who has concerns
about birth registration be entitled to access advice on every other
aspect of the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column290" />Column number: 290</div>Bill? Indeed, vice versa, someone who wanted to be clear about the
automaticity of the pension credit pilot would, according to the
proposal, have free licence to get as much information as they needed
for any aspect of the Bill, even if it had nothing to do with
them.</div>
<a name="09030427000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman cited the TUC in relation to one provision, yet he made no
definition of &#147;reasonable&#148; in the provision
involving</div><a name="09030427000111"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;activity
under this Act for which it would be reasonable to expect
payment&#148;.</div><a name="09030427000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given
that there are a few shyster lawyers around, I am afraid that the word
&#147;reasonable&#148; could blow a big hole in work trials, Access
to Work, work experience and all the things that, by common consent,
actually help claimants to stay very proximate to the labour market or
to get a job. The provision would do the reverse of what the hon.
Gentleman suggests.</div>
<a name="09030427000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">I take the
point that my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, North-West made about
0845 numbers, and I believe in the review. I am told&#151;he can tell
me later from his telecommunications and telephony
experience&#151;that the last nut to crack is 0845 numbers called
from mobiles, rather than landlines, and that, with existing
technology, one can either continue to offer that service or
not&#151;there is no third technological option whereby one can offer
the service for free. However, we are exploring the issue, because I
agree with the premise of the charter and my hon. Friend&#146;s
suggestion that, if people need access to information by
phone&#151;mobile or otherwise&#151;from Jobcentre Plus, it should
be free. Some customers have said that for routine, snappy information,
such as the time of interview and so on, they would far rather receive
a quick text. That makes perfect sense, but, by a literal
interpretation of the charter, that could not happen, because it says
that if they cannot obtain the service by telephone, with all that that
implies about telephony being vocal, they can demand a face-to-face
service. However, a little text would do, so we cannot draw the
provision too narrowly.</div>
<a name="09030427000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
absolutely with the hon. Gentleman in spirit, however, and I know that
my hon. Friend the Member for Bradford, North (Mr. Rooney),
the Chairman of the Work and Pensions Committee, is too. It is
absolutely right that we should put out&#151;far more readily than we
have, because it is out there already&#151;an overarching charter
that states what customers or claimants, or whatever we want to call
them, can and should expect in terms of behaviour, provision and
service from Jobcentre Plus. Alongside it, there should be either
programme-specific or more general approaches&#151;probably
both&#151;covering responsibilities for claimants or customers. That
is the way forward that we are trying to follow. As my hon. Friend the
Member for Warwick and Leamington makes very clear, that includes
saying, &#147;You will not being abusive or violent to Jobcentre Plus
staff,&#148; with all that that entails.</div>
<a name="09030427000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although we
are all broadly sympathetic, I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the
new clause. I know that the team has been contacted by the Disability
Alliance, which was slightly concerned that the new clause would put
more into legislation than the organisation had intended. It was
worried that the new clause, if accepted, would push the Department
away from its positive sentiment regarding of a
charter.</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column291" />Column number: 291</div><a name="09030427000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I say, I
will furnish Committee with details. There is a forthcoming stakeholder
seminar&#151;God knows what we called these people before they became
&#147;stakeholders&#148;; an awful word. It is a people seminar to
discuss what should go in the overarching customers charter or citizens
charter&#151;good Lord, not John Major&#146;s citizens charter! We
are very much with the hon. Gentleman in spirit, but I ask that the
proposal is not pursued in such a fashion.</div>

that is something that I know that the hon. Member for Glasgow,
North-West also feels strongly about. I look forward to the
Department&#146;s continuing work to establish rights and
responsibilities through a charter. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030427000150"></a>Paul
Rowen:</b> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second
time.</div><a name="09030427000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again,
I shall not press the new clause to a Division, but I think that it is
important, given that we have spent most of our time in Committee
dealing with sanctions, that we deal with other aspects of employment
that ought to be considered in the current climate. I understand what
the Secretary of State said on Second Reading: the recession and the
credit crunch are not reasons for not pressing ahead with reforms.
Nevertheless, speaking on behalf of the Liberal Democrats, I certainly
feel that it 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column292" />Column number: 292</div>is important that it is demonstrated to people, particularly those many
thousands of people who have recently lost their jobs, that strategies
can be adopted to improve
employment.</div><a name="09030427000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
I may again use an international example, given that the Government
have been very good at citing international examples that fit their
agenda, there are four areas in the Wisconsin programme that operates
in the US that deal with unemployed people. The first one is what is in
the Bill: &#147;work for your benefit&#148;. Another is community
service jobs, and a further one is transitions for people who need
specialist help and support.</div>
<a name="09030427000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">What is also
included in that programme, but is missing in this Bill, is a system
under which the state subsidises employers to take people into
employment in what are called trial jobs. It is vital that things are
done to get people back into work. Yes, we have considered measures to
encourage people to go into work, but employers also need
encouragement. I know that there has been experimentation through the
city strategy pathfinders and the employment and skills partnerships.
The hon. Member for Warwick and Leamington will remember last
May&#146;s debate, which was initiated by the hon. Member for
Nottingham, North (Mr. Allen), about this issue and the
greater freedoms of the
partnerships.</div><a name="09030427000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am seeking two major changes, although the first relates to a power
that already exists. Local authorities can, when setting contracts,
require as part of the contract that the person who wins it takes
somebody off the unemployment register. In my authority of Rochdale, we
set up a joint partnership board with a couple of employers. A few
weeks ago, they took on their 300th employee who had come off the
unemployment list. Those individuals include 15 people who were made
redundant as a result of the closure of
Woolworths.</div><a name="09030427000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although
that power exists, the new clause addresses something that does not and
accepts that someone who is unemployed might need to be retrained if
they are to undertake a job that they may be offered. A few years ago,
when my local authority was renewing all the council houses, people
were taken off the unemployment register. If someone is employed to
become, eventually, a qualified bricklayer, electrician, plumber or
roofer, there is no way that it can be argued that that particular
person will be able to do, from day one, 100 per cent. of what can be
done by a qualified person with several years&#146; experience. The
ability to passport benefits would represent a payment to the employer.
There would be a recognition that it was a training allowance for an
employer taking someone off the unemployment
register.</div><a name="09030427000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have spoken to employers in my town who would be willing to take this
on board. Indeed, Camden borough council operated a similar scheme
under a contract with a company. We think that such a proposal is a
good way of encouraging both employers and unemployed people. It tells
unemployed people that they can learn on the job and that the benefits
that they would have received if they were unemployed would be
passported to the employer as a training allowance. A person could thus
be trained in that particular trade.</div>
<a name="09030427000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the next
five years, there will be something like &#163;1.5 billion of public
and private expenditure in my local authority, for example through
Building Schools for the Future. The jobs will be not only in
construction, as that contract is over 20 years and involves the
provision of such services as IT and cleaning. There is value in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column293" />Column number: 293</div>putting something in the contracts to say that it is a requirement that
somebody is taken off the unemployment register, but that recognises
that that person may not be suitably qualified for a limited period.<b class="B">
</b>I emphasise that it is not the intention that the benefits would be
passported indefinitely.<b class="B"> </b>The new clause deliberately states that
regulations will be laid, and there will have to be tight conditions to
ensure that the scheme is not being used by an employer as a means of
getting money off the state without
delivering.</div>
<a name="09030427000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second
part of the proposal deals with something about which there are
particular concerns: many industries are having to offload jobs because
of the recession, which means that we will lose important skills and
abilities. That problem has been raised regarding industries such as
the motor trade and the aerospace industry, as well as other areas in
which there are highly specialised people who taken many years to
train. Employers are having to make certain people redundant because of
a downturn in trade, such as someone who visited my surgery a couple of
weeks ago and is making 13 of 88 employees redundant. I want
to probe whether the Government are willing to consider this
situation.</div><a name="09030427000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
could be shown&#151;it would have to be demonstrated by the
employer&#151;that an employee should undergo a period of further
retraining. It might well be that although a person was in the plant
for five days a week, they could spend three days actually working and
two days enhancing their skills and developing new ones so that when
the upturn comes, they will be appropriately skilled up to take
advantage of that.<b class="B"> </b>A scheme to allow that would be advantageous
to the company, because there would be no way that it could afford to
provide such training in the current climate. The new clause recognises
that and looks to countries such as Germany, where such an approach is
adopted. We could tell employers that we would do something to help
them to keep people in employment if they could demonstrate that they
were undertaking a retraining process instead of making those people
redundant.</div><a name="09030427000116"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.45
pm</div><a name="09030427000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">Such
an approach would have a double benefit: it would cost the state no
more than if those people were unemployed, and those people would still
be in work and drawing a wage for the remaining part of the week, and
so would be paying taxes on those wages. In the current circumstances,
that would be a win-win-win situation. There would be a win for the
employee, because they would not be unemployed and their skills would
be enhanced, and there would be a win for the company, because it would
be allowed to undertake reskilling that it would not otherwise be able
to afford in the current climate. Additionally, there would be a win
for the country, because instead of losing vital skills in some
sectors, we would be guaranteeing that we would still have engineers
and qualified people in the future, because if those people went
abroad, or we otherwise lost them, we would be in dire
straits.</div>
<a name="09030427000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">I reiterate
that I do not intend to press the new clause to a Division. I merely
wanted to put on record that the Liberal Democrats were serious about
dealing not only with &#147;work for your benefit&#148;, but about
protecting employment and ensuring that companies and employees are
able to ride out the recession.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030427000151"></a>Mr.
McNulty:</b> I appreciate the spirit of the new clause. If I
were being churlish, I could rip virtually every provision apart,

<a name="09030427000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
strong arguments for wage subsidy&#151;indeed, we have had it in the
new deal for the past 10 years. However, I am troubled by the fact that
the new clause would kick in only after 18 months of longer term
unemployment. The hon. Gentleman will know that, in our last series of
announcements, we announced the introduction of a package, from April,
that will include a &#163;2,500 mixture of employer subsidy and
training for companies that take on someone who has been unemployed for
six months. Why the delay? It is precisely because of some of the
problems with the new clause, such as resisting duplication and
dead-weight costs. That is a horrible phrase, but we want to resist
those costs. We also want to avoid the perverse notion, which is
problematic in any subsidy system, that people can sack a worker to
take on someone else.</div>
<a name="09030427000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">The issue
involves all sorts of details and complexities, but the notion that we
should not deal with it at all is wrong. We can and do, as I have said,
have a more focused use of Train to Gain&#151;through the new deal,
the new package that we are introducing in April, and our work with
colleagues in the Department for Innovation, Universities and
Skills&#151;to achieve some of what the hon. Gentleman has suggested,
such as keeping people in work, including in skilled jobs, and having
additional training facilities. In motor car plants, for example, where
the work force are on short time, Train to Gain has gone in to see what
it can do to help with skills and training, and to preserve the skills
base. The hon. Gentleman is right to raise this issue, because we do
not want to come out of this recession having to look for the very
skills base that were so dissipated in the past two recessions, and
finding that those people simply were not around, leaving us having to
skill people up again. That would not be appropriate.</div>
<a name="09030427000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">I agree with
the thrust and sentiment of what the hon. Gentleman said, but we have
to be clear that subsidies are short term&#151;the new clause is very
open-ended&#151;and, secondly, that they are precisely focused on the
longer term unemployed, potentially through particular skills
bases.</div><a name="09030427000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will be candid and say that there is still a huge debate across
Government about whether we should introduce blanket wage subsidy
schemes in areas such as the motor trade. We think that there is a
great deal of job substitution, duplication and other things going on
in some of the European models&#151;in Germany&#146;s and
France&#146;s, in particular. If we were to go down that road, we
would work much more around retention schemes that focus on training
and skills interventions to skill up the work force while they are
still in
place.</div><a name="09030427000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
appreciate that Wisconsin is in the US&#151;that is a perfectly fair
point&#151;but, although I am au fait and happy with the notion that
we should not take job subsidies off the table as an element in our
arsenal to equip us for responding to the downturn, for all the reasons
that the hon. Gentleman suggested, including holding on to the skills
base, I believe, on balance, that the new clause should be resisted,
albeit for reasons that I have resisted giving because of the spirit in
which the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column295" />Column number: 295</div>hon. Gentleman opened the debate. However, I do not doubt that we will
regularly return to this issue if the downturn
endures.</div><a name="09030427000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
the hon. Gentleman has not done so already, I commend him to look in
detail at the golden hellos and all the other bits in the package that
we are introducing in April for the six-months unemployed. They will
help and, I hope, obviate the need for a subsequent package for those
at 18 months, as is suggested in the new clause, which I ask the hon.
Gentleman to
withdraw.</div><a name="09030427000086"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030427000152"></a>Paul
Rowen:</b> I am happy to withdraw the new clause because, as I
said, its purpose was to stimulate discussion. I was interested by the
Minister&#146;s comment about six months, because, at present, no
advice is given until at least 12 months. I am interested in how six
months will fit in with current departmental policies. I beg to ask
leave to withdraw the
motion.</div><a name="09030427000087"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Clause,

<a name="09030427000112"></a><div class="hs_brev">That certain
written evidence already reported to the House be appended to the
proceedings of the
Committee.</div><a name="09030427000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">With
your indulgence, Mr. Amess, I shall try to wind things up. I
thank your good self&#151;in body and in spirit&#151;for your
excellent chairmanship, and ask you to convey our thanks in the same
terms to Mr. Hood. You both used a light touch and were good
humoured, as Chairmen should be, for which we have been grateful. There
was, from both of you, that gentle menace that suggested that, were we
to step out of line, you would pull out the full panoply of
Chairmen&#146;s powers, but of course we did not step out of line. I
was pleased to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Amess, and
that of Mr.
Hood.</div><a name="09030427000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am grateful to the hon. Members for Forest of Dean and for Hertsmere,
not simply for their presence&#151;how would we have coped without
them?&#151;but, equally, for dealing with our business in a focused,
professional manner that afforded the Committee a good deal of sharp
debate about important issues. Our proceedings have been relatively
free of partisanship and carried out in good humour and good
spirit.</div><a name="09030427000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
would be remiss not to thank the hon. Members for Henley and for
Billericay and the right hon. Member for Hitchin and Harpenden for
saying as little as possible and not getting in the way of our
deliberations&#151;I mean that most sincerely. The hon. Member for
Billericay, of course, is a Whip, so we would expect him to say very
little, but it would have been rather nice if he had popped in every
now and then. However, he is in the room now, for which I am grateful.
We welcome ghosts, whichever side of the Committee they are
on.</div><a name="09030427000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am happy to put on record that I am enormously indebted to the
Under-Secretaries of State for Work and Pensions, my hon. Friends the
Members for Burnley and for Chatham and Aylesford, and my hon. Friend
the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland for their contributions.
Although the Committee was top-heavy with Ministers&#151;I am not
referring to my own spherical status&#151;I am sure that hon. Members
will agree that all Ministers made a significant contribution and that
ministerial inputs were apportioned appropriately, if that is the
correct phrase. I am grateful to my colleagues for the spirit and
manner in which they contributed to the good order throughout the
sittings.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column296" />Column number: 296</div><a name="09030427000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
enormously indebted to my hon. Friend the Member for Warrington, North
for whipping lightly, but with gentle menace when required. I am
equally grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Ochil and South
Perthshire. One of the meetings coming out of our deliberations is a
discussion with the repetitive strain injury group to talk about the
serious matter of RSI. Hopefully, my hon. Friend has not got that from
throwing the advice and inspiration that we get from officials. I thank
those officials for their endeavours, along with the Doorkeepers and
the police&#151;I do not think that we troubled them from their
slumber too much having had only about two
Divisions.</div><a name="09030427000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
congratulate my hon. Friends the Members for Sheffield, Heeley, for
Warwick and Leamington and for Glasgow, North-West on their significant
and positive contributions, which guided the ministerial team and the
Committee. I especially congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for
Glasgow, North-West, who tabled some challenging amendments&#151;we
will come back with at least two or three in some form. He, too, is a
brooding presence with some gentle menace&#151;hon. Members might see
a theme emerging in my
thanks.</div><a name="09030427000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am also grateful to the hon. Member for Rochdale for his contributions
to our deliberations, many of which were put forward productively,
although perhaps he started off a bit slowly. He has given me a brand
new definition of a probing amendment: one where the clause is wrong,
the amendment is wrong and the wrong thing entirely is talked about. If
one is told so in no uncertain terms by the Minister, it becomes a
probing
amendment.</div><a name="09030427000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
was a little disappointed by the contribution of the hon. Member for
Glasgow, East, whose rants were rather partisan. His new clauses were
fatuous and vacuous, as would be expected from the Scottish National
party. I am disappointed because he comes from one of the poorest
communities in the country. One would have thought that the welfare
reform agenda would be right up the street of the people of Glasgow.
Happily for us, Glasgow has been more than adequately represented by my
hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, North-West and the Under-Secretary
of State for
Scotland.</div><a name="09030427000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
Bill covers important subjects that will matter to our communities and
individuals up and down the country. I commend it to the Committee, and
I seriously commend the Committee for its deliberations. Even though
not many amendments, if any, were endorsed, we will reflect on the
Committee proceedings. The Bill will be served well by the
contributions of most Committee
members.</div><a name="09030427000098"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09030427000154"></a><b class="B">Mr.
James Clappison</b> (Hertsmere) (Con): I join the Minister in
many, although not all, of his sentiments. I certainly agree with all
the sentiments that he expressed to the Chairmen of the Committee. We
are extremely grateful to you, Mr. Amess, and to your
colleague, Mr. Hood, for the manner in which the Committee
has been chaired, both in our deliberative sittings and evidence
sessions. As the Minister rightly said, the Committee has been
conducted in a good humoured and appropriate manner due to the skilled
chairmanship of you and your colleague. I join the Minister in the
thanks that he extended to everybody else who helped the Committee to
perform in an expeditious way, including the Clerk, the <i class="I">Hansard</i>
writers, the Doorkeepers and the police officers.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column297" />Column number: 297</div><a name="09030427000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am very
grateful to colleagues in my party. I thank my hon. Friend the Member
for Forest of Dean for his hard work, his telling analysis of the Bill
and his excellent contributions. I am grateful to our Whip, my hon.
Friend the Member for Billericay, for the extremely efficient role that
he has played. I am also grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for

we are being consensual, I reciprocate the spirit of the Minister for
Employment and Welfare Reform by congratulating him and his ministerial
team. I also congratulate Labour Back Benchers on their contributions,
as well as the hon. Member for Rochdale, who speaks for the Liberal
Democrats, and the hon. Member for Glasgow, East, who speaks for the
Scottish Nationalists&#151;I want to be all-inclusive in this
atmosphere. If there was an element of tenderness at the beginning of
the Minister&#146;s contribution a moment ago, I would like to
continue with that, although perhaps not all the remarks at the end of
his contribution were made in that respect.</div>
<a name="09030427000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">I certainly
think that the Committee has been conducted appropriately, and we are
pleased to have had the opportunity to examine the Bill and to do
justice to the process of parliamentary scrutiny, which is our duty. We
feel that we have done that fully. As the Minister rightly said, the
subject matter of the Bill is important, particularly at present. We
have been conscious throughout our proceedings of what is unfolding in
the country at large. As this part of the Bill&#146;s passage reaches
its conclusion, we look forward to further analysis and
scrutiny.</div><a name="09030427000102"></a>
