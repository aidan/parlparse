							<a name="07042650000356"></a>The
Minister of State, Department of Health(Ms Rosie
Winterton):
						</b> We are discussing a fundamental issue. In the
other place the spokesman for the official Opposition argued that the
law and the state hadno business interfering in the lives of
patients who retained decision-making capacity, despite being seriously
ill, if the risk that they posed was to themselves; if they posed a
risk to others, that was or should be the province of the criminal law.
As I said this morning, that seems fundamentally wrong. It means the
state abdicating its responsibilities for protecting people suffering
from mental disorder who may be driven to self-harm or even
suicide.</div>
					<a name="07042650000013"></a><div class="hs_Para">As for people
whose disorder may be putting others at risk, it is true that the
criminal law can intervene,but only after an offence has been
committed. In other words, the Opposition have said, in effect, that
the rights of those patients not to accept treatment are invariably to
take preference over the rights of other people who may become victims.
They have said that the competing rights are not to be balanced, but
that the former is automatically to be given
preference.</div>
					<a name="07042650000014"></a><div class="hs_Para">I ask the
Opposition to think carefully about attempting to retain the clause. It
really will have a detrimental effect, admittedly, as
the British Psychological Society said, on a small number of people.
However, it is not right that we, as parliamentarians, are prepared to
turn our backs on those people and not get treatment to them when they
desperately need it. That is why I am asking the Committee to reject
clause
4.</div>

						<a name="07042650000357"></a>
							<b class="B">Dr.
John Pugh</b> (Southport) (LD): I am delighted to see you in
the Chair, Miss Begg. Although I cannot imagine what you have done to
hold such a positionfor the whole of Thursday when you were
not even assigned to chair the Committee, I am pleased tosee
you.</div>
					<a name="07042650000016"></a><div class="hs_Para">We debated
exceptions the other day, most ofwhich could be resolved
easily by including a statement of principles in the Bill. The Scottish
Bill excludesany prejudice on the grounds of age, sex, sexual
orientation, religious persuasion, racial origin, cultural 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column98" />Column number: 98</div>
						or linguistic background and membership. I could not
help reflecting that, had we had such a statement of principles, much
of our earlier debate could havebeen
avoided.</div>
					<a name="07042650000017"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
that we are considering is verbatim the clause in the Scottish Bill and
the Secretary of State seeks to remove it. In its submission, the Royal
College of Psychiatrists said about the Scottish Bill
that</div>
					<a name="07042650000292"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
consider that the Scottish Mental Health Act provides an excellent
model for a new law for England and Wales. The positive experience of
our colleagues in Scotland over the last year and a half has reinforced
this view.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07042650000018"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am mindful
of the danger that all that we will do in the Committee is repeat the
mantras and arguments of the other place. Despite the copious briefings
that we receive, we shall just be marking time until the real trial of
strength occurs between the Lords and the Government, which to some
extent will mask the real and long battle that has been going on
between the Government and the Mental Health Alliance, where briefings
can simply be used as ammunition and Members of Parliament can be used
as proxies for organisations outside this place and reduced almost to
the state of ventriloquist dummies whereby discussions can be
choreographed and so
on.</div>
					<a name="07042650000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">I genuinely
believe that that is a waste of our time. It is a misuse of what is
obviously a talented, informed and able Committee. A Public Bill
Committee hasvery real strength. We cannot rival their
lordships&#146; eloquence or eminence&#151;[<span class="SmallCaps">Hon.
Members: </span>&#147;Come on.&#148;] Well, some of us cannot.
There is far more interchange and challenge and more probing questions
are asked in a Public Bill Committee, as we found out this morning. I
was struck by the lack of interventions in the Lords&#146; debate and
the rather respectful audience that they gave one another. That is fine
if one wants to state a case, but less good for exploring, analysing
and defining points of difference.</div>
					<a name="07042650000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">One of the best speeches in the
House of Lords was from Baroness Murphy, whose
contributions throughout the debate were splendid. She is a
psychiatrist, and she said of the amendment&#151;which is now clause

Committee:</div>

answer?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07042650000359"></a>Dr.
Pugh:
						</b> Clearly, the Government and the Mental Health
Alliance think that there is an important issue, as there are two
conditions in the 1983 Act for the detention of a mentally ill person.
One, obviously, is having a severe mental disorder; the other is to be
seen or judged to constitute a risk to oneself or others.
Essentially, the amendment would add a third
condition&#151;that the individual has impaired judgment about his
medical treatment.</div>
					<a name="07042650000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government want to insist that it is perfectly safe to leave just the
two conditions in place. They argue that to add the other condition
would make matters worse because mentally ill patients whoare
judged at risk will be left free to commit suicide and, less commonly,
to harm others.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column99" />Column number: 99</div>
					<a name="07042650000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">The key question is who we are
talking about here. Could there be people who are judged to be a
serious danger to themselves and others who are diagnosedas
mentally ill and who are possessed of unimpaired judgment? I wanted to
define where people stood on that issue, so I wrote to a number of the
bodies that contacted me and asked if there were such people and what
they were like&#151;we explored some differences in the debate this
morning.</div>
					<a name="07042650000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">Mind wrote
back to me saying that it was hard to imagine that there were such
people; the British Medical Association said that it was entirely
possible that there are such people. The Royal College said not in most
cases, although there will be some dangerous people who coincidentally
will have mental problems. Lewis Appleby at the Department of Health
said yes, there definitely were such people. The Law Society, in
submission MH20 said that it was axiomatic that if one is dangerous and
disordered one is mentally impaired.</div>
					<a name="07042650000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">The British Association of

added.</div>
					<a name="07042650000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">Baroness
Barker, Earl Howe and the Royal College of Psychologists said,
explicitly, that there would be some without impaired decision making,
who should be allowed to act freely. They took what the Secretary of
State described as a libertarian
position.</div>
					<a name="07042650000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
interesting thing about the variation of views is that it genuinely
does not depend on whether someone is for or against this Bill, which
leads me to surmise that there is an element of confusion about what
weare discussing. I posed the question whether impaired
judgment is not by itself clear, and I considered whether I could make
it any clearer. It is not defined in the Scottish Act, although it is
in the guidance, but when Baroness Barker introduced the amendment she
contrasted the lack of decision-making ability and capacity with
impaired decision making. On the other hand, Professor Richardson, in
her submission MH22, said almost precisely the opposite, talking
of:</div>
					<a name="07042650000297"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;our desire to see
the introduction of an incapacity criterion.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07042650000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">All this is less than clear. The Lords
notes distinguish impaired decision making from disorder of cognition,
but in submission MH9, Professor George Szmukler, who is quoted on
several occasions by a number of people,
said:</div>
					<a name="07042650000035"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;&#145;emotional
elements&#146; are ... in an important sense
&#145;cognitive&#146;&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07042650000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">Even
if it is not clear what effect the Lords amendment would have, it is
fairly clear what it was intended to do&#151;to reduce the pool of
potential detainees, although by all accounts it would do so by only a
small number, and assert the right of patients, particularly those who
are not impaired in their judgment, to have a say in their treatment. I
believe that we all support those laudable and important
objectives.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column100" />Column number: 100</div>
					<a name="07042650000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I share the
concerns voiced through the Lords amendment and in many of the
objections to the Government&#146;s position. We all know the sad
historyof full-frontal lobotomies, for example, that were
performed on people who did not know that they were being done. We know
more recently of overdoses of Largactil and so on, with all kinds of
adverse effects on people&#146;s physical health that had not been
anticipated and were not properly explained to
them.</div>
					<a name="07042650000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause is
supplementary to, not a replacement for, the two conditions laid down
in the Mental Health Act 1983. Many of the fears that have been
expressed about not including the clause could relate equally to how
that Act has functioned. To some extent, we are now seeing how it has
functioned, and we have had24 years&#146; experience of it.
The addition of a third condition to that Act, that of impaired
judgment, would by all accounts exempt a limited number of people who
also satisfy the other conditions. So it cannot by its presence or
absence significantly affect the number of people
likely to be sectioned by psychiatrists, unless psychiatrists start
behaving markedly differently from how they have behaved for the past
24 years.</div>
					<a name="07042650000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, the
clause makes an important pointabout patient autonomy and
choice, and it underlines and makes explicit the connection between
cure and consent. Provided that the Government&#146;s fears are not
realised, and people judged a threat to the health and safety of
themselves or others under the 1983 Act are not allowed to commit
suicide or an aggressive act on somebody else by virtue of their mental
disorder, there seems no major harm in leaving the clause in the
Bill.</div>
					<a name="07042650000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">We must address
the Government&#146;s fears, as they have been put seriously. I tried
to follow the argument as fairly as possible, and there are
fundamentally three categories of response to what the Minister said.
The first is that her fear is groundless; there is no category of
people about whom we need to worry. The second is that responding to
that fear by removing the clause would generate more unnecessary
incarceration than one would expect and certainly more than it is
worth. If it prevented one ill, it could create a worse ill elsewhere.
The third response is the more radical one given by Baroness Barker and
Earl Howe&#151;that we must put up with the current state of affairs
on the grounds of civil liberties. When individuals defend the clause,
they sometimes select one of those responses and sometimes give all of
them.</div>
					<a name="07042650000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have said
enough about the first two responses, so I shall turn to civil
liberties. One can fairly claim the right of an individual to commit
suicide by virtue of their mental illness. I do not, but one can make
that point and it is intellectually defensible. Nearly everyone would
hesitate to claim the right of an individual,for instance a
stalker, to harm and harass another individual by virtue of their
mental illness. It is often pointed out when dealing with civil
liberties that sane people, or those with no mental disorder, commit
suicide and do wrong things, and that, hey, there is criminal law out
there. That is a slightly glib response, because it depends on
believing that people who are mentally ill and those who are not
possess the same personal and moral autonomy. I cannot in all cases
believe that.</div>
					<a name="07042650000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">If an
individual with a diagnosed personality disorder were treated simply as
a common criminal, we might have some reservations. Do we not believe
that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column101" />Column number: 101</div>mitigating conditions might apply, or ought to apply, if someone has a
diagnosable mental disorder? Why do we believe that, and what remedies
do we
have?</div>

is unfair if I summarise a crucial passage of the Committee&#146;s
findings. It said, &#147;Yes, this is a residual problem, but that
must be left for other legislation.&#148; However, it slightly sold
the pass by failing at that point to tell us what such legislation

							<a name="07042650000362"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> Would the hon. Gentleman address the point that
outwith the criminal justice route, one of the things that we want to
do is to prevent people from offending to reduce offending rates.
Therefore, unless someone&#146;s judgment is impaired, we are
allowing them&#151;perhaps when they have not
offended before&#151;to go ahead and commit an offence because we are
saying that we cannot intervene. That is the other side of it. It is

pre-emptively acting to prevent people from committing an offence that

issue far better than I can. However, I accept that the Minister has
made a perfectly decent point.</div>
					<a name="07042650000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is not an easy issue.
Anyone who pretends otherwise is being simple-minded. According to my
account&#151;I do not think that it is an unfair account&#151;the
Government and the Mental Health Alliance are not as far apart as it
might seem. However, simply removing the clause leaves the issues
unresolved, the differences unexplored and sends out all the wrong

							<b class="B">Ann
Coffey</b> (Stockport) (Lab): I am a member of the
Modernisation Committee, which produced the report proposing to set up
Public Bill Committees and emphasising the importance of
pre-legislative scrutiny. We also do not do enough post-legislative
scrutiny in the House, particularly on Bills such as this. Questions
such as those rightly raised by the hon. Member for Southport about the
1983 Act could be answered if we had more information or had examined
since 1983 how the Act operated and was implemented. We do not have
that degree of knowledge, so we have to predict the consequences of
legislation.</div>
					<a name="07042650000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">My right
hon. Friend the Minister has a point when she says that by leaving in
clause 4 and enforcing the Lords amendment in a rigid way, a very
difficult group of people, who are difficult to help, might be denied
help. That is a very strong consideration. We cannot divide the problem
into those who self-harm and those who harm others because, as my hon.
Friend the Member for Stafford pointed out very coherently this
morning, they are often the same people. The people who jump off the
motorway bridge in my constituency into the path of a car not only lose
their own livesbut endanger the lives of people travelling
along the motorway. The same thing applies to people who jump 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column102" />Column number: 102</div>in front of trains. The act of suicide can in itself bea very
aggressive and angry act from people whohave had a very
disturbed background. Therefore, the interests of people who harm
themselves and the wider community are interlinked.</div>
					<a name="07042650000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although I understand the
reasons behind the separate test, I am not sure that it is totally
necessary. Two weeks ago, I went out and spent time with approved
social workers from one of the London hospitals, and witnessed a mental
health assessment. It was clear to me that the issues of mental
disorder and capacity were interlinked in how the two psychiatrists and
the approved social worker conducted that interview. What they brought
to the interview was several years of training and experience. As has
been said, mental disorder, or the continuum on which somebody is
disordered, is not easy to identify; one cannot take such
people&#146;s temperatures or see whether they have a rash.
Ultimately, the matter depends on clinical experience, which is why I
do not understand where the Royal College of Psychiatrists is coming
from on this matter. It is very jealous of its professional expertise.
Some clauses that we will talk about later argue for the retention of a
central role for psychiatrists in assessment because of their
expertise, which they cannot be substituted by anybody else. I am not
sure why the royal college wants to have that flexibility to make
clinical judgments taken away from it, in effect, by putting a test
about a test about impaired decision making&#151;nobody knows what
that means&#151;in the Bill.
</div>
					<a name="07042650000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is also another
issue that we should consider. The professionals who will work in
mental health will also work in other areas that will be governed by
the Mental Capacity Act 2005, which comes into forcein January
2008. Psychologists, psychiatrists, mental health
workers and community nurses will all implement that Act, which, as
everybody knows, sets out the definition of a person who lacks
capacity. It focuses on a particular time when a decision has to be
made, and on the particular matter to which the decision relates. The
Act states:</div>
					<a name="07042650000298"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It
follows that a person can lack the capacity for the purposes of the Act
even if the loss of capacity is partial or temporary or if his capacity
fluctuates.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07042650000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am reading
out the provision because it goes into some detail about what the
criteria are for lack of capacity. The so-called diagnostic test picks
up a range of problems such
as</div>
					<a name="07042650000299"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;psychiatric illness,
learning disability, dementia, brain damage, or even a toxic
confusional&#148;</div>
					<a name="07042650000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">state. Those
are the same areas in which psychiatrists and approved social workers
will make judgments in mental health assessments. That is underlined by
a very strong set of statutory principles that apply to the Mental
Health Act.</div>
					<a name="07042650000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">Administering or implementing
the 2005 Act will lead to those professionals having a shared view of
what capacity is, and sharing their clinical experience through case
studies and case law. That is a very important process, and it is a
welcome Act. However, the problem is how that process would sit with
clause 4, which takes in impaired decision making. Part 4 of the Mental
Health Act 1983, which is about consent to treatment, uses the term
&#147;capacity&#148;. In other words, somebody has to make a
decision about consent to treatment. The decision will be either that
the patient is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column103" />Column number: 103</div>not capable understanding the nature, purpose or likely effect of the
treatment, or that the patient does not consent to it. It is all about
issues of capacity. It will be difficult if clause 4 introduces
provision about impaired decision making, however, but part 5 of the
Act, which is about consent for treatment, talks about capacity. The
words that we put in the Bill and what they mean are very important,
and that will lead to
difficulties.</div>
					<a name="07042650000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">Further
confusion may arise in another area, in which I envisage&#151;I am
not a lawyer&#151;that many in the courts and mental health tribunals
will be interested. If somebody with learning disabilities also has a
mental disorder and is being assessed for treatment under the Mental
Health Act, they will already have been assessed under the Mental
Capacity Act 2005 for capacity in decisions relating to other areas of
life, such as finance and so on. They will then attend an assessment
for treatment under the Mental Health Act, in which the criterion is
whether they have impaired decision making, which is different from
having the capacity to make decisions. Even though people say that the
terms are the same, they are different words, and therefore mean
something different. They canand will be interpreted
differently by the courts. If impaired decision making is a higher
obstacle, therefore, someone with learning disabilities who has been
deemed incapable of making decisions underthe Mental Capacity
Act could be refused treatment under the Mental Health Act, as they
would still be considered as satisfying the clause 4 condition, as that
is different. I do not think that we can have two different tests in
this area.</div>
					<a name="07042650000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">The way
forward is to see how the Mental Capacity Act is implemented when it
comes into force in 2008, as I think that it has some implications for
the Bill. The hon. Member for Southport seemed to say that he did not
think that it made a great deal of difference. In that case, to avoid
confusion, I suggest that the best way forward is to remove clause 4
from the Bill until we can see the results of the implementation of the
Mental Capacity Act, and not add further confusion tothis
area.</div>
					<a name="07042650000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will just
make a final plea. Legislation is not perfect, and I am a strong
believer that we should leave as much flexibility in legislation as
possible concerning the decision making of people who will have to
operate it on the ground. We should not be in the business of having
tick boxes or setting obstacles for people to overcome. We should set
standards for them, have confidence in those standards and let them get
on with the job that they have chosen to
do.</div>

not just thought up on a wet Friday afternoon. &#147;Impaired

We do appreciate the Government&#146;s concern that the amendment
relating to the absence of &#145;impaired judgement&#146; could
enable service users to take decisions that may have tragic and
regrettable consequences for their families and themselves. It is
imperative that our members work within a clear and unambiguous

The position of the Royal Collegeof Psychiatrists was decided

am confident from my conversations with practitioners and
representatives of the Royal College of Psychiatrists that the briefing
that both the hon. Gentleman and I have received represents its
official position and that of the great majority of its members, even
though there may be at least 10 out of many thousands who do not sign

that it did not agree that that is the right approach to take. That is

people should be helped, if needed, which is why it has been so keen.

Stockport began her contribution by suggesting that the debate would be
better informed if we were able to scrutinise post-legislative
examples&#151;in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column108" />Column number: 108</div>this case and clause we can. The Mental Health (Care and Treatment)
(Scotland) Act 2003 includes a clause on impaired decision making, as
well as one on capacity, although in the Scottish legislation it
iscalled &#147;incapacity&#148;, while we have chosen to
call it &#147;capacity&#148;. We might have hoped that the
Government would have learnt from the very real experience of an Act
passed in 2003, not ignored it, particularly when that Act provides for
impairment as well as
incapacity.</div>

						</b> My hon. Friend makes a very good point. Based on
the Government&#146;s logic, there should have been an increase in
the number of suicides in Scotland, for example, if what the Minister
is trying to warn us of is true. I am not aware of any increase in the
number of suicides in Scotland. My impression is that there has been a
small fall, in line with the rest of the United Kingdom. I do not
understand, if something appears to be okay in Scotland and working,
why it is going to give rise to all sorts of horrors if we enact it in
the
Bill.</div>

							<b class="B">Mr.
Tim Boswell</b> (Daventry) (Con): Does my hon. Friend not
agree that one of the reasons why patients or potential patients may be
reluctant to submit to certain treatments, certainly if imposed on them
compulsorily, is their prior experience? For example, they may have
offered themselves as voluntary patients and found the likely
medications prescribed not only extremely unattractive, but with very
damaging or alarming side
effects.</div>

							<a name="07042650000397"></a>Tim
Loughton:
						</b> My hon. Friend is absolutely right, and I should
like to elaborate in a minute if hon. Members would allow me to make
some of my points. We seem to be having a bit of an argument about the
veracity of certain of the evidence before us. I want to counter the
Minister&#146;s points and justify why clause 4 should remain in the
Bill.</div>
					<a name="07042650000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am sure that
all hon. Members agree that weare approaching the issue from a
point of non-discrimination, which should be the basis of all health
treatment and certainly of mental health treatment. Enshrining the
principle of non-discrimination andthe non-stigmatising
approach in mental health lawis important and is all about
protecting those with capacity who are capable of making their own
decisions from being forced to undergo treatment or medication to which
they object and that, in some cases, may have side effects and not be
beneficial to their physical health. I will come on to that in a
minute.</div>
					<a name="07042650000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">Whatever the
Minister says and however many letters she pulls out, the Government
are in a position of relative isolation. The Government&#146;s expert
committee, under Professor Genevra Richardson, came out in favour of
such an approach. She stated:</div>
					<a name="07042650000098"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Patients should not be
subjected to compulsory treatment against their capable wishes simply
in the interests of their own health or for the avoidance of annoyance
to others. To do so would be to discriminate unjustifiably against
mental as opposed to physical ill health. If we are to apply the
recognised principlesof health care equally across mental and
physical disorder, it would help significantly to reduce both the
discrimination reflected in the Mental Health Act 1983
and the stigma which
						<div class="Column"><a name="Column109" />Column number: 109</div>feeds on it. Far from seeking to deny treatment to those who need it,
the impaired decision making condition would place mental and physical
disorder on an equal footing and would begin to break down those
barriers which deter people from seeking the help they
need.&#148;</div>

Government&#146;s concerns about the use of a criterion of impaired
decision-making, but we believe that most of those concerns can be
overcome. We believe that compulsory powers should only ever be used as
a last resort when people are very seriously ill, and we do not agree
that a person would become too seriously ill before an impaired
decision-making criterion is
met.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07042650000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Law

						</b> That is entirely the point that I made this
morning. Looking at my notes now, I can see that I said that if there
is a serious risk of a person being about to commit suicide, or capable
of or intent upon suicide&#151;if a person is in crisis&#151;de
facto their decision-making capacity is impaired.</div>
					<a name="07042650000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us also remember that a
recent addition tothe Mental Health Alliance is the
Samaritans. The organisation has some expertise in suicide and in
people who are in a state of crisis and it has been alarmed at the
implied connection between committing suicide and suffering from a
mental illness. It does not agree with that. It has also signed up to
the impaired decision-making clause. The Samaritans organisation talks
with some expertise. In whatever way it reached its
decision&#151;democratically or not&#151;however official or
unofficial its brief might have been, and on whatever basis it signed
up to join the Mental Health Alliance, the organisation believes that
an impaired decision-making clause is beneficial to people and
certainly would not lead to an increase in suicide or an increased
risk of suicide. Some volunteers within the
organisation might take a different view, but that is what the
organisation is officially saying, and experts such as the Samaritans
are people to whom we need to
listen.</div>

Winterton:
						</b> I want to clarify whether the hon. Gentleman is
actually disagreeing with what the Opposition said in the House of
Lords. The official Opposition spokesman argued there that the law and
the state have no business interfering in the lives of people who
retain decision-making capacity despite being seriously ill, if the
risk that they pose is to
themselves.</div>
					<a name="07042650000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is a
manifestly different position fromthe one that the hon.
Gentleman has just proffered. Furthermore, he has quoted from evidence,
but does he accept that the British Psychological Society has said that
a very small number of people believed to be at risk of self-harm or
suicide by this approach would be permitted to refuse treatment if
their decision making was not considered to be significantly
impaired?</div>
					<a name="07042650000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman cannot have it both ways. He cannot say that everybody would
be covered by the proposed provisions on impaired decision making as
they stand, but that we need to include a test just in case anybody is
not. His argument must be that there are people whom we should not be
treating, as his party&#146;s spokesman said in the House of Lords.
That is the inevitable
logic.</div>

colleague in the Lords, Earl Howe, who was at the forefront of the
debate there, and I have his comments before me. The point that he was
making, which he made directly to me as well, was that of course we are
not in the business of allowing or even encouraging a position that
would fail people to the extent that more suicides would result. We
believe that the impaired decision-making clause is a much better
preventive measure. The question that Earl Howe asked was: why should
the law allow the overriding of the wishes of people who have the
capacity to determine their
treatment?</div>

many people currently under sectionwho retain their ability to

because the impaired decision-making test would trump the test of
whether the person was a danger to themselves or to others.
Furthermore, will he give a number for &#147;many people&#148;? It
is curious that the British Psychological Society said that there were
very few such people, whereas the hon. Gentleman says that there are

it?</div>

Loughton:
						</b> We keep going back to the British Psychological
Society. It has never had so much publicity as it has had today in the
Committee. Let me quote an example from Dr. George Szmuckler, who is
involved with the Institute of Psychiatry. Speaking about capacity
assessments of different types of people, he
said:</div>
					<a name="07042650000306"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
research at the Institute of Psychiatry involving both patients on the
medical wards at King&#146;s College Hospital on the one hand and 112
patients on the psychiatric wards at the Maudsley on the other, found
similar percentages of patients with impaired capacity&#151;around 40
per cent.&#151;and did not find significant differences in the
reliability of capacity
assessments.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07042650000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
point that he was making was that people with physical illnesses lose
their capacity just as much as those with mental illnesses. The point
that I am trying to make is that people with a long-term mental illness
will have been subject to all sorts of medical treatment and other
treatments in the past. Many of them therefore build up a degree of
expertise themselves as to what treatments and drugs work and which may
have negative effects. If they retain some capacity to make those
judgments, those judgments should be listened to. If they are receiving
long-term drug treatment that can cause obesity, or may cause their
hair to fall out, or cause all sorts of liver or heart problems, surely
they should be able to have some influence over that treatment. That is
what the clause is all
about.</div>

							<a name="07042650000412"></a>Mr.
Boswell:
						</b> I am sure that my hon. Friend will also have
noticed another witness. Clause 10 states the fundamental principles
that should inform the code of practice. The first three
are:</div>
					<a name="07042650000307"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;(a)
respect for patients&#146; past and present wishes and
feelings,</div>
					<a name="07042650000308"></a><div class="hs_brev">(b)
minimising restrictions on liberty,</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column112" />Column number: 112</div>
					<a name="07042650000309"></a><div class="hs_brev">
						(c) involvement of
patients in planning, developing and delivering care and treatment
appropriate to them&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07042650000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
those principles apply, surely it is much better that they should do so
than that the patient should be put under compulsion as an
alternative.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07042650000413"></a>Tim
Loughton:
						</b> My hon. Friend is right and the Minister
mentioned that earlier in her references to best interests. As my hon.
Friend said, best interests include past and present wishes as set out
in the Mental Capacity Act 2005. It is not just about access, but about
treatment. The problem seems to be that mostof what the
Minister has said today was based on the effect that this provision
might have on people self-harming. She ended with a great cry of force
that this will have an impact on public safety too. She sneaked in the
old canard, which has been a particular focus of the Government, that
it is the public who are being put at risk.</div>
					<a name="07042650000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">By that same token, should not
the alcoholic who is a driver have his licence taken away because he
may, while under the influence of alcohol, kill someone? Similarly
should not the diabetic who is not taking his medication have his
licence taken away&#151;never mindbe restricted? Subject to
passing occasional tests, a diabetic is at liberty with a physical
illness that could result in them causing damage to someone else. We
are talking about people who retain capacity who are being treated
differently. That is the whole point of the difference between
them.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07042650000414"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> I am worried that the hon. Gentleman does not
understand the effect of the clause. The clause prevents the detention
of people who are a risk to themselves or a risk to others unless it
can be shown that they have impaired judgment. It is nothing to do with
the treatment that they might receive once they are detained. That is
absolutely separate. It simply prevents their detention in the first
place. It is important that he acknowledges that that is what it
does.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07042650000415"></a>Tim
Loughton:
						</b> I totally acknowledge the point that the
Minister is making, which is predicated on a subjective interpretation
that an impaired decision-making test will in some way be a greater
hindrancefor people accessing treatment than is the current
legislation. What we said earlier was that people who are in a state of
distress and are likely to commit suicide are more likely to be picked
up on the basisof impaired decision making. We seek to
protectthose people. The Minister&#146;s is an entirely
subjective interpretation of what will be achieved by using an impaired
decision-making test.</div>

							<a name="07042650000417"></a>Tim
Loughton:
						</b> May I just make one more point? The other basis
on which the Government have got it wrong&#151;going by an earlier
reference to the numbers needed to treat&#151;is the assumption that
treatment works. We know that, as with any physical illness, a lot of
patients with a mental illnesses will not respond to the treatment that
is prescribed for them on the first, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column113" />Column number: 113</div>second or even third prescription. In order to justify the use of a
treatment for a physical illness, one would, typically, look to have a
one-in-three success rate; so, for every three patients given some
medication or other form of treatment, one would expect at least one of
them to benefit. That is the sort of figure that NICE guidelines would
work on.</div>
					<a name="07042650000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">For suicide,
the statistic is that something like one in 100 might benefit from
treatment to prevent them from meeting that end, and for homicide
prevention the figure is some one in 2,500 to 5,000. There is no
guarantee that the treatment will work. It has to be judged on the
basis of the numbers needed to treat. By the Minister&#146;s own NICE
set-up, that is the basis on which the efficacy of a treatment will be
judged. The point is that for some people compulsory treatment will not
be beneficial. For them, treatment without compulsion is more likely to
be successful and in their best interests.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07042650000418"></a>Ann
Coffey:
						</b> I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will agree that
that is exactly the situation that exists at the moment. Treatment for
mental health problems has never been totally effective for everybody
at the time when they have received it, because giving such treatment
is a more difficult intervention than giving drugs for a disease. The
situation that the hon. Gentleman describes is a reflection of our
ability to help people with mental health problems; it is not something
new. He cannot do anything about it by ensuring that clause 4 is part
of the Bill; we are where we
are.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07042650000419"></a>Tim
Loughton:
						</b> I accept the hon. Lady&#146;s point. I do not
disagree that the system has shortcomings; we know that it has them,
just as the legislation and the service provision do. If the service
provision were perfect, legislation of this sort would not be
necessary, or at least it would not need to be so severe. We are going
to get it right only if the service provision isin
place.</div>
					<a name="07042650000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">What mystifies
me is that on every clause so far the Government have taken the
attitude that a section is on a service provider&#151;the mental
health trust or whatever it might be. It is not. The section is on the
service user to comply with treatment. This legislation is being used
almost as a means of forcing the provider to provide treatment. If
treatment is required, it should be provided anyway by virtue of the
fact that the mental health service is working. Our fear is that too
much of this legislation is designed to make up for shortfalls in this
country&#146;s service
provision.</div>
					<a name="07042650000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have
spoken for a long time on this clause&#151;<i class="I">[Interruption.] </i>I
want to bring my comments to a close. There are serious inconsistencies
between this Billand the Mental Capacity Act 2005. We could
have suggested a capacity test as a threshold for this measure, but it
is difficult to use in borderline cases, and impaired decision making
is a more flexible test and a more familiar concept to professionals.
Thereis an anomaly in the fact that it has been used in
Scotland, and the clause is largely based on the Scottish experience.
As it is apparently good for Scotland and has been working there
without the sort 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column114" />Column number: 114</div>of downside that the Minister warns about, I do not understand why she
is making such a big song and dance about it now.</div>
					<a name="07042650000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is clearly a major gulf
between us. We both approach this on the basis that we need to know
whatis best for service users and for the clarity of
professionals providing that service. We think that clause 4 provides
that extra clarity. That is what the professionals seem to
support.</div>

Browning:
						</b> It seems to me that we have heard quite a lot in
the debate on this clause about capacity and the Mental Capacity Act
2005. Having sat on the scrutiny Committee and the Standing Committee
that considered that legislation, I think that it is a
verygood Act. However, I think that the assessment of
impairment is also applicable. It is something that the Minister has
rejected. I would like to put on record, for the benefit of my hon.
Friend, the General Medical Council&#146;s definition of the
difference between impairment and capacity. Capacity, or incapacity as
the GMC calls
it,</div>
					<a name="07042650000310"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;broadly involves a
disorder of brain and
cognition&#148;,</div>
					<a name="07042650000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">whereas
impaired decision-making</div>
					<a name="07042650000311"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;is primarily a disorder of the
mind in which a decision is made, resulting in the decision being made
on the basis of reasoning coloured by a mental
disorder.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07042650000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">Therefore,
this clause takes into account the possibility that someone could be
suicidal or even dangerous to others. On that basis, the clinician
would be making a judgment. The patient could have quite well advanced
cognitive function but their impairment would mean that the clinician
had to decide whether they needed to be detained. That does not mean
that the patient could not be involved in that decision
making.</div>

						</b> Perhaps the Minister and the hon. Member for East
Worthing and Shoreham are not quite as far apart on matters of
substance as they believe. He quite correctly said that
&#147;impaired decision making&#148; has a clear meaning for
psychiatrists; if 99 out of 100 psychiatrists were asked to decide who
in this room had impaired decision making, they would come to much the
same conclusions. It is, therefore, clear for psychiatrists. However,
the point is whether it is clear for legislators. I have seen nothing
to persuade me that we, as legislators, are perfectly clear about what
we mean by &#147;impaired decision making&#148; and I feel that we
ought to be.</div>

good word. The hon. Gentleman has made numerous references to the
Scottish Act this afternoon. He will recall that I stumbled by accident
into a meeting of his the other day at which he was taking evidence.
One of the witnesses, a psychiatrist, was saying that the Scottish Act,
although it was passed in 2003, had not been implemented for long
enough for any conclusions to be drawn and that the numbers were so
small that he did not think that any conclusions could be drawn from
it.

							<a name="07042650000430"></a>Tim
Loughton:
						</b> I agree with the hon. Gentleman on the basis
that the Milan Committee discussed this long and hard in preparation
for the Scottish Act, as did the pre-legislative Scrutiny Committee in
preparation for the Bill. It is not something that has been plucked out
of the air. It is early days, although that has not stopped the
Secretary of State from trying to claim figures for the number of
children now being detained in adult wards, in which I think that she
was quite wrong. It is too early. However, Scotland has done it and
many people are happy with it in Scotland and many people were happy to
put it in place there. So far, at this early stage, it does not appear
to have led to the horror stories that the Minister seems to suggest
will occur.</div>
					<a name="07042650000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the
interests of moving on, I would like to sit down now. [<span class="SmallCaps">Hon.
Members:</span> &#147;Hear, hear.&#148;] Clearly, all hon.
Members are in favour of that. We are perfectly happy with clause 4.
There are all sorts of confusions over it, but we think that it gives
extra clarity and a good steer to professionals, who are in favour of
this measure. On that basis, I hope that the Government will not push
this matter to a vote, but if they do we will vote in favour of
retaining clause 4.</div>
					
					<a name="07042650000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07042650000431"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Kidney</b>: Thank you, Miss Begg. It is a pleasure to serve on
a Committee that has you in the Chair, with your usual assured skill in
keeping us all in order.</div>
					<a name="07042650000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">I oppose clause 4 because it
introduces a test that is new, additional and may have unforeseen
consequences that could be detrimental to people in the future if we
pass it in its present form. I want to follow on from what I thought
was a very constructive contribution to the debate by the hon. Member
for Southport. He asked what we might do instead if we accept that
there is still improvement to be made in the Bill but that removing
clause 4 is not the right improvement.</div>
					<a name="07042650000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have a briefing from the
Mental Health Alliance, which it sent to Members of the Committee. It
is part of a detailed briefing that they sent us on individual aspects
of the Bill, so its heading is &#147;Impaired Decision
Making&#148;. It is not the same as MH21 in the bundle of documents
that we have.</div>
					<a name="07042650000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I
said on Second Reading, I would like to say that I have the greatest
respect for the individual members of the alliance and for the alliance
as a whole, but, of course, it is not homogenous and all its members
have not agreed on every aspect of its submission. Indeed, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column116" />Column number: 116</div>within the briefing that I am referring to, on &#147;Impaired Decision
Making&#148;, the author mentions occasions when members of the
alliance had different points of view. A very good example is on the
issue of whether capacity would be a good test as the threshold for
compulsory detention in a hospital.</div>
					<a name="07042650000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of course, we all now have
MH40, a briefing from a number of other organisations that are members
of the alliance, but who write in respect of their professional
qualifications and responsibilities. They say that they are
writing</div>
					<a name="07042650000312"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to ensure that
Parliamentarians are fully aware that regarding certain key aspects of
the Bill, the Alliance does not speak for our organisations, and that
we disagree fundamentally with several of the public statements made by
them.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07042650000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am just pointing
out that it is not always the case that the alliance must be right, and
must be speaking for all its members.</div>
					<a name="07042650000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">My starting point is a point
that has been made by other Members in the debate. The briefing
says:</div>
					<a name="07042650000313"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Practitioners
in both physical and mental health care regularly conduct tests of
capacity, as they are required to do in relation to consent to medical
treatment.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07042650000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is an
important point that a lot of people have overlooked in the debate so
far. We should remember that a practitioner giving treatment without
consent could be convicted of an unlawful assault on a patient. A
practitioner who detains somebody without their consent could be guilty
of an offence of unlawful imprisonment. So, that is a very important
first test. However, the crucial difference between mental and physical
health, of course, is that, once that assessment is made, a
psychiatrist, being presented with a possible mental illness, can
override the capacity and apply, by law, a power to detain.</div>
					<a name="07042650000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is an important starting
point for our debate. As the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham
has just said in his contribution, there is evidence that people who
still have capacity are being detained at present. In fact, the
alliance&#146;s briefing says
that</div>
					<a name="07042650000314"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A recent
study found that a significant minority of detained patients,
particularly those who had been detained on a previous occasion,
retained their
capacity.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07042650000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is an
important starting point. Incidentally, the reference for that study is
&#147;Prevalence and predictors of mental incapacity in psychiatric
in-patients&#148;, by Cairns and others in the <i class="I">British Journal of
Psychiatry</i> in 2005.
</div>
					<a name="07042650000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I
think that is our starting point. Capacity is something that all
psychiatrists and medical practitioners arevery accustomed to
trying to establish, but at the moment it is not the deciding factor
when exercising the powers under the Mental Health Act 1983 to compel
detention.</div>
					<a name="07042650000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is also
important to bear it in mind that Parliament has provided for a very
long time the power to override capacity and detain compulsorily, most
recently in the Mental Health Act 1959 and the Mental Health Act 1983,
which is the Act that we are debating now. I pause to point out that,
in both of those years, the Government of the day was a Conservative
Government who clearly felt, as a matter of principle, that there were
occasions when it was right to override somebody&#146;s capacity and
detain them against their will for compulsory treatment. If people now
want to debate the principle of doing that, let us have that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column117" />Column number: 117</div>debate, but I have heard no arguments from the Opposition as to why we
should change the present position.</div>
					<a name="07042650000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have briefly reviewed why
such powers were felt to be appropriate in 1959 and 1983, and why we
still think they are appropriate today. I think that the less good
argument is a paternalistic one; the argument that we the
parliamentarians and we the psychiatrists think, &#147;This is good
for you, whether you like it or not. It is a matter of your safety or
public safety and we should do this to
you.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07042650000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is
a subtler argument. If a person is presenting with a potential mental
disorder and is saying, &#147;I refuse to have treatment,&#148; to
what extent is the refusal to have treatment part of the symptoms and
the outward emanation of the mental disorder? That is why I said in an
intervention this morning that psychiatrists were in a particularly
difficult situation in making these very, very difficult judgments on
our behalf. We give them the power and I think that we have an
obligation to back them when things go wrong, as they have done in a
high-profile way on a number of occasions and no doubt will again in
the future. That is the question of
capacity.</div>
					
					<a name="07042650000326"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.45
pm</div>
					<a name="07042650000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some have
argued&#151;this is in the alliance&#146;s document,
too&#151;that the threshold for compulsory detention should be
capacity. If a person has capacity and says, &#147;No, I refuse to
have treatment,&#148; there should not be a power to detain them
compulsorily. That brings us to the quote that my right hon. Friend the
Minister has used several times from the British Psychological Society
about letting them go even if they might be a danger to themselves and
to other people.</div>
					<a name="07042650000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">Such
a change would be a radical shift in the present state of the law and a
very dangerous one. The alliance draws back from that and says instead,
&#147;How about impaired decision making as an additional test that
is a threshold for compulsory detention?&#148; It describes that as a
less demanding test and a &#147;softer option&#148; than mental
capacity. Clearly, it recognises that mental capacity as a threshold
would be very dangerous, but that this provision is something
additional to what the law requires at present; it is a meaningful
test. As the Minister said, some people clearly will not reach this
threshold and will be turned away, even though they are presenting in
such a way that many people would think that they ought to be treated
even if they will not consent to
it.</div>
					<a name="07042650000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">So I hesitate to
say whether we should have an additional test and I look, then, to
where we are with the words before us today. The explanatory notes to
the Bill say that</div>
					<a name="07042650000315"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;there
is no precedent for this provision in legislation in England and
Wales&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07042650000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">However familiar
psychiatrists are with such a phrase, interpreting it among themselves
and in their assessments of patients, it is not something which in
England and Wales has legal meaning or of which there is legal
understanding such that we can all say that we are confident what the
outcome of adopting such a test would be.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column118" />Column number: 118</div>
					<a name="07042650000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">The alliance&#146;s briefing
says that we can now lookto an Act in Scotland&#151;the
Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003&#151;which
says that</div>
					<a name="07042650000316"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a patient
cannot be brought under the Act unless his ability to make decisions
about his treatment is deemed to be significantly impaired as a result
of his mental
disorder.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07042650000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">I immediately
point out that that wording is different from the wording in our Bill,
so even if anyone had evidence of how the changes have been effected in
Scotland&#151;they do not yet, because it is too soon to
tell&#151;it still would not be a great guide for us, because it is a
different test.</div>
					<a name="07042650000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
alliance quotes the British Psychological Society in a different
context&#151;its evidence to the Joint Scrutiny Committee back in
2004. In its submission, the society says that it notes
that</div>
					<a name="07042650000317"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the Human Rights
Act legitimises such compulsion only in the case of &#145;persons of
unsound mind&#146;. As psychologists, it is axiomatic that being
&#145;of unsound mind&#146; equates to being significantly impaired
in decision-making&#151;in this case being harmfully and
significantly influenced by the mental
disorder.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07042650000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think that
we are being in a sense conned. It is being said to us that it is
axiomatic that if a person says that they want to commit suicide, they
must have impaired decision making and therefore, &#147;Don&#146;t
worry. We will still detain them.&#148; However, as the Minister has
warned us time and again, that is not necessarily the interpretation of
the practice that will follow as a result of adopting this test, so I
for one am extremely hesitant about accepting
it.</div>
					<a name="07042650000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">My last word on
the alliance&#146;s briefing is this. Atthe end, it
helpfully refers us to the world view about what good legislation
should be. It says that theWorld Psychiatric Association
approved at its general assembly on 25 August 1996 a statement of its
ethical standards. The briefing
says:</div>
					<a name="07042650000318"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Article
4 states &#145;When the patient is incapacitated
and/or&#148;&#151;</div>
					<a name="07042650000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">incidentally,
the &#147;and/or&#148; is
important&#151;</div>
					<a name="07042650000319"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;unable
to exercise proper judgment because of a mental disorder, the
psychiatrists should consult with the family and, if appropriate, seek
legal counsel, to safeguard the human dignity and the legal rights of
the patient. No treatment should be provided against the
patient&#146;s will, unless withholding treatment would endanger the
life of the patient and/or those who surround him or her. Treatment
must always be in the best interest of the
patient.&#146;&#148;</div>
					<a name="07042650000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
happen to think that the Government&#146;s view of what this law
should say is closer to that statement thanwhat clause 4
includes in the Bill as a result of the amendment in the House of
Lords. We may not all necessarily be reassured that that good statement
is completely covered by the Bill. Like the hon. Member for Southport,
I want to continue to consider whether some other amendment could
reassure everybody that the use of the powers will be interpreted in
accordance with that statement of principle. We may be able to have a
debate about that when we discuss clause 10, but, for the moment, I do
not think that this clause should stand part of the
Bill.</div>
				
					
					<a name="07042650000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07042650000432"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> Obviously, this has been a full debate, and I
want briefly to pick up on a few points made by hon. Members.</div>
					<a name="07042650000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for Southport
rightly said that there is a difficulty in adopting a test such as that
which is proposed, because we are all clear that we do not 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column119" />Column number: 119</div>know how it would work; there is consensus that we do not know what the
effects would be. Some hon. Members have said, &#147;It is used in
Scotland, so we should use it.&#148; As legislators, we must make the
decision on the basis of the evidence before us.</div>
					<a name="07042650000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">We should ask what we know the
effect will be. We do not know, and merely to say that something
happens in Scotland should not be our approach. We know various things,
but as the hon. Member for Southport said, we do not know very much
about this extra test&#151;it is a leap in the dark. My hon. Friend
the Member for Stockport said that the element of confusion is
enormous, particularly in respect of the Mental Capacity Act
2005.</div>
					<a name="07042650000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are further
taking away clinicians&#146; discretion to decide whether a person
poses a risk to themselves or to others. Another test is being put on
top of that, and it will mean that certain people will not be able to
get treatment. Everybody is agreed on that. The British Psychological
Society says that the number involved will be small. The hon. Member
for East Worthing and Shoreham said that many people would not
necessarily need to be detained if such a test were included. The
figures cited vary from very few to quite a lot, but as my hon. Friend
the Member for Stafford said, differences also exist within the Mental
Health Alliance about whether the provision on impaired decision making
should be included. The Royal College of Nursing has said that to
include it would be wrong because certain people would not get
treatment.</div>
					<a name="07042650000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">I ask
Opposition Members to consider the fact that they do not know the
number of people who will not get treatment, although they know that we
will have to say to some people, &#147;I am sorry but the impaired
decision-making test overrides the test of whether somebody is a danger
to themselves or to others. Even where someone is a danger to
themselves and to others, they cannot be detained because they do not
have impaired judgment.&#148; This a matter of numbers, but let us
make no mistake: the numbers exist. It is wrong for us to change the
current position and do something that we all know will lead to fewer
people getting treatment. That is why I ask the Committee to reject
clause
4.</div>
					
					<a name="07042650000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07042650000433"></a>Dr.
Pugh:
						</b> Will the Minister help me with a slightly tangential
point? Are the conditions for compulsory admission for treatment
identical in every respect to those for admission for treatment? Once
conditions are met, cannot a person simply be admitted but treated in
whatever way it is decided that they want to be
treated?</div>
					
					<a name="07042650000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07042650000434"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> Again, there is a problem with the test. In
many cases, treatment is given to people who started off with impaired
judgment, but if an individual&#146;s judgment became less impaired
and that person went before a tribunal and on that particular day the
condition had changed, it would override the danger to themselves or
others. That must be remembered about the test. The numbers are there;
they range from very small numbers of people to larger numbers who, as
the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham said, would not be
detained as a result of this change. I therefore ask hon. Members to
think carefully about making such a change.</div>

Winterton:
						</b> The purpose of amendment No. 17 is again, I am
afraid, to change what was put into the Bill by the other place. It
will restore the appropriate medical treatment test to its original
form and once again remove the so-called treatability test that was
reinstated in another way in the other place. While the amendment will
change the position of the House of Lords, amendment No. 59 is an
attempt to compromise between the two. Amendments Nos. 19 and 20
restore the changes that we wish to make to the test that second
opinion appointed doctors must apply when deciding whether to authorise
certain
treatments.</div>
					
					<a name="07042650000327"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3
pm</div>
					<a name="07042650000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">The so-called
treatability test is one of the criteria for detaining people for
medical treatment, if their medical disorder is categorised as either
psychopathic or mental impairment. It requires the doctor recommending
detention to state that treatment is likely to alleviate or prevent
deterioration in the patient&#146;s condition. The treatability test
is not one of the criteria for detaining patients categorised as having
a mental illness or severe mental impairment. In other words, it is not
one of the criteria for detaining the vast majority of patients, either
under the civil system in part 2 of the Bill or the provisions in part
3 relating to offenders.</div>
					
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column121" />Column number: 121</div>
					<a name="07042650000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">The current wording derives from
the Mental Health (Amendment) Act 1982. The origins of the treatability
test go back to the 1959 Act and the Percy commission, which preceded
it. At the time, it was based largely on the notion that society owes a
greater duty to protect people with mental illness or more serious
learning disabilities than it does to those suffering from psychopathic
disorders or less serious learning disabilities. The idea was that
those in the former groups might deserve to be protected by being
housed in a hospital even if their disorder could not be expected to
improve as a result of
treatment.</div>
					<a name="07042650000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">Over time,
attitudes have changed, and we no longer judge the value of the
treatability test by those criteria. The debate now is about whether we
should persist in talking about the concept of treatability at all,
given what we know now about the options for treating people, and about
whether it is right to have a test that requires clinicians to predict
whether treatment is likely to have a beneficial effect before they can
detain someone. For the Government, the salient questions are: does the
test help people to get treatment, whether voluntary or compulsory?
Does it help clinicians to treat people? Does it provide the necessary
safeguards for patients that cannot be provided any other way? Those
are the questions that we are addressing at the
moment.</div>
					<a name="07042650000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">Treatability
is not the sole bulwark against non-therapeutic detention; there are
other criteria. In fact, the treatability test in the Bill does not
even apply to those detained for assessment&#151;nearly half of all
detentions under the Mental Health Act&#151;and it does not apply to
the large majority of the rest until after they have been detained. The
test cannot guarantee therapeutic benefits. No one can guarantee that
treatment will work. Appropriate medical treatment, which we want to
introduce, does not mean that people can be locked up without
treatment. That is precisely why the Bill states that appropriate
medical treatment must be available. Of course, it would be wrong to
detain people for treatment without actually offering them any, but the
Bill does not require or allow
that.</div>
					<a name="07042650000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">The problem with
the treatability test is that it has stood in the way of a number of
people in need of treatment. It has had quite a pervasive effect in
mental health services. Leading forensic psychiatrist Professor Tony
Maden summed it up when he wrote in a letter to <i class="I">The Guardian
</i>recently that the treatability test</div>
					<a name="07042650000320"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;was included in the 1983 Act for
the best of intentions, but proved a disaster in
practice.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07042650000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">The key to
that disaster is the way in which the test has contributed to a culture
in which certain groups of patients, particularly those with
personality disorders, are too often simply written off as untreatable
without regard to whether potentially effective treatment is available.
Such treatment is increasingly available but its development is being
impeded by a culture, fostered by the treatability test, of dismissing
people as untreatable when their needs cannot be met by general
psychiatric
services.</div>
					<a name="07042650000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">Curiously
enough, two committees of the British Medical Association wrote to me
recently suggesting that personality disorders be excluded from the
scope of the Bill because they are untreatable. That is the kind of
myth that has pervaded services and service delivery because there is a
treatability test. It has led to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column122" />Column number: 122</div>people being turned away from services or discharged after a period of
crisis intervention without proper follow-up. It is important to
recognise that because of the changes that have been made in the
treatments that are available, we need to ensure that nothing stands in
the way of getting treatment to people who can benefit from
it.</div>
					<a name="07042650000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">A sad result of
people being turned away from services was highlighted by Baroness
Corston in her recent report about the prison system. She found that
many women with personality disorders end up in the prison system
rather than being diverted into a hospital to get treatment. She
welcomed the changes that weare introducing in the Bill
because they mean that services can be developed and people can be more
appropriately
placed.</div>

							<b class="B">Meg
Hillier</b> (Hackney, South and Shoreditch) (Lab/Co-op): My
right hon. Friend may not be aware that I am representing the family of
a mental health patient who had been in and out of the Homerton
hospital in my constituency for two years, being treated for suspected
schizophrenia. On 7 July last year, he murdered a man by pushing him
under a tube train at Highbury and Islington station. Everyone,
including the defence counsel, believed that he would be put in
Broadmoor for the rest of his life under sections 37 and 41 of the
Mental Health Act 1983, but to our surprise, Broadmoor professionals
have judged that because he has a personality disorder he will not be
put in a mental hospital, but will go to prison. Tomorrow, he will be
given a prison sentence, yet he has a clear mental health
problem.</div>
					<a name="07042650000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">We must
remember the people involved&#151;not just the murder victim and his
family, but the family of the patient and the patient himself. I have
sat through two and a half days of debate listening to legal points
being made, but we are dealing with people. My constituent&#146;s
mother comes to see me in great distress; her distress, and that of her
family and the patient, will not be any less if he is put in
prison.</div>

							<a name="07042650000458"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> My hon. Friend has a very great understanding
of some of the problems that have been caused by the treatability test,
especially because of her constituency work in this case. I am grateful
for her support for our view, which is reflected by others, especially
in Jean Corston&#146;s report, that that test has stood in the way of
people getting treatment. It has also meant that people end up in the
wrong place, with tragic
consequences.</div>
					<a name="07042650000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another
extremely difficult and sensitive consideration is that the
treatability test is also a perverse incentive for people not to comply
with treatment. Tony Maden, a forensic psychiatrist, has spoken to me
about the fact that in Broadmoor, for example, lawyers have advised
their patients not to engage with treatment because if it can be proved
that they are not treatable they have to be released. Naturally, a
mental health review tribunal would not accept that, but nevertheless
there is that perverse incentive at present because of the treatability
test, and people can quarrel about whether they are detainable in
sometimes very difficult circumstances.</div>

Loughton:
						</b> We have heard this story before. On Monday we
interviewed Lucy Scott-Moncrieff, who is a member of the Law
Society&#146;s mental health and disability committee, and we have
spoken to other lawyers and experts on the matter. She said
categorically that she does not believe that it is a problem and that
she could count on the fingers of one hand the number of inmates of
Broadmoor who, in20 years, have been deemed untreatable. Of
those, only one was let out, and that was against the doctor&#146;s
recommendation. The same line came from Alan Franey, the chief
executive of Broadmoor for many years, who also supports our position.
If the Minister has evidence, she needs to produce it rather than come
up with wild accusations that seem to have no basis in fact or
reality.</div>

dangerous severe personality disorder section of Broadmoor, which is
relatively new. It was full of people who had been in prison and were
given the opportunity to come to a hospital environment to be treated
and looked after. All of them were there by choice, and they all
preferred that setting to being in prison, which is entirely contrary

					<a name="07042650000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is important
that we recognise that the current situation has in some instances
prevented services from being developed and turned some people away
from services as a result, and that it also provides a perverse
incentive to make certain arguments in front of tribunals. It is
because of those problems that appropriate medical treatment is much
better.</div>

					<a name="07042650000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">The change will
get rid of the incentive to resist treatment and remove all trace of
the language of treatability. At the same time, it will give patients a
safeguard that is every bit as good&#151;better, in fact, because no
one will be able to be detained for medical treatment unless they are
to be offered treatment thatis appropriate for their disorder
and for them as individuals. The hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton
and I discussed that issue this morning, particularly when considering
the situation for people with autistic spectrum disorder. The
psychiatrist whom the hon. Lady brought to meet me said that she knew
of people with autistic spectrum disorder and Asperger&#146;s
syndrome who had been turned away from services and told that they were
untreatable, and so she felt that there was a lack of service provision
for them. We needed to ensure that the development of services was not
an excuse that could be hidden behind as regards the Mental Health Act
and the treatability test. I thought that that she gave a good example
of why that had caused problems, in this case not just for people with
personality disorders, but for those with ASD and
Asperger&#146;s.</div>

							<b class="B">Sandra
Gidley</b> (Romsey) (LD): I am trying to follow the argument
that the previous law somehow led to a barrier to the development of
services. Surely if a condition was treatable in some parts of the
country, treatment not being available in a particular area would not
be a barrier to detainment&#151;or it should not be. In fact, is this
not a Government problem in terms of not developing the appropriate
services?</div>
					
					<a name="07042650000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07042650000474"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> No, I am afraid that the approach has led to a
culture of saying that if a condition is not treatable, there is no
point in developing services to try to treat it. I went to east London
recently, where I met an impressive woman psychiatrist who said that,
for the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column125" />Column number: 125</div>
						first time&#151;she had been there some 25 to 30
years&#151;services were being developed for people with personality
disorders. The Government have tried to pilot several schemes to
encourage the development of services, but there is no doubt that the
test has been a barrier. The psychiatrist with the hon. Member for
Tiverton and Honiton said the same thing.</div>
					<a name="07042650000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are trying to get rid of
that test, as we need to make clear that certain criteria must be met
under mental health legislation. First, does the person have a mental
disorder? Secondly, are they a risk to themselves or to others?
Thirdly, does that treatment have to be given in a hospital setting?
Fourthly, is appropriate medical treatment available for an individual?
We are clear about what counts as appropriate medical treatment. We are
not just asking whether treatment is available somewhere at some point
in the future, or whether treatment could be provided, with wishful
thinking; it must be a treatment that suits the individual at that
time. For the first time, the clause puts that argument on a good legal
footing, and it would enable the tribunal to look at whether treatment
is appropriate for the individual. That is what the psychiatrist whom
the hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton brought to meet me this
morning said. She spoke about the very issue of appropriate medical
treatment and how important it is that we make that change, so as to
give that legal basis&#151;in this case, to help with and encourage
the development of services. Once we overcome the idea that certain
conditions are untreatable in a culture, we can move to a whole
different level.</div>

							<a name="07042650000475"></a>Angela
Browning:
						</b> The Minister will know that a great deal of our
debate has focused on the more critical end of treatment&#151;she
mentioned crisis management and so on&#151;but it is actually in the
stages prior to that point that services are at a far lower level.
Whatever the Bill determines, appropriate treatment needs to be
provided, because many people will still end up in crisis in these
situations, purely on the basis that sustained and appropriate
treatment was not available to them on the path that they took to reach
the point that she describes. I hope that this Bill and her intentions
will encompass appropriate treatment in the community and will be
shared across agencies.We know that mental health patients
often need multidisciplinary teams often need to address the problems
of mental health patients at a much lower
level.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07042650000476"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> The hon. Lady is right. That is why the
psychiatrist whom she brought to see me this morning
welcomed our plans for supervised community treatment and said that it
is important that we have those services in the community and do not
just wait until people get to crisis point. That is a real issue. What
has happened with treatability is that people get to crisis point
because there has not been the service development that we would like
to
see.</div>

							<a name="07042650000477"></a>James
Duddridge:
						</b> If I follow the Minister&#146;s logic, she is
saying that a category of people is going untreated because of the
peculiarities of legislation, and that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column126" />Column number: 126</div>although more people will be treated overall, there will remain a
category that will be untreatable. I was going to ask her to put a
number on both figures for those who would be receiving treatment but
do not currently receive it and those whom I would term the
untreatable. Perhaps there are
none.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07042650000478"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman needs to recognise that the
problem at the moment arises because of the treatability test and the
pervasive culture that says, &#147;These people are
untreatable&#148;. For example, my hon. Friend the Member for
Hackney, South and Shoreditch mentioned her constituent who was told
that there could not be a particular disposal in terms of the court
because his condition was untreatable. We hear about that time and
again. A woman came to see me in respect of the Mental Health Alliance
lobby and said, &#147;Rosie, I have a multiple personality disorder
and keep being told I am untreatable.&#148; I said,
&#147;That&#146;s exactly why we want to make the changes that we
are trying to make at the
moment.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07042650000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">At the
moment, many people with personality disorders, for example, are
experiencing exactly what my constituent experienced. It is important
that, overall, in our mental health legislation we try to deal with
that. We want to introduce some supervised community treatment to
ensure that people get treatment when they need it. This is about the
development of services in the community. However, if the untreatable
label is hanging over things the whole time, it is difficult for those
services to develop in the first place. That is why we want to replace
the treatability test with an appropriate medical
treatment.</div>
					<a name="07042650000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Rochford and Southend, East asked about what is untreatable.
Again, that was something that the psychiatrist introduced to me by the
hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton mentioned and the Committee
discussed this morning. The psychiatrist felt that the problem was that
the treatability test was interventionist, like giving an individual an
injection or medication, and that people can come to associate that
with treatability. She said, &#147;I can&#146;t cure
Asperger&#146;s syndrome, but I know that there are things that I can
do to help.&#148; Some of those things even boil down to ensuring
that somebody is properly nursed and under nursing
care.</div>
					<a name="07042650000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">When we talk
about untreatability, it is important to recognise that some people go
through a crisis and, even in the course of detention&#151;this is
where we have a big problem with the amendment made in the
Houseof Lords&#151;it is not always possible to say that
theywill immediately get better. Some people in such
circumstances may deteriorate to start with and get better after that.
In a sense, the treatability test has got in the way of good care
because it implies something much more active and sometimes it just
might be appropriate for the individual to have, as I have said, good
nursing care&#151;observation and somebody to talk to at a
particularly difficult time&#151;as opposed to what some regard as
interventionist
treatment.</div>

						</b> This may be an unscientific, layman&#146;s

to refer patients to something that I shall describe as 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column127" />Column number: 127</div>
						sanctuary&#151;a safe place in which there may be
support of a non-invasive nature. A lot of our mental hospitals are now
predominantly admitting people in crisis, which makes the environment
inappropriate for people with acute depression, and that would also
apply to my Asperger group.</div>
					<a name="07042650000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">When the Minister talks about
appropriate medical treatment, can she expand on what it encompasses? A
safe place of sanctuary that is supervised and without lots of

there. It is certainly not out there in sufficient quantity for it to
have any impact on the definition. Can she expand on
that?</div>

						</b> It is important to say again that it is very
difficult for us to predict in advance what the appropriate treatment
would be for every single individual. It has to be up to the clinician
to decide what is best. However, if the clinician was detaining
somebody, they would need to be able to say whatwas
appropriate for that individual. That is a very important change. From
the treatability tests, they must be able to say that appropriate
medical treatment is available and that it meets the needs of that
individual. As the hon. Lady said, if meeting the needs of an
individual does not entail direct intervention and that keeping them
safe is the right thing, then that is what should be available. The
problem we have at the moment is that the treatability tests lead
people in the other direction and that is why we want to get rid of
them.</div>

useful, particularly as it implies broad support. The reason why I was
struggling between the two definitions is that this is at such a low
level. Everyone should deserve support, so everybody should be treated.
Therefore, I do not really understand what the problem is. Perhaps I
did not explain myself first 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column128" />Column number: 128</div>time around, but I was saying that the definitionof medical
support was helpful, because it included support in general. Surely
everyone deserves such support. People can be given support; as a
definition, it implies a low level of intervention. I do not understand
why there would be a problem with the Bill as it stands after coming
from the other
place.</div>

						</b> The problem is that of effectively reinstating
the treatability test. That is why it uses the same barriers that have
existed from the beginning. It is saying that the treatment is likely
to alleviate or prevent deterioration in a patient&#146;s condition.
I do not have the wording in front of me. The difficulty is in
predicting that treatment will alleviate or prevent a deterioration.
One of the problems is that we then become mixed up not only in proving
in advance, but in the difficulties caused when talking about
treatability and
curing.</div>
					<a name="07042650000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall move
on because I want to address amendment No. 59. I am grateful to my hon.
Friends the Members for Rhondda, for Bridgend and for Stockport for
tabling it. It attempts to define appropriate medical treatment as
treatment that is intended to do what I described as the
difficulty&#151;to alleviate or prevent a deterioration in
someone&#146;s condition. The amendment tabled in the other place
would restore the treatability test, which is treatment that is
intended rather than likely to alleviate orprevent
deterioration in the patient&#146;s condition. The amendment is not
dissimilar to the amendment tabled by the Government in another place
to make explicit the purpose of treatment for mental disorder. Unlike
the Opposition, whose amendment appears in the Bill as it is currently
drafted, my hon. Friends have looked closely at whether there is a way
to avoid some of the perverse incentives to which I have
referred.</div>
					<a name="07042650000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">My main
caveat is that there is more to appropriate medical treatment than
merely a substitute for the treatability test. It is also intended to
provide a new safeguard for patients, namely, that medical treatment
must be appropriate to them as individuals. I am slightly worried that
the amendment would not cover that, so I find it difficult to support
it today. However, I shall certainly take it away and think further
about it, particularly if my hon. Friends can expand a little more on
exactly how they have moulded it and their interpretation of
it.</div>
					<a name="07042650000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">As for Government
amendments Nos. 19 and 20, I believe that no one has anything to fear
from the changes that we wish to make to the tests to be applied by
second opinion approved doctors when authorising treatment under part 4
of the 1983 Act. We do not expect the changes to make a material
difference to what SOADs can and will authorise, but that does not make
them unimportant. Our amendments make explicit the breadth of what
SOADs must consider but, in so doing, they will not dilute the current
test.</div>
					<a name="07042650000259"></a><div class="hs_Para">In summary,
Government amendments Nos. 19 and 20 would merely reinstate wording
that more accurately reflects the work of SOADs. By contrast,
Government amendment No. 17 corrects what would otherwise be a serious
mistake and a missed opportunity to improve the criteria for detention
under the Act.</div>

					<a name="07042650000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would like to hear my hon.

suggestion of compromise and one that I will reflect on
further.</div>

							<a name="07042650000487"></a>Chris
Bryant:
						</b> It is a delight to serve under your chairmanship,
Miss Begg. I normally sit next to you in the House, where you sometimes
run over my foot, so it is nice to be at a slightly safer distance from
you this afternoon. I would like to say a few things before I
specifically talk to the amendment in my name and those of my hon.
Friend the Member for Bridgend, my near neighbour, and of my hon.
Friend the Member for
Stockport.</div>
					<a name="07042650000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">First, a
lot of stereotypes of different people&#146;s views seem to be
floating around in the debate. Some people stereotype the
Government&#146;s view as wanting to lock up anybody who has any kind
of mental disorder whatever. Sometimes even the hon. Member for East
Worthing and Shoreham slips slightly towards suggesting that the
Government have such motives. In his calmer moments, I know that the
hon. Gentleman would know and say that that is not what the Government
intend at all. Others would seem to suggest that those with a
libertarian point of view believe that absolutely nobody, ever, in a
free society should be detained under a mental health Act and that
people should only ever be detained under the criminal justice system
for things that they have done. Both are stereotypes that we should
eschew. I do not believe that anyone in the Committee holds either
view.</div>
					<a name="07042650000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">If that is true,
we must believe that some people ought to be detained under mental
health legislation by virtue of their mental disorder. It must also,
therefore, be clear that there must be some form of treatability test.
I say some form of treatability test, because as we have already
removed the two concepts of mental impairment and psychopathic disorder
from the 1983 Act, it seems clear that the old treatability
test cannot survive. Nor, for that matter, do I believe that there
should be a curability test, which is what some people understand the
treatability test to be. We cannot simply say that because we cannot
cure A, B or C conditions, we ought not be able to detain somebody.
What we may believe to be incurable today may not be what we believe to
be incurable or&#151;I hope&#151;curable in 10, 15 or 20
years&#146; time.</div>
					<a name="07042650000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for Tiverton
and Honiton made many references to advances in the understanding of
autism. I believe that there will be significant changes in how we
understand personality disorders in the next 20 to 30 years. It is
probable that in the past we have not invested enough in investigating
the aetiology of such conditions. We probably need to do more about
that, which I hope will pay
dividends.</div>
					<a name="07042650000265"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, I
am left with some very importantthings that we need to
consider. Yesterday I spent a considerable amount of
time with a lot of psychiatrists&#151;I know that that does not sound
right, but I am sure that hon. Members will understand what I mean.
Some of the psychiatrists maintained that the way the Government were
moving with the clause was inappropriate. Their argument was that the
Government were being driven by some psychiatrists out there trying to
drum up business for themselves, particularly high-profile business, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column130" />Column number: 130</div>
						running new clinics to deal with people with
personality disorders. I had to say to my psychiatrist friends that I
thought that that was really rather good news&#151;it is good if
people are saying, yes, here is a whole area of psychiatric treatment
that we have not yet done enough work on. If there are
psychiatrists&#151;in fact, more likely psychologists, in this
area&#151;who are trying to explore the recesses of how people come
to develop or acquire personality disorders and how those disorders can
be treated, then that ought to be wholly
welcomed.</div>
					<a name="07042650000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also think
that, as my hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch in
a sense pointed out in her intervention on my right hon. Friend the
Minister, the way in which the criminal justice system overlaps with
the mental health system is an important factor. In too many cases, the
victims of crimes that were perpetrated by people with personality
disorders are let down by one or other system because they are not kept
informed about what is happening to the people who committed those
crimes.</div>
					<a name="07042650000267"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon.
Friend mentioned a case in which the criminal justice system went in
one direction and I referred on Second Reading to another in which the
actress Lynda Bellingham had exactly the opposite experience. The
courts said that if she withdrew the charges against the person who had
thrown a fire bomb through her window because that person had a
significant mental disorder, then the judge would commit him to a
hospital. However, in the event, the moment she withdrew the charges,
the court decided that it could not do that because the gentleman had
already been in hospital for some time. He went on to cause further
problems to Lynda Bellingham and on top of that took his own life only
a week later.</div>
					<a name="07042650000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are clearly instances in which the mental health system and the
criminal justice system do not interrelate appropriately for the
victims of crimes perpetrated by people with mental disorders or in the
interests of those people themselves. There are even cases in which
there is a direct incentive for somebody to say to his lawyer,
&#147;I would prefer to go to prison than into the mental health
system, because I know that I will be out in two years&#146; time
when my sentence comes to an end, even though the environment might not
be a therapeutic one&#148;. He might, of course, gain some benefit
from the services that are provided to him in prison. That is an
important issue that we need to bear in
mind.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07042650000488"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> It is important to remember that. I take on
board the point made by the hon. Member for Broxbourne about the
release of the wrong person. The fact that the majority of restricted
patients detained under the category of psychopathic disorder claim
untreatability at some point during their detention is a reminder of
that important
point.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07042650000489"></a>Chris
Bryant:
						</b> Absolutely. The Minister is right. I would also
make the point that even in respect of conditions that some people
believe to be incurable and many believe to be untreatable, early
intervention by the mental health services is of enormous value.
Indeed, we touched in our debate on Tuesday on black African Caribbean
members of the community, who are probably far too often detained in
the mental health system for psychotic disorders. Many people have
pointed out that the very late presentation of people in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column131" />Column number: 131</div>their mental disorder is one of the factors that leads to their eventual
detention. If it were possible to ensure far more early intervention,
with the appropriate treatment, we might be able to avoid the need for
detention. The more that we as a society can avoid the need for
detention, the better it will be in respect of the health of the
individual and the costs to the state.</div>
					
					<a name="07042650000271"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07042650000490"></a>Angela
Browning:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman mentioned costs right at the
end of his sentence. It is very difficult to persuade service providers
that a little investmentin people at a lower level, so to
speak, saves a huge amount at the other end. In terms of human
suffering it is almost unquantifiable.</div>

							<a name="07042650000491"></a>Chris
Bryant:
						</b> The hon. Lady is absolutely right. One of our
difficulties in persuading mental health services to make that
investment and indeed in persuading people to present is associated
with the stigma that sometimes attaches to specific communities and
individuals. It is a sad fact that a young gay man is six times more
likely than a young straight man to commit suicide under the age of 16.
By definition, those young people find it difficult to come forward to
psychiatric services, because they already feel alienated from society.
The more we can do to transform that situation, the better. It is in
everybody&#146;s interests. We are light years away from where we
were 30 or 40 years ago, as I know from my own
experience.</div>

						<a name="07042650000492"></a>
							<b class="B">Mrs.
Madeleine Moon</b> (Bridgend) (Lab): We have had discussions
about early treatability; my hon. Friend has also mentioned the
difficulty that people with personality disorders have had in accessing
treatment and services. Does he agree that the whole point of the
amendment is for the term &#147;intended&#148; to open up the
potential for a lot of people to have treatment, which we hope will
prevent long-term deterioration? It would mean that people would at
least get access, albeit belatedly, to services that they would not
otherwise have
got.</div>

							<a name="07042650000493"></a>Chris
Bryant:
						</b> As is often the case, my hon. Friend puts far more
eloquently than I would do the point that I was about to make. Before I
get to the specifics of the amendment, I want to make a further general
point. Even with what I hope will be the end result of the Bill,
clinicians will sometimes make mistakes about whom to detain and whom
not to detain. I wholly deprecate the fact that the print media in
particular often plays at saying &#147;Let&#146;s search for the
clinician who got it wrong&#148; when somebody commits suicide or
kills someone else after having been through the mental health
system.</div>
					<a name="07042650000275"></a><div class="hs_Para">In my
experience, everybody who works in the system copes with enormous
stress and strain; the chaotic lifestyles of others descend on them on
a daily basis, which can place huge pressures on them. They are wholly
to be commended. I fear that the blame culture that sometimes surrounds
the issues has made it difficult for people entering medical school to
think about psychiatry as their future career. That is one reason why
we still do not have enough consultant psychiatrists or enough people
applying for vacancies. I hope that we will be able to transform that
situation in the years ahead.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column132" />Column number: 132</div>
					<a name="07042650000276"></a><div class="hs_Para">I like the Lords amendment in
part, but I think that it has significant problems. It is in two parts;
I shall deal with them in the wrong order, chronologically speaking.
First, I shall refer to the second element of the amendment, which
relates to</div>
					<a name="07042650000277"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;treatment
which is likely to alleviate or prevent a deterioration in his
condition&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07042650000278"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the
Minister said, there are many cases in which one knows that the mere
fact of somebody&#146;s detention means that their personality
disorder or other condition will deteriorate. That is a simple point of
fact, because losing their freedom and their volition might well
exacerbate their condition. In many cases, it is therefore difficult in
the short term for a clinician to say unambiguously and without threat
of challenge that the action taken will alleviate or prevent a
deterioration in the condition. In the short term at least, it will
almost certainly cause deterioration.</div>
					
					<a name="07042650000279"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07042650000494"></a>Dr.
Pugh:
						</b> The Lords amendment does not refer to an immediate
amelioration or worsening of the condition; it simply says that that
will occur. It is therefore perfectly compatible with people being
admitted and going on a downward spiral for a short
period.</div>

						<i class="I">
							<b class="B"> </b>
						</i>I did not say
&#147;immediately&#148;, so I was not seeking to misrepresent the
Lords amendment. There are many cases in which it is uncertain how long
that period might be. A lawyer would certainly be able to ask a
tribunal, &#147;Is the person&#146;s condition going to get better
in two, four, six or eight weeks?&#148; That is the problem with the
Lords amendment.</div>
					<a name="07042650000281"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another problem is that a
person&#146;s condition may have many different facets, and for that
matter, many symptoms. A clinician may want to treat some of the
symptoms and some of the conditions, althoughthe treatment may
not be able rectify, in any sense,the underlying causes of
those symptoms and the condition itself. That is why there might be
value in exploring whether it would be better to refer to elements or
symptoms of the condition, rather thanthe condition
itself.</div>
					<a name="07042650000282"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have also
tabled an amendment, along with my hon. Friends the Members for
Bridgend and for Stockport&#151;they are my friends&#151;on the
issue of likelihood. It is quite interesting that the hon. Member for
East Worthing and Shoreham referred to the hope that, in the ordinary
provision of treatment, one in three people would benefit from the
treatment provided. However, the likelihood of treatment alleviating or
preventing a deterioration in condition suggests a more than 50 per
cent. chance. However, it is rare for any treatment to guarantee more
than a 50 per cent. chance of doing either of those two things. That is
why I do not very much like the word
&#147;likely&#148;.</div>

well-intentioned, but it struck me that it is, to some extent, a guinea
pig&#146;s charter, because, increasingly, we must have an evidence
base for what we do. If a treatment has had some proven benefit in some
cases, there is an argument for accepting that. Surely,
ifthere is a good intent but no proof that
somethingever works, that opens vulnerable patients up to
experimentation.</div>

an element of likelihood in any degree of intention, but I want to

is making a very good case. I am slightly enamoured of his amendment,
as it contains a scintilla of the therapeutic benefit that we think is
very important. However, what the clinician intends as appropriate
could be a subjective judgment, and it is important in all aspects of
medicine that there is an evidence base for their intervention. Would
the word &#147;intend&#148; mean that the intention could be
examined by a tribunal to ensure that it was reasonable from the point
of view of its likely effect given the evidence base, because it is the
evidence base that is important in respect of the point that he is

something that was not in the interests of the patient, clearly one
would not be intending appropriate medical treatment. Obviously, that
must be judgable and verifiable on the basis of evidence according to
treatment that has been provided to others. But the word
&#147;likely&#148; on its own and ofitself suggests not
the one in three benefiting fromthe treatment that is provided
