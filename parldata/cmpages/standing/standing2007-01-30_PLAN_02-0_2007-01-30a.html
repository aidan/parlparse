							<b class="B">Mr.
Mark Francois</b> (Rayleigh) (Con): I beg to move, That the
clause be read a Second
time.</div>
					<a name="07013117000013"></a><div class="hs_Para">I welcome you to
the Chair, Mr. Hood. We now come to the
information-technology related aspects of the Bill. The aim is to
establish a reporting system on the progress of any new computer system
that might result from the Bill&#146;s provisions and specifically to
ensure that the Public Accounts Committee is kept appraised of
progress&#151;or otherwise&#151;twice a year. That is important, as
the explanatory notes make it plain that one of the Bill&#146;s
objectives is to permit expenditure specifically on computer systems to
assist with the introduction of the planning gain supplement.
</div>
					<a name="07013117000014"></a><div class="hs_Para">Indeed, under the
heading &#147;Financial effects of the Bill&#148;, the notes point
out that</div>
					<a name="07013117000084"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
financial effects of this Bill will be to authorise expenditure
principally on designing and building an administrative system to
administer the PGS, including the necessary business processes and in
particular an IT system.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07013117000015"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government estimate the cost at some
&#163;40 million. However, their overall record on managing IT
programmes, such as the one envisaged in the Bill, is unfortunately far
from encouraging. There are myriad examples of IT programmes that have
gone badly wrong under the present Administration, but in the interests
of time, I shall illustrate the point with only three.</div>
					<a name="07013117000016"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Department for Work and
Pensions&#146;s Child Support Agency famously spent almost
&#163;500 million on a new computer system known as CS2. It was
eventually launched in April 2003, about two years late and &#163;56
million over budget. The system was unable to migrate the backlog of
CSA pages on to its mainframe, and it is generally accepted that the
system will never work as originally intended.</div>
					<a name="07013117000017"></a><div class="hs_Para">I turn briefly to the Home
Office&#146;s IT record. Where should one start? I shall pick one
example. The new database for the Criminal Records Bureau, which 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column48" />Column number: 49</div>achieved notoriety for other reasons&#151;I shall not dwell on them
now&#151;was introduced in 2004, but the costs had doubled from the
original budget of &#163;200 million.
</div>
					<a name="07013117000018"></a><div class="hs_Para">We then have what I
might call the mother of all Government IT projects&#151;the new
national health service computer system, including the link between GPs
and hospitals and incorporating the so-called choose and book system.
That massive project was due to be fully installed by 2012, at
a total cost of &#163;6.2 billion, but it is running late in
many parts of the country. According to the National Audit Office,
which reports to the Public Accounts Committee, the cost has now
spiralled to about &#163;12.4 billion&#151;double the original
estimate.</div>
					<a name="07013117000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">We might be
reassured if the Treasury, which is supposed to be the guardian of
public finances, had a better record in IT procurement. However, the
Treasury and its agencies are not a great deal better. I remember
speaking for the Opposition in the debates on the Commissioners for
Revenue and Customs Bill, under which the Inland Revenue and Customs
and Excise were merged. That merger involved some 250 IT systems being
brought together in one organisation&#151;a major challenge for Her
Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs.</div>
					<a name="07013117000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">One example that springs to
mind is the tax credits computer system. I shall not dwell at length on
the problems, but suffice it to say that the system has suffered a
large number of technical problems. One used to be able to file online
through the e-portal, but that had to be closed by HMRC because of a
systematic attempt to defraud it of millions of pounds. Meanwhile EDS,
the IT contractor employed to operate the system on behalf of
HMRC&#151;yes, HMRC&#151;made such a hash of it that it had to give
up. It was replaced by an alternative IT contractor, Capgemini, but not
before the Treasury had sued EDF for &#163;77 million for
underperforming. In fact, the Treasury&#146;s record of managing IT
programmes is somewhat lamentable. In answer to a series of written
questions last year, it was revealed that the Treasury&#146;s IT
programmes were running at a combined total of 17 years
late.</div>
					<a name="07013117000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">What is the
proposed procurement strategy for the new computer system that the Bill
envisages? Specifically, which organisation mentioned in clause 1 or in
the accompanying notes will have overall responsibility for the design
and introduction of the system? Will it be the Secretary of State, HMRC
or the Valuation Office Agency, or will the system in effect be
designed by committee? If it is the latter, the warnings of
HMRC&#146;s own information officer, Mr. Steve Lamey, at
the time of its merger will have been apposite. In 2005, he said of the
lack of accountability in Government IT procurement:</div>
					<a name="07013117000085"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;So much decision making
is done in committees with huge matrix overlays that accountabilities
tend to be very
unclear.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07013117000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">Perhaps that is
one reason why the Treasury&#146;s IT programmes, when combined, are
running 17 years late.</div>
					<a name="07013117000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">From what basis is the
&#163;40 million estimate derived? The figure seems specific,
although the explanatory notes say that there may be wiggle room for it
to increase. Nevertheless, we have been given a broad figure of
&#163;40 million today, and I should like to know how it was arrived
at.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column49" />Column number: 50</div>
					<a name="07013117000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should like to question the
Minister about the proposed system&#146;s security and the related
issue of data protection. Much of the information on the system would
be commercially confidential among businesses that operate in the
property market, and they would want to be reassured when filling in
their returns that the information, which is important to them, was
held securely and treated appropriately by the Valuation Office Agency
and by HMRC.</div>
					<a name="07013117000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
another series of written answers that I obtained from the Treasury, it
was revealed that some 1,600 Government computers have been lost or
stolen since 1997. The worst culprit was the Ministry of Defence, and
the second worst was the Home Office. The Treasury&#151;to be
fair&#151;was further down that league table of shame, but 53 of its
computers have been lost or stolen.</div>
					<a name="07013117000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						In summary,
under new clause 1, given this Administration&#146;s poor record of
managing IT programmes&#151;including, specifically and
unfortunately, those in the Treasury itself&#151;we seek to establish
a regular reporting system that would apply to any planning gain
supplement-related IT system, with the report having to be submitted to
the Public Accounts Committee twice a year. That would help to
concentrate the minds of those involved in the project, thus helping to
reduce the risk that the taxpayer would effectively bear if and when
such work were commenced. On that basis, I commend our new clause to
the Committee.</div>
					
					<a name="07013117000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07013117000109"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Colin Breed</b> (South-East Cornwall) (LD): I apologise for
not being present this morning, but I was attending a sitting of the
Treasury Committee, questioning one of the Minister&#146;s colleagues
on, among other things, cost-effectiveness and value for
money.</div>
					<a name="07013117000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">Looking at the
Bill, I somehow doubt that the taxpayer has ever been asked to fund so
little of substance for so much money with so poor a chance of a
positive outcome. Its value for money must be difficult to demonstrate.
The Committee has had opportunities to consider the ways in which costs
can be mitigated and to try to improve the chances of achieving value
for money, but without success.</div>
					<a name="07013117000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are occasions when paving
legislation is appropriate, but this is not one of them. Much more
information about the exact proposals and their chances of success must
be made available to us if we are to consider spending what is a large
sum of taxpayers&#146; money. There are many obvious
flaws&#151;some technical, some practical and some
political&#151;but it is worth going ahead only if we can set up a
tightly controlled, cost-effective and value-for-money system for those
of us, or our colleagues, who have to consider whether to go further
with
it.</div>
				
					
					<a name="07013117000088"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.45
pm</div>
					<a name="07013117000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government
have rejected a sensible course of action, so any restriction on how
the system will be funded, any way of controlling costs and any way of
deciding how to keep a proper eye on how costs, particularly those
relating to computer systems, can be controlled over this short period
is to be welcomed. The new clause might be the sort of measure on
computer system costings that we should include in most Government
Bills.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column50" />Column number: 51</div>
					<a name="07013117000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the hon. Member for Rayleigh
has demonstrated, a clear picture has emerged. Although I am sure that
the Government undertake computer contracts in good faith and genuinely
believe that these things can be achieved in a given time frame and
costing, their track record has been poor. We should actively support
the idea of a regular report to demonstrate that things are on
time and within budget and to show that &#163;40 million-odd
is being spent for some real purpose.</div>

					<a name="07013117000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						My
reservation about the new clause is simple: it is unnecessary and would
bring no advantage, principally because the development of the IT
system for a planning gain supplement will be subject to the normal
intense scrutiny provided through the usual Government and
parliamentary procedures&#151;[<span class="SmallCaps">Hon. Members:</span>

Healey:
						</b> Thank you, Mr. Hood.</div>
					<a name="07013117000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me deal with some of the
irrelevant comparators that the hon. Member for Rayleigh introduced
into the debate: the systems in the Child Support Agency, Home Office
and national health service. Those much more complex systems deal with
millions of people in a way that a planning gain supplement system, if
we were to develop and introduce one, simply would not.</div>
					<a name="07013117000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">Furthermore, the planning gain
supplement is different from tax credits. A much smaller customer base
is involved and many fewer interactions will be needed between Her
Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs and the developers, not least
because the proposed planning gain supplement, as we are designing it,
will be simple and easy to comply with and to
administer.</div>
					<a name="07013117000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman will know that there were problems in the early stages of the
implementation of the tax credit system, and HMRC agreed compensation
of more than &#163;70 million with the supplier following the launch
of that system. Although he did not mention this, he may also know
that, since then, HMRC has changed its IT supplier and implemented
exemplary IT programmes, such as the child trust fund and pension
simplification programmes.</div>
					
					<a name="07013117000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07013117000113"></a>Mr.
Francois:
						</b> I do not want to cause a delay on this point. If
the Minister reads the <i class="I">Hansard</i> record of our proceedings, he
will notice that, while I mentioned that transaction and EDS being sued
for &#163;77 million, I also said that Capgemini took over the
contract.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07013117000114"></a>John
Healey:
						</b> I do not think that the hon. Gentleman mentioned
the implementation of the IT systems for child trust funds or pension
simplification, both of which have been smooth, well planned and well
implemented.</div>
					<a name="07013117000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">We and
HMRC are clear that it will be HRMC&#146;s responsibility to oversee
our approach to procurement. I should be clear with the hon. Gentleman
about that. A period of comprehensive testing will be built into 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column51" />Column number: 52</div>any design for the implementation of a planning gain supplement in the
run-up its introduction. One of the reasons for a relatively long lead
time between designing and introducing the IT system is to ensure that
the systems will work. One of the reasons for seeking the authority
under the Bill is that, once the Government make their decision to go
ahead with a planning gain supplement, there must be no delay with the
necessary work for starting to design and commission the system that
will be required.</div>
					
					<a name="07013117000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07013117000115"></a>Mr.
Breed:
						</b> I am grateful to the Minister for explaining the
situation prior to the introduction of the planning gain supplement.
However, in light of the Government&#146;s experience with other
computer contracts, will they monitor the costs of the contract under
discussion? If so, why will not they share with us their monitoring and
provide us with the figures? There will be no additional costs,
because&#151;I hope&#151;they are monitoring the costs, so in the
spirit of transparency, I see no reason why they should not provide us
with those figures to demonstrate that the contract is being properly
managed.</div>
					
					<a name="07013117000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07013117000116"></a>John
Healey:
						</b> Of course the costs will be monitored, and I
expect HMRC, through its annual and spring reports, to report regularly
on progress with the system&#146;s development and implementation.
The House has established procedures: it can, for example, draw heavily
on the National Audit Office and its regular reviews of major
programmes and departmental activity, and it can draw on the Public
Accounts Committee and its ability to consider which NAO reports it
wishes to take evidence on and debate. Those are the mechanisms by
which regular progress and spending updates can be secured and
scrutinised specifically by the House.</div>
					<a name="07013117000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand and appreciate the
concern behind the new clause, but I find it hard to understand its
specific purpose, other than to increase the bureaucracy and to create
a new and wholly unnecessary paper chase. On that basis, I hope that
the hon. Member for Rayleigh will not press the motion on the new
clause to a vote.</div>

input and that might have to liaise or work with the IT department in
charge of the planning gain supplement? Perhaps my hon. Friend can
explore that point
further.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07013117000121"></a>Mr.
Francois:
						</b> As I understand the Minister, the Government
will nominate HMRC to take the lead in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column52" />Column number: 53</div>procuring the computer system. It will be responsible, although I expect
that it will liaise with Departments. However, we could get into
trouble if we try to design the system by committee, because all
previous experience, including that which HMRC&#146;s chief
information officer relayed, has shown that, when the Government have
tried to do so, the strategy has not worked. That brings me back to my
response to the Minister&#146;s speech.</div>
					<a name="07013117000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister trotted out the
usual platitudes about regular reporting, close scrutiny and keeping a
tight eye on how public money is spent, but if the procedures
throughout Government are as robust as he would have us believe, how do
we explain the fiascos of the CS2 system, the doubling of the cost of
the NHS IT programme and the Criminal Records Bureau computer at the
Home Office? If those procedures, on which the Minister seeks to rely
in lieu of our new clause, are so robust, we must simply ask why on
earth they keep going wrong, and why does the taxpayer keep losing
billions&#151;not millions&#151;as a result?</div>
					<a name="07013117000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is true that, since
computers were invented, Governments of all colours have had problems
with information technology. I do not deny that. However, it is also
true that, under this Administration, the problems have escalated to an
extent never seen before. That is one reason why we are worried about
the more modest system under discussion and why we want to know that it
will operate effectively, on time and to budget.</div>
					<a name="07013117000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister did not quite
answer my question about how the estimate of &#163;40 million had
been arrived at. If he wants to intervene again, I shall gladly let
him. I do not want to misrepresent him, but I do not think that he
explained to the Committee how the Government came to a figure of that
magnitude. If he feels he answered the question, I shall not get bogged
down; however, I do not think I heard him do
so.</div>

					<a name="07013117000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have already
established that, because of the merger, there are 250 legacy computer
systems within HMRC alone. Could we not have modified one of those? I
am sure that it could get by with one of the remaining 249. Could we
not have converted one of the existing computer systems to take on the
task, thus saving the taxpayer a fair bit of
money?</div>

							<a name="07013117000125"></a>Mr.

						</b>
						<b class="B"> </b>I suspect that, if the planning gain
supplement goes ahead, we will need something a bit more complicated
than a spare abacus. Bearing in mind that a lot of computer systems are
knocking around in the Treasury and HMRC, would it be cost-effective to
modify one? I do not know the answer, but I should like to know that
that option had been explored before the Government ask the House of
Commons to commit up to &#163;40 million for a new computer system
that, as we heard this morning, we may never need if the tax does not
go ahead.</div>

of Act</div>
					<a name="07013117000086"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#145;This Act
ceases to have effect on 1st May 2008 unless the Treasury has
announced before that date its intention to introduce
legislation to impose the tax referred to in section
1(1).&#146;<i class="I">.&#151;[Mr.
Francois.]</i>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07013117000126"></a>Mr.
Francois:
						</b> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second
time.</div>
					<a name="07013117000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new clause
seeks to introduce a sunset provision into the Bill to time-limit its
provisions if the Government do not resolve to go ahead with the
introduction of the planning gain supplement by spring 2008. I
reiterate that we are opposed in principle to its introduction, but
given that the Budget statement now usually takes place in March, this
provision would give the Government several chances to confirm their
intention to go ahead with the PGS before the sunset clause would come
into operation, effectively cutting off the expenditure permitted by
the Bill.</div>
					<a name="07013117000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although
the Government could in theory make a decision and provide an
accompanying statement whenever the House is sitting, the window of
opportunity provided by our proposal would mean in practice that they
would use Budget 2007, pre-Budget report 2007 and Budget 2008 to
clarify their intentions on the planning gain supplement before the
sunset clause kicked in. After that time, if the Treasury was still
undecided on whether or not to go ahead, the opportunity to spend money
allowed for under this paving Bill would be lost.</div>
					<a name="07013117000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given that the Treasury has
already been discussing the possibility of introducing the planning
gain supplement for three years, it does not seem unreasonable to seek
to put a backstop on the decision process, lest the Treasury go round
in circles for even longer.</div>
					
					<a name="07013117000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07013117000127"></a>Mr.
Burns:
						</b> The new clause is eminently sensible, but, as its
co-sponsor, I wonder whether we missed something. My hon. Friend talks
about going round in circles and he mentioned the Budget and the other
pressures on the Chancellor. However, he has forgotten that the current
Chancellor will not be Chancellor in May 2008, by any stretch of the
imagination. Should we not have been a little more generous in our time
scale, to take into account the change of circumstances and the fact
that a new Chancellor will probably be going round in circles trying to
fix the mess that he
inherits?</div>
					
					<a name="07013117000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07013117000128"></a>Mr.
Francois:
						</b> My hon. Friend tempts me to summarise the
Chancellor of the Exchequer&#146;s record, but I shall not indulge in
doing so, lest you rule me out of order, Mr. Hood. I could
say that the massive amount of borrowing that the Chancellor has
incurred 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column54" />Column number: 55</div>is not particularly impressive for a start. Nevertheless, my hon.
Friend&#146;s concern for the Chancellor is touching, and I am
pleased that he has him constantly in his thoughts, as indeed we all
do. Our thoughts may be somewhat different however.</div>
					<a name="07013117000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was seeking to argue that it
does not seem unreasonable to put a backstop on the decision process,
as we intend to do with our new clause. I hope that that seems
reasonable and that the Committee will give a fair wind to our new
clause as a result. We cannot allow the Government to go round and
round in circles for ever.</div>
					
					<a name="07013117000089"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5 pm</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07013117000129"></a>John
Healey:
						</b> Again, I have some recognition of the concerns
that lie behind the new clause. The hon. Member for Rayleigh said that
his main concern was that no time limit or sunset point on the
authorisation of expenditure is set in the Bill. My response, however,
is similar to that on the previous new clause: in practice, I do not
believe that a case can be made for it.
</div>
					<a name="07013117000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill is not a
blank cheque. I make it clear that, if the decision is taken not to
introduce a planning gain supplement, no further expenditure will occur
under the Bill. The Government do not spend significant sums on
programmes unless we are sure that we want to proceed&#151;the PGS is
no different&#151;and to do so would not be in our interests, nor in
the wider national interest.</div>
					<a name="07013117000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">If we want to introduce a
planning gain supplement within a reasonable time&#151;it cannot be
introduced before 2009, because we are committed to providing
sufficient time for the markets to adapt to a prospective planning gain
supplement&#151;the decision to proceed must be taken in good time,
depending on a satisfactory analysis of the consultation that we are
undertaking.</div>
					
					<a name="07013117000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07013117000130"></a>Anne
Main:
						</b> May I take the Minister back a little? He said that
the Government do not spend money on things that may not go ahead.
Would he throw home information packs into the mix? He should remember
how much that cost and how much training was involved, but it fell
apart and it is now being introduced in a completely different
form.</div>
					
					<a name="07013117000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07013117000131"></a>John
Healey:
						</b> The hon. Lady cites an example of something that
is going ahead. The forms have been modified in response to
representations. I repeat that it is not in our interests to spend
significant resources on things that we do not intend to proceed with.
That is precisely the approach that we will take with the planning gain
supplement. The decision will need to be taken before beginning the
detailed design work on the IT systems that would be authorised under
the Bill.</div>
					<a name="07013117000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">My priority
is to make the right decision about a workable planning gain
supplement, rather than constraining that decision by statute. On that
basis, I hope that the hon. Member for Rayleigh will not press the new
clause to a Division. If he does, I shall ask my hon. Friends to
resist.</div>
					
					<a name="07013117000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07013117000132"></a>Mr.
Francois:
						</b> I sense at this hour that we are moving towards
the sunset of our deliberations. I know that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column55" />Column number: 56</div>that will be a great disappointment to Labour Members. However, I shall
make a few quick points in response to the Minister.</div>
					<a name="07013117000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon. Friend the Member for
St. Albans made an apposite point, as she has done a number of times.
She gave the example of HIPs: a lot of money was spent preparing for
them, but it was spent mostly by people training to become HIPs
inspectors. Private individuals lost money, rather than the taxpayer.
That was not well handled by the Government, and it does not set an
exciting precedent for what may follow the Bill.</div>
					<a name="07013117000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is important to reiterate
the matter of timing. The Government have issued four consultation
documents on the process&#151;they have talked about it a great
deal&#151;and the current consultation will end on 28
February. They know that there is much opposition to the proposals. At
some point, the Government have to take a definitive
decision&#151;one way or the other. As an American friend who fishes
says, they either have to fish or cut bait. I hope that the industry
will not have to wait much longer before the Government&#146;s
intentions become clear. I hope that they will back away from this
errant and mistaken tax.</div>
					<a name="07013117000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should like to thank you,
Mr. Hood, as we draw to a conclusion, for the good-humoured
way in which you have chaired our proceedings. You kept us ticking 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column56" />Column number: 57</div>along nicely. In a spirit of equally good humour, I give a parting shot
to the Minister. It might be said that this is a bad paving Bill, that
it is bad paving. I think it represents crazy paving&#151;and I can
tell the Minister that, by squeezing in that remark, I have won a bet.
I thank you, Mr. Hood, for your services to the Committee. I

appreciate, as do other hon. Members, the way in which you have chaired
our proceedings. You helped us to give full scrutiny to this short
Bill, but in a way that did not constrain hon. Members from expressing
their natural concerns. We have usefully re-examined many of the issues
that were touched upon on Second Reading. I am glad that we heard
contributions from both sides of the Committee&#151;that is always
important. I am also glad that we have been able to complete our proper
scrutiny well within the time allowed by the programme motion. I look
