<P>
<B>Mr. Richard Allan </B>(Sheffield, Hallam): I beg to move amendment No. 64, in page 8, leave out lines 7 and 8.
<P>
This is a probing amendment designed to elicit from the Minister the purpose of this part of the clause. Subsection (3)(c) refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the economic well-being of the United Kingdom.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We want the Bill to define ``economic well-being'' more clearly and to specify the circumstances in which warrants may be issued on that basis. We understand the other parts of the subsection, which closely reflect the aims of article 8 of the European convention on human rights.
<P>
It is clear that warrants may be issued if they are necessary on the grounds set out in the subsection, and it is clear that the provision mirrors the wording of article 8, which suggests that certain intrusions are necessary in a democratic society. The reference to national security in subsection (3)(a) is not entirely clear but it, too, reflects article 8 of the convention. Subsection (3)(b) refers to the prevention or detection of serious crime, which also reflects the wording of article 8,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>For the prevention of disorder and crime,<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
although we are pleased that the phrase is qualified in the Bill by the word ``serious'', which introduces another hurdle. However, we have some concerns about the meaning of the phrase,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>for the purpose of safeguarding the economic well-being of the United Kingdom,<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
specifically in the context of intrusions against article 8 of the convention, which establishes a right to privacy. In particular, we note that the phrase is qualified by subsection (5), which makes it clear that the provision is limited to activities outside the United Kingdom. Therefore, subsection (3)(c) relates not to domestic matters, but to people who are crossing borders and who are involved in considerable activity outside the UK.
<P>
The phrase ``economic well-being'' could cover a range of circumstances, but we question whether the circumstances that the provision is designed to trap are not covered by other parts of the criminal law that deal with such matters as customs evasion, tax evasion, insider dealing, false accounting and counterfeiting. However, the Government have seen fit specifically to define those offences that we believe would be covered by subsection (3)(b), which relates to preventing or detecting serious crime. We want to elicit from the Minister what sort of activities the provision is designed to cover. Does it relate to the secret board meetings of German motor manufacturers who may threaten the economic well-being of the UK, or might warrants be issued to place intercepts on foreign companies that might be about to cause job losses in the UK? Or are we talking about activities that should be covered by the definitions of other sorts of criminal activity that I have mentioned? I want to probe that area and hope that the Minister will clarify the activities that we would define as serious crime that are not already covered by other areas of law for which he would expect the Secretary of State to issue warrants.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Ruffley </B>(Bury St. Edmunds): In prefacing a series of questions to the Minister, I want to congratulate him. Reading the minutes of evidence, I was struck by the genuinely helpful way in which he has dealt with questions put to him by the Opposition, because that is not always the way with Government Ministers. Our debate has been civilised and I hope that we can continue in that spirit.
<P>
Subsection (3) lists the four grounds on which a Secretary of State may issue a warrant if necessary. The term ``necessary'' is construed in accordance with the draft convention on mutual assistance in criminal matters that operates between member states of the European Union, as necessary in a democratic society. That is all fine and dandy, but I should be grateful if the Minister would explain why the subsection appears to be tracking that international convention. Why cannot we make law without reference to such international conventions? The history would be helpful.
<P>
My reason for thinking that it would help if we knew why, as the explanatory notes state, convention language is being tracked is that there are clear differences, helpfully elucidated in the explanatory notes, between the relevant articles of the convention and the clause. The amendments are, I think, intended to help in that context. Information to be collected under subsection (3)(c) will be restricted to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>information relating to the acts or intentions of persons outside the British Islands.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The provision expressly excludes domestic activities, yet article 8 of the convention goes wider than that and covers protection of domestic tax revenues, as the explanatory notes point out. Why have the Government departed in the drafting of the clause from the apparent ambit of that article?
<P>
What is the reason for the jurisdictional reference to the British islands, for which the interpretation clause gives no definition, in preference to the United Kingdom? The question troubled me somewhat as I drank my cocoa last night and read through the clauses in preparation for today's festivities.
<P>
I wonder, in the light of concerns raised by the Liberal Democrat spokesman, why there has been no attempt to define the term ``economic well-being''. I fully understand—this point was dealt with on Second Reading—that it should have the meaning ascribed to it in the Security Service Act 1989 and the Intelligence Services Act 1994. However, I think that it was also pointed out on Second Reading that the appearance of the term in two recent Acts is not a reason for the Bill not to update the language and clarify the meaning. It is not clear and Liberty and other interest groups have raised a legitimate point for debate. We know that fraud, evasion of national customs laws, insider dealing, false accounting, counterfeiting and all the other examples that the Minister gave will be covered, but why should not that be stated in the Bill?
<P>
Is the Minister at liberty to tell us how many warrants have been issued in, say, this or the previous Parliament that would be covered by subsection (3)(c)? That might give the Committee an idea of the magnitude of the problem that interception warrants might cover.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Luff </B>(Mid-Worcestershire): I do not wish to appear uncharitable, but I must say that when I saw that the Liberal Democrats had tabled the amendment, I thought ``Here we go again''. I thought that I saw a characteristic but misplaced concern about the personal freedom of the individual. I have, however, thought about the arguments that were set out on Second Reading and advanced by the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Allan) just now, and I believe that the Liberal Democrats may have a point. Those of us who are fans of the James Bond films will know that 007's enemies have become increasingly preoccupied with economic matters but less concerned about nuclear issues, so the provision is clearly important.
<P>
As the Minister knows, there is much concern outside Parliament about the total compass of the Bill. It has been described as draconian and I am receiving increasingly hysterical e-mails from my constituents, who are alarmed about its impact on their activities. It is omnibus phrases—[Interruption.]. I shall not comment on the observation that has just been made.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Taylor </B>(Esher and Walton): Are the e-mails directed to my hon. Friend or does he merely intercept them?
<P>
<B>Mr. Luff:</B> They appear to be directed at me. The last one that I received said ``innocent until proven guilty'' about 20 times. That was the extent of its argument, although it made a helpful contribution to the debate and focused my mind on people's acute concern about the Bill. Phrases such as
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>economic well-being of the United Kingdom,<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
which the amendment would delete, are open to different interpretations. On Second Reading, it was suggested in answer to a question asked by the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey (Mr. Hughes) that definitions of economic well-being were contained in the Security Service Act 1989 and the Intelligence Services Act 1994. For the benefit of further accuracy, I obtained copies of those Acts, but I cannot find definitions of economic well-being. The phrase seems to have crept into the draftsman's lexicon without adequate definition. Perhaps the Minister will draw our attention to an earlier Act that defines it, but we should know exactly what it means before we allow it to be included in the Bill. The only definition of the phrase ``well-being'' that I have found is a dictionary definition, which describes it as a
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>healthy, contented or prosperous condition<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and as ``moral or physical welfare''.
<P>
That is a pretty broad definition of the state of the economy that the Bill seeks to protect. It is important to test it and to pick up on the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Bury St. Edmunds (Mr. Ruffley) about subsection (5), which relates to the scope of enforcement. My hon. Friend reminded us that subsection (5) refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>information relating to acts or intentions of persons outside the British Islands.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Interestingly, that test is different from that implied by the words that the Liberal Democrats seek to delete, which apply to the United Kingdom. The phrase ``British Islands'' clearly includes the Republic of Ireland. [Interruption.] I appear to be wrong about that, and I apologise immediately.
<P>
<B>Mr. A. J. Beith </B>(Berwick-upon-Tweed): The phrase includes the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands, but not the Republic of Ireland.
<P>
<B>Mr. Luff:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman, who anticipated and answered a question that I was going to ask about the full compass of the British islands.
<P>
More seriously, what does the provision achieve that is not already allowed under the 1989 and 1994 Acts and how does it relate to them? What exactly do the Government have in mind? Will the Minister give examples? Would the provision have enabled the Government to find out what Nick Leeson was up to in Singapore, or do they already have such power? Nick Leeson's activities in Singapore had a material effect on the economic well-being of the United Kingdom. The point made by the hon. Member for Hallam about BMW and Alchemy is entirely prescient and we should be given answers. Does Government communications headquarters have power to monitor electronic discussion between companies that operate outside the United Kingdom but which have subsidiaries or significant investments within it? One is tempted to ask the Minister what the Government are doing about Ford's e-mails on the future of Dagenham.
<P>
Even if the Minister answers those questions, we must ask whether we are satisfied that the provisions will not have a detrimental effect on the confidence in communications security enjoyed by foreign companies that invest in the UK. The issue is especially important—I am speaking on a slightly partisan note—in the light of the Administration's determination to undermine relationships with major multinationals by blaming them for what the Government should have known or worked out already. We must not do anything to undermine investors' confidence in the UK.
<P>
Is the Minister satisfied that the clause will not raise concerns with our trading partners and will not prompt the risk of retaliation? Does the World Trade Organisation have a role in regulating such activity? To what extent is the Minister free to take the step?
<P>
Finally, I am concerned about the different tests that apply to different clauses. Clause 46 (3), which partially mirrors the provisions here and which relates to access to keys, gives a different, shorter test. The subsection states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>A requirement to disclose a key is necessary on grounds falling within this subsection if it is necessary . . . in the interests of national security . . . for the purposes of preventing or detecting crime . . . in the interests of the economic well-being of the United Kingdom.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The fourth provision in clause 5(3)(d) is not included in the later clause; clause 21 applies a completely different list of tests regarding traffic data.

<P>

<B>Mr. Allan:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes an interesting point when he compares the definitions. I can understand that there is a difference between serious and not serious crime, but a curious distinction is drawn regarding economic well-being. Clause 5 refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>safeguarding the economic well-being of the United Kingdom<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
but clause 46 uses the words
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>in the interests of the economic well-being of the United Kingdom.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
What is the difference between ``safeguarding'' and acting ``in the interests of''? That is another major question.
<P>
<B>Mr. Luff:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for anticipating a point that I wish to make—that shows that concern is widely spread. If definitions are to be offered, they should be consistent across the Bill. Clause 21 includes a range of other tests, including tests for public safety, public health, collecting tax and duties. The Minister must explain why the wording of the test of economic well-being in clause 5 applies there and why other wordings and other tests apply elsewhere. I am minded to think that the purpose is necessary but, given the concerns expressed by the conference on the Bill last week, he must give clear explanations.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Maclean </B>(Penrith and The Border): I shall begin by alluding to clause 21—we shall not debate it today but my hon. Friends have raised it. It contains insidious provisions; I hope either that we shall delete them or that the tests in clause 5 will be applied. We must have firm assurances from the Minister on several important points raised by clause 21. We need the Government merely to restate what Home Secretaries have stated over the years. We might then be satisfied with the operation of that aspect.
<P>
Clause 5(3) contains the grounds on which a warrant might be applied for and issued. Clause 6 lists the organisations that might apply for a warrant. Such a listing of organisations and grounds is an innovation—it does not appear in previous legislation. The Act legitimising the operations of the Secret Intelligence Service gave the narrow grounds on which it could apply for warrants. The same rules applied to MI5. When we established the National Criminal Intelligence Service and introduced warranting for it and for the police, serious crime grounds were added.
<P>
I shall make these points differently in regard to clause 6, but what worries me about clause 5 is that we have never before included all the grounds for a warrant in a clause, with a list of all the organisations that could apply for one in another clause. Superficially, it would seem that any of the organisations in clause 6 could ask for a warrant on any ground in clause 5. We have never before had such a mix and match.
<P>
I am grateful to the Minister for the letter that he sent to my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Hertfordshire (Mr. Heald), which I received this morning, in which he noted that he had no intention of changing the operating procedures of MI5 or MI6. He stated that they would still operate under normal arrangements, one dealing with foreign matters and one with domestic matters, warranting through the Foreign Secretary and the Home Secretary for their respective operations. That might be a safeguard in some ways.
<P>
Clause 6(2)(b) would allow
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the Chief of the Secret Intelligence Service<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
to apply to the Secretary of State for a warrant under clause 5(3)(b)
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>for the purpose of preventing or detecting serious crime.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Unless there are other safeguards, the organisations listed in clause 6 could apply for warrants on any of the grounds set out in the clause 5. I need to be reassured that that is not the case. Clause 5(5) appears to contain an exclusion to prevent an organisation from asking for a warrant to safeguard the economic well-being of the United Kingdom unless the threat comes from overseas. We need to put on the record what previous Ministers said about the interests of the economic well-being of the United Kingdom.
<P>
My quote from Hansard starts with no less a source than the hon. Member for Leyton and Wanstead (Mr. Cohen), who asked the previous Prime Minister
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>if he will set out in a form which does not jeopardise national security the financial criteria used by the Secret Intelligence Service and the Security Service to assess matters which relate to the economic well-being of the country.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The then Prime Minister replied:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The term ``economic well-being of the United Kingdom'' is a well-known provision, used in the Intelligence Services Bill, the Security Service Act 1989 and the European Convention on Human Rights without definition.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary gave two examples of where the Secret Intelligence Service might act in this area in his speech introducing the Intelligence Services Bill on 22 February 1994. Official Report, column 157.—[Official Report, House of Commons, 21 March 1994; Vol. 240, c. 4W.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Therefore, I proceeded to column 157, in which the then Foreign Secretary, Douglas Hurd, said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>There is the provision for action—the tasking of our intelligence agencies—in the interests of the economic well-being of the United Kingdom. Those who have followed these matters know that that is a well-worn provision. It is in existing legislation, and is provided for in the European Convention on Human Rights. It sometimes causes puzzlement as to what it can mean.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Examples of where it might be useful are where there is instability in a part of the world where substantial British economic interests were at stake, or where there was a crisis or a huge difficulty about the continued supply of a commodity on which our economy depended.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The House will notice that the Bill restricts the activities of the SIS and GCHQ for safeguarding the economic well-being of the country to the acts or intentions of persons outside the United Kingdom. The agencies may not and do not get involved in domestic economic, commercial or financial affairs.— [Official Report, 22 February 1994; Vol. 238, c. 157.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That quote is helpful. I want the Minister to reassure me that what Douglas Hurd said still stands and that he set out the scale of what is covered by economic well-being.
<P>
The examples that Douglas Hurd gave are clear. One is coded speak for oil—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the continued supply of a commodity on which our economy depended.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Well, that used to be oil; some economists now argue that oil is not so important. However, I am sure the Minister will agree that those are major considerations. I know that he cannot and will not speculate on BMW, but it would be interesting to discuss whether the definition would cover the decision of the board of BMW to dump Rover—which was known to everyone but the Government—[Interruption.] Well, perhaps one Government agency was doing its duty and knew about it but failed to pass on the information to the Foreign Secretary. It would be interesting to speculate on whether that decision falls within the high threshold of activity described by the former Foreign Secretary.
<P>
The SIS will be investigating the big stuff that threatens the economic well-being of the United Kingdom. However, it is not correct to use the term ``threatens''. In 1985, the then Home Secretary said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>As in the case of serious crime or national security, the Secretary of State has to consider that interception is not just desirable. Secondly, interception has to be protective. It must be concerned with safeguarding the country's economic well-being, not with promoting it.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is an important distinction. We want confirmation that the Minister stands by that, and that that is his and the present Home Secretary's understanding. The former Home Secretary continued:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>That means it relates to threats to that well-being.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Thirdly, it is the economic well-being of the United Kingdom which is at issue. By definition, the matter must be one of national significance and cannot be of a trivial kind which is peripheral to that well-being. It is a crucial part of our foreign policy to protect the country against adverse developments overseas.—[Official Report, 12 March 1985; Vol. 75; c. 159-60.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Again, that confirms what the former Foreign Secretary said on Second Reading of the Intelligence Services Bill in 1994.
<P>
Those quotations satisfy me of what the previous Government and the then Home Secretary and Foreign Secretary understood of their duty to safeguard the economic well-being of the United Kingdom. I hope and believe that that has not changed one iota. I do not think that the present Foreign Secretary or Home Secretary have a different understanding. Indeed, I hope that they apply the same criteria. Will the Minister assure the Committee that the Bill will not widen the remit or increase the power of the Security Service or the Secret Intelligence Service, either inadvertently or deliberately, or lower the threshold of safeguarding the economic well-being of the United Kingdom?
<P>
The explanatory notes contain a lovely little phrase that suggests that the provisions could apply to ``safeguarding'' tax revenue. One of the organisations listed in clause 6 as being allowed to apply for a warrant is Her Majesty's Customs and Excise. It does a valiant job in safeguarding tax revenue, as many of those who have been put out of business by it will testify. That was an uncharitable comment, but it has happened on a few occasions in my constituency. However, the Revenue may argue that its action was justified.
<P>
<B>Mr. Luff:</B> I would appreciate the Minister's clarification. As I read the explanatory notes, clause 5(3)(c) reflects the wording of article 8 of the European convention on human rights, but it is more limited and therefore does not allow for the protection of tax revenues.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> My hon. Friend puts it much better than I did. The explanatory notes state:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Clause 5(3)(c) closely reflects the wording of Article 8 of the Convention, though the term in Article 8 is understood to have a broader meaning and would include, for example, the protection of tax revenues.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
However, the subsection seems to have a narrower wording. It seems that the provisions of clause 6 would prevent Customs and Excise from going to the Minister for a warrant and saying, ``We want to safeguard the economic well-being of the United Kingdom. Peter Luff Ltd has not paid its VAT and we are therefore suffering a tremendous loss of revenue. We need interception, warrants, the lot.'' Nevertheless, that would not prevent Customs and Excise from obtaining a warrant under subsection (3)(b), because it could conclude that serious crime included avoiding the payment of VAT.
<P>
We need some more helpful information from the Minister. He will probably cite precedent. For instance, in 1996, when we were debating the NCIS legislation, his right hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth (Mr. Michael) pressed me to define the difference between organised crime and serious crime. In answer, I relied on the wise words spoken on Second Reading by my right hon. Friend, the then Home Secretary, who did not define it either. We had a long, round-the-course discussion about what would constitute serious crime, which is wisely not defined in any legislation. It would be helpful to know what Customs and Excise would regard as an economic crime serious enough to justify application for a warrant.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> I am grateful to my right hon. Friend, who has been teasing out some of the problems of the clause. Is it his understanding that subsections (3) and (5) together ensure that a warrant would not be needed if an interception were required in relation to Mr. Luff's activities with the Inland Revenue? Subsection (3) suggests that a warrant is necessary for the purposes of safeguarding economic well-being. However, it will not be necessary unless the activity in question is conducted outside the jurisdiction specified in subsection (5), which implies that if it is being conducted within the jurisdiction, a warrant will not be needed at all.
<P>
<B>Mr. Luff:</B> On a point of order, Mrs. Michie. My right hon. and hon. Friends are speaking about a hypothetical Mr. Luff rather than this one.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am sure that the Committee appreciates that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> Luff Incorporated Trading has nothing to do with my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Worcestershire, who is a distinguished member of the Committee and is rightly not registered for VAT.
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Home Office (Mr. Clarke) Perhaps it is spelt L-O-U-G-H.</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> Exactly. My hon. Friend the Member for Bury St. Edmunds could be right, but I am not certain. The last time the Committee discussed serious crime, we had at the back of our minds drug dealing and trading, paedophilia, international terrorism and the illegal movement of gold bullion to avoid VAT and customs duties. We were considering the crimes that would justify application by the National Criminal Intelligence Service for interception warrants. That is not to suggest that other crimes are less serious, and no hon. Member is diminishing crimes of violence against the person, rape, murder, wounding, theft, criminal damage and armed robbery, which are, of course, serious crimes. However, they are crimes that are generally capable of investigation without the need for interception warrants.
<P>
For the purposes of the Bill, we considered serious crime that had an international element, was operated overseas using the internet or involved the movement of large amounts of money. We had in mind serious crimes such as money laundering, drug dealing and paedophilia. Will the Minister assure us as far as he can that that is the general ballpark area of serious crime with which the Bill deals? Will he assure us that the local VAT man cannot simply decide that an outstanding bill for £2,000 or even for £10,000 is serious crime? Where is the cut-off? To my mind, a tax dodge of £500,000 may come into the ballpark area, although VAT inspectors will envisage different levels.
<P>
When economic crime involving VAT and the Revenue is included in Bills such as this, we must be clear on the provisions covering it. I am happy to tell the Home Secretary and the Foreign Secretary that I do not want to know about interception warrants. On the grounds of national security, I do not approve of open parliamentary scrutiny of such warrants imposed to safeguard the economic well-being of the United Kingdom. I know that some people believe that such matters should be in the open, but I do not think that we can operate in that way. The Executive has to operate with considerable secrecy in dealing with terrorist organisations, international drug dealers and paedophiles. However, if the draconian powers rightly possessed by the Home Secretary and the Foreign Secretary are to be used to intercept people's e-mails, telephone calls and communications in the interests of tackling serious crime, we must be clear that such provision is not a means of getting at every taxpayer or everyone who has dodged a parking fine. I say that without wanting to trivialise the matter—there is a limit somewhere between people moving drugs worth £20 million, £5 million or £1 million, who should be busted and locked up for life, and those who might have committed offences that the VAT man—but no one else in the country—considered to be serious crimes in the same league as paedophilia, terrorism or drug dealing, for example.
<P>
I raised many points and concerns about the clause. I would be happy for the Minister to say that he will write to me in due course.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> I should like to clarify a troubling point, which occurred to me as my right hon. Friend the Member for Penrith and The Border (Mr. Maclean) spoke. The matter is central to the consideration of the amendment regarding economic well-being and the clause. Subsection (3)(c) states the grounds on which a warrant is necessary, including the safeguarding of the economic well-being of the United Kingdom. However, subsection (5) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>A warrant shall not be . . . necessary on the ground falling within subsection (3)(c)—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
economic well-being—unless the information relates to activity outside the UK jurisdiction. That implies that a warrant will not be necessary if the information relates to economic well-being within that jurisdiction. Is my reading of that right? If I am wrong, the Minister might tell me why that is so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> I shall try to deal with the many points raised as rapidly as I can. To the hon. Member for Hallam, I should say that I welcome the debate—the important issue was considered on Second Reading and has been aired in Committee. The hon. Gentleman said that the amendment was a probing amendment; I hope that it will have that effect.
<P>
It is incumbent on me to suggest what behaviour might fit the description by providing examples. I should say to the right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border that our intention is in accordance with the instances from 1994 and 1995 to which he referred. Nothing that we are doing seeks to vary the overall approach, save in the two important respects regarding the Human Rights Act 1998 and the movement of technology that we noted when we first moved the Bill. The Bill is intended to be consistent with the principles that the right hon. Gentleman outlined. I shall return to address his points in detail.
<P>
First, I want to identify warnings of threats to the supply of energy, commodities or raw materials on which the UK is especially dependent. The right hon. Gentleman referred to some of those; the example is concrete and the national issue should rightly be addressed.
<P>
Secondly, I want to identify attempts by rogue traders or others to manipulate commercial markets, especially when such actions could undermine confidence in the City of London or affect the stability of other financial markets. I shall not share the names bandied about the Committee, but such an instance could arise and be significant, clearly affecting the country's economic well-being.
<P>
Thirdly, I want to identify the general development of a better Government understanding of events and trends that might have a serious effect on the UK economy.
<P>
I give the examples to show that we are considering concrete matters. I do not go as far as the hon. Member for Mid-Worcestershire (Mr. Luff) in considering the question of James Bond, but I was entertained by the personalities that he sought to draw on. I do not know whether his lese-majesty suggests that he might be Miss Moneypenny in this situation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Luff:</B> What about Q?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> The question of Q is interesting. The hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds, with his interest in little devices and clever tricks, is the obvious candidate. The James Bond films, which I have studied carefully with my children as a general briefing for the Committee, deal not with economic well-being but with drug smuggling and other areas.
<P>
The phrase is important and clear; its meaning was debated during the passage of the Interception of Communications Act 1985. I confirm what I said in response to the right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border—the description used then by Ministers remains valid. Safeguarding the economic well-being of the UK does not mean industrial espionage or intelligence gathering on behalf of UK companies. In all cases, the aim of work conducted under that heading is to allow the Government to take protective actions appropriate and consistent with obligations under national, EU and international law.
<P>
The right hon. Gentleman raised the question of safeguarding in that context. ``Safeguarding'' is a higher test than ``in the interests of'', as ``serious crime'' is a higher test than ``crime''. That is why different phrases are used. We reserve the higher tests and definitions for the most intrusive interference with privacy—in this case, interception. We shall debate at different stages the purposes for which lower levels of intrusion might be authorised.
<P>
I should perhaps refer to points made by two or three hon. Gentlemen. We have different levels of language throughout the Bill because we are considering different levels of interception and interference with people's privacy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I thank the Minister for clarifying the point. Will he say where the distinction is defined or how he feels that it is defined, so that we can be absolutely clear about the meaning of ``safeguarding'' versus ``in the interests of'', which is the wording of the lower test?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> The point arises in respect of all the language that we use here. It is ultimately for the judges to define what we mean, but it is down to us to try to describe as clearly as we can what we think that the words might mean. I am trying to do that in my response.
<P>
One can follow the suggestion of the hon. Member for Hallam of trying to define economic well-being more fully by listing a series of specifics that arise. Traditionally, we have not gone down that course because we have thought it right for economic well-being to stand and to be interpreted later. I acknowledge the hon. Gentleman's point but stand by what I said—``safeguarding'' is a higher test than ``in the interests of''. That is the case for having different levels of interception.
<P>
<B>Mr. Oliver Heald </B>(North-East Hertfordshire): Although the judges have a role, it is for the Secretary of State to decide meaning when giving a warrant. It is worrying if the Minister does not know that.

<P>

<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> It is not a question of not knowing, although I confess that I have never issued a warrant because I am not a Secretary of State. However, I know what the hon. Gentleman means. I have tried to give clear examples. I shall address other points and shall give way if hon. Members feel that I am not being clear enough.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> When describing the activities that might justify an interception warrant, the Minister referred to the Government getting a better understanding of developments and trends in the general economy. That might fall within the lower test of ``in the interests of'' rather than in the higher test of ``safeguarding''. ``Safeguarding'' would apply only to a serious threat, rather than to a general intelligence gathering exercise. The Minister referred to something that sounded like general intelligence gathering. I have difficulty understanding the way in which ``safeguarding'' is a higher test in the context of some of the Minister's examples.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> I referred to the development of a better Government understanding of events and trends that might have a serious effect on the UK economy. I wanted to refer to a serious effect on the entire economy, rather than simply to an effect, which might be a wide definition. That meets the point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Beith:</B> The Minister says that judges will eventually define meaning. It is almost inconceivable that anyone would have the evidence to mount a case on the basis that they had been improperly intercepted on the grounds of economic well-being. I make the point simply to remind the Minister that what is said in Committee and the definitions that he offers will be of crucial guiding importance to future Secretaries of State in a sphere in which we are unlikely ever to get judge-made definitions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> I appreciate the right hon. Gentleman's point. I shall shortly refer to the view of the Intelligence and Security Committee, of which he is a member. I acknowledge entirely the weight of his point, which is why I have tried to speak accurately to the matters that have been addressed.
<P>
A crucial part of the UK's foreign policy is to protect the country against adverse developments overseas that might have grave and damaging consequences for our economic well-being. By definition, therefore, the matter must be one of national significance and cannot be trivial. I am trying to watch my words in light of the injunction from the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith).
<P>
I now refer to the 1996 annual report of the all-party Intelligence and Security Committee, which made the following statement:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We reviewed the subject with both the intelligence producers and consumers, and came to the overall conclusion that intelligence work in support of economic well-being is an important, valuable and, on the evidence that we have taken, properly conducted area of the agencies' activities.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Hon. Members should bear the committee's conclusions in mind because it had the opportunity to consider the matter in detail.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I was also asked how much interception currently goes on for that purpose. As the Committee will know, it is long-standing practice not to go into detail on such matters. However, in his 1991 report, the interception commissioner, Lord Lloyd, stated that no more than a few warrants had ever been issued on the grounds of safeguarding the economic well-being of the United Kingdom. I can confirm that that remains the case. I am aware that that is not a specific number, but the Committee will understand why it is inappropriate to be specific.
<P>
I was asked about the case of BMW and Rover. Again, I am sorry not to be more helpful, but it would not be right for me to comment on any specific example for the reasons explained by the right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border. However, I stand by the examples that I just gave.
<P>
The hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds praised me, and I appreciate his remarks. I took seriously his comments on tracking the wording of the convention. The tests in clause 5(3) track the legitimate purposes set out in article 8 of the European convention on human rights, although not the draft convention on mutual assistance in criminal matters. The tests are tightly drafted, as they were in the 1985 Act, and I make no apology for that because interception is a very intrusive activity. To confirm the point made by the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds, article 8 is wider than clause 5(3), but we want to restrict intrusion as far as we can.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman also raised a question about the British islands. The right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed clarified the meaning of the term ``the British Islands'' in clause 5(5). The phrase is defined in the Interpretation Act 1978 as
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The United Kingdom, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Clause 5(5) offers special protection to domestic residents, including those on the islands, as did the Interception of Communications Act 1985. The hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds asked why domestic activities are excluded in clause 5(5). That restriction is carried forward from the 1985 Act. It provides extra safeguards for the residents of British islands, which we have no desire to diminish.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> Is the Minister saying that if UK residents were involved in something like the Barings collapse, a warrant could not be issued against them, but that it could if they happened to be based in Singapore?
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean rose—</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> I shall give way to the right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> Is it the case that, in the example quoted by the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam, a warrant could not be issued at all against people in the UK to safeguard the economic interests of the country, or is it simply that a warrant is unnecessary and the police or Security Service can take action without a warrant? The wording of clause 5(5) is ambiguous.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> I am not sure that the wording of the clause is ambiguous. It is clear that a warrant must be issued and there is no question of one not being issued. It is not our intention that the wording should be ambiguous, but I am prepared to consider the matter and see whether it could be resolved by an amendment. The purpose of the Bill is not to leave a loophole so that interceptions can take place without warrants. However, I am happy to consider what has been said.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> I should like to get this clear. Subsection (3) states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>a warrant is necessary on grounds falling within this subsection if it is necessary—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) in the interests of national security;<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(b) for the purpose of preventing or detecting serious crime;<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(c) for the purpose of safeguarding the economic well-being of the United Kingdom;<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and for the purpose set out in paragraph (d). That is understood. What, then, is the meaning of subsection (5) in relation to subsection (3)? It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>A warrant shall not be considered necessary on the ground falling within subsection (3)(c) unless the information which it is thought necessary to obtain is information relating to the acts or intentions of persons outside the British Islands.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That must surely mean that a warrant will not be necessary if the information relates to acts or intentions of persons inside the British islands. Why else include subsection (5)?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> Subsection (5) is to protect people living in the British islands from interception on the grounds set out in the clause. I know that the hon. Gentleman is trying to be helpful, but he has got the wrong end of the stick. I am prepared to write to him further to clarify matters better than I am perhaps doing in Committee. Subsection (3) deals with the general situation, while subsection (5) excludes what happens in the British islands. With respect to the economic well-being test, subsection (5) means that a warrant cannot be issued with respect to acts or intentions of persons in the British islands.
<P>
<B>Mr. Beith:</B> Would not the provision preclude the Secretary of State from deeming something to be necessary?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> The right hon. Gentleman is correct. I do not want to be confusing or unhelpful. I give an absolute assurance that we do not intend to create a loophole allowing interception to take place without a warrant. I am happy to discuss wording the provision to make that clearer, but I think the present wording is clear.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> I accept the Minister's assurances, but ask only that he go over the matter with the parliamentary draftsmen again. No doubt they know exactly what the provision means and it satisfies the Minister's requirements. However, subsection (5) might look and sound better to the laymen among us if it stated something along these lines: ``No warrant shall be issued where economic activity in subsection 3(c) relates to people within the United Kingdom.'' That is a bit basic and blunt and no doubt needs cleaning up, but such an exclusion is preferable to the tortuous terminology in subsection (5).
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> I shall ask the parliamentary draftsmen to look at the right hon. Gentleman's back-of-an-envelope job. I do not think that there is any dispute about what we want to achieve.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> When the Minister is writing to us, it would help if he could relate the information to clauses 21 and 46 too. Under those provisions, it would be possible to serve notices to obtain communications data and to serve a decryption notice on the grounds of economic well-being, but with respect to acts or intentions of persons inside the British islands. That seems curious.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> I was coming to that point. A series of tests is established throughout the Bill, at different levels for different types of action, whether communications, data encryption or interception. There is a cat's cradle of different tests for different types of operation. The right approach is to discuss the precise formula when we reach the relevant clauses. I am happy to debate it with the hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire. It is in everyone's interest to make the matter as clear as possible.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Luff:</B> When the Minister writes, will he relate the definition to the Intelligence Services Act 1994 and the Security Service Act 1989?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> Yes, I shall do what I can on that.
<P>
Two other points were raised by hon. Members. Serious crime is defined in clause 71(2) and (3). The test is the same as in the Police Act 1997 and the Interception of Communications Act 1985. It includes offences that result in ``substantial financial gain'', although an amount of money is not given. Serious tax fraud—where a criminal offence is involved—could in major cases justify an interception warrant.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border asked whether there was a mix and match between agencies and powers. The bodies, such as the Security Service, NCIS, Customs and Excise, the Secret Intelligence Service and GCHQ, have their own statutory purposes. Clause 5 does not allow them to depart from those purposes, and that is a significant constraint on there being a mix and match. I hope that that meets the concerns of the right hon. Gentleman. We have no desire to depart from previous practice.
<P>
I have tried to respond to hon. Members' concerns. The amendment has allowed us to probe and clarify the issue, but I hope that the hon. Member for Hallam will withdraw it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> The debate has been useful. I echo the comments that the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds made about the Minister's attitude, which we also appreciate. He has gone out of his way to clarify aspects of the Bill that are opaque in either their wording or their intention, and we now have greater clarity about what is meant by economic well-being. I am pleased to hear that Mr. Blofeld, the constituent of the hon. Member for Mid-Worcestershire who keeps sending e-mails, will be able to communicate safely with Mr. Goldfinger, the constituent of the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds, to plot the economic downfall of the United Kingdom without their privacy being invaded, but additional clarification of what can and cannot be put in place would be helpful. We are in favour of safeguards and we are pleased to hear that they exist for UK citizens who conduct business that does not fall within the criminal ambit.
<P>
It would not be useful to pursue the amendment, although I am sure that we will have a similar debate on clauses 21 and 46. I hope that, by the end of our proceedings, we will have a clearer idea of the definition of economic well-being. As my right hon. Friend the Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed said, it is not likely to be tested in the courts; instead, it will be defined by the operating procedures used by the Secretary of State. When we discuss something that is not in the public domain but relies on the discretion of the Secretary of State, it is important to clarify the issues in Committee. People must have confidence in what is a significant power. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Luff:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 13, in page 8, line 24, after `warrant', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'provided that the same is proportionate to what is sought to be achieved by the conduct expressly authorised or required by the warrant'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss amendment No. 12, in page 8, line 24, after `is', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`reasonably'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If we have a similarly wide-ranging debate on these amendments, I am minded to put the question on whether the clause should stand part of the Bill without further debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Luff:</B> Your ruling, Mrs. Michie, helpfully clarifies what I was going to say. I hope that the debate will be brief and tight because the amendments are probing amendments whose purpose is to test one aspect of the clause. Although I have a few comments to make on clause stand part, we are grateful to the Minister and, indeed, to you for letting us have such a free-ranging debate on the previous group of amendments. Those amendments were closely related and that decision enabled us to have a more intelligent discussion. I am sure that we can truncate the clause stand part debate, because many of my concerns have been covered.
<P>
The amendments would apply the tests of reasonableness and proportionality. Amendment No. 13 deals with by-products, as the Minister called them during the Committee's second sitting; indeed, the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed also made helpful remarks about by-products. The Opposition seek to minimise the existence of by-products and to ensure that the security services do not feel that they have an excuse to sweep up all sorts of material for future or unrelated use. Such provision is especially important in respect of specific information that is needed for an investigation but which cannot be neatly targeted.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Therefore, amendment No. 13 deals with the by-products, which are the subject of the bracketed words contained in subsection (6)(a). Amendment No. 12 deals with conduct used in applying the warrant. I strongly suspect that the Minister will tell me that subsection (2)(b) covers by-products and the information sought. If it does, there will be no need to press the amendments to a Division, but I should like clear assurance on that point. The explanatory notes make great virtue of subsection (2)(b), which ``introduces a proportionality test''. They go on to state:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Proportionality, under the Convention case-law, is an essential part of any justification of conduct which interferes with an Article 8 right to privacy.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is important for the Committee to be satisfied that the wording of subsection (6) properly protects the convention rights. I understand that the Secretary of State has to make a judgment about whether a warrant is desirable, and we must not allow those who operate the warrant to be given undue discretion in its implementation. If the Secretary of State has to be constrained to proportionality in the issuing of the warrant, it is essential that those who give effect to it in practice are similarly restricted. We must not give a blank cheque to enthusiastic young interceptors and we should ensure that a proper test of proportionality applies to what they seek to collect.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> I rise briefly to support my hon. Friend. Last week, the Committee considered similar concerns about what would happen if any of the organisations involved—Customs and Excise, the Security Service or the Secret Intelligence Service—tried to exceed its remit in the enthusiastic pursuit of its duties. Some hon. Members expressed anxieties about whether the security services would go too far and ask for unnecessary warrants or for too much in other respects.
<P>
The House always has such concerns when it allows the Executive to interfere grossly with individual liberties. Sometimes it is right to interfere excessively in our cherished freedoms in order to protect the security of the state, to detect serious crime, to safeguard national security and so on, and that is permitted. However, Parliament always wants to be assured that such activity occurs only in the direst circumstances, in which no other legitimate recourse is available. The one thing that is missing from the Bill is a clause placing on the Secretary of State an obligation to behave proportionately or reasonably or to act according to a specific qualitative yardstick when considering the warrants.
<P>
Such an obligation has never been imposed by legislation. Every Government and all Secretaries of State rightly reject such suggestions, which would automatically provide an appeal procedure for cases in which people found out about the activities in question. If the Secretary of State were required in assessing a warrant application to consider a number of criteria specified in statute, a Pandora's box would be opened up, as an appeals mechanism would be necessary to assess whether the Secretary of State had considered the specified matters. The Security Commission could check such issues as part of overlooking the Secretary of State's decisions on warrants. I see no insuperable difficulty in having a check list of qualitative criteria to which the Secretary of State should apply his mind before issuing a warrant.
<P>
No doubt Secretaries of State have rejected warrants. I suspect that those who prepared the papers for them will have pointed out that the grounds on which the applications were based were not good enough, that something was not quite right or that something else needed to be done. They will have tried legitimately to protect the Secretary of State's back and ensure that he acted properly and lawfully in granting those warrants. I know of cases in which Secretaries of State have rightly rejected applications.
<P>
The problem is that the Bill does not state the grounds on which applications should be rejected. The Minister will doubtless say that it would not be appropriate to spell them out. However, in the absence of a clause or subsection laying down the criteria for the Secretary of State not to grant a warrant—perhaps because an application was not up to a certain standard—the Bill should include a provision allowing for ``proportionality'' or for acting ``reasonably''. The problem with the word ``reasonably'' is that such tests are normally decided by the courts, which is not likely to happen unless the Security Service Act commissioners conclude that the Secretary of State should not reasonably have come to the conclusion that a warrant was appropriate.
<P>
The Bill lacks a checking provision. Perhaps I should draft a new clause for later consideration. Clause 5 should require the Secretary of State to grant warrants only if he is satisfied of certain qualitative features. Those criteria are not spelled out in the Bill, but we can always trust Home Secretaries—they are good chaps—to behave reasonably and to apply proper tests, at least in their own minds. I hope that the Minister will assure the Committee that a new clause will be drafted.

<P>

<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> I know that the right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border is carried away with his success on the Terrorism Bill, his rhetoric putting Bills immediately on to the statute book. However, clause 5(2) deals with much of what he wishes to achieve. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Secretary of State shall not issue an interception warrant unless he believes—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) that the warrant is necessary on grounds falling within subsection (3); and<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(b) that the conduct authorised by the warrant is proportionate to what is sought to be achieved by that conduct.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That reference is strengthened because things done pursuant to the warrant under clause 5(6)(a) must be proportionate. It is also a matter of general law that such things must be interpreted in accordance with the convention of human rights.
<P>
The hon. Member for Mid-Worcestershire conceded that clause 5(2) meets many of the Opposition's concerns. We believe that ``necessary'' is a higher test than ``reasonably necessary''. In a slightly different context, the court in Strasbourg described it as
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>not synonymous with indispensable, but not as flexible as such expressions as admissible, ordinary, reasonable or desirable.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is a high test. We believe that inserting the word ``reasonably'' would confuse matters and would result in a stricter test than necessary.
<P>
I appreciate that the amendments are designed to establish a strict set of criteria, but we believe that the present wording already achieves that. I hope that the hon. Member for Mid-Worcestershire will be prepared to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Luff:</B> It would be churlish not to say that the Minister has met our concerns. He has put on record exactly what the tests would be and what should happen after a warrant has been issued. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Luff:</B> In view of your earlier injunction, Mrs. Michie, I shall not initiate a long debate. I have only three points to make that were not dealt with during our extensive debates on the amendments.
<P>
We need to consider briefly Liberty's concerns about clause 5(4). Liberty, quoted in the Library briefing, states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Clause 5(4) effectively replicates the unsatisfactory IOCA requirement that the Secretary of State merely ``consider'' the availability of alternative means of obtaining the relevant information. Where access is sought in cases of routine crime to confidential or other sensitive material, Schedule 1 to the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 requires the investigating authority to positively show that other methods have failed or are bound to fail. For the Bill to apply a less stringent test where the individual faces an interference with fundamental rights on the basis of suspicion of serious wrongdoing turns proportionality on its head.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Liberty deserves a response to that suggestion.
<P>
What will happen when individuals usually resident outside the British Isles who might have been part of a conspiracy to undermine the welfare of the UK visit this country? What powers will the Secretary of State have to deal with foreign nationals who are not normally resident here? I would not want the Minister to think that I was obsessed with films about espionage, but I recall the film ``Entrapment'', in which Catherine Zeta Jones plans a major fraud on a Singapore bank but has to conduct the espionage in the UK. I trust that the Minister can assure me that the Secretary of State would have the necessary powers to deal with such a situation.
<P>
Finally, in responding to the debate on amendment No. 64, the Minister did not deal with the point made by my right hon. Friend the hon. Member for Penrith and The Border about tax revenues. The notes on clauses suggest that subsection (5) is tighter than the European convention on human rights demands. Why is that the case?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> First, on Liberty and turning proportionality on its head, all I can say is that I do not agree. We have provided for proportionality in the conduct of the Secretary of State and how the Bill relates to the European convention on human rights. Liberty's concerns are not justified.
<P>
To answer the hon. Gentleman's third point, serious tax fraud that constitutes a criminal offence could justify an interception warrant. However, I cannot immediately answer the hon. Gentleman's question about non-residents who come to this country, but I shall write to him about that. I believe that the point is covered and I will give him that assurance in writing.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 5 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 6</center></H4>
<H4><center>Application for issue of an interception warrant</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Beith:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 34, in page 8, line 44, leave out `a Permanent Under-Secretary of State in the Ministry of Defence' and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`the Chief of the Defence Staff'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment relates specifically to the list, the broader principles of which we shall discuss in relation to later amendments. The amendment results from our genuine concern about the decision to make either one of the civilian heads of the Ministry of Defence responsible for applying for warrants on behalf of various service bodies that come under the aegis of the Ministry. From reading the legislation, I assume that the relevant bodies will be the Ministry of Defence police, the service police—that is the RAF and military police—and defence intelligence, but presumably not the Ministry of Defence as such. I do not envisage that some operating division of the Ministry of Defence, other than the bodies that I have mentioned, would need to apply for warrants, but I could be wrong. However, everyone else in the list is the head of an agency or law enforcement body. Their applications will be considered by the Secretary of State, who is advised by civil servants responsible to the departmental permanent secretary. What worries me—and also concerns some members of the Intelligence and Security Committee, although it has not been discussed formally—is that the person who will be responsible for giving advice will be the person applying for the warrant. That does not seem to be analogous with the basis on which all other bodies apply for warrants.
<P>
There is a further complication. The legislation extends the system of warrants and adds to civil liberties by doing so, because it creates warrant protection for more interception activity than hitherto. A consequence, in theory—it will be for the Minister to say whether it is true in practice—is that many more Secretaries of State are brought into the net. For every body listed, a Secretary of State could be involved.

It is not clear from the Bill whether the Secretary of State for Defence will be involved in approving and granting warrants or whether the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who presumably ranks as a Secretary of State, could become involved in authorising a Customs and Excise warrant. We might return to that issue later. The possibility is at least opened up that the permanent secretary at the Ministry of Defence could apply for a warrant on behalf of the Ministry of Defence police, the RAF police or defence intelligence, and then be responsible for the civil servants advising the Minister on whether to grant the warrant.
<P>
I have suggested one way of making sure that there is more than a mere Chinese wall, which is to make the Chief of the Defence Staff responsible. The only complication with that, as far as I can see, is that the Chief of the Defence Staff has no direct responsibility for the Ministry of Defence police, who are a civilian arm of the Department. However, he has direct responsibility for all the other relevant bodies.
<P>
A further complication is that there are two permanent secretaries at the Ministry of Defence, one of whom has responsibilities for intelligence matters while the other does not. It is not clear which of those is involved.
<P>
There should be a better way to resolve this matter that would put defence policing and intelligence bodies on all fours with the other bodies in the list and that would not involve the permanent secretary in at least a theoretical conflict of responsibility as both an applicant for a warrant and the civil servant responsible for those advising on the warrant.
<P>
<B>Mr. Luff:</B> I am grateful to the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed for the amendment, because it enables us to test an important part of the list. There are many mysteries in the precise wording of this subsection. The right hon. Gentleman said that there were two permanent secretaries. I stand to be corrected by him, as I have been already this morning, but I think there is one permanent under-secretary and a second permanent under-secretary. The first thing that I want to know is whether
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>a Permanent Under-Secretary of State in the Ministry of Defence<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
is the permanent under-secretary, the second permanent under-secretary or both of them. That is not clear to me. The definite article is used for all the other individuals in the list.
<P>
The other issue that needs to be dealt with is the consequences of accepting the amendment. I have here the chart of the higher organisation of the Ministry of Defence, from the ``Civil Service Year Book'', which is beguilingly simple. I suspect that it is a great deal more complex than it is shown to be, if the truth be known. As far as I can see, accepting the amendment would result in excluding the work of the chief scientist and the Chief of Defence Procurement from the line management of the individual responsible for applying for the permit. I might have misunderstood the organogram, which is difficult to follow, but it seems that not just the police, but also defence procurement, might then be difficult to deal with. I wonder whether the answer would be to add the Chief of the Defence Staff as the normal applicant for a warrant, while including the permanent under-secretary for the other occasions.
<P>
The question of who would approve the warrant needs to be clarified. I think that I know what the Minister will say, but I remember the points made by my right hon. Friend the Member for Penrith and The Border last week about what Secretary of State was being talked about. In the case of a warrant applied for by either the, or a, permanent under-secretary at the Ministry of Defence, or by the Chief of the Defence Staff, would the Secretary of State necessarily approve the warrant, or would it be the Home Secretary, to avoid the internalisation that the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed spoke about?

<P>

<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> The amendment is useful. I shall deal first with some of the smaller points. There are two permanent under secretaries, hence the phrase ``a Permanent Under-Secretary'' which covers both of them. The Secretary of State involved is the Defence Secretary, not the Home Secretary. The Chancellor of the Exchequer is not a Secretary of State, so Customs applications would have to come to the Home Secretary in the ordinary way. I have tried to clarify some of those points in a letter that was delivered this morning and I am happy to continue clarifying if there is still any lack of certainty.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed made an important point. There is a conflict in approach and ideology, which we have resolved in one direction and which he suggests might be resolved in another. On the one hand, there has to be independent advice to the Secretary of State about the actions of those who are applying for a warrant, hence the suggestion that the Chief of the Defence Staff should issue the warrant rather than the permanent under-secretary. On the other hand, there is the quite important constitutional principle that the armed forces of the country are not independent of the Secretary of State. The phrase is included to emphasise that, unlike the police forces, the Chief of the Defence Staff does not have a role independent of the Secretary of State. It is for the Secretary of State to take key strategic decision. As commander of the armed forces, the Chief of the Defence Staff is subordinate to the Secretary of State. That is why the phrases are established in this form. It is not for the perfectly reasonable reasons mentioned earlier about problems with MOD police in other areas. We could no doubt find other ways to address those problems if we did not have the formulation before us. MOD ideology, with which I am not deeply familiar, considers that the Chief of the Defence Staff has to be—and it is right that he or she should be—subordinate to the Secretary of State in such matters. That is why the Bill is in its present form.
<P>
Most MOD interception activity will be carried out by the armed forces. The permanent under-secretary will have a clear role to play in authorising that activity, first in support of the armed forces, by showing that their activities are not open to legal challenge, and secondly by ensuring that the armed forces do not exceed the legal and constitutional principles under the Act—for example, by breaching the principles of the Human Rights Act 1998.
<P>
In light of the debate, I am prepared to think again about whether we might deal with the matter differently. I shall be interested to hear the right hon. Gentleman's response to my observations when he winds up on the amendment. Is he prepared to consider withdrawing it on the basis of my assurance that I am prepared to look at it further? Our reasons for using that wording are perfectly defensible and reasonable, but I acknowledge what the right hon. Gentleman says about the conflict between that and some of the issues in the Bill. We have come down on one side of the argument. I hear what the right hon. Gentleman says, and I shall be interested to hear his response to my comments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Beith:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for his constructive response to the points made in this short debate. It is always helpful to discover the reason why something has been done, which is often not apparent in parliamentary drafting, even if one is still not convinced—and I am still not convinced—that the reason outweighs the other arguments about preventing conflicts of interest, loyalty or responsibility. There could be a conflict between the responsibility to apply for and assist action that some part of the MOD empire feels that it should carry out and that of safeguarding civil liberties and proportionality and all the other issues that were raised earlier.
<P>
That potential conflict still seems to be there, which is why I am grateful that the Minister has agreed to look more carefully at it.
<P>
I shall reflect on whether the constitutional principle of the responsibility of the forces to the Secretary of State could still be met while some other structure was put in place to meet the objectives, which are elsewhere met by the separation of those individuals. It is an important point. I recognise that, as far as I can see, most of the other people on the list have a statutory authority to carry out law enforcement activity that is in some measure independent of the Ministers to whom they are responsible.
<P>
It is something of a Chinese puzzle. I am glad that the Minister is to devote some more thought to it and I shall certainly do so. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Luff:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 15, in page 9, leave out lines 4 and 5 and insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(k) a Permanent Under-Secretary of State in the Department of Social Security.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following:
<P>
Amendment No. 14, in page 9, leave out lines 4 and 5.
<P>
Amendment No 35, in page 9, line 5, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(2A) The Secretary of State shall not make an order under subsection (2)(k) unless a draft of the order has been laid before Parliament and approved by a resolution of each House.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Government amendment (a) to the proposed amendment.
<P>
Amendment No. 16, in page 9, line 9, after `order', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`under the affirmative resolution procedure'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Government amendment No. 71, in page 72, line 26, after `section' insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`6(2A),'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Before the Committee debates this group of amendments, it might help to set out the order in which questions will be put on them. When the debate has finished, the Committee will decide, first, on amendment No. 15. I shall put the question on the next amendment, amendment No. 14, if I am satisfied that a separate division is justified. I shall then ask an hon. Member to move amendment No. 35 formally, but before putting the question on amendment No. 35, I shall ask the Minister to move formally amendment (a) to amendment No. 35. When that has been decided, I shall put the question that amendment No. 35, as amended, be made.
<P>
I hope that that reasonably clarifies the situation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Luff:</B> Thank you for that helpful clarification, Mrs. Michie. The grouping is relatively complex, for a variety of reasons. The amendments cover two different issues and there are three groups of amendments within the grouping, two of which deal with the affirmative procedure.
<P>
I am presented with a challenge in debating the group. No criticism of the grouping is intended: I am only too happy to rise to the challenge. I shall be hard on the Minister and the Government in relation to amendments Nos. 14 and 15, welcoming and generous on amendment No. 35 and Government amendment (a) and inquisitive on amendments Nos. 71 and 16.
<P>
If I am harsh in advocating amendment No. 15, I hope that that will not alter the Minister's characteristic courtesy in dealing with later points. I hope that the praise that I shall heap on his shoulders will make him feel a good deal more relaxed.
<P>
It is fair to signal now that we do not regard amendments Nos. 14 and 15 as probing amendments. They are matters that we think we shall wish to press to a Division, unless the Minister is able to say something in summing up to change our mind.
<P>
May I concentrate initially on the addition of the words
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`Permanent Under-Secretary of State in the Department of Social Security.'?<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I will leave the deletion of lines 4 and 5 for the moment, if I may. The issue was debated on Second Reading by my right hon. Friend the shadow Home Secretary and my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Hertfordshire in his winding-up speech. Both the Home Secretary and the Minister sought to deal with the point here, but we were not convinced by what they said in response. It was clearly partial, and we were grateful for it, but it did not go far enough. As my right hon. Friend the shadow Home Secretary said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>One notable omission is any provision for a senior official responsible for the detection of serious benefit fraud to apply for an interception warrant. Given that such fraud is by far the most substantial crime by value committed in the United Kingdom, it seems a bit odd that no senior official at the Department of Social Security can apply for a warrant—even in the most serious cases of benefit fraud; for example, those involving international gangs.—[Official Report, 6 March 2000; Vol. 345, c. 778.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Home Secretary said in essence that it was not a problem, because the police would be involved and they could apply for a warrant. My right hon. Friend the shadow Home Secretary was not persuaded by that response. She invited the Government to consider
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>whether there are cases that might not necessarily be dealt with at one remove through the police and whether there might thus be some circumstances in which that individual should be able to apply for an interception warrant.—[Official Report, 6 March 2000; Vol. 345, c. 779.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is the heart of the amendment. I am a little confused—bemused, even—by the Government's reluctance to take this seriously. We often hear ``joined-up government'' being boasted of by the Government. We are seeking here to make it less joined-up, to remove a link from the chain and make it simpler for those involved in chasing benefit fraud to pursue their concerns without necessarily having to involve the police. The argument made by my right hon. Friend the shadow Home Secretary during her speech on Second Reading needs to be clearly answered today by the Minister.
<P>
We know that the Government has had a different attitude to benefit fraud over the years. Four years ago, my right hon. Friend, the Member for Hitchin and Harpenden (Mr. Lilley), the then Secretary of State for Social Security said, during a debate on benefit fraud:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>One of the attitudes of Opposition Front-Benchers to fraud is to pretend that is not very big: the other is to say that is not very important. Their attitude to fraud is similar to the attitude of the right hon. Member for Sedgefield (Mr. Blair) on shoplifting, who said: ``Shoplifting is just a case lone parents and other poor people helping themselves to a treat.'' Opposition Members see fraud in a rather similar light.—[Official Report, 5 March 1996; Vol. 273, c. 170.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Opposition are now the Government and that reluctance to admit the scale or the seriousness of benefit fraud seems to have undergone some damascene conversion. I think that I am correct that we now hear of figures up to £7 billion of fraud waiting to be claimed—a crock of gold. If that is the case—it might not be, although it is proving difficult to deal with—why are the Government passing up the opportunity to make the task of those who chase these matters simpler?
<P>
We are dealing not with small fraudulent claims made here and there in individual housing benefit applications, but with systematic and organised fraud on a huge scale. The information technology that lies behind the rationale of the Bill makes that process much easier to conduct. It is extraordinary that the Government are not prepared to make the task of those tracing fraud simpler.
<P>
I know that it is only recently—the Minister might say thus, and I must take it on the chin—that those responsible for investigating fraud have started to be given the powers they need. That would be a fair criticism of the previous Government. The Social Security Administration (Fraud) Act 1997 gave housing and council tax benefits inspectors many powers for the first time. The Act says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>An inspector may . . . enter any premises liable to inspection under this section at any reasonable time . . . may make inquiries about, and examine documents relating to, any person believed by him to be a benefit claimant or a benefit recipient . . . and interview any person found by him in any premises liable to inspection under this section.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It goes on to say what persons liable to supply information shall do, why premises might be liable for inspection and, intriguingly, defines ``document'' as
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>anything in which information of any description is recorded.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I wonder what that means in the context of the Bill. It is a very generous definition of ``document'' that probably includes a lot of the electronic means of storing, retrieving and transmitting information. The powers given by that Act to those seeking to combat housing benefit and council tax benefit fraud were absolutely right and proper, but these poor people have been, to use a phrase that my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Hertfordshire likes, the Cinderellas of Government in this respect—always the last to get such powers. Here is an opportunity to put them on an equal footing with others in government who are combating crime of whatever kind. It is one that the Minister should seize.
<P>
The matter becomes all the more urgent because of two relatively recent Government policies. They increase the urgency of updating the ways in which the Benefits Agency and local authorities can investigate fraudulent claims and payments. The Government are doing two things that are inevitably moving us more rapidly than I would like in the direction of electronic transmission of all benefits.
<P>
We know the uproar that has been caused among rural and even town sub-post offices by the Government's determination to move all benefit payments to automated credit transfer, away from payment in simple cash at the post office counter. I know what my sub-post offices say and we would hardly need to debate this amendment if their wisdom was borne in mind by the Government. The best way to combat benefit fraud is to pay it in person to people who are known. There is no prospect of Bradley Green post office paying benefit to the wrong person, because it knows the people who live in the community. That will no longer happen. All the residents of the remote rural communities of England and Wales will find that they have to open bank accounts and have their benefits paid into them. It will all be done electronically. The anonymity of that process will mean that those conducting major benefit fraud will have a field day.
<P>
I could be wrong, but my initial reading of yesterday's announcement that the banks are to be referred to the Competition Commission could make the process still worse. The Cruickshank review of banking competition suggested that more agencies should be involved in money transfers, and that greater competition for the transfer of funds should exist. A new regulatory body to supervise the transfer of funds was also suggested. More benefit funds will be transferred electronically by a greater number of agents, so the need for proper powers for the Benefits Agency and all involved in benefit payments has never been more urgent or real. My right hon. and hon. Friends will take a great deal of persuasion that amendment No. 15 is not urgently needed. Indeed, the need for it is becoming more urgent by the day, and we see no reason why it should be resisted.
<P>
Amendment No. 14 would delete subsection (2)(k), which will grant the Secretary of State draconian powers. That is a problem that we encounter often in the Bill, but some welcome concessions will be made in due course, so I must not be too hard on the Minister, who, at least on this occasion, may have taken our concerns on board. Granting the Secretary of State a power—at present, dealt with through the negative resolution procedure—to designate any such persons as he thinks fit, makes the inclusion of a list somewhat spurious. We could not accept the inclusion in the statute book of such a power. I am sure that that is an issue to which Liberal Democrats and Conservative Members will return time and again, as we consider the Bill clause by clause.
<P>
What other person does the Secretary of State have in mind that he might add by order to the subsection? Perhaps he has in mind a permanent under-secretary at the Department of Social Security. If so, let us add his name now, and not waste Parliament's time on a subsequent statutory instrument. We have deep concerns and amendments Nos. 15 and 14 are important to us, so we shall be listening carefully to the Minister's winding-up speech.
<P>
I move to the rather happier territory of amendment No. 35 and Government amendment (a). The Minister understands that we wish to change the order-making power under subsection (2)(k), so that a designated person can be added to the list only by the affirmative resolution procedure. Unless I have misinterpreted Government amendment (a), it merely tidies up the drafting of our amendment and renders it more effective. In that spirit, I give my heartfelt thanks to the Minister. The Government have made an exceptionally important concession, which shows that they understand the concerns of those outside this place about the effect of the Bill. We intend to support Government amendment (a), provided the Minister can confirm that our interpretation is correct.
<P>
I admit that I need the Minister's help to understand the precise impact of Government amendment No. 71. As I have confessed, I am not a lawyer, but it seems intended to stand in the stead of amendment No. 16, which would make the removal of a person from the list also subject to the affirmative resolution procedure. Again, the Government appear to have accepted the power of our argument, although they are dealing with the matter in a different way. I genuinely look forward—as I always do—to what the Minister has to say, because the Opposition want to understand the precise impact of Government amendment No. 71 before deciding how to vote.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Beith:</B> I shall deal with the issues and amendments in the order in which the hon. Gentleman dealt with them. On amendment No. 15, the issue is not whether interception cannot sometimes be used to deal with the widespread problem of benefit fraud; it is commonly accepted that certain circumstances justify interception. The issue is whether the permanent secretary of the Department of Social Security should be added to the list of those who can apply for a warrant, and whether the DSS should become a law enforcement body with warrant-seeking powers. We strongly oppose the amendment., but I have better news for the hon. Member for Mid-Worcestershire because I support amendment No. 14.
<P>
Amendment No. 15 entirely replicates the problem to which I referred on the previous amendment because it would give powers to a permanent secretary and would create another Secretary of State who would grant warrants. The application would go from the permanent secretary in the DSS to the Secretary of State for Social Security. It would introduce precisely the same problem to which I referred on the previous amendment because that permanent secretary would be responsible for the channel of advice to the Secretary of State for Social Security on whether to authorise the warrant. That would be unsatisfactory. Presumably the problem could be solved by designating another official in the DSS for the purpose, so I shall set that aside and examine the arguments in principle against the amendment.
<P>
The proposal ignores the existing working arrangements with the police for the detection and prosecution of large-scale benefit fraud. I know of no evidence that those arrangements do not work in practice and in my other capacity I have not been made aware of any great deficiency in the arrangements by which the DSS works with the police as the law enforcement body.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> Can the right hon. Gentleman confirm that the police are involved in every case of fraud or alleged fraud?
<P>
<B>Mr. Beith:</B> No, because of officials of the DSS or any other money-collecting or distributing body can deal with fraud by methods short of prosecution. The first is to draw the attention of the person concerned to the fact that what he is up to is known about. There is a chain of actions that can be taken and the police are not involved in every case, but they are involved if detection or prosecution is necessary and they are even more involved if the Department believes that there is a possibility of large-scale fraud when it will work very closely with the police.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> Does the right hon. Gentleman accept that the Department of Social Security prosecutes approximately 10,000 people a year for various benefit fraud offences and that some are quite serious? Why should the power to intercept be used at one remove through the police? Why should not the benefit fraud investigation service organise a fraud division for that purpose?
<P>
<B>Mr. Beith:</B> I shall come to that. One reason is that to grant the power to the Department would provide no threshold, unlike other parts of the Bill. The use of interception powers, for example, in other areas is defined by reference to serious crime and the involvement of agencies when serious crime is involved. There is no threshold here to enable a judgment to be made on what the DSS is as an organisation. Is it a body whose activities are characterised by applying for interception warrants and engaging in such investigation? That lack of a threshold is a problem.
<P>
<B>Mr. Luff:</B> I am genuinely trying to understand the right hon. Gentleman's argument. He said that there is no threshold, but interception warrants may be issued subject to clause 5, which clearly states that the crime at issue must be serious. Is that not the threshold for which the right hon. Gentleman is looking?
<P>
<B>Mr. Beith:</B> Perhaps I had not understood the way in which the hon. Gentleman tried to relate his proposal to the rest of the Bill, in which case I owe him an apology. The DSS is part of life for a large section of the population, often for reasons that they do not choose—ill health, unemployment and so on. It should not be characterised as an organisation that is likely to tap people's telephones as they make their normal claims. It is not unusual for the DSS and other agencies to be mistaken in their pursuit of individuals and to cause great distress to very vulnerable people as they genuinely try to crack down on fraud. People understand more readily when the police have to carry out an interception than if a Government Department such as the DSS does so. There is no good parallel. The nearest parallel would be the arguments about VAT and Customs and Excise, to which the right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border referred to earlier, but Customs and Excise has been a law enforcement agency for centuries. Although it sometimes comes as a surprise to people, it is an established part of our law. The DSS is not characterised in that way. It is a Government Department that seeks fairly to distribute benefits set out by statute and has some powers to pursue those who break the rules in applying for those benefits. However, when it wants to pursue serious crime, it involves the police. That relationship and chain of events are readily understood.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> Will the right hon. Gentleman let me correct something? I mentioned the DSS, but these matters are dealt with by the Benefits Agency. The benefit fraud investigation service is part of that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Beith:</B> I am also prone to using the generic term to refer to the part.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I would mention a further complication. My understanding is that the Government are proposing to merge the Benefits Agency and the Employment Service to offer a unified service. Therefore, if the amendment were accepted, the Employment Service/Benefits Agency friendly helping hand service would have the power to carry out interceptions. That makes it even less acceptable that it should be given this power.
<P>
<B>Mr. Beith:</B> My hon. Friend makes a good point. He also raises the possibility of further additions to the list, using the power to which I shall refer in a moment, to cope with governmental reorganisation and with the amalgamation of various agencies. The strongest words that I can use are ``If it ain't broke, don't fix it''. Whatever weaknesses there are in the present arrangements, they are not the involvement of the police and the fact that the police have to play a major part. At least, I remain to be convinced that that is a significant weakness in the present arrangements.
<P>
Amendment No. 14 raises a much wider principle, and I want to state the principle as we see it very strongly. Interception bodies should be created by primary legislation, not by secondary legislation. Indeed, the Government have made it clear that they have no plans to create any new bodies that carry out interception activity. If they were to do so, I would expect them to come to Parliament with primary legislation designed to create such a body, set out its statutory purpose, place limits on that purpose and, if appropriate, give it interception powers to link it into the Bill.
<P>
It would not be right for the Government to take a new or existing body, confer on it such a status and give it that character. It is implicit in what I have said on both amendments that a body that can carry out telephone interception is significantly different in character from other branches of the Government, and I do not want them to be characterised by the ability to intercept telecommunications. It is a limited and special power that intrudes on civil liberties and should be used in a controlled and regulated way by a limited number of bodies. It should not be a characteristic of the Government that their institutions intercept telephone calls. We all read our George Orwell in years gone by. Indeed, it is a matter of regret that the picture conjured up by ``Nineteen Eighty-Four'' of Big Brother and all that has ceased to be seen as something that one can oppose or be concerned about: it is increasingly accepted as a fact of life. We should not be ready to accept it as a fact of life and certainly not as a characteristic of government. I prefer to disprove some of Orwell's prophecies by confining interception to areas and agencies that have a clear need for it.
<P>
What changes could a Government envisage that would require them to introduce orders to add other bodies, and what sort of bodies could be added? We could have an argument about the Child Support Agency similar to that in which we have been involved today about the DSS. There would be great opposition in many quarters if the CSA became an agency that applied for telephone interception warrants. Again, it is not a case of the police not having powers to act if a serious crime is suspected, although it is more difficult to envisage large-scale organised crime in relation to the CSA. That is just an example of a body that might be added. The Government could introduce on to the list another central agency such as No. 10 or the Government Whips Office. Governments of evil intent—which they can always disguise—could add all kinds of bodies for all kinds of purposes. As the Government have made it clear that they do not intend to do that, they do not need the power to be able to add, through secondary legislation, to the wide range of bodies that can apply for interception powers.
<P>
The Minister has sought to address that in the amendment, which is welcome. The negative resolution procedure should not be used in this respect; we all know what a joke it is in terms of parliamentary scrutiny. The Government can be certain of being able to exclude any debate or vote from the Order Paper. I am therefore pleased that if the power remains it will be subject to the affirmative instrument. Having said that, I have sat on many Committees over the years, some of which considered Bills in which all the orders were to be by negative resolution. At some point in the Committee's deliberations—usually a little later than this—the Minister would turn up to trumpet his concession and say, with a great show of reluctance, ``We'll let them have an affirmative order for it''. However, the question would remain as to whether the power was justified in the first place. In this case, it is not justified. If there were an overwhelming reason for it, I would prefer it to be implemented by the affirmative, rather than the negative, resolution procedure—although I should almost always prefer that, given the defects of our existing negative resolution procedure.
<P>
Although the Government amendment is welcome, in a limited way, it does not answer the argument against including the power in the Bill, which I shall continue to oppose. I cannot envisage any convincing argument that the Minister might give in favour of retaining it. However, he will have the opportunity to do so.

<B>Mr. Ian Taylor:</B> The right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed made a persuasive case. I share his reluctance to see the Government characterised as wanting to use investigatory powers beyond the tight remit that is provided for by the list in clause 6. As a staunch Conservative, I shall not in any way undermine the excellent argument of my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Worcestershire in his reasoned and thoughtful contribution. However, in the event that his argument does not prevail, my instinct would be to follow that of the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed. For a variety of reasons based on public impact and wider business confidence, the powers in clause 6—which I support—should be allocated only to a very tight list. If a change to the list is required, it should be made de minimis by affirmative action. In the interests of the Government of the day, it should probably be made through primary legislation.
<P>
I urge the Minister to think carefully about why he wants to include paragraph (k). Perhaps I am missing something obvious that cannot be envisaged by a humble Opposition Back-Bencher. When the Minister tells us about it, we will say, ``Of course, if only we had thought of that.'' We are not as omnipotent and far-sighted as Ministers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Luff:</B> Omniscient.
<P>
<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> My hon. Friend is correct. However, I enter the caveat, with which I am sure that he will agree, that Ministers can also be characterised by omnipotence.
<P>
Unless the Minister intends to tell us that we have overlooked something, he should take care in inserting into the Bill a catch-all clause that could have a problematic impact on public and industry perceptions of the powers that are granted by the Bill and disproportionately damage the arguments that he is putting forward.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> In rising to speak to amendment No. 15, I am mindful of the powerful contributions made by the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed and by my hon. Friend the Member for Esher and Walton (Mr. Taylor). They opened up the appalling vista that powers might be taken to allow senior officials of the Child Support Agency to obtain warrants to intercept.
<P>
Any parliamentarian who has had even a passing acquaintance with the work of that agency will shudder at that prospect. The blood almost runs cold to think about what those officials—many of whom are well meaning, but many of whom are deeply incompetent—would do with the powers accompanying warrants for interception. Having said that, I support the main thrust of the arguments put forward by my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Worcestershire.
<P>
<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> I may have misunderstood the hon. Gentleman. In proposing that a permanent under-secretary in the Department of Social Security be given the proposed powers, is he making a distinction between the Benefits Agency and, say, the Child Support Agency or any other agency? As far as I can see, the amendment says okay to the Benefits Agency and also to the Child Support Agency. Perhaps I have got that wrong?
<P>
<B>Mr. Luff rose—</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> I think that I shall speak for just a few seconds before giving way to my hon. Friend.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> The Opposition have signalled clearly that we want this power to be made available to the benefit fraud investigation service. We have used the words
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Permanent Under-Secretary of State in the Department of Social Security<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
to cover the issues that we were discussing earlier. If the Minister says that that wording needs to be more specific, we can return—[Laughter.] No, if he says, with the benefit of all the legal advice that he has available, that it needs to be more specific, we can return to the issue on Report. However, it is important to grant this power to the benefit fraud investigation service.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend. This has become a probing amendment, and an important one. I am sure that the Minister will reflect on the comments made by my hon. Friend in his brief intervention.
<P>
I want to return to the proposition put forward by my hon. Friend the Member for Maidstone and The Weald (Miss Widdecombe), when she rightly drew attention to the fact that it is a serious omission that no senior official from the Department of Social Security is empowered to obtain warrants. That is because benefit fraud is now one of the most serious economic threats—on the public spending side—to the sound management of public finances and to the sensible management of the British economy. I know that the Treasury and the Chancellor of the Exchequer are exercised by that fact, and they appear keen to do something about it.
<P>
In that respect, I was disappointed to read a briefing in the newspapers to the effect that the Chancellor was not prepared, in this Parliament, to tackle the national disgrace of housing benefit fraud. Such organised, premeditated and disgraceful fiddling robs deserving claimants of resources that they need. If the briefing is to be believed, I hope that the Government will have the courage to take action if they get back into power after the next general election. We would support any Government who tackle fraud, which is why the amendment is so important. A balance must be struck between the civil liberties of the citizen, which must be protected, and the needs of the state to protect the national economic interest. That cannot be seen more clearly than in the need to tackle fraud, which is most widespread and outrageous in relation to social security.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I should like to focus on a specific point that was made by the Home Secretary on Second Reading. He responded to my right hon. Friend the Member for Maidstone and The Weald in relation to a case of benefit fraud in Lancashire, and stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In most cases of serious social security fraud, the police are involved. There is no problem in the police making an application through the National Criminal Intelligence Service—they do that through an intermediary. There would be no impediment to that system for applications in cases of serious benefit fraud.—[Official Report, 6 March 2000; Vol. 345, c. 778.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
You have an eagle eye, Mrs. Michie, and you will have noted that the Home Secretary used the words ``in most cases''. He did not use the words ``in every case'' or ``in all cases''. We are therefore perfectly entitled to ask the Minister what circumstances there might be in which serious social security fraud does not involve the police. The logical deduction from the Home Secretary's words at column 778 is that such circumstances exist. If certain serious social security fraud cases do not involve the police, what are the options for obtaining a warrant? In those circumstances, there would be no possibility of an intermediary, because the police would not be involved and would not be able to function through an intermediary as the Home Secretary suggested. Will the Minister therefore provide more detail?
<P>
Finally, I want to reaffirm Opposition Members' ambivalence about the Bill. As a lifelong staunch Conservative with libertarian instincts, I find any extension of the state's power worrying. We must also have regard to the examples drawn to our attention by the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed, such as warrants being obtained by the Child Support Agency. However, the nature of social security fraud and the damage that it does to the economy outweigh those considerations. That is the overriding argument for amendment No. 15, which would extend the powers of the Department of Social Security to protect the economic interests of citizens, not least those who are currently suffering as a result of fraud in the social security system.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> With your permission, Mrs. Michie, I shall deal first with the points made about social security in relation to amendment No. 15. I shall then deal with amendments Nos. 14 and 35, Government amendment (a) and Government amendment No. 71 together, and amendment No. 16.
<P>
On amendment No. 15, the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds generously acknowledged that the Government are absolutely committed to rooting out social security fraud. There is no question about that—we have set in motion a series of initiatives to achieve that end—and there is no issue of principle between us. However, it is important to understand the Bill's approach. Those people who are named in clause 6(2) and who may apply for interception warrants belong to those organisations that have the technical capacity to intercept communications. We raised that matter earlier in our exchange about the Ministry of Defence, when we discussed the role of the permanent secretary and the Chief of the Defence Staff. Not all organisations in the social security framework, including the Benefits Agency and the Child Support Agency, have the technical capacity to intercept communications. They do not have that capacity for legal reasons—serious issues are raised about its use—and because it is expensive.
<P>
Organisations that have the technical capacity to intercept communications should not be confused with organisations that can make use of intelligence that is derived from interception. For example, to take an obvious case, individual police forces in England and Wales are not named in clause 6(2), but when the cases that they are investigating are serious enough, they may ask the National Criminal Intelligence Service to apply for an interception warrant. NCIS is the intercepting agency, but the intelligence that is gained through the intercept is passed to the police. That is how the process works. If the Department of Social Security works on a joint inquiry with the police, the mechanism that I described is one way in which interception could be used to further the investigation.
<P>
Equally, there is nothing to prevent the DSS from going to directly to NCIS to ask it to apply for an interception warrant on behalf of the DSS, if the investigation is serious enough. NCIS has a statutory function under the Police Act 1997 to provide criminal intelligence to law enforcement agencies, including ``any government department''. That provision is contained in section 2(3)(a) of the 1997 Act. The DSS and other Departments can ask NCIS for information and help in this context.

<P>

<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> Is the Minister saying that it is possible for a social security official to go directly to NCIS, or would the police have to funnel the application to NCIS?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> The DSS can go directly to NCIS and ask that body to apply for an interception warrant on its behalf. It does not necessarily need to go to a particular police force. That mechanism is contained in the Police Act 1997, which established NCIS.
<P>
The hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds discussed what would happen if benefit fraud involved serious crime but the police were not involved. He quoted the Home Secretary, although it was not clear whether my right hon. Friend's words were quoted from a Second Reading debate or another debate. When my right hon. Friend used the word ``most'', he was being cautious. Ministers have to be careful not to mislead in any way. I cannot envisage any circumstance in which serious benefit fraud occurred that did not involve the police in some capacity. I understand why the hon. Gentleman raised his point, but it lacked substance.
<P>
The amendment should not refer to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>a Permanent Under-Secretary of State in the Department of Social Security.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Rather, the legislation should refer to the Benefits Agency, the benefit fraud organisations, the Child Support Agency or any other appropriate body. The amendment is therefore technically deficient, although I do not say that by way of criticism. It appears to involve a sweep-up power against all benefit fraud and to employ the immensely powerful technique of interception, which could be used in relation to child support or the Benefits Agency. The amendment should be withdrawn on those grounds. The rapier-like advice of the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds should be taken by the Opposition Front Bench. The amendment should be treated as a probing amendment rather than one that they intend to press to a Division.
<P>
However, if the Opposition were to press the amendment to a Division, we would still believe that the way to deal with social security fraud—appalling as it is and wherever it takes place—is through the police agencies. That is the right way to proceed, because the great power that Parliament is giving to the security services to intercept communications has, under clause 5(3)(b), to be
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>for the purpose of . . . detecting serious crime.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The words ``serious crime'' that are the trigger for such tremendously forceful powers.
<P>
I hope that Opposition Members will consider withdrawing the amendment for three reasons. First, it is technically deficient. Secondly, it would create confusion about their intentions in relation to the Benefits Agency, the Child Support Agency and other agencies. Thirdly, the idea that an agency could investigate serious crime without involving the police is wrong in principle. That is the Government's position on amendment No. 15.
<P>
As for amendments Nos. 14 and 35, Government amendment (a) and Government amendment No. 71, the reason for clause 6(2)(k) is to make the Bill as future-proof as possible. I have not been dragged screaming to introduce the affirmative resolution. There is no way of knowing how Departments will merge, how new investigation bodies will be set up or how such investigation will be handled in five to 10 years' time. We believe that withdrawing the ability of the Secretary of State to add persons to the list would remove flexibility under the Bill.
<P>
For the first time, the Bill lists who may apply for an interception warrant. That was not specified in the Interception of Communications Act 1985, although the annual reports of the interception commissioner have made clear which agencies may apply. The intention behind the Bill is to specify the agencies involved, while maintaining the flexibility to add more organisations if that becomes necessary. No matter which organisations appear on the list—even if we double or treble the number of them—the Secretary of State will be the final arbiter of whether an interception warrant should be granted in a particular case. His duties to behave proportionately and in the other ways that we have outlined will remain, whichever organisations can apply for a warrant.
<P>
I accept the argument that was made on Second Reading that there should be more open and direct parliamentary debate about such matters. I said that we shall consider such matters seriously and, as a consequence of that, we believe that the affirmative procedure is an advance on the negative procedure that was in place previously. It will allow a more open situation. I want to confirm formally, as I did on Second Reading, that the Government have no intention of adding further names to the list. Interception is such an intrusive activity that it must be tightly controlled to retain public confidence in it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Beith:</B> Any fundamental change in the security and intelligence services would require primary legislation. It would not be possible, for example, to amalgamate two or three agencies without such legislation. The setting up of NCIS, although initially done without primary legislation, eventually required it. It is difficult to imagine the Minister being caught in the circumstances that he envisages where a new body, which has not been given the control of a statutory purpose, needs to be added to the list of organisations by ministerial order.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> I accept the force of the right hon. Gentleman's argument, which carries much weight. All the institutions have evolved by being bought on to a statutory basis and by the establishment of the parliamentary Committee of which the right hon. Gentleman is a member. There is much more openness about such matters. That is necessary and positive and is it why the Government stick to their position. I urge the Committee to reject the amendment, as we need flexibility to cover circumstances that we cannot envisage.
<P>
I was asked why Government amendment (a) is necessary. Amendment No. 35 is perfectly adequate to ensure that additions to the list of agencies can be made only by the affirmative resolution procedure, and we agree with that. However, there is no reason why an order to remove an agency should be subject to the same procedure. Amendment No. 35 would result in uncertainty about the procedure that applied to an order that removed an agency that had been added earlier. On the one hand, subsection (4), which relates to negative resolution power, would apply, but, on the other hand, so would the Interpretation Act 1978, which specifies that a revoking order is to be made in the same way as the original order—by affirmative resolution. That is why we have tabled Government amendment (a) and Government amendment No. 71, which is consequential.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The addition of an agency should require an affirmative order, but the removal of an agency should not, because the intrusion is less. The two actions do not have parity. We therefore hope that the Committee will reject amendment No. 16.
<P>
I hope that the hon. Member for Mid-Worcestershire will withdraw amendment No. 15. If he does not, I urge my hon. Friends to oppose it. Amendments Nos. 14 and 35, Government amendment (a) and Government amendment No. 71 are grouped. If the Opposition accept Government amendment (a) to amendment No. 35 and Government amendment No. 71, we shall support the proposition that amendment No. 35 as amended should be passed, but we would oppose amendment No. 14. Under amendment No. 16, an affirmative order would be required for removing agencies from the list, and we would resist that amendment, too. I hope that I have been clear in explaining the Government's position, and I hope that we can reach a decision.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I return to amendment No. 14, in support of which my right hon. Friend the Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed eloquently argued. A huge logical inconsistency runs through the Minister's arguments. In the friendly spirit of the Committee, I should point out that on the one hand the Minister argued that the powers were intrusive and could be serious and that therefore we must be careful whom we give them to, and that specifically in the case of the Benefits Agency, the National Criminal Intelligence Service must remain the appropriate statutory funnel for channelling requests. We entirely agree with that argument. On the other hand, however, he said that we should keep a back door open for the Secretary of State to apply for other agencies to be added without requiring primary legislation. There is no equivalence between the affirmative resolution procedure and introducing primary legislation. My right hon. Friend was entirely correct that new agencies would be given a statutory footing. Especially given the Minister's initial arguments about how serious the power is, that suggests that an agency that was to be made an intercepting agency and given that power would have to pass the threshold of being established on a statutory basis.
<P>
My right hon. Friend referred to the possibility of Governments with evil intent, which clearly worries those of us who approach the matter from a liberal perspective. I should have thought that the Minister's better instinct would have been to be equally worried about the possibility of providing powers in primary legislation that could be used inappropriately in future. We have already had a sign that, if the official Opposition were in power now, they would add organisations such as the Benefits Agency investigative branch to those that can secure intercepting warrants. At some dim and distant future date when the Conservative party returns to government—[Interruption.] I revert to the sort of fantasy world to which we referred earlier, with 007 and Blofeld. I can imagine a Conservative Prime Minister plotting a scheme to introduce other agencies. In allowing the clause to stand part but rejecting the amendment, the Minister would be giving such people the power to allow the head of the Benefits Agency investigative branch to apply for warrants under affirmative resolution, rather than requiring them to pass the much higher threshold of reconstituting statutorily the Benefits Agency investigative branch as an intercepting authority. We and, we hope, the Minister would feel more comfortable, given his earlier comments about how seriously he takes the power, with setting that threshold through primary legislation.
<P>
I am all for future-proofing legislation, and I do not like matters to have to be reconsidered unnecessarily, but future-proofing relates to technological advance and methods, not fundamental principles. We would breach a fundamental principle if we said that a body could be made an intercepting authority without giving it a statutory basis in primary legislation. The Minister is wrong on that point. Indeed, in some of his arguments he made a persuasive case for being wrong in not accepting the amendment.
<P>
I live in hope that he will decide that giving the Opposition the affirmative resolution procedure is not enough, and that he ought to be more tough with his departmental colleagues who would like the Secretary of State to have additional powers to save returning to the matter at a future date. I hope that he will stick to his line that the Government have no plans to add other bodies, accept that future Governments may wish to do so, and consider whether, by giving them that power he may at some future date have to resist a measure brought in through this dangerous subsection in the Bill.

<P>

<B>Mr. Heald:</B> The designations of the people who may apply for an interception warrant should be in the Bill. Amendment No. 14 would rightly exclude paragraph (k), which would give the Secretary of State a wide-ranging, unnecessary, mop-up power. After all, the Minister admits that there is no intention to add anyone else to the list. I hope that he will reflect on that. He may not. However, his concession on amendment No. 35 with its addition of paragraph (a) is good news.
<P>
It seems right to withdraw amendment No. 15 at this point, although, of course, this is a matter for my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Worcestershire. The reason is not that we do not think the principle is important, because we do. I spent two years going round the country meeting benefit fraud investigators, and every one of them was frustrated because to do their job properly they constantly had to involve other parties, as they did not have adequate powers themselves. We introduced the Social Security Administration (Fraud) Act 1997, which remedied a good deal of that problem. However, it is not a proper argument to say that we cannot let the benefit fraud investigation service do this because it does not have the technical capacity. Of course it does not, because it is not allowed to do this work. If a body such as Customs and Excise and every police force in Scotland can have the power, I do not understand why the elite force that should be out there seeking to end benefit fraud, which is the most serious crime that we face—[Interruption.] I am told that we do not have long to go, so come in No. 9. I leave it to my hon. Friend to do the formal part.
