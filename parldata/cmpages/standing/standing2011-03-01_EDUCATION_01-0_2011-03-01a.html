                           </strong> I have a few preliminary announcements. Members
may, if they wish, remove their jackets during Committee sittings. Will
all Members ensure that mobile phones, pagers and so on are turned off
or switched to silent mode during sittings? As a general rule, I and my
fellow Chair do not intend to call starred amendments that have not
been tabled with adequate notice. The required notice period in Public
Bill Committees is three working days; therefore, amendments should be
tabled by the rise of the House on Monday for consideration on
Thursday, and by the rise of the House on Thursday for consideration on
Tuesday. There is a money resolution in connection with the Bill, and
copies are available in the
room.<a class="bkMark" name="11030169000006">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Not
everyone is familiar with the process of taking oral evidence in Public
Bill Committees, so it might help if I briefly explain how we will
proceed. The Committee will first be asked to consider the programme
motion on the amendment paper, for which debate is limited to half an
hour. We will then proceed to a motion to report written evidence, and
then a motion to permit the Committee to deliberate in private in
advance of the oral evidence sessions. I hope that we can take that
formally. Assuming that the latter of those motions is agreed to, the
Committee will move into private session. Once the Committee has
deliberated, the witnesses and members of the public will be invited
back into the room and our oral evidence session will begin. If the
Committee agrees to the programme motion, it will hear oral evidence
this
morning.<a class="bkMark" name="11030169000007">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Welcome to the
Committee everybody, particularly Mr Walker, with whom I look forward
to working over the next month. I was grateful for the opportunity to
discuss the programme motion with Opposition members of the Committee
yesterday evening. It is a generous allocation of time in Committee for
a 79-clause Bill, and I look forward to the
detailed scrutiny of each clause. The programme motion proposes that
the Committee consider the Bill in the logical order in which it is
drafted. It also sets out the details of all the witnesses from whom we
will hear this
week.<a class="bkMark" name="11030169000009">&#160;</a>

this Bill Committee session. I wonder if each of you—because you
are all involved with the academies movement—might say something
about why the freedoms you have been given or have had in running an
academy are so important. Perhaps you can also say something about the
further removal of some of the bureaucratic impositions that have in
the past applied to schools and academies, such as the requirement to
have a SIP. What are your views about lifting those restrictions?
Perhaps we could start with Mr
Gibbons.<a class="bkMark" name="11030169000018">&#160;</a>

Gibbons:</strong>
                           </em> Obviously the warning about loquaciousness
means that my reputation goes before me. The academies I am responsible
for are a result of the closure of three underachieving schools, which
have been severely underachieving for I think 20 or 30 years.
Therefore, the role now is to move as quickly as possible in order to
ensure that those schools recover, improve and move on.<a class="bkMark" name="11030169000019">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I am slightly
puzzled by your question because I would think that the freedoms that
one has to operate within are very much in the minds of the school
leaders, too. Having run inner-city state schools and, indeed, an HMC
school, as well as academies, I do not think I have changed my approach
to sorting out the problems I

			Column number: 4<a class="bkMark" name="Column4">&#160;</a>
                           </div>have to deal with. The SIP question is different for academies because
our SIPs tend to be supplied by the DFE—and now by the
YPLA—rather than by local authorities. The SIP question is not
so much whether one has a SIP or not, but depends entirely on the
quality of that person and their ability to perceive the situation and
act
accordingly.<a class="bkMark" name="11030169000020">&#160;</a>

Sowter:</strong>
                           </em> From my perspective, having worked in a
number of inner-city schools on school improvement, I have always had
to work quite autonomously, think outside the box and push boundaries
to raise standards for children quickly because they do not have much
time to waste. In my experience, I have found that undue bureaucracy
can hold things back. For example, phonics is now well thought of as a
system for teaching children to read. I am a primary head, by the way.
In the early days, when I first introduced phonics to my young
children, I was told by local authority advisers that it was not
appropriate and it was not part of a strategy at that time. I had to
fight tooth and nail to implement a reading programme that I knew would
work for my children. That is just one
example.<a class="bkMark" name="11030169000021">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">In
terms of a SIP, if your school is outstanding—this is not
speaking from an arrogant point of view—I felt that it was a
complete waste of my time to be sitting down with a local authority
adviser or SIP five times a year to tick their boxes. I had much better
things to do. I knew where my school was and where it needed to go
next, and I did not need a SIP to come in to meet me five times a
year.<a class="bkMark" name="11030169000022">&#160;</a>

Moynihan:</strong>
                           </em> I look after a group of academies called
the Harris Federation, which is a group of nine academies in south
London. All those schools were failing, unpopular and seriously
underachieving before we took them on. It is the freedoms that
academies bring that have allowed us to transform them. Of nine failing
and unpopular schools, four are now outstanding, two are making
outstanding progress, one is good and two are making good progress.
What is different? Previously, the local authorities concerned had done
everything they could to turn those schools around. The things they had
done had not worked, while the freedoms that we had over pay
conditions, higher expectations, an expectation that performance will
be better, more rigorous performance management and flexibility in all
sorts of ways have allowed us to improve those schools
rapidly.<a class="bkMark" name="11030169000023">&#160;</a>

said—I will be brief on this—that as the academy school
belongs not to some bureaucracy or to Government but to itself, the
school will be in charge of its own destiny, and that immediately gives
it pride and purpose. That is the way it works. As a chain, we do not
need SIPs—we provide that expertise ourselves—and we
found them to be a bureaucratic
encumbrance.<a class="bkMark" name="11030169000024">&#160;</a>

welcome the deregulatory thrust. Many of the early academies were
transformational academies and were in difficult realities and

particularly the impact of sponsors, were important in making the
movements that the academies have made. Any reduction

way to go

said in your views on the Bill that you had some concerns about
arranging suitable alternative provision for permanently excluded

explain your concerns to the Committee?<a class="bkMark" name="11030169000042">&#160;</a>

Sowter:</strong>
                           </em> If a head teacher takes the very serious
decision permanently to exclude a pupil, there would be a great deal of
pressure on that head to find alternative provision for the child they
decided to exclude. I therefore feel that one’s hands could be
tied, in terms of doing the best thing for that child. Exclusion is an
absolute last resort, but it is also a way of managing to get that
child the specialist provision that they may need. If your hands are
tied in terms of trying to find alternative provision for a child, that
child may not get access to the services that they need. We have yet to
see how this will work out. I understand that there will be some
national pilots. I could see a positive situation where schools
collaborate to commission specialist provision for children who may
have to be excluded. I feel that could work, but if schools are working
on their own and looking for specialist support, that would not work
for that school or those children.<a class="bkMark" name="11030169000043">&#160;</a>

hardly worth saying: it is good teaching. If you design your curriculum
appropriately, if you have your teachers on the ball and able to engage
the young people, if you benefit from one of the things that I benefit
from—it is a new building, which is a privilege; it is
beautifully designed and almost allows many children to be
self-policing, because it is so open and there are no little corridors
or back passages for there to be trouble unseen by the staff—all
of those things contribute. But you start with the mission of the
school, in terms of its teaching and learning, the quality of its
teachers and the quality of its interaction. That is your starting
point. You need other sanctions, and you need to be able to act when
things do not work, but that is where you begin.<a class="bkMark" name="11030169000061">&#160;</a>

expectations not only for children’s learning, but for
behaviour, including the behaviour of adults towards children. All
children should know exactly where they stand, as should parents, and
within that, there should be a caring ethos that comes through as a

you can set very high aspirations, standards and expectations. It is
about values, expectations and aspirations, and following that up with
clarity and toughness, so that you say what you mean and you do what
you say. That sets up the ability for teachers to teach. Provided that
the teaching is good, the structure is good and that you care about
youngsters as individuals and involve them in the development of good
discipline, most children want to come to school to learn to do well.

                           </span> I have a couple of general
questions about academies. The original legislation about academies was
brought in by the previous Government. Do you see the Bill as a natural
continuation of that, or is it a radical departure? Secondly, what is
of most concern to parents is having a great teacher teaching their
child. Will you tell us about your experience of academies and whether
they have had an impact on enabling teachers to achieve their full
potential?<a class="bkMark" name="11030169000064">&#160;</a>

                           </em> Certainly, I see it as a continuation of
the previous Government’s policy. The idea is to free schools
from bureaucracy, and to give leadership the chance to make decisions
and be accountable for them, and to not be part of group-think where a
local authority area suggests that only certain standards are possible.
If failing schools have previously had such freedoms and have done well
with them and improved, it seems logical to me that other schools
should have the same freedoms and be able to benefit from them. It
seems, therefore, to be a sensible extension of a successful
policy.<a class="bkMark" name="11030169000065">&#160;</a>

                           </em> I would agree entirely. It seems a logical
development, taking things forward in a transformational way. It is
about good teachers being able to teach and get on with the job, and it
is about putting structures in place that allow that to happen, so that
teachers can take a traditional or creative approach, providing that
the structures are put in place by the academies. I think, therefore,
that this is very much an organic development moving on.<a class="bkMark" name="11030169000066">&#160;</a>

Sowter:</strong>
                           </em> I would agree with that. As I said earlier, I
was continuously disappointed in the past when primary schools were not
allowed to become academies. I was very vocal about that, so I am
pleased now that we are part of the academy initiative.<a class="bkMark" name="11030169000067">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">In terms of
teaching, I do not think that becoming an academy has improved the
teaching in my school, because I have always put a very strong emphasis
on teaching, and I am pleased to see that that has a very high profile
in the White Paper. These are early days for us yet, as we only became
an academy on 1 September 2010, but what it has done is allowed us to
look really flexibly at what our teachers also feel will work. There
is, for example, a system at the moment called PPA—planning,
preparation and assessment—which is where teachers have two
hours a week, negotiated through the union, out of class. It is very
difficult in a school such as mine, which is a very large primary
school. I ask teachers, “Would you prefer to have a bit extra in
your pay packet and forgo the PPA, or would you like to keep the
PPA?” Unanimously, they said that they would love to get rid of
PPA. They thought it was disruptive. They had to pick up the pieces
when they got back to their classroom if there was a cover teacher, and
they said yes, they would love to have a bit extra in their pay
packets. That is the sort of thing that I am now able to do in an
academy, which I was not able to do in the
past.<a class="bkMark" name="11030169000068">&#160;</a>

say that teaching and learning has improved in traditional
academies—the transformational ones that were in schools in very
challenging circumstances—aided by things such as the
development of the graduate teacher programme, but particularly by
Teach First and the Teach First stable of options for leadership
development.<a class="bkMark" name="11030169000069">&#160;</a>

number of heads say—this is my experience as well—that
when they are part of a local authority and dealing with teachers who
are not competent, you get very risk-averse human resource departments
in local authorities, whose main criterion is to avoid risk rather than
do what is necessary in many cases for youngsters. One of the
advantages of being your own employer as an academy is that you can
seek advice from elsewhere, and you are free to behave in a way that
people would in the real world outside. That is a significant way of
improving the quality of
teaching.<a class="bkMark" name="11030169000070">&#160;</a>

First, is not current provision perfectly adequate? There is a wide
variety of choice—school sixth forms, sixth-form colleges and
general and specialist further education. What happens, in terms of the
threat to existing providers, if new entrants come in, or is that

                           </div>a secondary irrelevance? In broader terms, do you think 16-to-19
provision is inadequate at the moment, and that that is why the
provisions in the Bill are
essential?<a class="bkMark" name="11030169000071">&#160;</a>

Moynihan:</strong>
                           </em> I can give you an example. We have opened a
number of academies in Croydon and Merton in south-east London, which
has one of the lowest post-16 staying-on rates in the country. When we
attempted to make the schools that we took on 11-to-18 instead of
11-to-16, we were opposed by everybody. Councils and learning and
skills councils opposed us. They all said that it was not part of their
strategic plan to have school sixth forms.<a class="bkMark" name="11030169000072">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Four years
later, in that area, we now have 1,000 sixth formers—thankfully,
Government supported us, operating as one centre. Nothing else has
changed locally. There are no other new providers. The plan delivered
absolutely nothing. Having the freedom to open new provision where
perhaps there is a need that has not previously been met seems to be a
good one. That is a practical example of a
situation.<a class="bkMark" name="11030169000073">&#160;</a>

Gibbons:</strong>
                           </em> This is quite a hard question, because you
probably need to relate it to the intention of the previous Government
and this Government to have people remaining in education or training
until the age of 18. It means there is a bigger market than there was
for 16-to-19 provision, because there is no escape. I have worked in an
area that traditionally had a “high employment but low
wage” structure, so people could do stuff at the age of 16, but
it did not really carry any sort of lifelong commitment to improvement.
There is a need for 16-to-19 to become an even more dynamic sector of
the market for
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11030169000074">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
also think that, if we are to reach people whom we have not reached
before, we need a variety of provision in a way that we have not had
before. To return to my very early answer about bringing in business
and the local college to be part of the design of each section of our
16-to-19 part of the academies, that has made a huge difference. In our
area of operation—a much smaller area of operation than
Dan’s—we have moved post-16 numbers from about 150
between our two academies to 405 for next year. Those youngsters would
not have gone anywhere else. The other thing that we are experimenting
with, which we have found very exciting, is that we have been liaising
with local Connexions, careers people and colleges to try to design a
course to bring NEETs back into the system. We have designed a six-week
course for NEET students, so that they can get back into readiness to
learn. That sort of flexibility seems to be the sort of creative
thinking we will need if we are to make a reality of
16-to-19.<a class="bkMark" name="11030169000075">&#160;</a>

very poor retention rates at post-16, and we took over a number of
schools where children would just not travel and therefore became NEET.
I think it is very important that as academies are formed, they have
the ability to develop sixth-form provision, and that that is looked
after with a wider plan.<a class="bkMark" name="11030169000076">&#160;</a>

about weaknesses to address within the system. I do not think it is
particularly a question of weaknesses to address within the system; it
is that the transformational freedoms for academies can be applied to
post-16 providers, and I would see that as a positive thing, providing
that it is seen within a strategic overview of the current
provision.<a class="bkMark" name="11030169000077">&#160;</a>

                           </em> We have taken on a school where most
children are refugees and do not speak English, and we have been able
to vary the curriculum and provide many hours of literacy in the early
years of secondary school, to bring people up to speed. That has had a
significant impact. I can think of one particular school—Harris
academy Bermondsey, in a very disadvantaged area. It quickly went to
outstanding, within three years. Harris South Norwood did similarly,
because we used freedom in the curriculum to focus on the basics, so
that every youngster could access every subject. That has been very
important. In our sixth form, we have a range of 25 A-levels and the
international baccalaureate. Large numbers of students who were the
first generation of their family to go to university are now
progressing, so in terms of vigorous standards at the top end, we have
been good.<a class="bkMark" name="11030169000080">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We have been
good at using the freedoms—as most academies are, I
think—to vary teachers’ hours, so after school there are
lots of extra classes in different subjects. In our extra-curricular
offer we aspire to match the independent sector, because that is one of
the real strengths it has. We offer Saturday morning clubs. In every
school holiday there are teachers at work delivering extra classes. In
terms of standards, the hours worked are a lot longer and the outcomes
are
rising.<a class="bkMark" name="11030169000081">&#160;</a>

very much on basic core education, getting English and maths right,
good quality teaching and learning throughout, and focusing on the
core. Other academies have been much more creative and looked at a
competency-based curriculum, or other solutions that suited their
particular needs. What I am saying is that the academies have been able
to focus on their community needs to achieve what they want to
achieve.<a class="bkMark" name="11030169000082">&#160;</a>

things that we and many academies do is teach longer hours and make, as
Dan does, an offer to our children of lots of clubs, lots of
enrichment, and lots of opportunities and trips. Once the culture and

children desperately want to learn and do well. Being able to say that

right buttons to get the right jobs done with those children, we want
the children off the register. In my academies, we reduce the number of
children on the special needs register, if it is appropriate for the
individual child. I hope that all academies adhere to the regulations
and to the spirit of what we do, which is about addressing some of the
difficulties in education for some of the most difficult and deprived
youngsters in the

to the code, so if the local authority names an academy, that academy

our aims is to drive up aspiration in our area, and there are many ways
of involving local communities in your institution in a way that will
eventually spill over into improved education. So we are using some of
the energy and contacts of our sponsors to find ways of bringing
additional facilities to our sites, so that the community feels that
not just an education is being offered but a whole way of life, in
terms of transforming family life chances. We are in very close
negotiations with the local medical people about building a new
surgery, health and well-being centre in the grounds of one of our
academies. We have made an application to Sport England to develop a
sports village.<a class="bkMark" name="11030169000096">&#160;</a>

that speak for itself, but in the medium term it is important that our

for their benefit. I felt uneasy during some of the questioning about

has been very much the case that many predecessor schools that changed
to academies had been struggling for quite a long time. The act of
becoming an academy means that one school ceases to exist and another
begins. That act of redefining the culture and the climate makes that
big impact, rather than a new head in an existing culture. I think that
is more difficult. It is the complete break and the new start that
seems to be one of the key transformational

question implies that interested and interesting leaders are attracted
to the academy structure and therefore you have good leaders and new
freedoms. Those freedoms could be used in other schools in other
circumstances. But I have found two things that are very different. One
is what has just been said: the idea of the original institution
closing and reopening with a fresh start and a new name has been hugely
symbolic in local communities. The other thing is that things can be
done more quickly because the chain of command between spotting the
need and making it happen with the resources that you have is just that

becoming an academy. My school was in special measures 10 years ago and
it became outstanding, but we were not an academy. I agree with you. I
still had the same view about running a school that I have now. The
difference between schools is that I have never had a dependency on any
other authority that I would rely on to support my school because I
knew that would not work. It is about school leaders and schools
themselves taking the responsibility. School improvement needs to
happen from within. It happens in lots of cases but in others it does
not. But there is this false sense of dependency, if you like, that
there is some power around you that will support and protect you. That

family and a group of sister schools. It would be our view that our
academies need to be part of that family, but an independent part of
that family. So we engage
fully.<a class="bkMark" name="11030169000115">&#160;</a>

where we have worked closely with local authorities that have been very
forward thinking. They have had schools that they have not been able to
turn around or do anything with, and they have been very proactive in
bringing in providers like us and running competitions so that somebody
else could take these schools and work with them. So we have done that
quite well. I can certainly think of one local authority where our
principal chairs the hard-to-place protocol, and we give a great deal
in that local authority. So we have some good examples of where we work
with local authorities. In terms of where they add value, though, it is
harder for me to give an answer.<a class="bkMark" name="11030169000122">&#160;</a>

commissioning role, where they act clearly in the best interests of
young people and where, when new places need to be commissioned because
existing places are not good enough or there is no adequate supply,
they act very proactively. I see too many examples of situations where
places that are just good enough or barely good enough are defended
when alternatives are available. There is a reluctance among local
authorities to have competition with their own provision. Local
authorities need to see themselves no longer as the providers, but as
the commissioners and the people who make things happen.<a class="bkMark" name="11030169000130">&#160;</a>

quite a lot on the role of local authorities with academies. I would
like you to shed some light on the role of parents. First, how critical

are trying to square in this debate. We have moved from parents being
slightly distant about schooling in general to being avid supporters of
what we do. When we opened as academies our attendance at parents
evenings, which is a rough indicator of interest, was less than 30%,
especially with the older years. Now we are achieving 90% regularly,
and on one occasion with year 11 we had 100% of parents attend a
particular open evening. It seems to me that that willingness to walk
through the door and be part of what we are doing is a transformation
for us. When we showed the plans for our new building, which will open
in August, to our parental community two years ago, they said it looked

			Column number: 18<a class="bkMark" name="Column18">&#160;</a>
                           </div>very nice but “It won’t happen, will it, because we never
get anything in this area?” There was a feeling that promises
had been made over time and they had not been kept. The idea that we
are now providing those buildings, and the idea that those
parents’ evenings show a huge increase in attendance, is very
good for us.<a class="bkMark" name="11030169000136">&#160;</a>

not yet have is a relationship with our parents that makes them
understand how they can best support their children. They want things
to be good for their kids, but they do not quite yet know how to do
that with us in terms of education. That is the next phase for us.
Making parents be part of our school community, when they saw the
previous failing schools as not being part of anyone’s

of deprivation in Edmonton, north London, and as I have said it was in
special measures and was very undersubscribed and we could not fill
places. I knew that the answer was to raise standards and to make that
school a happy, safe place where children wanted to be. The buildings
are very old, and they still are; because we were a converter academy
we did not have new build. The school improved quite rapidly and I
gained the trust of the local community, so they have been right behind
me. We have had 300 applicants this year for our reception class and

support, challenge and replace failing schools, parents who had had a
bad experience in education, or who were ill-informed or ill-led, were
very anti those academies as they went in. That tended to make the
newspapers, but actually if you were to go into some of the communities
now that many academies serve in this country and say, “We are
taking your academy away from you,” there would be a riot. I can
think of an example of one of our schools in Doncaster, which was very
strongly opposed prior to its opening. Within six months of it opening
the aspirations of parents were beginning to change. The parents could
see a future for themselves, their community, their village and their
children. We are still involved in the process of developing and
involving the parents in the learning. If you were now to go to that
village and say “This academy is going to close,” there
would be a huge riot. Parental support is strongly behind the academies
that are open. That can be seen in the number of people who apply for
places. Very many academies are oversubscribed. The second point would
be that many academies manage to change the aspirations of parents and
the community as well as the children
involved.<a class="bkMark" name="11030169000140">&#160;</a>

of it through this Bill, is to reduce the bureaucratic burden on
teachers. We are taking that seriously and there is a huge amount of
work going on in the Department to streamline and simplify reams of
guidance. Clause 18 abolishes the School Support Staff Negotiating
Body. Clause 7 abolishes the GTCE. Clause 6 removes the statutory duty
to enter into a behaviour and attendance partnership. Clause 50
abolishes the requirement for an academy to have specialist status. Can
the witnesses comment on some of those reducing bureaucracy
clauses?<a class="bkMark" name="11030169000144">&#160;</a>

Moynihan:</strong>
                           </em> May I start with specialist status?
Specialist status has been a really important feature in the
improvement of many schools, but that is because it has allowed them to
define their own ethos and identity. It has not been having the
specialism per se; it has been because it has allowed them to
differentiate themselves and build an ethos. Academies as independent
schools is a mechanism for providing that certain ethos. I do not think
that losing that specialism will have an effect. An academy can choose
to have a specialism in the new world if it wishes to. It can change
that specialism over time, as is appropriate. Under the old system,
once you had a specialism, it was a hugely bureaucratic process to get
it changed. I do not think anything would be lost through this
change.<a class="bkMark" name="11030169000145">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">On behaviour
and attendance partnerships, most schools work with other schools to
improve behaviour. It is much better if schools can determine whom they
work with, rather than having a local authority dictate it for them.
Some of our schools are near each other, but in different local
authorities. Under our funding agreement, we have not been able to work
with each
other.<a class="bkMark" name="11030169000146">&#160;</a>

                           </em> In terms of specialism, I would agree
entirely with Dan. On partnerships, it is important that if you enter
into a partnership, you enter into it willingly. If you go willingly
into a partnership, you are likely to make that partnership work. Very
many academies are happy to be involved—as you have heard from
the witnesses—in lots of partnership activity, but we applaud
the fact that it is non-bureaucratic. We accept the Government’s
decision to abolish the GTC. Our only concern is that we have accurate,
up-to-date data on people who should not be working with children and
that that would go back to the Department as it did with the GTC. On
support staff, academies deploy a new support staff, as we heard from
Patricia, in a wide variety of ways. We want the best terms and
conditions, because we want the best people to work for us, so we would
welcome the flexibility that that deregulation would
bring.<a class="bkMark" name="11030169000147">&#160;</a>

but we would like to see protection from those allegations to be
extended if possible to people who have left the school from pupils who
have left the school. We would also like it to be extended to

going out. It is an important message. In many ways, the message that

more important than any legislation that the Government introduce. That

the searches are very welcome and necessary. We simply do not believe
that that will be abused or that it is going too far. There are many
examples where this sort of additional opportunity to be able to search
things is a last resort. But, occasionally, when a child refuses to
co-operate and something needs to be dealt with urgently, you need
those powers in order to be able to do things. For example, if somebody
is using malicious

                           </div>text messages, you need to search a phone to find out about that. If the
child is refusing to co-operate or the child is making arrangements to
bring an illegal substance into the school, that is something a school
needs to be able to clamp down on straight away. We
would only use it as a last resort, and our advice to members would
absolutely be to use it under very, very clearly controlled
circumstances. That needs to be emphasised.<a class="bkMark" name="11030169000169">&#160;</a>

Lightman:</strong>
                           </em> One of the characteristics of the Bill is
that it gives a lot of new powers to the Secretary of State. There is a
worry that there is not an element of independence or distance, which
needs to be maintained in relation to some of those things. As for
specific examples of the effect of centralisation, if you take the
example of teachers who are dismissed and the fact that governing
bodies are required to consider referring that to the Secretary of
State, “considering” is not strong enough if someone has
been dismissed for misconduct. If you are referring directly to the
Secretary of State—it is so centralised in that way—we
fear that there could be a deterrent factor. Governing bodies might
think, “Do we really want to go that far at this stage?”
In the interests of parents, whom you mentioned, that might be
disadvantageous, because obviously, if a teacher has been dismissed for
misconduct, we would want to make sure that that is properly dealt with
so that there are not teachers like that in our work
force.<a class="bkMark" name="11030169000172">&#160;</a>

that new schools would be academies within a local area. The measures
proposed in the Bill mean that, even if a local community very much
wanted a particular type of community school, it is possible for the
Secretary of State to have determined what sort of school they would
get and who will win the competition for the academy status, in
contradiction to the wishes of the local community. That is another

service on which they can rely and must therefore depend on school
transport. Many parents will have access to e-mail or at least to a
mobile phone, so an e-mail or a text could be sent. I should like your

absolutely right that, in the majority of cases, you would give
information to parents. You would tell them in advance. In fact, our
advice would always be to tell parents in advance about a detention.
The problem has been that one of the messages of a law which requires
these things to happen is what the Secretary of State has referred to
quite frequently as the “I know my rights” culture:
“You can’t keep me in detention because you
haven’t given me 24 hours’ notice.” This is what
we have to get away
from.<a class="bkMark" name="11030169000176">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
message that this is giving is that schools maintain discipline and, if
a child misbehaves and the school decides to put that child in
detention, it has the right to do so. Our advice would always be to
inform parents, and certainly we would be very wary of keeping a child
in on a winter night or anything like that. People just would not do
that, but at the same time the message is that the school maintains
discipline. Schools will send a text message or something like that,
but it is a question of freeing things up. That is the point on
detentions.<a class="bkMark" name="11030169000177">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Searches
of this kind are against the child’s will, because often a child
would agree to show you the contents of their phone if you were
investigating something. Such a search would only be carried out in my
view by a member of the very senior staff in the school, the leadership
team of a school. At any school that I was head of, I would not want my
staff to be searching mobile phones or children. Given precisely all
the sorts of risks you have highlighted—certainly a special
needs child—that would be a ridiculous way of dealing with
things. We are talking about an extreme case that would have to be
dealt with by senior staff under very controlled circumstances. Those
staff will of course have undergone training in how to deal with such
things, and by the nature of their roles they will have had training in
how to deal with autistic children and so
on.<a class="bkMark" name="11030169000178">&#160;</a>

Having another adult present is one thing, but I do not think we would

these things are wrong. They have a very clear sense of right and

extreme situations, and in fact, particularly with detention, I imagine
that very few schools would issue a detention without notice. There is
no real harm in giving someone a power they choose not to use. The
difficulty is when you claim dramatic effects from a power that people

goes through a lot of what we are talking about in education policy at
the moment: whether you need to legislate for everything, or whether
you rely on professionals to have a common-sense approach to such
things. As I have said, I have been a head for 15 years. I cannot
imagine a situation where I would sanction any of my staff searching a
member of the opposite sex without a witness present. In fact, I
wouldn’t allow anyone to search a member of the opposite sex,

                           </strong> Good morning. This is just a little bit of an
unhappy St. David’s day for you. On exclusions, what do you
think about where the Bill seeks to strike the balance between the need
to look at the issues of discipline that you have talked about, and the
rights of children—I wanted to avoid the term “rights of
children”, but we must acknowledge that—particularly with
regard to the concerns that have been raised in evidence submissions
for children with special educational needs, such as
autism?<a class="bkMark" name="11030169000196">&#160;</a>

                           </em> It is right that exclusion should be a last
resort, and it should be made as difficult as possible. It is also
right that children should not be reinstated after their head teacher
has made a decision to exclude someone. Financial sanctions attach when
it is considered to have been wrong, and we must bear it in mind that
by fining a school, you are not fining the head teacher; you are fining
the other students in the school. You may ask the school to pick up the
cost of the excluded student, but if you are applying an additional
financial sanction to that, you are taking away from the other students
in the school, so I do not think that that is
appropriate.<a class="bkMark" name="11030169000197">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
also think that although it is not entirely clear in the Bill, if this
is a first step towards holding schools accountable for the funding and
outcomes of students who have been excluded, it would be inappropriate
to do that without schools also having control over the alternative
provision for those students. Many years down the line, you could find
yourself accountable for the performance of a student you excluded
several years ago. The alternative provision could change. You may have
no control over the quality of alternative provision in your area. That
would seem to be holding people accountable for things they have no
control over. That would be a
concern.<a class="bkMark" name="11030169000198">&#160;</a>

                           </em> I agree with all of that. Exclusions are a
last resort. There is always a tension in relation to the need to
exclude. We need to put this in perspective. We hear lots of things
about multiple fixed-term exclusions. Permanent exclusions, which is
what we are talking about here, are a very rare thing. However, they
have to happen, and we must not have any deterrents that prevent
schools from excluding in those cases, because as a parent, I and, I am
sure, you would want your child to be protected from having people in
school who are so
disruptive.<a class="bkMark" name="11030169000199">&#160;</a>

am very concerned about the idea of schools being held accountable for
pupils whom they have excluded, because many of those pupils are

can.<a class="bkMark" name="11030169000200">&#160;</a>

final point is that what needs to go on the other side of all this
legislation about exclusions is doing something about the preventive
work to support students who are at risk of exclusion long before they
get anywhere near needing to be excluded. In my years of headship, I
viewed exclusion every time as a failure. Luckily, I had very few of
them, but when I had to do it, it was a failure, because everything
else we had tried to do to prevent that student from being excluded had
failed. I think that is what the vast majority of school leaders would
believe.<a class="bkMark" name="11030169000201">&#160;</a>

                           </em> There are no positives at all to getting
rid of the support staff negotiating body. Support staff are incredibly
important in our schools. The development we have had in the number of
support staff and the roles they are able to carry out in schools has
been a major factor in the success of our schools system. Sometimes
there is not enough emphasis on that success. Those people have brought
about many improvements. Their roles are very different from people who
perhaps have slightly similar titles but work in local authorities in
other ways. They have very different jobs and at the moment they have
no national pay and conditions, very few protections and very little
clarity about their working conditions, so I do not think there are any
positives about removing
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11030169000203">&#160;</a>

time for students to have access to high-quality careers guidance. We
have a number of concerns, which we have expressed in our written
evidence, about this part of the Bill, because we think a proper
programme of careers education and guidance is absolutely essential for
a school. We need that to be underpinned and supported by this new
all-age service, which needs to be put in place quickly, and with
clarity and information to school leaders about what it will
entail.<a class="bkMark" name="11030169000207">&#160;</a>

on the destinations of students coming from a school is very
interesting information. I think every school should know all about it.
If we are heading towards a point in time when you will create a league
table or hold schools accountable for the career destinations of
students, it would be a negative step. For how many different things,
including the aspirations of families and the health of the local
economy, will head teachers be responsible? Although we should know
about it and have high ideals, the information should be used to help
schools to evaluate themselves rather than to hold them
accountable.<a class="bkMark" name="11030169000208">&#160;</a>

essential. It is a major problem at the moment.
Sometimes the best applicants for jobs in schools in subjects that, by
way of example, perhaps have more of a vocational bias are FE trained.
They have QTLS rather than QTS, and are not allowed to work in schools.
Conversely, qualified teachers can work in colleges. We think that that
is a major anomaly. It does not mean that they will work in schools,
but at least they can apply for a job and be considered. If they are
the best candidate, they can be appointed. We very much hope that that
will be addressed very soon so that we can appoint the best people to
work in our schools. That is a management decision within the school

                           </em> I get the argument that requiring someone to
collaborate does not work in that sense because you get the body but
not the spirit. Some reasons why pupils with special needs and other
additional needs in schools have a higher rate of exclusion is that the
schools do not have the resources, skills or the access to specialist
support to give those students what they need. If we want to minimise
the rate of exclusions but also ensure that they are used in as
sensible a way as possible, it should be beholden upon groups of
schools to work together both to offer other placements to
schools—pupils are not always going to alternative provision but
often going to another school—and to ensure that every school
contributes equally to that. We should hold all of those schools
accountable for the outcomes of students rather than one school. If we
can get jointly accountable local collaboratives with some influence,
which could set up alternative provision and steer and control it to
suit their needs, it would be a step forward. In many ways, we need to
go beyond where attendance and behaviour partnerships were, rather than
step back from them.<a class="bkMark" name="11030169000212">&#160;</a>

have had quite consistently across the country from members is that
behaviour partnerships were a very good thing. They have enabled
schools to do a great deal of very effective proactive work. Lots of
our members will want to continue with those things but, clearly, there
is an issue of funding, which needs to be available. The other thing is
that every area needs to have high-quality pupil referral unit
provision, and that is not the case. It is very patchy. The other major
problem, which we hope the Green Paper will deal with in some way, is
access to specialist provision. Many of these children really
desperately need specialist provision, for example child and adolescent
mental health services, and access to that is woefully inadequate, as
has been well documented elsewhere.<a class="bkMark" name="11030169000213">&#160;</a>

provision to allow academies to have different arrangements for
exclusion if the Secretary of State should nominate that. I do not

                           </em> I will start on the role of the local
authority. We warmly welcomed the definition of the local
authority’s role in the White Paper as being a champion for
parents and families, promoting a good supply of strong schools,
supporting vulnerable children and championing educational excellence.
It is a measure of our disappointment that thus far in the Bill we
cannot see some of those roles being writ large in the legislation. We
strongly believe that those are the right roles for a local authority.
We believe that the local authority will make the transition from being
a provider to more of a commissioner. If it is to be a true and proper
commissioner in terms of an upholder of standards as well as of supply,
we would argue that some of the levers that we require, in relation to
commissioning strong school improvement, to intervening when schools
are not quite at the point of failure but heading towards decline, and
to having a coherent and community-and-parent-friendly admissions
picture across an area, some of the clauses in the Bill are unhelpful
and some are missing. We strongly support the role as it is outlined in
the White Paper, we just have a sense of disappointment that the Bill
has not really provided the levers that are necessary to deliver on
that
vision.<a class="bkMark" name="11030169000231">&#160;</a>

should have anything much to fear from this Bill or from the White
Paper. Local authorities have not been running schools for many years.
In my own local authority area on Isle of Wight, we are set to become,
from this autumn, the first area to be an entirely commissioned
secondary model. All our schools will be academies or trust schools,
which we very much welcome. We will be holding all of those schools,
including the academies, to account through our scrutiny process. We
feel that that strengthens our role in looking at the standards,
securing sufficient high quality places and making sure that what we
are accountable to the public for through the ballot box is
addressed.<a class="bkMark" name="11030169000232">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The strong
and strategic role of the local authority, as the Secretary of State
has described it, is something that we and many other local authorities
are keen to fulfil.

			Column number: 30<a class="bkMark" name="Column30">&#160;</a>
                           </div>There are some areas of clarity, such as the proposed new funding
arrangements, changing the Young People’s Learning Agency to the
Education Funding Agency. We are not keen to see the creation of
another quango. Instead, we should like that money to come directly to
local authorities in a similar set-up to the dedicated schools grant.
We should also like to explore whether the local authority can provide
the oversight of the post-16 education funding arrangements as well.
Let me be clear though, that is not with a view to us actually
controlling or running the schools or the post-FE education, it is
about us ensuring sufficient high quality places and value for money in
terms of how the money is distributed. The role of the schools forum
could perhaps be extended to look at that as well as to ensure that the
local authority has oversight of that particular area. We have a
particularly defined area on Isle of Wight because we do not border any
other local authorities. We can look at the provision as a whole and at
what is needed in mainstream education and in SEN and ensure that there
are sufficient places for pupils with those needs as well. The overall
direction is welcome and the strategic role for the local authority is
one which our local authority and many others want to
fulfil.<a class="bkMark" name="11030169000233">&#160;</a>

systems. The problem with the current performance management system in
schools is that it is over wieldy and, as a result, it has created an
obstacle to managing performance of teachers in schools rather than
something that has helped heads to do it. There is a very good study,
which I would recommend anyone with time to read, that was done by the
Manchester School of Management in 2002. Heads of maintained schools
are interviewed. One union leader said:<a class="bkMark" name="11030169000234">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“Heads
are very reluctant to go down the capability route because it is so

                        </p>
                        <p>Managing
teachers, therefore, becomes difficult. There is a tendency to give
them easier classes, sweep things under the carpet and hope things get
better. That is a problem of the current system.<a class="bkMark" name="11030169000235">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">As for some
of the current statistics, the University of Manchester Institute of
Science and Technology discovered that in one academic teaching year,
only 1.2% of teachers in maintained schools had any form of action or
discussion about their performance with their head teacher. One finding
of the study suggested that that was because heads did not want to deal
with the procedure. Indeed, two thirds of maintained heads surveyed by
UMIST said that they had never handled a performance case through a
capability procedure. One good idea in the Bill is that of simplifying
the performance management and capability procedures to reduce their
length and bring them more in line with the ACAS code of practice. A
good ACAS code of practice was introduced in 2009. It has gone down
very well with the rest of employers and employees in the country, and
I do not think that the school sector should necessarily set itself
additional obstacles to those by which all other employers are
bound.<a class="bkMark" name="11030169000236">&#160;</a>

been needed is where schools are particularly reluctant to engage and
can sometimes limit the opportunities of youngsters in that school in a
way that they perhaps do not understand or accept. To give an example,
a local area might decide to highlight the role of young carers within
its children and young people’s plan and trust arrangements.
Young carers are often a hidden group within schools, and in the
absence of any mechanism to require schools to focus on that, there
could be a real mismatch between schools and authorities. Some will be
good at addressing those needs, while others will be completely blind
to them. It is a question of the family of schools and the local
community working together to try and address issues that are of common
importance and priority.<a class="bkMark" name="11030169000241">&#160;</a>

for David Smellie. I notice from your biography that as well as
advising schools on employment related matters, you are also an
employment lawyer for staff and pupil disciplinary matters. The Bill
introduces some interesting new powers for teachers such as the
searching of pupils, and the confiscation of various items of
contraband, including mobile phones, and the right to look at and
delete the contents of those mobile devices. As a lawyer, could you
give some sort of feel as to whether you think you will be making money
out of cases arising from these clauses?<a class="bkMark" name="11030169000242">&#160;</a>

to Councillor Pugh and Matt. The first is about careers and Connexions.
In the light of budget pressures in the local government sector at the
moment, presumably local authorities are laying off Connexions staff.
Given the delay between where we are now—we could be four weeks
away from redundancies—and Royal Assent to the Bill and the
establishment of the all-age careers service, do you think that there
is a risk that we will not be able to get the infrastructure and
professional expertise with respect to careers that the Bill
wants?<a class="bkMark" name="11030169000246">&#160;</a>

                           </em> I see this as an opportunity for local
authorities to take a refreshed approach to careers advice. For too
long, we have relied on schools to provide much of that advice.
Notwithstanding the fact that we have had the Connexions service, too
many pupils have focused on getting that advice from schools, where it
has often been weighted towards staying in school or doing something
where money follows the learner if the pupil decides to stay
there.<a class="bkMark" name="11030169000247">&#160;</a>

authorities, including ours, are looking to use the opportunity of the
change, albeit within a tightened financial envelope, to provide a
different type of service that draws skills from the schools but
integrates them with other council services to provide the advice and
expertise that young people need. Much of that is still developing, but
I do not see it as a barrier to legislation of this nature coming
forward. Connexions is quite separate from the Bill, but it is
something that all local authorities are having to look
at.<a class="bkMark" name="11030169000248">&#160;</a>

raising the participation age, which is important but often overlooked.
The Government have pledged to continue raising the participation age,
but as part of the Bill, it is watered down immensely. Again, local
authorities have other budgetary and strategic pressures. This is not
important to you now, is it? That essentially means that raising the
participation age in 2013 and 2015 will not happen. Is that a correct,
fair and honest assessment?<a class="bkMark" name="11030169000251">&#160;</a>

that we welcome is the Government’s commitment to moving away

be a good range, and we are certainly pressing ahead in our area with
some more vocational diplomas; we are working with local businesses and
bringing those opportunities forward for local young people. I do not
see anything being a barrier to that taking place. Yes, there are the
wider debates around EMA and what will be put in its place, but we are
not seeing evidence of young people pulling back from participating and
continuing to receive a broader range of education opportunities than

requirement to appoint an LEA governor to the governing body of a
maintained school. We believe that it is a vital link, but there is
also a role for local authorities to provide better clarity on what the
LEA governor should do as a member of that governing body. All too
often, that has been the case in our area. The LEA governor has not
been there as an advocate for the local authority, ensuring that the
local authority’s commitment to standards and what it is trying
to drive through across the whole area is taken to that school and that
the school is held to account for that. Often they become spokesmen for
the school to the local authority.<a class="bkMark" name="11030169000258">&#160;</a>

relationship will be two-way, but all of us in the local authority feel
the need to provide greater clarity. If we can offer that to the
Government, perhaps they will review their proposal to remove the
requirement for an LEA governor. If the local authority is to have the
strong and strategic role that the Secretary of State has talked of,
there needs to be that link to all schools. Even where schools sit
outside the local authority family, such as academies and free schools,
clearly we still need to link into them and ensure that they are
providing the best opportunities for young people and the best choice

working with academies. None of us needs to be anxious about the role

it is that there will be a children’s element that would oversee
the safeguarding role and also link to the local safeguarding children
board. I see no dilution of that role for the local authorities; nor do

                           </em> From our local authority perspective, we are
very supportive of the apprenticeships. Providing opportunities for
those work-based learning opportunities that have disappeared over the
years is long overdue. The role of the local authority is crucial in
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11030169000271">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">That
ties in with the comment that I made earlier that, rather than having
the money for post-16 opportunities channelled through a new funding
agency, the opportunity to do that should be through the local
authority, so that we can provide oversight—not control, but
oversight. A commissioning role on how that is provided is
crucial.<a class="bkMark" name="11030169000272">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">At
a local level, we work particularly with our chambers of commerce in
identifying businesses to provide those apprenticeship opportunities.
We had a very successful fair, which we organised in conjunction with
them recently, where businesses were champing at the bit to participate
in the scheme, because they want new recruits. They see the opportunity
of work-based learning, particularly in the current economic climate,
as a way to bring people on at minimal cost to start with, to build
them up and to develop their skills. That is particularly relevant in a
community where we seek to raise aspiration and give more young people
an opportunity in a community where that may not previously have
existed.<a class="bkMark" name="11030169000273">&#160;</a>

is a clear role for the local authority in co-ordinating that, and

with different specialisms will also play a

provisions are welcome. As I said, if the local authority is to play a
meaningful commissioning role, it is very important that it should have
the levers to do that commissioning properly. I am not sure that they
do, in their entirety, at the moment. Local authorities are well
positioned to co-ordinate the schemes. It is very important that they
are not over-bureaucratised and do not become an impediment rather than
a help. In order for those things to happen effectively, they have got
to be commissioned properly across the whole range of post-16
opportunities.<a class="bkMark" name="11030169000275">&#160;</a>

careers. I welcome your comments about  the all-age careers
service, and your points about its independence and the importance of
creating more balanced advice. Of course, you know that local

you see that marrying with the new service? What are local authorities
going to do to ensure that their responsibility for engagement, as
defined in that Act, is married with the all-age

                           </em> I hope that the Government would give us the
opportunity to do that in a flexible manner, as I touched on before. We
want to ensure that sufficient and independent high-quality advice is
provided to young people. Clearly, we are working within a challenging
financial envelope, in terms of the money made available to local

                        <p class="tabbed">Again, that
links back to my point about channelling money through the local
authority for post-16 education. We believe that that can be provided
in a cost-effective way for the local taxpayer, but it needs to tie in
with other things that we are doing at that level and it does not have
to be provided directly by the local authority. A number of agencies
out there provide good, high-quality advice to young people.<a class="bkMark" name="11030169000278">&#160;</a>

with our approach to secondary education as a whole, we would be very
much looking to commission that and invite tenders for people to
provide that service, rather than necessarily providing it all in-house
ourselves. We would still, however, retain responsibility and

set out a clear specification for what we wanted from any such

                           </strong> I have two questions, and both relate to

                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The first
point is about the children’s trusts’ responsibility to
improve well-being. Schools have taken that very seriously in recent
years. There has been a significant rise in the number of child
protection referrals to local authorities from schools and there has
been a consequent reduction in the number of serious case reviews in
the middle years—in those years between a child’s
starting school and in year 8, where other risk factors become
apparent.<a class="bkMark" name="11030169000281">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">My
understanding—the Minister will correct me if I am
wrong—is that the major reason behind removing the duty to
co-operate relates to reducing the bureaucracy for schools. On the
balance of reducing the bureaucracy for schools and the consequent
knock-on effect for serious case reviews, where would you say that that
balance lies?<a class="bkMark" name="11030169000282">&#160;</a>

                           </em> Schools are on the front line of the child
protection system, because they are a universal service and they see
children every day. That is why it is so important that they are key
players in the child protection system. In terms of the relationship
between that and the wider children’s trust and well-being
provisions, it is about establishing—or in this case
disestablishing, possibly, through removing these duties—a
landscape where schools are placed at the centre of children’s
lives in relation to everything, not only their educational attainment.
Safeguarding is one aspect of that.<a class="bkMark" name="11030169000283">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Depending on
the interpretation by schools and inspectors, there could be a negative
effect, or there could not. It will depend on the interpretation at
school level and by inspectors, in terms of the well-being provision.
However, the message that it gives out to schools, and we are already
receiving it at local authorities, is that, “We do not have to
be so concerned with that stuff any more, because there is a Bill that
says we do not.” That could be dangerous and it would be
regrettable.<a class="bkMark" name="11030169000284">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">In
the final analysis, there are lots of reasons why the partnerships will
continue. In most authorities, they will continue with very willing
people on a voluntary, rather than statutory, basis. The concerns,
however, come when there are those outliers who really do not want to
play with the system as it should be, and where there will be little or
no power to require them to do so.<a class="bkMark" name="11030169000285">&#160;</a>

                           </em> If I could add this point. Just because there
is not a bureaucratic duty to co-operate does not mean that there is
not an expectation of co-operation. My experience is that we will not
see schools not wanting to participate in the process. One of the
benefits of having had a duty over the years is that it has perhaps
embedded that culture within schools, and we can now release them from
the shackles of being told to do that, with some of the associated
bureaucracy, and actually move to a relationship where schools, as they
have demonstrated over the years, will co-operate and take part in the
early flagging up of particular issues and child protection concerns.
We will continue to see that happening without a formal duty being
placed on them to do so. I do not think that any provider or head would
want, or even seek, to neglect that duty or responsibility.<a class="bkMark" name="11030169000286">&#160;</a>

idea. Do you think that it is important, therefore, that that should be
precluded in the legislation, so that such a bad practice would be less

authority will think about when considering a child protection issue
will be what remit the member of staff was working under at the time.
Where a member of school staff is doing something that is in some shape
or form inappropriate with the child, and where that goes outwith that
individual’s duties, we are obviously slap bang into clear child
protection policy.<a class="bkMark" name="11030169000288">&#160;</a>

can see that there is a tension where a statutory provision allows a
teacher of one sex to carry out a search of a pupil of another sex.
Equally, one has to accept that given the sorts of things that can go
on inside schools—the sorts of child protection issues that can
arise among the pupil body itself, with electronic communication
implements—there is a real need, actually, for schools to be
able sometimes to search a locker or search a pupil, and there may not
be an opportunity to stand back. I appreciate that it is a fine
balance, but sometimes schools do need to be able to act quite
swiftly.<a class="bkMark" name="11030169000289">&#160;</a>

the Government to ensure that teaching can be performance-managed as

                           </em> I think that in general terms the Bill is
seeking a simplification of the teacher performance-management and
capability system, so as to reduce the amount of time being spent on
such cases. I believe that under the current system it typically takes
something like 18 months to go from the start to the end of a
capability process. That in itself has been one factor in head teachers
not being willing to go down that route. My understanding is that the
Bill seeks to curtail that procedure and bring it more in line with the
ACAS code of practice.<a class="bkMark" name="11030169000298">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">It might be
relevant here just to explain one thing that the Government did four or
five years ago. For employers at large, the then Government introduced
a statutory disciplinary procedure that applied to all employers. That
was quite a directive disciplinary procedure, and its intention was to
simplify the handling of performance and conduct cases by laying it all
down in quite some detail. Unfortunately, its effect was completely the
opposite. Having put down quite detailed procedures, it resulted in a
huge over-complication of the process and brought,

                           </div>in the line of the previous question, more legal cases. In 2007 the
Gibbons review reached a conclusion on that legislation, saying that
the regulations were inappropriately inflexible. My understanding of
the Bill’s intention is similar—to bring the performance
management of schools much more in line with the ACAS code of practice,
which was what replaced the statutory disciplinary procedure for all
other
employers.<a class="bkMark" name="11030169000299">&#160;</a>

it should. One of the findings of some of the research that has been
carried out in this area has been that the process of requiring schools
to refer teachers removed for performance and competency reasons to the
General Teaching Council acted as a disincentive for head teachers to
go down a performance process in the first place, because there is a
natural human reaction to think, “I may be sacking this person,
but I don’t necessarily want to remove their career in its
entirety.” Hence, it created that disincentive. I think the Bill
does the correct thing by not going down the incompetence referral
route.<a class="bkMark" name="11030169000303">&#160;</a>

that there is a risk that they might go through the processes in slow

authority assets that you might be holding for schools into assets to

assessment of this and the impact it might have on the provision of
school buildings either within the maintained sector or, indeed, on

school sites within its wider property portfolio, and it is up to those
local authorities to determine at a local level how they wish to use
those in the future. We made the commitment at a local level as part of
our school reorganisation process that any capital receipts from school
sites would be re-invested into services for children and young people,
because we wanted to convince people that that is an approach that we
are using appropriately for the needs of young people in the wider
area. Ultimately, that has to be a matter for local authorities to
determine—if there are wider powers in terms of the school
sites.<a class="bkMark" name="11030169000309">&#160;</a>

school sites set to do that this autumn. Clearly, there is a balance to

is comfortable that that can work effectively under that academy set
up, local authorities should be relaxed about that. There is a need to
explore this particular area further, because if it does not tie in

base, it could become disjointed. I am not saying that we are opposed
