<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">185</b><a name="09020551000209"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Edward Garnier</b> (Harborough) (Con): I begin by asking some
questions about the aspects of the Bill that refer to the sentencing
council for England and Wales, which are in part 4 of the Bill,
beginning at clause 100. Traditionally, it has been the duty of the
Government&#151;the Executive&#151;to provide resources, and it has
been the duty of the court independently of Government to sentence
appropriately, given the facts of the case. The impression could be
gained from the design of this Bill that resource is to influence
sentence. Is that your impression? Perhaps I can start with the
magistrates and then ask others to comment.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column82" />Column number: 82</div><a name="09020551000021"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Thornhill:</b></i> I think that magistrates share your grave
concerns. What is important is that magistrates and other members of
the judiciary are free to sentence in an appropriate way the offender
in front of them, taking into account the circumstances of the offence
and the offender. Clearly, there must not be any impression or attempt
to fetter that discretion. Our concerns are that if we look at
something like clause 107, we are moving from &#147;have regard
to&#148; sentencing guidelines, which is the current position, to
&#147;must follow&#148;, where that is mandatory. Coupling that
with a number of other clauses suggests that that might be the case. We
have been given an assurance that it is not the intention to fetter
discretion, but clearly those words might suggest that that is the case
and that therefore there is an attempt perhaps to blur the distinction
between the Executive and the judiciary. That is our
concern.</div><a name="09020551000022"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
186</b><b class="B"><a name="09020551000210"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> Mr. Fassenfelt, from your position as
an officer of the association but also as a sentencer in a court in
Kent, do you share Mr. Thornhill&#146;s
concerns?</div><a name="09020551000023"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Fassenfelt:</b></i> Yes, I can sum this up in very few words.
Magistrates feel that the current guidelines are in fact guidelines. We
feel in the association that the proposals in the Bill will in fact
become tram
lines.</div><a name="09020551000024"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
187</b><b class="B"><a name="09020551000211"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> Mr. Cavadino, I do not know whether
this is relevant to your area of work and experience, but if you have
something that might help us, I would be pleased to hear
it.</div><a name="09020551000025"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Paul
Cavadino:</b></i> First, the Bill does not require sentencing
guidelines to take account of resources. I would be sympathetic to a
case for its doing so, but it does not. In clause 102, a range of
factors are set out that the guidelines have to take account of. They
have to have regard to, for example, current sentencing practice, the
need to promote consistency, the need to promote public confidence and
the cost and effectiveness of different sentences. That is a
replication of the statutory requirements that currently apply to the
Sentencing Guidelines Council. It does not say in that clause that the
guidelines must have regard to penal resources. Clause 109 says that
the sentencing council should publish assessments of the impact on
resources in relation both to the number of prison places and to the
probation and youth justice
services.</div><a name="09020551000026"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
188</b><b class="B"><a name="09020551000212"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> Do you understand that clause 109 is
directed at the Executive, rather than at the
sentencer?</div><a name="09020551000027"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Paul
Cavadino:</b></i> I believe that it is directed at trying to
ensure that everyone involved&#151;the sentencers at the sentencing
council, the Executive and Parliament, if the guidelines will still go
before a Select Committee for scrutiny&#151;will see the impact that
any change in the guidelines or in new guidelines would have on penal
resources. That seems completely sensible. The notion of producing
guidelines without taking any notice of the impact on resources does
not seem a sensible course. If we had more rigorous, more effective
assessments of the impact on the penal system, the Executive could see
what they needed to do by means of planning for penal resources. Also,
the public and others involved, including Parliament, would be able to
see whether the proposal would be counter-productive and frustrate the
effectiveness of sentencing. The effectiveness of sentencing can
clearly 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column83" />Column number: 83</div>be reduced, if guidelines are passed without any regard being had to
whether the resources are there to put them in
place.</div><a name="09020551000028"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
189</b><b class="B"><a name="09020551000213"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> Are you therefore saying&#151;I will come on to
the other witnesses&#151;that had resource assessments been in place
over the past 10 years, we might have had fewer criminal justice Bills
and we would not have had 3,500 new offences being created with many of
those offences sending people to
prison?</div><a name="09020551000029"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Paul
Cavadino:</b></i> The combination of the requirement on the
council to publish impact assessments of its guidelines, and the
provision in the Bill enabling the Lord Chancellor to refer major
proposed changes in legislation or penal policy to the council for an
assessment, could have been a deterrent to some of the legislation
brought forward and proliferated over the
years.</div><a name="09020551000030"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
190</b><b class="B"><a name="09020551000214"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> Gillian Guy, do you have anything to help us on
this?</div><a name="09020551000031"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Gillian
Guy:</b></i> From our perspective of victims and witnesses,
we welcome anything that adds credibility to the system and confidence
in having comprehensible guidelines that make sentencing make some
sense to victims and witnesses. I agree with Paul about needing to pay
some cognisance to the impact on resources for planning and capacity
purposes. I would not welcome guidelines saying, &#147;If this is
difficult to manage, you should change your sentencing
accordingly.&#148; We are concerned that offence legislation might
not get implemented, because of those resource constraints and that the
Bill creates 308 new prison places. We are concerned about whether
previously enacted legislation that we would like implemented will see
the light of day, because of the pressure on prison
places.</div><a name="09020551000032"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
191</b><b class="B"><a name="09020551000215"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> We know&#151;the witnesses from the Prison
Reform Trust might tell us more about this&#151;that the prison
population has risen by approximately 15,000 to 20,000 since this
Government came into office. We also know&#151;this is not a
controversial point&#151;that about a quarter of the prison
population is accommodated in cells that are too small. That is to say
that about 18,000 people are doubled up in single cells and that about
3,000 or 4,000 people are trebled up in double cells. Do you think that
a resource assessment of the nature set out in clause 109 would help us
to deal with prison
overcrowding?</div><a name="09020551000033"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Gillian
Guy:</b></i> It should help us to plan for prison capacity in
terms of what legislation we are bringing in and what offences we are
seeing. It also prompts us to look at community sentencing and other
alternatives to prison and to really think about what are appropriate
sentences. Victims and witnesses are not clamouring for people to be
banged up at all costs. This is about having appropriate justice and a
system that is separate from them, so that it is not their
responsibility to ensure&#151;if incarceration is the right
thing&#151;that prisons have appropriate capacity and are properly
managed.</div><a name="09020551000034"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
192</b><b class="B"><a name="09020551000216"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> Juliet Lyon and Professor Mike Hough, do you
think that clause 109, which deals with the resource implications of
the guidelines, confuses the purpose of the other clauses dealing with
the guidelines to the courts? Are there not two separate functions:
first, calculating the available resources, given the state of the
economy and Government finances, and how 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column84" />Column number: 84</div>they should be deployed within the criminal justice system and,
secondly, what a court should do in any given case? Would it be easier
and clearer if those two functions were expressly separated rather than
dealt with entirely by the Sentencing Guidelines
Council?</div><a name="09020551000035"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Professor
Hough:</b></i> I think that they are separate functions, but
there is absolutely no reason why they should not be discharged by a
single body. The sentencing council is the obvious one to do
it.</div>
<a name="09020551000036"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
193</b><b class="B"><a name="09020551000217"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> Are you suggesting, therefore, that magistrates,
sentencers and the Crown court should be informed of and required to
take into account the resource implications following the assessments,
or are you saying that that should be a matter for the
Executive&#151;the Government and the Ministry of Justice? Is it for
them to learn the lessons of the assessment and to provide, or not to
provide as their political policies may conclude, the answers to the
questions posed by the assessment, and to leave the courts free, under
statute and common law, to apply the relevant
sentences?</div><a name="09020551000037"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Professor
Hough:</b></i> My view is that the council should take on the
technical task of assessing the cost implications of any proposal.
Others should decide what to do with that technical assessment. I do
not think that it is for the council to actually have a handle on
resources.</div><a name="09020551000038"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Juliet
Lyon:</b></i> In the broader context of rising prison
numbers, I do not think that anyone is suggesting that introducing the
new measures under the Bill would lead to a failure to provide the
number of places that we might need for serious and violent offenders.
However, there is the danger of seeing the system as infinite, when it
is finite. Certainly, the Prison Reform Trust welcomes the proposals in
so far as we like the idea of a council or commission that would look
in three directions&#151;guiding sentencers and advising prospective
legislators and the public. The council or commission could serve a
function in building public confidence&#151;Gillian Guy mentioned
that&#151;but that is not altogether fleshed out as it is described
currently.</div>
<a name="09020551000039"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
194</b><b class="B"><a name="09020551000218"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> On Tuesday, Mr. Martin Narey&#151;as
you all know, he is the chief executive of Barnardo&#146;s, but he
previously worked for the Prison Service&#151;said that just as we
ration health provision, so we should ration criminal justice
provision. In so far as I understood his argument, he appeared to think
that there is no difference between the one public service and the
other. Do you think, from the point of view of a magistrate or someone
who has to look after and influence policy on prisoners and
non-custodial defendants, that we can, by using these resource
assessments, ration access to the criminal justice
system?</div><a name="09020551000040"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Professor
Hough:</b></i> I have a little more to add, but if one asked
the public how resource sensitive sentencing should be, they would
probably answer that for grave offences, resources should not play a
part, but for less serious offences, people would probably happy to see
resource-sensitive
justice.</div><a name="09020551000041"></a>

last
sentence?</div><a name="09020551000042"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Professor
Hough:</b></i> If one is trying to be responsive to public
opinion in any way, we should consider that people feel that for grave
offences, resources should not 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column85" />Column number: 85</div>enter the judge&#146;s or the magistrate&#146;s mind. However, for
run-of-the-mill offences, if people are asked whether the fact that
this sentence costs &#163;30,000 and that one costs &#163;10,000
should enter the magistrate&#146;s mind, they will say yes.</div>
<a name="09020551000043"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Juliet
Lyon:</b></i> In terms of the numbers of people going through
the courts and the sentences that are being handed down, we have seen
sentence inflation, which you have drawn attention to. Lord Justice
Gage&#146;s report draws attention to the fact that a number of the
sentences are now outside the guidelines, and they are outside at the
top end, not the bottom. Anything that would curb sentences or bring us
within a margin&#151;not a grid&#151;would be wise, because things
become absolutely out of hand, to the social and economic detriment of
everyone.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
196</b><b class="B"><a name="09020551000220"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> Gillian Guy and Paul Cavadino, would you like to
comment on my
questions?</div><a name="09020551000045"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Gillian
Guy:</b></i> Can I make a comment about rationing the
criminal justice system? I think it would do little to build confidence
among the general population, who suffer more from a fear of crime than
crime itself. The point is managing the criminal justice system and the
punishment system. As I have said, that means thinking about the
required outcomes on reoffending, restitution and punishment. We should
think about what can bring about those outcomes. There are a range of
options, and we can talk about managing allocation without going into
rationing, which is a dangerous
term.</div><a name="09020551000046"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Paul
Cavadino:</b></i> In my view, it would obviously be sensible
to have a greater correspondence between the level of sentencing and
the resources available, including the number of prison places. Prison
overcrowding reduces the effectiveness of sentences by making it harder
to rehabilitate offenders and reduce reoffending. The Bill does not
require rationing of penal resources; it requires the publication of an
assessment of the resources that would be required in order for any
particular set of guidelines to be
implemented.</div><a name="09020551000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
means that policy makers, seeing that assessment, have a decision. They
can decide either to plan to provide additional resources, if
additional resources are required, or they can decide to legislate to
change the parameters within which sentencers operate in order to
ensure that there is a different level of sentencing for some or all
offences that corresponds with the reasonably foreseeable resources.
The approach of requiring an individual sentencer to decide what he or
she does because of resources is one that would not be consistent with
the interests of justice, but we need to find a better way to bring
sentencing levels in line with the resources available. Publishing an
impact assessment means that policy makers would be able to see what
the real impact of the guidelines would be and make policy choices
accordingly.</div>

Thornhill:</b></i> We have concerns about this particular
issue, and certainly about resource-sensitive justice. It is very clear
that each individual should be sentenced appropriately. It would be
inappropriate if one week a particular offender received a particular
sentence and the following week, because of resource implications, a
different offender with a similar and like offence received 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column86" />Column number: 86</div>a different sentence. That would be wholly inappropriate, and it would
undermine any confidence in the criminal justice system, particularly
in sentencing. It would effectively be, as it is sometimes referred to
in other situations, sentencing by postcode. That would be entirely
inappropriate, and it would mean that you are taking discretion away
from the judiciary. We must keep that separation of powers.</div>
<a name="09020551000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">We already
have something like that in the early release scheme. At the moment,
different offenders in different places are being treated differently
under the early release scheme. Again, we think that that is
inappropriate if a sentence is imposed according to the sentencing
guidelines and there is no cogent evidence to say that, in terms of the
magistrates courts, we are outside the guidelines. There is no cogent
evidence for that; in fact, the evidence suggests otherwise. In those
circumstances, we accept the principles explained. It is right to do
cost assessments, but they should not impinge on the judiciary in the
courtroom.</div><a name="09020551000051"></a>

Michael</b> (Cardiff, South and Penarth) (Lab/Co-op): The
sentencing council will be dominated by lawyers, and specifically by
judges. Can I ask each of you, starting with Professor Hough, how we
can ensure that its guidance is driven by consideration of what works
and the objectives of cutting offending and reducing reoffending, not
just by court-based experience tempered by resource issues, which is
where this conversation has been since we started this
morning?</div>
<a name="09020551000052"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Professor
Hough:</b></i> This is a very self-serving answer, but
obviously research needs to feed into the council&#146;s work. I am
pleased to see that there are plans in the Bill to have statisticians
and researchers in the council, but there are plenty of other research
resources to draw
on.</div><a name="09020551000053"></a>

<a name="09020551000055"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Juliet

about public confidence. It would be acceptable not only to sentencers
but to the public to see it led thus. They are more likely to feel that
they can trust the information, if they see it as independent. If they
see that it might have a political bias, I think that we would get a
withdrawal of
confidence.</div><a name="09020551000056"></a>

Michael:</b> I think that in evidence elsewhere, Gillian Guy
has said that what victims want, other than for the clock to be turned
back so that they did not become victims in the first place, is for it
not to happen again. Should that not be a big focus for the sentencing
council?</div>
<a name="09020551000181"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent"><i class="I"><b class="B">Gillian
Guy:</b></i> From my point of view, it absolutely should. I
have already listed the kinds of thing that we look for as outcomes. I
understand why the sentencing council is comprised as it is, but I do
not see any reason why it should not open its doors to other views and
other people in order to keep that perspective coming
through.</div><a name="09020551000057"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Paul
Cavadino:</b></i> The sentencing council, according to the
Bill, will have eight judicial members and six lay members. Schedule 13
sets out a range of different expertise and experience that the lay
members should have between them. It seems to me that there is an 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column87" />Column number: 87</div>astonishing omission&#151;the requirement for at least one member of
the council to have experience in the rehabilitation of offenders. If
the council is required, among other things, to take account of the
effectiveness of different sentences in reducing reoffending, which the
Bill requires, it seems very odd that the otherwise excellent list of
experience of different types required of the lay members does not
include experience in the rehabilitation of
offenders.</div><a name="09020551000058"></a>

201</b><b class="B"><a name="09020551000225"></a>Alun

things, but should it not have
primacy?</div><a name="09020551000059"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Paul
Cavadino:</b></i> In my view, it should clearly be a major
consideration in sentencing. Proportionality clearly has to be an
important factor in sentencing. In other words, we must try to get a
sentence of a severity that corresponds to the seriousness of the
offence, because if we do not have that, it is not a system of justice,
but a system of social engineering. Within those parameters, it makes
complete sense to look for the sentence that will be the most
effective.</div><a name="09020551000060"></a>

202</b><b class="B"><a name="09020551000226"></a>Alun

modest?</div><a name="09020551000061"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Paul

again talking about the majority of sentences handed out. Would not
magistrates welcome an emphasis on effectiveness and, in effect,
assistance in the judgments they make by enhancing their knowledge of
the likely effectiveness of the sentences they pass, in the way that
Mr. Thornhill has just
described?</div><a name="09020551000063"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John

provided with information and data about the effectiveness of
sentences. Indeed, magistrates will ask for that, but we then say that
the lines should go no further than providing that information for us.
We welcome the extension of the non-judicial members to a broader range
of people, particularly statisticians who will provide that
information. We all share the Gage report&#146;s concern about the
lack of data, and that is one of the things that we would like to see
extended. We think, as the Justice Committee did, that the time is not
right for this particular Bill, but we welcome the idea of moving along
the road of finding greater information and providing more data on the
decisions that could be made. We would support that principle and move
along those lines. Clearly, it provides the judiciary with the
information about the effectiveness of sentences, and although we have
lots of statistics already, we think that we need a lot more, and then
the judiciary should be left to make the decisions in
court.</div><a name="09020551000064"></a>

Mr. Thornhill, you made a fairly passionate plea for
judicial independence and discretion, particularly with regard to
magistrates being able to sentence as they see fit, and nobody demurs
from that. You made it clear that you did not think considerations
about the availability of custodial places should have any impact on
the sentence. Can you give the Committee an absolute assurance that
those sitting in the City of Liverpool magistrates court are not
influenced when sentencing by the availability of prison
places?</div><a name="09020551000069"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John

that the clerk of the court does not ring round before a session to

210</b><b class="B"><a name="09020551000239"></a>Mr.
Howarth:</b> Perhaps we should move on. At the moment, if the
totality of sentences handed down by all the courts exceeds the number
of prison places, the only safety valve in the system is early
release&#151;I think you referred to that earlier, Mr Thornhill. Is
early release probably the least desirable way of dealing with an
excess of
sentences?</div><a name="09020551000083"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Thornhill:</b></i> No, because that sends a message that the
sentences imposed will in fact be curtailed at an early stage. Many
magistrates are frustrated by this&#151;we have had resignations from
the magistracy because of the early release scheme&#151;and it seems
to me that there must be other ways of managing that particular
situation.</div><a name="09020551000084"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
211</b><b class="B"><a name="09020551000240"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
212</b><b class="B"><a name="09020551000241"></a>Mr.
Howarth:</b> Thank you. Mr Cavadino, you were a member of the
Gage working group, as was I. Do you see anything in clauses 107 to
109, or anywhere else in the Bill, that would require sentences to be
passed based on an understanding of the current availability of prison
places?</div>
<a name="09020551000087"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Paul
Cavadino:</b></i> No. Clauses 100 to 118 and
schedule 13 are based solidly on the recommendations of the
sentencing commission working group chaired by Lord Justice Gage. The
group considered whether sentencing guidelines should be required to
take account of penal resources. It decided by a majority to recommend
that they should not, and that an impact assessment should be produced
so that policy makers would be made aware of the impact on resources.
That issue was specifically considered by the working group. Its
recommendations were specifically against doing that, and the
provisions in the Bill are based on those recommendations. Nothing in
the Bill requires individual sentencers, or sentencing guidelines, to
take account of penal
resources.</div><a name="09020551000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">Policy
makers need to find a way of bringing sentencing levels and penal
resources more into line, first because prison overcrowding makes it
harder to carry out sentences effectively, and secondly because it
leads to an undermining of the sentence by the early release scheme.
The concerns expressed about the early release scheme by the
Magistrates Association are a powerful argument for trying to find a
better way of aligning sentencing levels with penal resources. The
Government have chosen to do that in the Bill expressly by not
requiring sentencers to take that into account when
sentencing.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
213</b><b class="B"><a name="09020551000242"></a>Mr.
Howarth:</b> One of the arguments is that requiring the court
to follow sentencing guidelines&#151;particularly in determining
tariffs, for example&#151;would be an undue fetter on the discretion
of sentencers. Do you think the
phrase,</div><a name="09020551000183"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;unless...it
would be contrary to the interests of justice to do so&#148;,
</div><a name="09020551000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">is a weak
test or a strong
test?</div><a name="09020551000091"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Paul
Cavadino:</b></i> I think that it is a reasonable test. It is
clearly stronger than the current test. At the moment, legislation
requires courts to have regard to sentencing guidelines and to give
reasons if they are passing a sentence outside the range prescribed by
sentencing guidelines. This is a slightly stronger test. It requires
the court to follow the guidelines, unless it is satisfied that it 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column90" />Column number: 90</div>would not be in the interest of justice to do so. That seems to me to be
an entirely reasonable test. I cannot think of any other valid reason
for departing from the guidelines, and because it is slightly stronger,
I think that it would aid greater consistency and therefore reduce the
degree of injustice that results from inconsistency in comparable
cases. It would also help to aid predictability, which is important if
policy makers are to plan to resource the penal system in line with the
likely results of sentencing guidelines.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
214</b><b class="B"><a name="09020551000243"></a>Mr.

guidelines.</div><a name="09020551000093"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Professor
Hough:</b></i> I think that it is a sensible
test&#151;better than the previous one. The system proposed in the

lines.</div><a name="09020551000094"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Gillian

general public and to victims and witnesses. The aim that we would like

people using the system.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
215</b><b class="B"><a name="09020551000244"></a>Jeremy
Wright:</b> Gillian Guy, can I ask you about special measures?
If any other witnesses want to come in, please feel free, but I suspect
this is more for you than for them. Clause 82, as you know, gives the
absolute right for witnesses in specified offences involving guns and
knives to have special measures when they give evidence, and, as we all
understand, the purpose of special measures is to enable witnesses who
are anxious or frightened, or otherwise concerned about giving
evidence, the opportunity to do so with certain extra help.</div>
<a name="09020551000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">Is there any
logic, in your view, to making a specific category of offences eligible
for witnesses to have special measures, or is it more sensible simply
to say, as we do now, that if the witness can demonstrate particular
anxiety or concern, they should have the special measures, and if they
cannot they should
not?</div><a name="09020551000097"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Gillian
Guy:</b></i> This provision highlights the confusion around
the debate on special measures, or indeed the lack of a debate around
special measures. I think that the confusion arises from the fact that
evidence would be worse without them, but we do not talk about the fact
evidence is better with them. From our point of view, there are very
few witnesses who enter a witness box who are not in some way anxious,
at the very least, and who do not find the whole scenario and
experience quite difficult to deal
with.</div><a name="09020551000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our
contention is that in many circumstances, regardless of the actual
crime complained of, people would benefit from some form of special
measures. What has happened here is that a particular type of crime has
been identified&#151;we know that a particular thing is going on in
society at the moment&#151;where the Government have obviously felt
that, without anyone having to get through any degree of proof of that
anxiety, those special measures should be available. As I say, our
contention is that special measures should be designed for the
individual, and the individual&#151;no matter what the crime, no
matter what their background or what might be perceived as their level
of vulnerability&#151;should be afforded the ability to get special
measures, if that would make the evidence better. That is our
contention.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column91" />Column number: 91</div><a name="09020551000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">The difficulty
that we have is that we are not understanding what that debate is
about, such as whether it is about better evidence, whether it is about
wanting to put witnesses through the most difficult scenario in order
to test them thoroughly, where the boundaries of that treatment ought
really to lie&#151;we act on behalf of defence witnesses as well as
prosecution witnesses, and the whole scenario involves getting to
justice and getting to the truth, hopefully&#151;and whether we are
dealing with expense or difficulty in providing special measures, which
again almost brings us into the realms of rationing and how that is
dealt with. It is important that we understand what we are actually
aiming to
achieve.</div><a name="09020551000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">From
our point of view and experience with witnesses&#151;we help 250,000
of them a year through the court process&#151;we believe that justice
ought to be built around those individuals, so that they are
comfortable with giving evidence and the court gets the best possible
stab at the truth. In that context, we are most alarmed that in a year
18,000 witnesses, eligible under existing legislation for special
measures, were not identified as vulnerable and intimidated witnesses,
let alone trying to open up eligibility. Once you have eligibility, you
certainly have to be able to identify people and offer those measures.
Let us be honest about what we are trying to achieve
here.</div><a name="09020551000101"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
216</b><b class="B"><a name="09020551000245"></a>Jeremy
Wright:</b> You know that one of the arguments made against
special measures, in particular circumstances, is that they make the
defendant look more guilty when a witness is given certain measures
through which they can give evidence. To counter that argument, would
it be better for all witnesses, particularly those under the age of 18,
for example, to be entitled to special measures, as a matter of course,
so that no jury could look at a particular witness and say, &#147;The
fact that that witness has special measures must mean that the
defendant is a little more
guilty&#148;?</div><a name="09020551000102"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Gillian
Guy:</b></i> It assists the argument around allowing people
generally to understand the system and to get special assistance in
giving the best evidence possible. Obviously, it would not identify
particular defendants as being in cases where witnesses feel
particularly vulnerable. There would be a broad approach, which would
not act to the detriment of either party. As I say, however, making
then breaking that promise is worse than not making it in the first
place. We must ensure that we make good on the promise. We also have to
be clear, when we talk about special measures, that the whole gamut of
special measures does not apply to everybody. It offers what would help
in individual circumstances to help us get to the
truth.</div><a name="09020551000103"></a>

the individual&#146;s death and their history that perhaps led to
that death. I am aware of psychological autopsy studies that have
increased the background investigations into an individual&#146;s

suicide in particular. What is your view on the best way to structure
investigations to give us far greater information and evidence to help

was four years late. We have asked that consideration be given in the
Bill to limiting the amount of time that people have to wait, which
puts a huge strain on bereaved families. In the course of being asked
to represent herself, she was means-tested and had to consider
remortgaging her property in order to afford to discover why and how
her son died in prison. That concerns an omission in the Bill that we
would very much like amended. In answer to your specific point, in this
instance the young man was severely mentally ill and had been for a
long time. The inquest allowed us, from the prison gate onwards, to
understand what had happened to him once the sentence was passed. He
found it impossible to cope with custody. He was a very intelligent
young man and he found it very hard. He was put into a segregation unit
for his own protection and was dead within a matter of days. He was
facing a five-year sentence. We discovered in the course of the inquest
that the staff had left a plastic bag in his cell, which allowed him
the means to kill himself.</div>
<a name="09020551000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">What was
missing, clearly&#151;this is the point that you are
raising&#151;is the question, &#147;What about the decision to
imprison in this particular individual&#146;s case?&#148; There had
been information in court about his mental health history and a report
from a psychiatrist offering to take him in for further in-patient
treatment. He had a previous history of about 11 years of treatment. In
that case&#151;it would not be true in every case&#151;the
information about the decision to imprison would clearly have been
pertinent to understanding not only how that young man came to take his
own life in a very bleak situation in prison but the issue for other
vulnerable people, particularly mentally ill people, in similar
circumstances. It is a great regret that that could not be
investigated. It was a great regret to the coroner himself; he said
so.</div><a name="09020551000106"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
218</b><b class="B"><a name="09020551000247"></a>Mrs.
Moon:</b> Do you think that it would be helpful if there were
national guidelines to be followed in investigations so that consistent
information came through, rather than leaving it to individual coroners
to conduct their own form of investigation? Do we need to establish the
nature of the issues to be investigated? Professor Hough, with your
research experience, can you comment on
that?</div><a name="09020551000107"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Professor

issues at
all.</div><a name="09020551000108"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Juliet

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020551000248"></a>The
Chairman:</b> For practical purposes, I will move on to live
links.</div><a name="09020551000110"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
219</b><a name="09020551000249"></a><b class="B">Mr.
David Kidney</b> (Stafford) (Lab): In a moment, I will ask the
witnesses about the significance of removing the safeguard of requiring
the consent of the accused before using live links. First, though, will
John Thornhill and Gillian Guy say something about the present use of
live links and the existing law? How does it work practically in
magistrates courts, and are there any 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column93" />Column number: 93</div>implications for the delivery of justice? Gillian, what is the
experience of victims of crime with access to live
links?</div><a name="09020551000111"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Thornhill:</b></i> Many courts now conduct cases, sentences
and administrative hearings over live links. We have found no serious
problems with them so far, and no problems have been reported to us.
Clearly, there are concerns about whether the defendant fully
understands what is happening. There are issues about the defendant not
wishing to engage, and how we manage that particular situation.
Contempt of court issues may arise, and that is something that we need
to look at. In principle, at the moment, we find no serious problems
with them, but we are concerned about the defendant&#146;s ability to
say that they do not want to be involved. That is what concerns us in
the proposed
legislation.</div><a name="09020551000112"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Gillian
Guy:</b></i> The experience thus far has been that they have
been broadly welcomed. They are a way to ease the situation of giving
evidence, which is the aim. The issues have been around early decisions
about whether live links are to be used or not, so that witnesses can
get to grips with what that means, whether they have been successful in
giving that facility, consistency in their availability and an
explanation of what they actually mean. For example, there are
certainly witnesses who did not have a full explanation and thought
that they could not be seen. They were shocked to find that that was
not the situation. It is really about early application, early decision
and early explanation. Live links are but one method of helping people
feel at ease with the
process.</div><a name="09020551000113"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
220</b><b class="B"><a name="09020551000250"></a>Mr.
Kidney:</b> That is helpful to start with, but can I now go
through the witnesses? Juliet Lyon, I do not think that the written
response that you sent us covers that particular point. A lot of the
links are from prison to court. Do you have concerns about changing the
present system by removing the consent, and if so, can you suggest any
safeguards in its
place?</div><a name="09020551000114"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Juliet
Lyon:</b></i> We have not covered it in our written evidence.
I have some concerns about the permission being removed. That would be
the issue. The other issue, which overlaps with information that we
provided, was under clause 87, which discusses examination of the
accused through an intermediary. Having just conducted three years of
work on people with learning disabilities and learning difficulties in
prison, we are acutely aware how many people have gone through the
criminal justice system not fully understanding their role in it or the
procedures at police stations, at courts or after they enter prison. We
welcome some of the suggestions for improving information, which would
be relevant here. There are issues that arise prior to that, such as
fitness to plead. They are not in the Bill at the moment and need to be
reinforced.</div>
<a name="09020551000115"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
221</b><b class="B"><a name="09020551000251"></a>Mr.
Kidney:</b> Others are expressing concerns about the potential
for the abuse of prisoners. First, they would not be seen because they
did not appear in court, and they could be subjected to subtle pressure
to plead in a way that they might not plead in a courtroom. Do you
share those concerns?</div>
<a name="09020551000116"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Juliet
Lyon:</b></i> It is difficult because you need room for
flexibility, which is hard to get. It is vital for some individuals to
be in court so that they can see, and  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column94" />Column number: 94</div>contribute to, the procedure. For others it is pretty intolerable. Some
face an immensely long journey&#151;people are held further and
further away from the court of committal&#151;and all the rigmarole
that that involves. Pragmatically, it is often best that they do not
appear, but you need to have flexibility. Taking away the permission is
potentially
problematic.</div><a name="09020551000117"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
222</b><b class="B"><a name="09020551000252"></a>Mr.
Kidney:</b> Gillian Guy, do you welcome the change and do you
have any concerns about it?</div>
<a name="09020551000118"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Gillian
Guy:</b></i> The concerns are in terms of ensuring that
justice is seen to be done. That is clearly about ensuring that the
procedure is in the best interests of getting to the truth, but it is
also about expediting the procedure. Some of the damage that is
inflicted on witnesses and victims is often because of the long
drawn-out process of trying to get into courts in the first place and,
as Juliet said, the long travelling distances involved. People
sometimes hang around for days and have to go backwards and forwards,
and that does not help the situation or people&#146;s anxiety.
Expediting the procedure has
helped.</div><a name="09020551000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">Arriving
at a decision quickly is good for witnesses, but I do not think that we
want to lose the primary objective of justice by overriding the rights
of the defendant. The decision ought to be made in the interests of the
case, not the individual.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
223</b><a name="09020551000253"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Tim Boswell</b> (Daventry) (Con): Briefly, Gillian Guy
referred earlier to alleged inconsistencies in the use of the measures
and had some concern about it. I am not familiar with them myself, but
it would be useful if you, Gillian, and/or John Thornhill, could say
whether the resources issue crops up again. Is there a need for greater
consistency of practice, and is that constrained by resources in
particular cases? Will the Bill help to address that?</div>
<a name="09020551000121"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Gillian
Guy:</b></i> It is the case with all the initiatives that the
resources do not necessarily follow; therefore, there is inconsistency
in application. I do not see that the Bill addresses that. It is for
others to allocate the resources to ensure, as I said, that promises
made are kept.</div>
<a name="09020551000122"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
224</b><b class="B"><a name="09020551000254"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> Perhaps before Mr. Thornhill responds,
I could follow that comment by asking him to mention his experience of
resources, and to say whether a bench that has a difficulty with the
procedure is in a position to influence decisions on the allocation of
resources to deal with it.</div>
<a name="09020551000123"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Thornhill:</b></i> Certainly, resources are a concern. There
are two levels of resources. First, on equipment and the consistency of
equipment around the country, there were to be a certain number of
pilot schemes, but some of them will not go into operation because of a
lack of resources or problems with resources. The resources have to be
there to ensure consistency right across the country if we are going to
deliver.</div>
<a name="09020551000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, we
are seeing a rise in the use of interpreters in court, and we have
concerns about how interpreters will be used. Will they be in the
prison or the court? There are concerns about communication between the
interpreter and the witness or
defendant.</div><a name="09020551000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">Resources
are always a problem. The issue of the time spent hanging around and
waiting was mentioned. When we were discussing the Sentencing
Guidelines 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column95" />Column number: 95</div>Council, there were concerns about resources for the prison population,
but we have concerns about the resources for community sentences. We
see long waiting times. The recent crime figures show that there are
large numbers of people in custody awaiting either trial or sentence.
That is a real concern to us as magistrates because, as one of my
colleagues just said, justice is not being done.</div>
<a name="09020551000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have no
problems with the principle of live links and there are obvious reasons
why they should be used in the interests of expedition. However, all
parties&#151;prosecution, defence, magistrates and judges&#151;have
to be able to say, &#147;This is not working in the best interests of
this defendant and these witnesses. Therefore, we need to ensure that
there is a live appearance, either by the witnesses or by the
defendant.&#148; That has to be there. Whether you remove the
permission of the defendant or build in a clause that allows
submissions to be made on each occasion on that issue, something along
those lines ought to be in the Bill. It should not be
blanket&#151;&#147;You must
appear.&#148;</div><a name="09020551000127"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
225</b><b class="B"><a name="09020551000255"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> That is very helpful. I would like to ask about
your experience in cases of individual witnesses. Some comment has
already been made about confusion&#151;for example, on whether they
know that they are going to appear. Is it your experience in court
that, on the whole, magistrates address these matters in a way that
makes things clear to people, and could we improve that practice if not
by
legislation?</div><a name="09020551000128"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Thornhill:</b></i> I do not think that there is any necessity
to improve that practice by legislation. This is about having proper
guidelines and providing proper information to those who will appear in
court. Certainly on the benches where I have sat, either in the chair
or as a winger, everyone has been at pains to ensure that those who are
appearing on the live link fully understand what is happening in the
court. Our legal advisers, for instance, will pan the camera round to
show the defendant or the witnesses who is in court and explain who
those people are. Also, the defendants have an opportunity to have a
live link with their advocate before the court session starts. In all
those terms, my experience at the moment is that generally they have
the opportunity to understand what is happening, but I do appreciate
the point that was made. If it is not explained to witnesses, that is
inappropriate and it would then be for the bench or a judge to explain
to the witnesses what was
happening.</div><a name="09020551000129"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
226</b><b class="B"><a name="09020551000256"></a>Alun
Michael:</b> My question is first to Victim Support, but I
would be interested in the views of other members of the panel. It
focuses on the commissioner for victims and witnesses. There has been
encouragement from Government for the system generally to show greater
respect to victims in two senses: first, in relation to the concern
articulated by Victim Support that I mentioned earlier&#151;that what
has happened does not happen again&#151;and secondly in relation to
the experience in court of victims and witnesses. We have had the
statutory code of practice for victims of crime. We have had things
such as the prosecutors pledge, although from evidence given to the
Justice Committee, I got the general impression that that does not seem
to have any great salience. What will the victims commissioner add and
how can we be sure that the commissioner will do what previous measures
have been intended to do?</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column96" />Column number: 96</div><a name="09020551000130"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Gillian
Guy:</b></i> Obviously, the Government themselves will answer
on what the commissioner will add, because the legislation here is
changing what was proposed five years ago. Five years ago, Victim
Support was a supporter of the commissioner because of the state we
were in at the time. In five years, an awful lot has happened. If
nothing else, people talk about victims and witnesses constantly. We
talk about victims and witnesses being at the heart of the criminal
justice system, and my view is that we still have a hell of a long way
to go on that, but at least we say it and we try to put things in to
support it. We do have the victims code, the witness charter and a
number of quite strong voices around now for victims and witnesses, not
least of which is my own organisation. Indeed, we strengthened
ourselves quite recently to be able to do that even more, with the
whole of England and Wales being spoken for in those
terms.</div><a name="09020551000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
difficulty we currently have&#151;Ministers are aware of
this&#151;is that it is not altogether clear to us why this is
happening now as opposed to five years ago, when there was a lot to be
shifted. Also, why this? It is a rather watered-down version of the
commissioner of five years ago. It is very important to us as an
organisation to ensure that our concerns are addressed about possible
duplication and possible confusion about the mixture of voices around,
and to receive reassurance that resources will not be diverted away
from victims and witnesses into that kind of edifice. Those are our
questions and that is what we put in evidence. Times have
changed  and we do not fully understand why this, why
now.</div><a name="09020551000132"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
227</b><b class="B"><a name="09020551000257"></a>Alun
Michael:</b> Are there any comments from other
witnesses?</div><a name="09020551000133"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Fassenfelt:</b></i> Magistrates have been told in the past
that victim impact statements are available. I think this is in
relation to the comment recently made concerning resources. We do in
theory have victim impact statements. When I have asked for them, 90
per cent. of the time they are not there. If you have an initiative you
must provide the necessary resources to back up that
initiative.</div>
<a name="09020551000134"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
228</b><b class="B"><a name="09020551000258"></a>Alun
Michael:</b> Is it as bad in
Liverpool?</div><a name="09020551000135"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Thornhill:</b></i> Yes, it is as bad in Liverpool. Very
often, the victims are not made aware that they can make such a
statement. It is at the very early stages in dealing with the
particular incident that they need to be made aware of the opportunity
to make that victim impact statement. It is no use, as John says, when
we often ask in court, &#147;Has a statement been made?&#148; and
no, it has not. That obviously is to the disadvantage of the victim.
Clearly those victim impact statements are an important piece of the
sets of information that are provided to magistrates and judges when
making decisions.</div>
<a name="09020551000136"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
229</b><b class="B"><a name="09020551000259"></a>Alun
Michael:</b> If something goes wrong, currently there are
about 10 different organisations that have a piece of the criminal
justice system, with 10 different ways of making a complaint or seeking
to register a complaint. Is that adequate? Is that
satisfactory?</div><a name="09020551000137"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Gillian
Guy:</b></i> Certainly from Victim Support&#146;s point of
view, on behalf of victims and witnesses, no, it is not. It is very
difficult, I think, to give to people who are unfamiliar with the
system the responsibility for finding their way through various
complaints procedures, finally ending up with the parliamentary
ombudsman under 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column97" />Column number: 97</div>the victims&#146; code. I think that there was room&#151;and as you
know we have said as an organisation that we think the Bill could be a
missed opportunity for victims and witnesses&#151;to bring an entire
strategy together on their behalf and put them very much at the heart
of the system, to allow them to be central to the whole system as it
goes along.</div>
<a name="09020551000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">We consider
that that is missing at the moment, in terms of a complaints system
that would be one complaints system and would be clear to people who
would not have the onus and worry of having to work their way through
everybody&#146;s different cultures and ways of dealing with
complaints. As I believe I said in evidence the other day, if people
are serious about dealing with complaints&#151;and that means
improving matters as a result of complaints&#151;they make it easy to
complain.</div>
<a name="09020551000139"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
230</b><b class="B"><a name="09020551000260"></a>Alun

victims and
witnesses?</div><a name="09020551000140"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Gillian

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
231</b><a name="09020551000261"></a><b class="B">Jenny
Willott</b> (Cardiff, Central) (LD): I want to ask, just
expanding on that, about the role of witnesses, and the support for
witnesses and victims, in the coroners&#146; system rather than
magistrates courts and Crown courts. To declare an interest, I used to
work for Victim Support before I got elected, and I know that in some
parts of the country there is a witness service equivalent in
coroners&#146; courts, but it is quite patchy. Victim Support has
said that it would like that to go on much more broadly across the
country. Is anything needed in the Bill to enable that to happen, or is
it simply a matter of
resources?</div><a name="09020551000142"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Gillian
Guy:</b></i> I think in terms of the Bill what we have is a
charter, and that is to be welcomed, in that anything that tries to set
out some rights and expectations for witnesses is welcome; but it does
not really go far enough.</div>
<a name="09020551000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">If we look at
the clause regarding support in coroners&#146; courts, that really is
about some coroners&#146; courts having some support available on
sitting days. As people may be aware, in the witness service people
are, as volunteers, available from when a witness is identified right
the way through until those people deem it unnecessary to have that
kind of support. We would say that there needs to be a system that is
not fortuitous&#151;that is the word I would use rather than
&#147;patchy&#148;. Where there is a little bit of resource
somewhere, Victim Support and the witness service get in and give a
little support. That is now diminishing and ebbing away, and we would
like to see proper provision for coroners&#146; courts to have
witness support throughout, in the way that we know it in the criminal
courts.</div>
<a name="09020551000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">It would also
be good to see that replicated in civil courts, where there are some
quasi-criminal cases going on without such
support.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
232</b><b class="B"><a name="09020551000262"></a>Jenny
Willott:</b> And you would like to see that included in the
charter
specifically?</div><a name="09020551000146"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Gillian
Guy:</b></i> I think the charter could go further, but the
charter itself may not achieve it. It is a matter for the policy
writers and legislators to say whether we need legislation to set that
up and make it actually work, but it would need resources and a
commitment to see it happen.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column98" />Column number: 98</div><a name="09020551000147"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Juliet
Lyon:</b></i> There is scope for amending the charter to
ensure that we get rid of this morally repugnant means-testing so that
families are entitled to financial support. It is about equality of
alms, if you like. Quite often they are not represented because they
cannot afford to be, and in cases of death in custody they are up
against the Prison Service, which is very well represented indeed, and
that is not
fair.</div><a name="09020551000148"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
233</b><b class="B"><a name="09020551000263"></a>Jenny
Willott:</b> That relates exactly to the question I was about
to ask you, which concerns access to legal aid at inquests. You have
just put forward one side of the argument, and we have already heard
the other side, which is that if both sides are represented by lawyers
it can turn into a quasi-trial so that the character of an inquest is
changed and, rather than being inquisitorial, ends up being much more
adversarial and more like that of a criminal court. What are the
feelings of the other witnesses who have an interest in the provision
of legal aid for families, particularly in cases where the other side
is represented by lawyers? Would that counteract that imbalance and
make it fairer or end up changing the character of an
inquest?</div><a name="09020551000149"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Gillian
Guy:</b></i> I think that it is about equality, balance and
ensuring that no parties at an inquest feel severely disadvantaged.
There are other ways of dealing with how the system then operates, but
that does not mean that people should be disadvantaged to make it a
less professional
approach.</div><a name="09020551000150"></a>

Guy:</b></i> Not directly. Of course, that relates to
investigation and witnesses. Our point of view on investigation is that
it is so difficult to get witnesses to come forward in certain cases,
which is clearly what gave rise to the measure, that we would like to
see it potentially extended beyond the age group to which it is
currently restricted. As far as witnesses are concerned, we welcome
anything that makes it easier to get to justice and the truth and allow
the general public as well as victims and witnesses to feel that there
is some system that will support them as they go through, but the
safeguards are incredibly important. I do not, however, have a witness
to provide to you who has been through
that.</div><a name="09020551000154"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
236</b><b class="B"><a name="09020551000267"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> So you have no direct experience of how that is
working. I will move on to bail. You will perhaps have seen clauses 97
and 98, which will amend the current bail law. It has been suggested
that that will 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column99" />Column number: 99</div>restrict the ability of courts in certain circumstances to give bail in
murder cases, and if you look at the black letter text of the Bill you
will see that there is no doubt that it will. Does that matter or
concern you, and is it a good thing? What is your general view on
that?</div><a name="09020551000155"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Thornhill:</b></i> As most charges normally go directly to
the Crown court, they will only ever appear once in our courts. We
clearly have concerns that the matter should be dealt with
expeditiously in the Crown court, and if the decision on bail is
reserved to the Crown Court, that is satisfactory. However, it is
suggested in the legislation that that has to be done within 48 hours,
which seems too long to us, as magistrates, and we would like to see
that period shortened. Nevertheless, we still think that it would be
appropriate for bail applications to be made in the magistrates courts
in those circumstances. At the moment, magistrates take all those
considerations into account. They make bail decisions based on the
offence and on whether there is satisfactory evidence to suggest that
the defendant will commit further offences while on bail&#151;failure
to surrender, interference with witnesses or any other considerations.
All that is in current legislation when magistrates make decisions
about bail.</div>
<a name="09020551000156"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
237</b><b class="B"><a name="09020551000268"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> Do any other witnesses have observations on
clauses 97 and 98?</div>
<a name="09020551000157"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Gillian
Guy:</b></i> On behalf of victims we particularly welcome the
additional emphasis on public protection. Although I take your point
that there is existing legislation, that is not entirely the experience
or the perception of victims and witnesses. This kind of legislation,
which puts an additional emphasis on public protection, is welcome. We
would also like to see greater notification given to victims and
witnesses when bail is granted. I know that the code has certain
provisions in it and compliance with that code is necessary. We would
like to see the code made stricter so that people are given immediate
notification.</div>
<a name="09020551000158"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Juliet
Lyon:</b></i> The Prison Reform Trust would like to see some
effort made to look at the Halliday review of sentencing, in which a
recommendation was made about an intermediate estate. That would not
mean a stark decision between bail or custodial remand, but would look
at provision within a community that was adequately supervised and met
the requirements of the court. Unfortunately, that recommendation in
the Halliday report never went anywhere, but we believe that it is
still applicable today.</div>
<a name="09020551000159"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
238</b><b class="B"><a name="09020551000269"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> I appreciate that the Bill deals with about 25
different subjects, but there are provisions in it to allow a
magistrate decision to be made by one justice of the peace as opposed
to a bench of two or three. Do you see that as a useful advance, either
in bail cases&#151;which it does not cover&#151;or in other
decisions that courts sometimes have to make? One observation made is
that it is difficult to get a bench of magistrates together for quick
decisions or lengthier cases. Do you see an argument for allowing
magistrates to sit with fewer members on the bench?</div>
<a name="09020551000160"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Fassenfelt:</b></i> As a serving magistrate I think that the
Magistrates Association would see no problems with that as long as it
is only used in emergency situations. I sat in a police station on
Christmas day in order to adjudicate in an adjournment case. We would
not see any problems in that direction.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column100" />Column number: 100</div><a name="09020551000161"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Thornhill:</b></i> If it is about cases or situations that
are mainly administrative issues, we would not have a problem. If it
involves making decisions about innocence or guilt, or regards
sentencing or something of that nature, we still believe that such
matters should be dealt with by a bench of three magistrates. However,
if it is expeditious, then it is
appropriate.</div>
<a name="09020551000162"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
239</b><b class="B"><a name="09020551000270"></a>The
Chairman:</b> If members of the Committee have no further
questions for the witnesses, is there anything that the witnesses would
like to offer or comment on?</div>
<a name="09020551000163"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Juliet
Lyon:</b></i> In our written evidence we have drawn attention
to what we feel are two notable omissions from the Bill. The first is
the possibility of amending the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974.
All through our correspondence with Ministers, ever since the
&#147;Breaking the Circle&#148; consultation in 2001&#151;which I
understand was generally welcomed&#151;there has been no effort to
amend that Act.</div>
<a name="09020551000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are always
being told that there is no legislative opportunity, but the Bill
appears to present such an opportunity, and we would like the
Rehabilitation of Offenders Act to be considered. At the moment it
undoubtedly causes people to fall into a difficult situation. If they
disclose their previous offence or imprisonment, they are likely not to
get a job. If they do not disclose it and they are found out, they
might lose their job. It certainly leads to further offending and is
not calibrated correctly.</div>
<a name="09020551000165"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020551000271"></a>The
Chairman:</b> That seems very
apropos.</div><a name="09020551000166"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Thornhill:</b></i> We have talked a lot about the monitoring
role of the Sentencing Guidelines Council, particularly in reference to
sentences in court, where justice can be seen to be done. The
Magistrates Association and magistrates have grave concerns about
out-of-court disposals&#151;the abuse of fixed penalty notices,
penalty notices for disorder, conditional cautions&#151;and a whole
range of issues where they do not appear to be effective, given that at
least 50 per cent. of them are not complied with.</div>
<a name="09020551000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">We would like
consideration to be given to including scrutiny of out-of-court
disposals in the Sentencing Guidelines Council&#146;s monitoring
role. We are gravely concerned that 50 per cent. of fines and penalty
notices for disorder, for instance, are not paid. They then go to the
court to be imposed, which acts as another drain on the finances of Her
Majesty&#146;s Courts Service, when the money was probably originally
granted to the Home Office. We have grave concern about that particular
issue.</div><a name="09020551000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another
figure that we have reported is that where conditional cautions are
imposed and not complied with, no further action is taken 38 per cent.
of the time. Effectively, that means that the offender has got away
with it. We are talking about in court, where there is public scrutiny.
Anybody can go into a court. Justice can be seen to be done. With
out-of-court disposals, it cannot always be done and, in the majority
of cases, it cannot be seen to be done. We would like consideration to
be given to including a scrutiny of that system in the Sentencing
Guidelines Council&#146;s remit.</div>
<a name="09020551000169"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
240</b><b class="B"><a name="09020551000272"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> Following that, I am hearing anecdotal evidence
that in a number of quite serious cases involving rape and violent
offences, the police are not progressing cases beyond a complaint,
either because 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column101" />Column number: 101</div>it requires too much effort to get additional evidence at the request of
the Crown Prosecution Service or because they are not confident that
the victim or some other relevant witness will appear in court, so they
do not bother. Defence solicitors are telling me that their clients are
getting off scot-free. Sometimes they get a caution, but often they are
simply not proceeded against. Do you think that the council might also
look at that?</div>
<a name="09020551000170"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Thornhill:</b></i> I will answer that one directly:
absolutely, yes. We have similar anecdotal evidence, and it is of grave
concern to us. The out-of-court disposals are undermining public
confidence in the justice system, when the courts are seen to be doing
justice.</div><a name="09020551000171"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
241</b><b class="B"><a name="09020551000273"></a>Mr.
George Howarth:</b> What is the reason for that failure? Is it
purely administrative, or is there some other
reason?</div><a name="09020551000172"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Thornhill:</b></i> There may be a whole range of reasons. We
do not know what those reasons are. Indeed, part of the collection of
data remit of the Sentencing Guidelines Council will be to seek those
data and find out that information, as well as the causes and reasons
why there is non-compliance. The figures are
high.</div>
<a name="09020551000173"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
242</b><b class="B"><a name="09020551000274"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Are there any further words of wisdom, in a John
Humphrys one
minute?</div><a name="09020551000174"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Paul
Cavadino:</b></i> I would like, very briefly and very
strongly, to support Juliet Lyon&#146;s comments that the Government
agreement in 2003 to the case for reforming the Rehabilitation of
Offenders Act 1974 is now more urgent than ever.</div>
<a name="09020551000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">Later this
year, the Government intend to introduce basic disclosures, which means
that anyone applying for any job of any kind&#151;not just sensitive
occupations, but any job&#151;could be required by an employer to
produce a certificate showing his or her unspent criminal convictions. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column102" />Column number: 102</div>There is a real risk that that could lead to much greater discrimination
against ex-offenders in the job market and, therefore, to an increase
in reoffending, because employment is crucial to reducing reoffending.
The Government accepted the case for reform five years ago. It is time,
in our view, for the legislation to be included in the
Bill.</div><a name="09020551000176"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Gillian
Guy:</b></i> As has been said, this is a very wide-ranging
Bill. We have not spoken about data protection. We would like to see
consultation on guidance to ensure that it is about sharing information
safely rather than stopping the sharing of information. It would make
all our jobs much easier if we could do that. Omissions from the Bill
include a clear strategy about victims and witnesses, which would give
rise to other provisions. A taster of those would be, perhaps, looking
at criminal injuries compensation, which has not been touched on; as we
have said, special measures for all; a complaints procedure that is
comprehensive and comprehensible in the criminal justice system;
support for witnesses in the civil and coroners courts; and an
obligation to refer for witness support to the witness
service.</div>
