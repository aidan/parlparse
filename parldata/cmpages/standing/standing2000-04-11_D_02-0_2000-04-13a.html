<B>Mr. Simon Hughes </B>(Southwark, North and Bermondsey): I beg to move amendment No. 8, in page 1, leave out lines 9 to 12 and insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`19B.-It is unlawful for a public authority to discriminate, in carrying out any of its functions, against another person.'.<P>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take the following amendments: No. 9, in page 1, leave out lines 15 to 17.
<P>
No. 10, in page 1, leave out lines 18 to 20.
<P>
No. 11, in page 1, leave out lines 21 to 24.
<P>
No. 12, in page 1, leave out from beginning of line 25 to end of line 10 on page 2.
<P>
No. 13, in page 2, leave out lines 11 to 15.
<P>
No. 14, in page 3, line 15, leave out subsection (2) and insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(2) After section 78(2) of the 1976 Act there is inserted-<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``(2A)(a) In this Act, `public authority' includes any person certain of whose functions are of a public nature, but does not include either House of Parliament or a person exercising functions in connection with proceedings in Parliament.''.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I welcome you to the Committee, Mr. Sayeed.
<P>
This important group of amendments relates to the definition of public authorities. As the long title states, the Bill extends the application of the Race Relations Act 1976 to the police and other public authorities. The first part of the Bill amends that Act by inserting a new section 19B. Each amendment in the group amends part of the new section.
<P>
Amendment No. 8 would omit lines 9 to 12, which refer to schedule A1, replacing the list of public authorities with a general proposition. Amendment No. 9 would do the same for lines 15 to 17, which would go because they also refer to schedule A1, as would amendment No. 10 for lines 18 to 20. Amendment No. 11 would delete the lines that provide for the way in which the Secretary of State would amend schedule A. Amendment No. 12 would omit the part that allows the Secretary of State to amend schedule A1 when offices, people and functions change. Therefore, it gives the Secretary of State all sorts of opportunities to vary the list when there are changes in public authorities' activities. Amendment No. 13 would delete the proposed new subsection (7), a sweep-up subsection that allows ancillary changes to be made. The last of the group, amendment No. 14, relates to the schedule itself.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department (Mr. Mike O'Brien):</B> As I have already told the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey (Mr. Hughes) informally, the Government accept his points in principle and will in due course table amendments. That may assist him with the rest of his arguments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> That may assist the Committee as well. The Minister was kind enough to suggest outside the Room that the Government were minded to move in the direction of the amendments, and his formal confirmation of that is welcome. I intended to be brief, so I shall simply put the proposition and then allow him to give the Government's response.
<P>
First, as I said, the public authorities are listed. The Government started from that position in part because it gives clarity and allows the public authorities in question to identify themselves. Moreover, a list of public authorities was tied to the statutory duty to promote equality. During the Bill's passage through the other place, and particularly on Third Reading, my colleagues, including Lord Lester, suggested an alternative approach. They proposed that a list of public authorities with a specific duty to promote good race relations be retained, and that the authorities be defined generically, as in amendment No.14. That amendment derives from the Human Rights Act 1998, which this Government brought before Parliament . It would ensure that the Bill's definition of a public authority is the same as that in the 1998 Act.
<P>
If we are to create coterminous and comfortably coincident legislation, it is important, particularly for those who have to interpret and work with legislation, that the same definitions are used where possible. When the 1998 Act comes into force in October, there will be significant interrelationship between it and the Race Relations Act 1976. By definition, both draw greatly on principles enshrined in human rights legislation. Given the direction in which the Government moved in section 6(3) of the 1998 Act, it is right to argue that they should take the same approach in the Bill.

<P>
Secondly, by definition, one may omit items from a list. One might also want to add items to a list, and the Bill, as drafted, provides for adding to the list of authorities. The list might need to be amended, but that would require that an amending order be sought from Parliament on each occasion. We are all aware that that is a cumbersome procedure, but there is a further difficulty. If a public authority is defined not by a generic definition but as a list definition, those seeking to exercise their rights under the Bill, once it is enacted, would be unable to do so if the relevant public authority had been inadvertently omitted from the list. Retrospective legislation would be regarded as inappropriate, and unreasonable discrimination might occur purely by accident.

<P>
<B>Sir Robert Smith </B>(West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine): If my hon. Friend looks at the list, he will see that the possibility of such an accident is considerable. The list includes bodies that are subject to legislation enacted in the Scottish Parliament, and a change might be made there that was not detected here.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> The presence of my hon. Friend the Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine (Sir R. Smith) is-I hope-helpful to the Committee because that is just the sort of issue that arises. In conversation yesterday, my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Wallace) referred to the way in which issues arising from Home Office legislation-such as the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Bill, the Terrorism Bill and this Bill-relate to the Scottish Parliament. It is important that we do not run the sort of risk to which my hon. Friend the Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine referred.

<P>
Thirdly, under article 14 of the European convention on human rights, which will be incorporated by the 1998 Act, the guaranteed right of non-discrimination applies only to rights otherwise included in the convention, and is therefore limited. That is one of the great debates surrounding the convention. If a privatly operated prison-nowadays, there are many public-private partnerships, and public services operated by private agencies-that was not covered by the legislation discriminated on racial grounds when selecting prisoners for special privileges or training, there might be no remedy under the 1998 Act. Therefore, one would have to refer to the Race Relations Act for a remedy, but that remedy might accidentally have been omitted. We must avoid the risk of omitting by accident not only a body that is entirely public and should have been included, but a body or agency that is partly public and partly private, or carries out a public function it is a private agency.

<P>
<B>Mr. David Lidington </B>(Aylesbury): Has the hon. Gentleman heard, as I have, from Group 4 or other operators of private sector prisons? Group 4 has made it clear that it is perfectly content to be brought fully within the scope of the Bill and has no wish to evade any of the obligations that it would impose.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> Yes, I have heard that; I was pleasantly encouraged by the representations that I have received from Group 4. It positively welcomes the Bill and wants to ensure that there will be no problems.

<P>
In the case of an increasing number of bodies-in the education sector, for example-the boundary may not be clear. If any body that carries out a public function is able to understand from the Bill that it has an obligation, greater protection will result. The benefit of a functional defintion is that it would provide a single, clear point of reference for everyone concerned and cover all bodies that exercise public functions, whatever their technical status. That would avoid the possibility of mistakes and adverse effects on individuals.

<P>
I am grateful to the Home Office for recognising the merit of that approach, and look forward to the Minister's suggestions on how to proceed. If he tells me that there are technical reasons for the Government
 reconsidering matters and returning to them on Report, I shall happily accept that.

<P>
I pay tribute to the Home Office and its officials, who have taken a very constructive approach to the matter throughout this Parliament, especially since the Macpherson report highlighted the urgent need for the Bill. They took on a difficult task in trying to persuade colleagues across the Government of its merit and importance. There is often a natural resistance to legislation in Departments other that the lead Department, and one has to try to persuade people that it represents the right way to proceed.

<P>
I am also conscious, as someone who used to practise human rights law, that one must be careful that one's proposed legislation does not imply that a wave of litigation will follow from it. I hope that the Bill will avoid that and that it will work together logically with other legislation. The passage of the Bill has shown the benefit of a two-Chamber Parliament and proper deliberation. Legislation that is not rushed through ultimately emerges in a better state.

<P>
The amendments are constructive, and I hope that they will find favour with the Committee.

<P>
<B> Mr. Lidington:</B> I, too, start by welcoming you to the Chair for your first sitting of the Committee, Mr. Sayeed. I believe that this is also the first time that you have chaired a Standing Committee.

<P>
I closely read the record of debates in another place, and have a great deal of sympathy with the line of argument of the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey. I find it difficult to understand why the Government are opposed to a generic description of a public body and prefer the method of designating particular bodies or categories of body in the schedule. At the extreme end of logical argument, there is a risk that some activities of a public body not listed in the schedule would be subject to race relations legislation, because they were defined by the Amin judgment as falling within the remit of the Race Relations Act 1976, but others would be outwith the scope of any race relations legislation.

<P>
The Government are now prepared, sensibly, to adopt the approach advocated by the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey. I would be interested to know more about the Government's reasoning for that and to hear from the Minister the reason for the position that they took in the other place. My hon. Friends and I will examine the wording of any Government amendments that are tabled in Committee or on Report.

<P>
<H5>10.15 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
I have one question to which the Minister may be able to reply today, but, if not, perhaps he will write to me. During debate on the Human Rights Bill, disquiet was expressed in both Houses about the organisations that might be caught by the definition of a public body. There was discussion on whether churches could be considered to be public bodies and, therefore, bound by the Act. I wondered whether such considerations were behind the Government's resistance in the other place to a generic description of public body.

<P>
I hope that the Minister will be able to assure the Committee, either now or in Government amendments, that the definition of a public body will apply to what reasonable people would assume to be public bodies-arms of Government, whether organisations that are part of the Government machine or those acting in accordance with a Government contract-and not extend to organisations that might be defined as having a public function but which, like churches and other faith communities, would be thought, rightly, by most people to be independent and outside the scope of the Government and the public sector. I look forward to the Minister's response.

<P>

<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I join other members of the Committee in welcoming you to the Chair, Mr. Sayeed, and assure you that on your first occasion as Chairman we all intend to behave ourselves.

<P>
I thank the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey for the way in which he moved his amendment. The Home Office's approach to Bills has been to listen carefully to arguments during debate and not to be afraid of amending a Bill if that is the right thing to do. It is a sign of the Government's strength and of the Home Office in particular that we are prepared to listen to the arguments.

<P>
The amendments relate to the definition of public authority for the purposes of the Bill. The choice is between a list approach-as used, for example, in the Freedom of Information Bill-and a generic definition approach, as used in the Human Rights Act. As has been mentioned, the issue was debated at some length in another place, at which time the Government believed that their original listing approach was preferable. However, we agreed to take the matter away, consider the arguments raised in another place and decide whether, on reflection, that was correct.

<P>
The Government's main reason for favouring the list approach was that it provided clarity as to which bodies had obligations under the Bill and which were to be regarded as public authorities. That was especially important to the duty to promote race equality. However, the arguments were always finely balanced and we listened to the views expressed in another place, which favoured a generic approach. As this House was also likely to favour a generic approach, we took the view that we could move in that direction. It is possible, to some extent, to have the best of both worlds. A generic approach could be used for the purposes of defining public authorities in relation to unlawful discrimination under new section 19B-with some exceptions, to which I shall return-while a listing approach could be used in relation to the duty to promote race equality.

<P>
We must be careful when dealing with the duty to promote race equality, because it will place obligations on public authorities. We must be sure that it will apply to particular authorities and that there will be no doubt about whether an organisation should implement mechanisms to enable it to promote race equality. We have therefore taken the view that, in principle, the generic definition could be used for new section 19B, although some exceptions will be necessary-indeed, there are already some exceptions in the schedule.

<P>
Furthermore, as with the Human Rights Act, in circumstances in which a body has some functions that are of a public nature, new section 19B will apply only to those functions. The hon. Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Lidington) referred to private sector companies that undertake public functions. When undertaking public functions, those companies will be covered by the definition; when undertaking private functions, they will not.

<P>
A good example of such a company is Group 4, which has been mentioned by the hon. Members for Aylesbury and for Southwark, North and Bermondsey. I join them in praising Jim Harrower and others in Group 4 for their positive approach not only to this race equality Bill, but to the Human Rights Act. As an organisation that provides some public functions-running prisons and carrying out various other duties-it sees its role as one in which it can embrace those positive areas of Government policy.

<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Luff </B>(Mid-Worcestershire): As Group 4 is based in my constituency, I must express my gratitude to the Minister for those comments. I shall ensure that they are relayed to the company.

<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> We shall deal with the question of exceptions by listing them. The exceptions to the generic definition that we are likely to include are, first, issues relating to the making or approving of orders or instruments, or the making or approving of arrangements for imposing requirements under section 41 of the Race Relations Act 1976; secondly, any judicial decisions; thirdly, the intelligence services; fourthly, decisions not to prosecute taken by prosecuting authorities of whatever kind; fifthly, matters of immigration and nationality in which decisions will need to be authorised, to which we will come later; and, finally, proceedings in Parliament. We will be examining those areas with a view to exempting them.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I do not dissent from that list. Will the Minister at some stage set out, perhaps in a letter to hon. Members, a summary of the reasons for each of those categories? We understand the reasons, but that would be helpful. I appreciate that we will discuss some of those issues later-for example, functions relating to immigration and nationality-but having a summary in the public domain of the Government's reasons for exempting certain categories would be useful.

<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I have no problem with doing that. I shall write to members of the Committee.

<P>
The amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey have not yet been agreed by the parliamentary draftsmen. We would like to examine them with the help of those who are more expert than we are in drafting legislation, but we undertake to table our amendments in response to them later in our proceedings in Committee. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will feel able to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> As I said earlier, I am grateful for the Minister's constructive response. Organisations, such as Group 4, which made representations to us, and others that have followed the progress of the Bill and are involved in this area, such as Justice, were clear in their view and argued strongly that a generic definition was the right way in which to proceed.

<P>
I remember from serving on the Committee the many lists of public bodies in a local government Bill on urban development in the early 1980s. Many Bills have schedules that list public offices under the Crown whose holders are excluded from receiving payment or being Members of Parliament. Such Bills have to be amended or altered frequently.

<P>
The Minister will know from his experience in the Home Office that, owing to frequent changes in the allocation of responsibility for carrying out a function, a generic definition rather than a list is better. The list of functions that I have includes the running of prisons and detention centres, transporting people to court and electronic tagging. A wide range of private bodies have public functions. That is an argument for making the amendment. I hope that the phraseology of the Human Rights Act will be adopted.

<P>
I am happy to withdraw the amendment, but, before I do so, I urge the Government to ensure that the amendments are tabled in good time for Report, so that the House can consider the issue. Legislation is always better as a result of being able to see what is coming and to reach agreement in advance. If the Minister is minded-as he and his colleagues have been elsewhere-to have further informal discussions with the hon. Member for Aylesbury and myself, so that we reach maximum agreement, I am sure that we would be happy to do so. The matter may arise later in Committee. We may find that we hold a common view on the objective and are merely agreeing the mechanics. We do not want to repeat our debate, and I know that the Minister has been helpful in that way in respect of other Bills.

<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I would like to make a couple of points before the hon. Gentleman withdraws the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I will allow the Minister to make those points in a second. I am encouraged by his response. The hon. Member for Aylesbury rightly alluded to concerns raised elsewhere in respect of other legislation, and I hope that they will also be dealt with. However, there seems to be consensus that we should move forward along the lines suggested by the amendments. The Government have been very positive about that this morning.

<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> We will use our best endeavours to table the amendments as soon as we reasonably can. Obviously, the parliamentary draftsmen are under pressure from the Bills before the House, but I hope that they will be able to help. I shall ask them to make the amendments a priority, so that we can table them in good time.

<P>
I am conscious that I have not dealt with a point raised by the hon. Member for Aylesbury about the churches. A public authority would be defined as an authority carrying out a public function. When the churches are carrying out pastoral functions such as church services, they are carrying out a private function; when they are running a school, they are carrying out a public function. Therefore, in carrying out their public functions, they would come within the terms of the Bill, so they could not discriminate on racial grounds in running a school, for example, unless there was justification for it. It is not immediately obvious when there might be, but the Bill contains a justification provision. However, they would be excluded where the functions that they are carrying out are not functions of government or another public authority.

<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Lidington:</B> Two points occur to me from what the Minister has just said, which it may be sensible for him to take away rather than give a response to immediately. First, do the Government believe that the Bill imposes new responsibilities and obligations on church schools? My understanding is that the 1976 Act already covers the actions of local education authorities and schools fairly comprehensively. If the Government believe that the Bill will change the law in relation to their obligations, it would be helpful to have an explanation of the way in which that would happen.

<P>
Secondly, I take the Minister's point in relation to the churches. The germ of a question in my mind is whether conducting marriages, for example, given that marriage is a legal contract and not simply a religious ceremony, would amount to a public function in the Government's newly adopted approach. Will the Minister say at some stage how that issue would be approached?

<br>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> As regards the new responsibilities and obligations, the hon. Gentleman is right that the 1976 Act covers nearly all the areas that the Bill will cover in relation to local authorities and schools. However, I want to consider how schools will be organised and whether the duty to promote in local government, which is in the 1976 Act, was passed to school governors. I assume that it was, but I want to check that. New obligations will be imposed in regard to the duty to promote, because areas covered by local government already have a duty to promote. That would not impose an obligation, unless the Bill is further amended.

<P>
The hon. Gentleman's second point related to marriage. Given that we will be using a generic definition, what is a public function will always be a matter for the courts. I shall ponder the issue of marriage as a public function. I suspect that it may be, but I shall write to the hon. Gentleman on that.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> Perhaps I should reveal my other hand. I do two jobs: I am the Liberal Democrat spokesman on home affairs and the Church of England. Therefore, I had better say a word or two-[
Interruption.] Yes, we may have to go elsewhere for an answer.

<P>
It is important to deal with the church matter responsibly. During our first debate, the hon. Member for Aylesbury raised general questions and issues concerning public functions, such as church schools. I am chairman of the governing body of a primary school, which is a public function and I understand the point made by the Minister. The hon. Gentleman was right when he said that the conduct of a marriage by a church, as well as by a synagogue, temple or register office, is a civic, public function and would be covered. However, only parishioners, not any church-goer, are entitled to attend a church's annual parish meeting and, for example, to vote for church wardens. I am flagging up a few matters that may be worth discussing with Church of England authorities and I am sure that they will give a constructive and helpful response. That will apply equally to other faiths when carrying out public functions. We are happy to work outside the Committee, as well as inside, to get the definition right.


<P>
I have reflected on our proposition to remove the three pages of new schedule A1, which lists only some public functions. It refers to Ministers of Crown
and Government Departments, the Scottish Administration, the National Assembly for Wales, the armed forces, the national health service for England and Wales, the national health service for Scotland, local government, which is the longest list, and the police. The problem is that non-departmental public bodies are not included and that is a good reason for the change. The starting point for the amendment is the current definition in the Human Rights Act which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In this section ``public authority'' includes-<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) a court or tribunal, and<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(b) any person certain of whose functions are a public nature,<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> but does not include either House of Parliament or a person exercising functions in connection with proceedings in Parliament.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Minister has indicated that he wants other exceptions from the generic definition and that is reasonable. I am sure that a definition with exceptions is the right way to proceed.

<P>
I am happy that the Minister has indicated that it is in the Government's mind to provide in an appropriate place-that may be with other duties under the Bill or elsewhere or both-the best possible guidance on what is covered. It is all very well to say that we want simple legislation without inconsistent definitions and I am always in favour of that, but people must be able easily to find out whether they are covered. The more we can point them in the direction of guidance-

<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> A list.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> Some assistance must be given for the interpretation of legislation. People should not have to wait for the courts to interpret everything. The Minister said that we may be able to cover that with the positive duty elsewhere in the Bill. That is the right way forward and I look forward to further discussion.

<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The hon. Gentleman has persuaded me to go for a generic list. Now that I have been persuaded of that, I do not have to be persuaded to go for lists also.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> That is the first time in my life that a Minister has tried to stop me from finishing my speech in a Committee. Before I receive further discouragement and so that better things may come later, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 5, page 1, leave out lines 13 and 14.

<P>
The Committee will be aware of the Government's intention to table an amendment to make indirect discrimination unlawful under new section 19B of the 1976 Act. That was announced in the House on 27 January. The decision followed discussions in another place, and was a result of the Government listening carefully to the arguments and following further consideration by Departments. The Government have always been in favour, in principle, of extending the indirect discrimination provisions of the Act. However, we must ensure that such an extension would be effective without leaving public bodies open to routine and unnecessary legal challenge in circumstances in which their policies were entirely proper.

<P>
We have listened carefully to the arguments and considered further the theoretical risks of challenge. We established that they were, largely, theoretical. We concluded that, although the Government implement economic and social policies based on requirements or conditions that will inevitably have a differential impact on different racial groups-whether because of different age profiles or regional distribution-these were justifiable. If challenged, therefore, we believe that a court would be likely to reach the same conclusion and not find them unlawful. Case law in employment and the provision of goods, facilities and services under the Act has shown the courts to have given public authorities a fair wind when deciding cases of indirect discrimination. That provided some comfort, both on the risks to our policies overall, and to those that benefit ethnic minorities the most.

<P>
None of this would avoid the problems of spurious challenges being brought, and we are concerned about that. However, as the Government pointed out during debates on the Bill in another place, the number of claims for indirect discrimination brought under the Act historically has been low. In 1998, for example, less than 1 per cent. of the employment cases were on the grounds of indirect discrimination-that is, setting conditions. Less than 1 per cent. of non-employment claims, the closest comparator to the functions to which we want the Bill to apply, were on the grounds of indirect discrimination. A similar position applied in 1997.

<P>
We concluded, therefore, that we could confidently justify our economic and social policies, and, taking into account the approach that has been adopted by the courts as well as the historically low level of claims, it seems right to include indirect discrimination in the Bill. In our view, inclusion outweighed the need to avoid the risk of having to deal with spurious challenges and we are pleased to have been able to reach that decision. The debates on the matter were serious and detailed, and the theoretical risks were examined with considerable care. We listened to the arguments put forward in another place, following which we were pleased to move to this decision.

<P>
I shall deal with some of the issues that might concern hon. Members. It might be useful if I set out briefly the difference between direct and indirect discrimination. Direct discrimination occurs when one person treats another less favourably than he treats, or would treat, other people. Indirect discrimination occurs when there is a requirement or a condition that, though applied equally to people of different racial groups, has the effect that the proportion of one racial group that can comply is considerably smaller than that of another racial group, or when such a requirement or condition is only honourable if it cannot be justified irrespective of racial group and if it is detrimental to the claimant who cannot comply.

<P>
I shall give some examples of direct and indirect discrimination. The question of whether the police would be affected by these provisions has raised some concern. We have examined that issue with a great deal of care and concluded that, for example, in relation to stop and search, indirect discrimination would not be an issue. Stop and search will not be affected by the inclusion of indirect discrimination in the Bill because it does not impose any condition or requirement that cannot be complied with. Any discrimination arising from the use of stop and search would be dealt with in relation either to direct, rather than indirect, discrimination, or by way of victimisation, which would be unlawful under the Bill in any case.

<P>
If a police officer stopped a black man in circumstances under which he would not have stopped a white man, he would be treating the black man less favourably than another person of a different racial group. That is direct discrimination. If a Department awarded a grant to a black person in different circumstances to those under which it awarded a grant to a white person, the Government would have treated the black person less favourably than the white person. Again, the issue would be direct, not indirect, discrimination.

<P>
We have concluded that the Bill will operate in such a way that indirect discrimination will not cause the Government problems. We canvassed various Departments on whether they considered that any of their policies would be inhibited so as to prevent beneficial effects from reaching ethnic minorities. Having carefully examined their policies, they concluded that ethnic minorities would not be disadvantaged by the inclusion of indirect discrimination, which had been one of our worries. We also believe that no proper function of the Government will be disadvantaged by the inclusion of indirect discrimination.

<P>
We were therefore satisfied that we could include indirect discrimination in the Bill, and are pleased to have been able to do so. I hope that members of the Committee will support the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for tabling the amendment, and to him and his colleagues for listening to, and accepting, the argument that was put in the other place. I and my hon. Friends have added our names to the amendment and fully support it. Because it is the result of considered reflection by the Government, and they have accepted the argument, I shall add only one point to the Minister's comments.

<P>
It would be illogical-and unacceptable to those who have followed the matter with interest-for the Bill to seek to deal with the problems of discrimination in the public sector while allowing a coach and horses to be driven through the legislation. I once did a stint at the Commission in Brussels dealing with the abuse of dominant position by companies working across Europe. One of the big issues was ensuring that legislation did not discriminate in ways other than by simply barring the import of, say, Belgian lager or Italian matches, which would clearly be illegal. If one drew up a specification that effectively meant that Belgian lager was the only lager that was excluded, or that Italian matches were the only matches that were not allowed in, everyone knew that the same objective had been used. That is not unusual or specific to this kind of legislation. We must guard against the unintentional, indirect consequences of legislation and decisions.

<P>
Ten or 20 years ago, the Metropolitan police-followed by the other police forces-changed its rules on height restrictions because it was clear that otherwise members of certain groups in the community would not be able to join the police service. Early representations were made by those in the Chinese community, such as people from Hong Kong who had settled here and wanted to join the police service-some of whom had been police officers in Hong Kong. The average height of that community tends to be far shorter than that of people from the United Kingdom. There are a whole range of reasons why the measure represents a move in the right direction, and plenty of international justification for correcting the law.

<P>
This has been a significant debate on what was probably the most controversial area during the Bill's passage through the House of Lords. It was certainly the area in which the most heavyweight representations were made. Bodies such as the Commission for Racial Equality flagged up their unhappiness with the Bill. When it was first published, people argued that it would not deal with the problem of updating 1970s race relations legislation some 25 years later in as comprehensive a way as they had hoped, particularly in the light of certain challenges and weaknesses. The legislation must ensure a more equal society in all areas of public service, and this is the way in which to achieve that.

<P>
I end with the example of a recent report, which suggested that, in terms of both gender and race, the fire service does not reflect society. Certainly, that is the impression that I get as I travel round the country. I do not believe that those who interview applicants intend to make it difficult for women, black people or Asian people to become firefighters, but that is the result. There are various practical ways-interview techniques, recruitment practices, choice of advertising media-in which one can indirectly create an imbalanced public service. The fire service is an important public service that establishes role models. For example, the television programme ``London's Burning'' is very popular in London. It conveys a strong impression of a good service, but it is also important that it reflects society as a whole. We must get this issue right across the range of public services.

<P>
I am grateful to my colleagues in the other place for advancing our argument. I am particularly grateful to Lord Lester, who has worked on such matters inside and outside Parliament and party politics for many years. He and his colleagues wanted to collaborate with other parties to ensure that the Government were persuaded of our view. I am grateful to Ministers for accepting our arguments, and I am sure that the Government amendment will produce better, more comprehensive legislation. In practice, the work of Sir William Macpherson and his colleagues in respect of the inquiry will be rewarded and valued by those who feel that we are still some way from an equal and non-discriminatory society.

<P>
<B>Mr. Lidington:</B> I have a number of concerns about Government amendment No. 5, but I acknowledge that there is a logic, which the Government now accept, to the amendment proposed by the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey.

<P>
In terms of direct and indirect discrimination, the Race Relations Act 1976 already binds the entire private sector. It also binds public sector organisations, in so far as they and their activities are covered by the Amin case judgment. There is persuasive argument, based on logic and the need for coherence, for amending the law to include the remainder of the public sector in the ambit of race relations legislation. The thrust of many arguments advanced in the House of Lords was that, in respect of indirect discrimination, it would be illogical to exclude parts of the public sector from the law. However, the Government expressed strong reservations. Lord Bassam of Brighton, speaking on the Government's behalf, said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>To outlaw indirect discrimination-<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
in all the functions to be newly covered by the Bill-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>would have uncertain and potentially far-reaching effects on the Government's ability to make policy. Any policy or practice that has a different impact on different racial groups because of a requirement or condition would be open to challenge in the courts.-[Official Report, House of Lords, 14 December 1999; Vol. 608, c. 178-82.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That could include any age-based policy, because of the different demographic profiles of different racial groups, and any regional policy, because of the different regional spread of different racial groups.

<P>
The most succinct definition of indirect discrimination that I could find when I trawled through the literature was probably the one given by Mr. Justice Waite in the case of Raval v. the Department of Health and Social Security, in which he said that indirect discrimination was
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>a form of words which conveniently abbreviates (though it does not wholly describe) a complex statutory formula, widely enough drawn to apply to almost any situation involving a distinction of any kind between races  but rescued from application in artificial or absurd instances by affording on the one side an opportunity of justification and by insisting on the other side upon proof of a consequential detriment suffered by the complainant.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
The aspects of indirect discrimination that I want to explore and on which I wish to press the Minister to make further comments are as follows. How demanding is the test required of the complainant to prove both the fact of discrimination, if it is indirect, and the harm that it causes to him or her? Secondly, how robust is the defence available to a public body that, if discrimination exists and can be demonstrated on the facts, it is justifiable under the 1976 Act and the defence provided there in section 1(1)(b)(iii)? We are not talking about something as self-evidently repugnant as an employer sticking up a notice saying, ``No blacks need bother to seek a job here''. We are talking about actions found by the courts to be discriminatory, even though the organisation may not have intended to discriminate and even though the arrangements later found to be indirectly discriminatory were established for what seemed to most people at the time to be sensible and practical reasons.

<P>
Thirdly, how confident are the Government that there will not be a surge of vexatious litigation once the amendment becomes law? The Minister will understand as well as anyone else in the Committee that on many occasions a public sector body that is not flush with money, such as a school governing body, may find it safer and simpler to settle out of court and perhaps to make a compensatory payment to a complainant, even though it believes that it is unjust to have to do so, simply because it wishes to avoid the risk, the expense and the debilitating drain on the time of a limited number of professional people to pursue a defence through the courts and perhaps through the whole appellate process.

<P>
The definition of indirect discrimination in the 1976 Act requires that four elements must be present to establish the fact of indirect discrimination. First, the requirement or condition applied to the complainant must have been applied equally to all persons, regardless of race. Secondly, the proportion of persons in the complainant's racial group who can comply with the condition or requirement must be ``considerably smaller''-I stress the word ``considerably''-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>than the proportion of persons not of that racial group who can comply with it.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Thirdly, the condition or requirement must be unjustifiable. Fourthly, the condition or requirement must have operated to the detriment of an individual.

<P>
It is important to note that direct discrimination, as defined by the courts, can happen unintentionally. The courts have also concluded that a complainant's inability to comply with the condition or requirement need not be due to his or her race. Discrimination can be established in law if it can be shown that fewer members of a racial or ethnic group would be able to comply with a requirement, at a particular time, even if the reasons for their inability to comply are not necessarily connected with the fact that they are members of that racial group.

<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
The best example of the application of that principle that I can give relates to the Sex Discrimination Act 1975. That Act has a read-across to race relations legislation, which is framed in almost exactly the same terms. In the case of Greater Manchester Police Authority v. Lea in 1990, Mr. Lea claimed that he had been indirectly discriminated against because of his sex. He had applied for a job as an operations room assistant with the police, but was not appointed, because he was in receipt of an occupational pension, having accepted medical retirement after an accident. The policy of the police authority, designed to take into account the needs of unemployed people, was that those who received occupational pensions or had accepted voluntary redundancy or early retirement should not, as a general rule, be considered for appointment.

<P>
At the time of the case, 4.1 per cent. more men than women in the economincally active population were in receipt of occupational pensions. Therefore, the evidence presented to the court was that, whereas 99.4 per cent. of women could comply with the condition set by the authority, only 95.3 per cent. of men could do so. The court found that discrimination had taken place.

<P>
I draw two points from that case. First, the fact of discrimination was established, even though the rules that were relevant to the case were based not on the sex of the employee but on whether or not the applicant had taken early retirement or was receiving an occupational pension. Secondly, Mr. Lea's inability to comply with the condition laid down by the police authority was not due to the fact that he was a man, but to the fact that he was in receipt of an occupational pension and had retired. Nevertheless, the court concluded that indirect discrimination on the grounds of sex had, in fact, taken place.

<P>
The final key point about that case is that it showed that the court was prepared to interpret a difference of 4.1 per cent. as considerable, within the terms of the Sex Discrimination Act. Reading the lessons of that case across to race relations shows that there are causes for concern as to how the concept of indirect indiscrimination on grounds of race may be interpreted by the courts. That and other cases have established that the court will define the group with which to compare the proportion of the complainant's group who are able to comply with a condition, before it decides whether the latter is considerably smaller. It is for the court to decide what is a considerably smaller proportion. The court in the Lea case decided that a difference of 4.1 per cent. was large enough to meet that test.

<P>
Once a condition has been found to be discriminatory on the facts of the case, it is for the respondent-the public body, under the Bill-to prove to the tribunal court that a policy condition or requirement is justifiable in law. The court must then objectively weigh up the balance between the discriminatory impact of the condition and the reasonable needs of the public body that is applying it.

<P>
There are many examples of courts wrestling with such matters. On several occasions, judges have warned of the risk that the burden of providing detailed statistical evidence, or that of spurious or vexatious litigation to seek to prove discrimination, may become intolerable for those who are being sued. In the case of Perera v. Civil Service Commission in 1982, Mr. Justice Browne-Wilkinson said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>On the one hand, the burden is on the complainant to prove his case and, viewed in isolation, the statitistics produced do not prove it. On the other hand, it is most undesirable that, in all cases of indirect discrimination, elaborate statistical evidence should be required before the case can be found proved. The time and expense involved in preparing and proving statistical evidence can be enormous, as experience in the United States has demonstrated. It is not good policy to require such evidence.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In the case of Jones v. Chief Adjudication Officer, Lord Justice Mustill said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The suggestion that it is enough to prove differential impact to throw the burden of proving justification on to the legislator, the employer or whatever by expensive and time-consuming litigation, seems to me to be wholly inimical to the interests of society and the cause of equal treatment in particular.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
I therefore question whether the defence provided in section 1(1)(b)(iii) of the 1976 Act will be adequate to allow public bodies confidently to defend practices that not only they but most reasonable people who support anti-discrimination legislation, consider to be common-sense, practical rules for the services that they provide.

<P>
I want to cite a few examples to illustrate my fear that the amendment could encourage spurious litigation, or even lead to sensible public policies being overturned in the courts. I hope that the Minister, when he responds to the debate, or having reflected on the matter, will be able to demonstrate to me that my fears are groundless. I would find it encouraging and helpful to be persuaded that the points that have been made to me by various people outside the House and aired in some quarters of the media in recent months are based on worries rather than a proper understanding of what the Bill will bring into force.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman accept that, often, it is not the law on indirect discrimination that is incorrect but people's understanding of it? For example, people often tell politicians that the law still allows for positive discrimination, but this Bill, like others, clearly does not. It allows for positive action, not positive discrimination. Does the hon. Gentleman accept that we must ensure not only that the legislation is clear, but that we provide a clear explanation of its meaning, so that people will not believe that it is working to their disadvantage?

<P>
<B>Mr. Lidington:</B> That is a perfectly sensible principle.

<P>
The points to which I wish to draw the Minister's attention are by way of illustration; they are not a comprehensive list. I begin with education, to which we alluded in the debate on the previous group of amendments. Several media accounts of the Bill have stated that it will impact on the freedom of local education authorities or school governing bodies to establish admissions policies, define catchment areas, and-perhaps-select children on whatever grounds the law permits, be it aptitude or ability. However, according to my careful reading of sections 17 to 19 of the Race Relations Act 1976, education appears already to be covered. If my reading is accurate, the worries expressed in the media are groundless, and it would be helpful if the Government would confirm that they share my understanding.

<P>
The Minister will know that question of the police has aroused the greatest controversy and public concern in respect of the Bill. That can be attributed in part to a confusion of the legal notion of indirect discrimination with what Sir William Macpherson has termed ``institutional racism''. The two concepts are distinct, and it is important to disentangle them.

<P>
I should inform the Minister of concerns that were expressed to me not by newspaper editors but by police officers, who have the difficult task of ensuring law and order on our streets. One such concern is the use of stop and search. No one would defend the actions of a chief constable or area commander who encouraged officers to stop and search black people for no reason; nor would anyone do other than condemn an officer who behaved in such a fashion. However, life is more complicated than that. An area commander told me that his chief constable, following the guidance and encouragement of the Home Secretary, told him to rely on intelligence-led policing.

<P>
The tactic that has been shown to deter and prevent street crime is to keep a close eye on known villains and stop and search them. That involves concentrating stop-and-search operations in areas where people with criminal records are known to operate, and keeping them under close supervision, so that they know that the police are keeping an eye on them. The chances are thereby higher that a stop-and-search operation will produce adequate evidence to convince the Crown Prosecution Service that a successful prosecution can be brought.

<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
The officer told me that a number of complaints had been made to him that his officers were stopping a disproportionate number of people from ethnic minority communities in his area. He was concerned about that, so he inspected all the paperwork relating to stop and search over the previous six to 12 months. He found that his officers were stopping a much higher proportion of people from a particular ethnic community than was justified by their proportion within that town's population. ``But'', he said to me, ``when I looked at the individuals who had been stopped and searched, I found that, in almost all cases, they were men known to be involved in street crime, whom sensible, intelligence-led policing suggests I should be keeping under surveillance and the very people I should be telling my men to stop and search''. In that town and at that time that category of people happened to come disproportionately from a certain ethnic group. It would be disturbing if sensible and effective police work of that kind could be made inoperable by the Bill. That is a matter of concern to officers at every level, from chief constable to beat PC.

<P>
Chief constables and area commanders must take difficult decisions about the allocation of resources. I do not intend to engage in a party-political knockabout with the Minister over police numbers and resources. Let us agree that under a Government of any colour, whatever formula is used, every chief constable and area commander will have a limited pot of money and a limited number of officers, which he must then decide how to deploy.

<P>
Different commanders have come to different conclusions. In my authority the chief constable is applying a formula to allocate officers between the different area commands. In London, as we know, there has been much controversy in recent years over sector policing. Local authorities and Members of Parliament from outer London often complained that they were being denuded of cover because police resources were being concentrated on inner London. Those are the decisions that the then Commissioner and his team of senior commanders justified by what they saw as the right priorities for policing the metropolis.

<P>
My question to the Minister is whether the freedom of a chief constable or area commander to set police priorities in that way and to allocate men and resources as he chooses is constrained by the Bill. Could it be argued that, if he chose to give greater or less protection to an area that happened to contain a particularly large ethnic group of one type or another, that freedom could be challenged in the courts?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> That policing matter is not a new issue in the context of the Bill. When the previous Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis was persuaded of the need for a special operation-Operation Eagle Eye-to deal with street attacks, he called London politicians, including the late Bernie Grant and others, to meetings to discuss his proposals. We discussed whether the possible consequence of more young black people being arrested, because some of the affected areas contained more young black people, was justifiable. We discussed the matter so that he could persuade us that, on the basis of the crimes committed and their type, there was justification. He wanted to justify his action, although the law did not require him to do so.

<P>
The test is not a new one for public authorities. If local police and community consultative groups, local Members of Parliament, councillors and so on can be persuaded that there are objective, non-race-related reasons, there should be no problem. Only mischievous complainants would believe that they could succeed in making an argument against that.

<P>
<B>Mr. Lidington:</B> The hon. Gentleman is right to say that this is not a new dilemma. The difference is that in the case which he cited, the commissioner was trying, for good reasons, to persuade community leaders that his proposals were justified on the grounds of good policing. When the Bill is enacted, any individual who believes that he or she has suffered detriment as a result of a police operation or policy will be able to go to law to challenge that police policy and to try to have it overturned by a court. It is important to press the Government on that significant difference.

<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I fundamentally disagree with the hon. Gentleman because he ignores a number of cases and, in particular, the level of burden and the way in which the justification would operate. We believe that indirect discrimination would not have a bearing on intelligent policing nor on the ability of a chief officer to allocate resources. I shall deal with that later because I am conscious of the time.

<P>
<B>Mr. Lidington:</B> The Minister may be able to reply at a later sitting, but I hope that we can have a thorough debate and a detailed explanation from the Government on the rationale behind the reassurance that the Minister and the Home Secretary gave on Second Reading.

<P>
May I finally deal with health? The health service must set priorities and one of the low priority treatments that has been listed by Buckinghamshire health authority, which covers my constituency, is non-medical circumcision. That led me to ponder on whether the freedom of health authorities to set priorities could be constrained by the Bill. Leaving aside the extend to which Muslims could use case law to show that giving low priority to non-medical circumcision indirectly discriminates against them, there is no doubt that there would be a prima facie case for a British Jew to show that that policy is indirectly discriminatory against the Jewish community. A similar point could arise in respect of a decision by a health authority to give high or low priority to the treatment of or research into any medical condition that happens to affect disproportionately a particular racial or ethnic group. Sickle cell anaemia is an obvious example.

<P>
There is a question for the Government to answer on health. I received a written answer from a Health Minister a few weeks ago suggesting that the Department is still consulting its lawyers on whether extending the law to indirect discrimination would make a difference to the freedom of health authorities and trusts to set their own priorities as they see fit.

<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?

<P>
<B>Mr. Lidington:</B> It might be more straightforward if we resume our discussion this afternoon, when I shall allow the Minister to intervene.

<P>
