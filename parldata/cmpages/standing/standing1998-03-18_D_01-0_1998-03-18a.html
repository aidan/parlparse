<P>

</P>
<H4><center>Clause 1</center></H4>
<H4><center>Welfare of animals kept in quarantine 1981 c. 22</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paul Flynn </B>(Newport, West): Good morning, Mr. Winterton. I shall be uncharacteristically brief this morning, which is not to set a precedent for the Bill. It is a simple Bill with one significant provision for animal welfare. It is surprising to many of us that there are no mandatory rules covering animal welfare in the 81 kennels and other establishments in which quarantined animals are held.
<P>
The Bill has two objectives: to strengthen the laws covering the security of kennels and to ensure that inspectors from the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food may inspect them. Distressing evidence exists and Passports for Pets quoted 100 cases of animals suffering greatly in quarantine kennels suffering which is in addition to the anxiety and distress felt by animals and owners when they are separated for six months. That is bound to be upsetting for companion animals.
<P>
The first part of the clause deals with rule ID 50, which was drawn up to ensure that kennels are secure so that any rabies could not spread from animal to animal or from animal to human, and that kennels are built and maintained in a way that prevents that possibility. To make the provisions more comprehensive, it is necessary for the clause to be inserted into the Animal Health Act 1981.
<P>
The second part of the clause refers to "animals and other things", which are listed in the notes on clauses and include a large group of members of the animal kingdom. It provides Ministers with the power to set mandatory welfare standards for animals kept in quarantine premises. The majority of quarantine kennels are well run, but a recent inspection revealed that two kennels which had accepted the voluntary standards had not maintained those standards. Most quarantine kennels were above the required standard, but three refused to abide by the voluntary code and there is evidence that they are falling below the required standard. At the end of 1996, the Quarantine Kennel Owners Association wrote to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, suggesting that four reforms were necessary.

which cover security. The association said that

The association pointed out other defects in the law and said that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"For far too long facilities that are clearly unsatisfactory, not only from poor maintainance, but also from the way that they are managed, have apparently been condoned by the Ministry and have brought the whole industry into disrepute."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We are not here to knock the industry or to anticipate any other possible changes that may be made to the quarantine regulations, which are outside the scope of the Bill. If changes were made to the quarantine regulations as advocated in the Reform of Quarantine Regulations Bill, there would still be a need for the clause to be inserted into the 1981 Act, because we shall always need some form of quarantine for animals coming from countries in which rabies is widespread and endemic.
<P>
I commend this modest Bill to the Committee. It will make a significant improvement to animal welfare and will help us reduce man's inhumanity to animals.
<P>
<B>Mr. Alan Clark </B>(Kensington and Chelsea): I support the Bill promoted by the hon. Member for Newport, West (Mr. Flynn). That support is founded in quite a late conversion to the issue. In common with many hon. Members, I have received much correspondence recently about reforming or abolishing the quarantine laws. Hitherto, I have always responded to such correspondence by arguing that rabies is a dreadful disease, that we are completely free of it and that to some extent we have had to pay the price for keeping our country free of it. However, that argument generated a return correspondence, in which many constituents and members of the public drew my attention to the horrendous experiences that their pets have suffered in quarantine kennels. That led me to inquire what level of supervision or powers of intervention were vested in the authorities. The answer was practically none.
<P>
I am completely converted to the argument that the Bill is necessary and will relieve animals of a great deal of hardship. It is incumbent on the House to get it on to the statute book as soon as possible.
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Mr. Jeff Rooker):</B> I should like briefly to add to what my hon. Friend the Member for Newport, West and the right hon. Member for Kensington and Chelsea (Mr. Clark) have said. The Billl is important. I was unaware of the gap in the law until just after taking office and receiving representations I reply to hon. Members' letters on the issue.
<P>
We are discussing, not the wider issue of reform of the quarantine laws, but welfare in kennels. Officials and lawyers from whom I sought advice informed me that, until about 10 years ago, the Ministry was thought to have some authority and legal powers in that respect. However, lawyers considered the matter, and decided that, on the evidence available, the Ministry did not have sufficient legal authority to lay down and to police welfare conditions.
<P>
The Government welcome the opportunity that my hon. Friend's Bill provides. If the House and the other place will it, I am pleased to say that my hon. Friend intends it to come into force soon afterward.
<P>
The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food will police the Bill. Our inspectors visit quarantine kennels at least four times a year, so it is quite easy to adapt the regulations that we can place on kennel owners. I have visited only one quarantine kennel; it would probably be quite inappropriate to disclose which. I assure the Committee that it was one of our top kennels: I was very impressed with conditions there. However, I also spoke to pet owners whom I met that day, one of whom had searched through 15 quarantine kennels before she found one that she was happy to place her beloved pet in for the necessary six months.
<P>
The Bill will enable the Government to include quarantine kennel owners who freely admit that they do not want to participate in the voluntary code. We are at liberty to disclose such owners: in a parliamentary answer recently, I disclosed all those who comply with the code. We hope that pet owners will take cognisance of that. The existence of kennel owners who do not want to comply begs the question, why not?
<P>
When the Bill is on the statute book, it will be incumbent on the authorities that impose quarantine on pet owners to ensure vigorously that every possible endeavour is taken to ensure that the welfare of animals is uppermost during their quarantine. That will be the case for however long quarantine is maintained, and regardless of the result of the current consultation and of the findings of the expert group under Professor Kennedy. It is incumbent on the authorities that impose quarantine on pet owners to ensure that every possible endeavour is made to make the welfare of those animals paramount during their quarantine.
<P>
<B>Mr. Desmond Swayne </B>(New Forest, West): Has the Minister given any estimate of potential extra costs? A number of people in the industry are worried about the uncertainties facing them, because of the uncertainty surrounding the quarantine regulations. Will the Minister say something to allay those fears?
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I am probably unable to do so in the terms of the hon. Gentleman's question. We do not have powers to regulate welfare standards, and therefore do not have reports of welfare standards in that respect. Some of the existing rules in some quarantine kennels are open to question in terms of their structure and the security of access to the kennels for vans. Some operators work purely as carriers of animals between the ports of entry and quarantine kennels, and I occasionally receive reports that not all carriers are able to manoeuvre their van securely into the entrances of some kennels, which have to be fully covered. There may be problems in that respect, but people in the industry say that they cannot make the necessary investment because of the uncertainty.
<P>
I am not able to give the hon. Gentleman the reassurance that he seeks. I cannot nor can anyone prejudge the report from Professor Kennedy and his colleagues, but it is expected fairly soon the target date, which has not been changed, was some time between the end of April and the end of May. Professor Kennedy and his colleagues are assessing the options, and if any prove to be acceptable for full-scale consultation, we are committed to enter into that.
<P>
The Bill does not place an onerous burden to secure the welfare of pets on quarantine kennel owners. It will give us the opportunity in due course to give a better seal of approval to those kennels with good welfare standards, and to highlight that to pet owners, which is not quite possible at present. At present we can publish a list of those kennels that support a voluntary code, but the Bill will introduce a mandatory code.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Maclean </B>(Penrith and The Border): I, too, wish to speak briefly in support of this modest but good Bill. I look forward to the Minister's five-star hotel rating system. The Minister visited an excellent quarantine kennel, and I could remark facetiously that I have never yet known a civil servant take a Minister to visit a really bad one. Ministers usually visit the best.
<P>
The majority of quarantine kennels have good welfare standards, but those of us who are pet owners still want those kennels to be run in a way that is in keeping with the way in which we have spoiled our pets at home. I can well understand that the Minister receives letters of complaint about quarantine kennels, even when those kennels have the highest welfare standards. The owners complain merely because the kennels have not taken care of Fido in the way in which they would take care of him.
<P>
I think that the quarantine system will continue for some considerable time, but not necessarily for dogs if microchip technology is harnessed to the extent that we think possible. I look forward to the Kennedy review, as it could be possible to link electronic systems to vaccination in the future. I am absolutely convinced that vaccinating a dog twice over a six-month period with an electronic chip system is a workable system provided that it is provable that the pet before the Customs officer is the one on the certificate. It is not the technology that will let the Government down, but the proof of it. Quarantine kennels will have a role in the future possibly a revised role because when people present pets, that they claim have been vaccinated and microchip-injected, it will not be possible at every port, I suspect, for Customs officers to check those animals.

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I always hesitate to intervene when an Opposition spokesman is holding forth, but the right hon. Gentleman is going slightly wide of the llimited private Member's Bill before us.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> I was coming back to the point, Mr. Winterton. Quarantine kennels will be needed for some time, if perhaps in the different form of holding centres for animals that come to the country from which their owners can collect them after 24 or 48 hours once they have been properly screened. They may be used for those short periods, or may be used for other species that will probably not have pet passports or identification systems, so I believe that quarantine kennels will exist for some time.
<P>
If that is so, it is important that the highest standards of welfare should apply to reassure the public and to make sure that the minority of quarantine premises[Mr. Maclean]
owners who are the bad boys are weeded out and do not give a bad name to the vast majority who are dedicated to animal welfare and provide an excellent service. I support the Bill.
