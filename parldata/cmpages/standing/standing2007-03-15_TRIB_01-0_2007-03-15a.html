					<a name="07031534000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">Good morning,
Mrs. Humble. I welcome you to the Chair. I am looking
forward to renewing the close working relationship that you and I had
on the Select Committee on Work and Pensions not so long ago.</div>
					<a name="07031534000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am extremely pleased that the
Committee&#146;s programme has been agreed through the usual channels
in an amiable way. I am grateful to those who took part in that
process. I expect that our proceedings will be pleasant, although I
hope not too long an experience. The last time that I served on a
Committee, we discussed the Company Law Reform Bill, which had 925
clauses and is the longest Bill that has ever been introduced to
Parliament. That Committee was also notable for a further reason: since
her child care provision failed, my hon. Friend the Member for 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column4" />Column number: 4</div>
						Burnley (Kitty Ussher) had to bring her one-year-old
daughter with her to all the sittings. So long were our deliberations
that the young girl learned to walk. Indeed, when needing a break, many
hon. Members were seen holding the baby&#146;s arms and strutting
down the corridor with her. We cannot offer such nice distractions on
this Committee, so we shall have to make what positive steps we
can.</div>
					<a name="07031534000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is a good
Bill. It was well received in the House of Lords, and I pay tribute to
my colleague there, Baroness Ashton, whose open-minded, co-operative
approach I intend to emulate, since I am sure that the Bill can be
improved and that its rationales can be probed so that we understand it
better. It will transform the Tribunals Service of this country, which
plays such a vital role in relations between the individual and the
state, adjudicating independently. It will introduce other beneficial
changes to help the indebted who need help and who cannot pay, and
enforce debts against those who will not pay. Finally, it will assist
the museums and art galleries of the country to obtain loans of
cultural objects without
risk.</div>
					<a name="07031534000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">I look forward
very much to our deliberations. I welcome my hon. Friends and gentlemen
and ladies on the Opposition Benches to the Committee and look forward
to some co-operative, helpful and improving
work.</div>

pleasure to serve for the first time under your chairmanship,
Mrs. Humble.</div>
					<a name="07031534000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">I certainly endorse what the
Minister said about the Bill. We support it in principle and we endorse
much of its detail. We wish to probe some matters, and there may even
be areas on which we shall push the hon. and learned Lady quite hard,
particularly when we reach parts 3 and 4, which deal with bailiffs and
powers of entry. In the main, we support the Bill. It has a lot of
detail, but if we move at a sensible place I am sure that we shall get
through it and give it proper scrutiny. I support the programme
motion.</div>

served on a Public Bill Committee as opposed to one of the myriad other
predecessor Committees on which&#151;with some exceptions&#151;I
have had the pleasure of serving. I share the view of the hon. Member
for North-West Norfolk that the controversial parts of the Bill come
later, in parts 3 and
4.</div>
					<a name="07031534000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should like to
raise one further matter, if I may.The Minister has tabled a
second motion about evidence, which she will no doubt move in a second.
The guidance notes sent to Members on Public Bill Committees
state:</div>
					<a name="07031534000262"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
programme for oral evidence will be included in the programme motion
agreed by the Programming Sub-Committee and proposed by the Minister at
the first meeting of the Public Bill Committee. The motion is
debatable.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07031534000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">I seek your
guidance, Mrs. Humble. I want to propose that we take oral
evidence from two organisations, so I assume that that request should
come under the next motion for discussion, although the leaflet
suggests that it might covered by the one we are considering. I shall
take your guidance.</div>

						</b> The purpose of the clause is manifest. It puts
beyond doubt the fact that the tribunal judiciary are independent of
the Executive. It does so by ensuring that the duty on the Lord
Chancellor and other Ministers of the Crown to uphold the continued
judicial independence of the judiciary, which is enshrined in section 3
of the Constitutional Reform Act 2005, extends to all the tribunals for
which the Lord Chancellor is responsible. That includes the employment
tribunals in Scotland and criminal injuries compensation appeal panel
adjudicators appointed by Scottish Ministers under section 5 of the
Criminal Injuries Compensation Act 1995. The guarantee also covers
non-legal members of tribunals, as well as the legally qualified
ones.</div>

Baird:
						</b> Taken together, this clause and schedule 1 create
the post of senior president of tribunals. They set out the procedure
for filling that post and provide for him to
represent the views of tribunal members&#151;an important provision.
We indeed have a &#147;him&#148; designate at the moment, although
his post rather than his gender is designated and we hope to turn it
quickly into a reality. As I am sure everybody knows, Lord Justice
Carnwath is the senior president designate. The clause and schedule
closely follow Sir Andrew Leggatt&#146;s recommendation that the
leadership of the tribunals system should
promote</div>
					<a name="07031534000264"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;by leadership
and co-ordination, both consistency of decision-making and uniformity
of practice and

					<a name="07031534000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
senior president will be a free-standing senior judicial official who
will oversee the tribunal judiciary, and his powers and duties are set
out in the Bill. Furthermore, not only is his office clearly
independent of the Executive, but in carrying out his functions, the
senior president will not be subject to the direction of the chief
justices responsible for the courts. Clause 2 places a duty on the
senior president to ensure that tribunals are accessible, that
proceedings are fair and are handled quickly and efficiently, that
members are expert and that innovative dispute resolution methods are
developed in respect of the type of cases that come before tribunals.
Those criteria are based on the long-standing principles underlying the
jurisdiction of tribunals which go back to the Franks report in the
1950s.</div>
					<a name="07031534000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">The White Paper

ensure that the right person of the right calibre is appointed.
Schedule 1 provides two possible routes by which any vacancy for the
senior president position may be filled. The first will be when the
Lord Chancellor, the Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales, the Lord
President of the Court of Session and the Lord Chief Justice of
Northern Ireland all agree on the nomination of a lord or lady justice
of appeal, or a member of the inner house of Court of Session, as a
suitable candidate.</div>
					<a name="07031534000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
an alternative, the Lord Chancellor wouldask the Judicial
Appointments Commission to selecta candidate for
recommendation for appointment.The process for doing that
follows as closely as is appropriate the process under the
Constitutional Reform Act 2005 for appointing heads of
division.</div>
					<a name="07031534000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
successful candidate will be appointed by Her Majesty the Queen. To
underpin the independenceof the role, the senior president,
unless disabled by a permanent infirmity or incapacitated from
resigning, may be removed from office only by Her Majestyon an
address presented to her by both Houses of
Parliament.</div>

Bellingham:
						</b> We certainly support this part of the Bill.
The hon. and learned Lady made a point about the Judicial Appointments
Commission. We supported the Constitutional Reform Act 2005 because one
ofthe key principles behind it was the separation of
powers&#151;that is, that the process of judicial selection should be
totally separate from the Executive. Obviously, taking the power away
from the Lord Chancellor and putting it into the hands of the
commission was an important part of that Act.</div>
					<a name="07031534000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have a question about the
clause. Obviously, the Lord Chancellor himself will appoint the person
tothe office of senior president. I take on board the
Minister&#146;s point about the default position in respect of the
Judicial Appointments Commission, but may I ask how that ties in with
the 2005 Act?</div>
					<a name="07031534000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want
to make another quick point. We support the whole essence of trying to
bring the tribunals together into one consolidated organisation.
However, how will Parliament be involved in scrutinising how the new
process works? Obviously, we can question Ministers; the Select
Committee on Constitutional Affairs will call evidence at different
times in different inquiries. However, will the Minister comment
briefly on how Parliament will be able to scrutinise how the new
process will
work?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07031534000314"></a>Simon
Hughes:
						</b> The initiative is welcome. Bluntly, the Tribunals
Service has long lacked both coherence and co-ordination, and somebody
should be seen to be leading it. As we all know from our communities
and constituencies, that is an important part of the process. The
Tribunals Service probably has more people going through its doors than
the courts, and certainly more than the non-criminal courts. Given that
some tribunals are territorial, and limited to either England and
Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland, I assume 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column8" />Column number: 8</div>
						that the implication is that the president looks
after and speaks on behalf of all of them. Is it envisagedthat
someone will be chosen, who will come under the president, whose
particular role will be to speak for the Northern Ireland, Scotland or
England and Wales tribunals? In other words, if a particular issue
arisesin one of the jurisdictions within the UK, is there
someone within the process who will lead on
that?</div>

						</b>
						<b class="B"> </b>The appointment is not made by the Lord
Chancellor under either route; it is made, on his recommendation, by
Her Majesty the Queen. The purpose of outlining the first way forward
to the appointment of a senior president is that if an obvious
candidate emerges from the judiciary and consequently comes from that
independent source, it might be appropriate for the Lord Chancellor,
having been consulted, to sanction that appointment. In default of
absolute consensus among the judiciary&#151;essentially a proposal
coming from the judiciary&#151;it is appropriate that the appointment
should be made in the ordinary way by the Judicial Appointments
Commission.</div>
					<a name="07031534000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">If I have
understood the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk correctly, he is
asking how the Judicial Appointments Commission will be scrutinised by
Parliament. My understanding&#151;I shall write to correct it if I am
not accurate&#151;is that the commission will prepare an annual
report that will be presented to Parliament and debated.</div>
					<a name="07031534000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">To answer the territorial
question asked by the hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey,
the position is that it will be the senior president&#146;s role to
make representations on behalf of the tribunals, and he will serve all
the jurisdictions. Therefore, he is the voice of the Tribunals
Service.</div>

spells out our intentions regarding the next steps, and states that
there will be consultation at every stage. It seems to me to be correct
to say that there needs to be some formula by which working practices,
once they emerge, can be checked by Parliament to ensure that they are
functioning accurately. However, I cannot tell the hon. Gentleman now
specifically how that will occur beyond a Member who is troubled
raising it in the ordinary way on the Floor of the House. Some

more unified leadership within the tribunals&#146; judiciary. My

							<a name="07031534000324"></a>Vera
Baird:
						</b> Clause 3 provides for the creation of two new
generic tribunals&#151;a first-tier tribunal and an upper
tribunal&#151;over which the senior president will preside. The upper
tribunal is to be a superior court of record. Each tribunal will
consist of judges&#151;its legally qualified members&#151;and other
members. Establishing a single, two-tier structure for tribunals will
lead to a simpler, more coherent tribunals system that will be flexible
enough to accommodate the needs of different users and different
jurisdictions, both now and in the
future.</div>
					<a name="07031534000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">The first-tier
tribunal will be the first instance tribunal, and will hear appeals
from the original decision-making body. The upper tribunal will be
primarily, but not exclusively, an appellate tribunal from the first
tier. Both are intended to be adaptable and able to take on any
existing or new tribunal 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column10" />Column number: 10</div>jurisdictions. In future, when Parliament decides to create a new appeal
right or jurisdiction, it will not need to create a new tribunal to
administer it.</div>
					<a name="07031534000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">Because
of its specialist nature, the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal will act
as a separate pillar of the new structure outside the new legal
framework, although the Bill is sufficiently flexible to allow for
future transfer if appropriate. We would not, however, exercise that
ability to transfer unless the Home Secretary agreed, and as the
tribunal will remain outside the new generic tribunals, the associated
rule-making power will also remain with the Lord Chancellor in respect
of the AIT and not move to the new tribunal procedure
committee.</div>
					<a name="07031534000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">For similar
reasons, the employment tribunals and the Employment Appeal Tribunal
will also act as separate pillars of the new structure, remaining
outside the new framework for the unified system, but the AIT and the
EAT will still enjoy the benefits of the single administrative
structure of the Tribunals
Service.</div>
					<a name="07031534000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those reforms
will ensure that, as Sir Andrew Leggatt recommended, tribunals will be
independent and separate from the Departments that make the decisions
under review. They will deliver more than just a federation of existing
tribunals. They will produce a framework within which tribunal users
will be ableto benefit from authoritative, timely, consistent
and comprehensible decisions. They will deliver a cost-efficient system
providing good value for the taxpayer, and as Sir Andrew Leggatt
prescribed, they will be fit for the users for which they are
intended.</div>

						</b> I beg to move amendment No. 2,in
clause  4, 
page 3, line 6, leave out
&#145;judge&#146; and insert &#145;legal
member&#146;.</div>
					<a name="07031534000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
essence of the amendment concerns the use of the word
&#147;judge&#148;. The Committee will recall that Sir Andrew
Leggatt was at great pains to emphasise that tribunals exist for users,
as the hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey pointed out.
Tribunals 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column11" />Column number: 11</div>
						need to be accessible. Day in, day out, we meet
people in our constituencies who have had experience of tribunals. In
fact, many more of our constituents go to tribunals than go to court.
The point of tribunals is that they should be unthreatening and
consumer-friendly. There is a huge responsibility on the chairman of
the tribunal to ensure that the conduct of its affairs is as informal
as possible. That is why we are keen to ensure that everything about
tribunals should be relaxed and consumer-friendly.</div>
					<a name="07031534000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">Does the Minister feel that the
use of the word &#147;judge&#148; is appropriate in those
circumstances? I can understand that there are plenty of chairs of
tribunals who like calling themselves judges. The other day I met
someone at a social event about whom everyone was muttering, &#147;My
goodness, he&#146;s a judge&#148;. It was all hugely exciting and
good for his ego, but in fact he was chairing a tribunal. I submit that
those chairs of tribunals of course do a superb job. I do not suggest
for a moment that we should try to undermine their standing and
credibility in any way. If it makes them feel better to tell their
friends that they are judges, all well and good. However, should the
users of tribunals, who are our constituents, feel that there is that
extra layer of formality inherent in the use of the word
&#147;judge&#148;? I would say probably not.</div>
					<a name="07031534000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">The other important point is
that the Lord Chancellor has the power to appoint people with no legal
qualifications whatever as legal members of tribunals. Those people may
well become chairs of those tribunals. We do not necessarily object to
that, but if people are appointed to tribunals as legal members, yet
have no legal experience whatever, should they call themselves judges?
I suggest to the Minister that that would not really be
appropriate.</div>
					<a name="07031534000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">Earlier
we discussed the importance of the Constitutional Reform Act 2005, the
essence of which is the separation of powers so that judicial selection
should be entirely free of the Executive. However,we find a
member of the Executive&#151;the Lord Chancellor&#151;able to
designate individuals as judges, in complete contravention of all the
principles of that Act. How can a member of the Executive appoint a
judge, when that plainly breaches the principle of the separation of
powers to which the Government claim to be so attached?</div>
					<a name="07031534000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">If we are keen, as we are, to
maintain an atmosphere of informality and want to make the tribunals as
user-friendly as possible to our constituents, the Minister should
accept the minor change proposed in the amendment, which would be in
the interests of the tribunal
system.</div>

								Simon
Hughes:
						</b> In that case, I stand corrected; but the general
point holds. We are having a two-tier system&#151;that has been
agreed by the Committee and it is sensible. The Tribunals Service is
meant to be less formal. There is a strong case for having a perfectly
proper and respectable title at the lower level, but something other
than &#147;judge&#148;. Some people are not legally qualified,
which is perfectly acceptable. The title of chair of an employment,
industrial or social security tribunal and so on seems entirely
appropriate. I would be interested to hear what assessment has been
made of the benefit of a more legal title at the lowest
level.</div>

							<a name="07031534000333"></a>Vera
Baird:
						</b> Unlike the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk, I do
not mind if calling people judges makes them happier. I think that
people should be happier if they can be. We in the Labour party want to
let the sun shine in on all possible occasions.</div>
					<a name="07031534000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">Calling somebody a judge has
absolutely nothing to do with who appoints them or how they are
qualified, and it certainly does not have the remotest relationship
with the separation of the Executive and the judiciary, which we
promoted in the Constitutional Reform Act
2005. Although the hon. Gentleman now talks about how
the Opposition supported the Judicial Appointments Commission, they
were actually dragged screaming to that agreement. There is nothing
about calling someone a judge that compromises the independence of the
way in which they are appointed.</div>
					<a name="07031534000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">The process is well under way.
The hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey hoped to find an
analogy with something that has already disappeared. Immigration
adjudicators are now called judges. People who used to be called
stipendiary magistrates are now called district judges, as are those
who were known as registrars in the county court. There are cost judges
who adjudicate on lawyers&#146; fees, and there are even judges in
the Eurovision song contest, some of whom usually award nil points to
us. There are a lot of good aspects to the proposal to call these
individuals judges. The term &#147;judge&#148; describes exactly
what the post holders will do. They will make decisions about
people&#146;s rights and about Government responsibilities.</div>
					<a name="07031534000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">The purpose of creating a new
title is to give consistency across a wide range of jurisdictions.
Currently, legally qualified members are known by a range of titles,
including commissioner, president, adjudicator, panel chairman, umpire
and even member, which I thought very funny when I was younger. Those
titles do not convey a clear picture about who the
titleholders are or what they do. Nor do they convey
the fundamental message that tribunals are independent of the
Government. Everybody knows that judges are independent, but the term
&#147;legal member&#148; does not carry the same message.</div>
					<a name="07031534000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">Calling people
&#147;judges&#148; does not mean that tribunals will be run
differently. The judges will continue to treat appellants and
complainants as they do now. Theywill give matters the same
consideration and do soas informally as possible. We intend to
retain the informality of tribunal hearings. During hearings, judges
will not need to use their titles. In the AIT, legally qualified
members are known as immigration judges, and senior immigration judges
are usually addressed as &#147;Sir&#148; or &#147;Madam&#148;.
That is the guidance from the tribunal president.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column13" />Column number: 13</div>
					<a name="07031534000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendments echo those tabled
by Lord Kingsland in Grand Committee. We resisted them then and we
resist them now. In doing so, we have the support of Mr.
Justice Hodge, the president of the AIT, and Mr. Paul
Shaerf, the president of the Council of Immigration Judges, both of
whom wrote to me expressly on this matter. Mr. Justice Hodge
wrote:</div>
					<a name="07031534000266"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I know
that there is very widespread support within the tribunals judiciary as
a whole for the use of the title to be adopted. The adoption of the
title will be seen by them as a recognition of the important work that
is done by the Tribunals Service for the administration of justice as a
whole. Further, I believe every effort should be made to maintain and
promote the cohesion of the judicial &#145;family&#146; and
conferring the title &#145;judge&#146; on those who adjudicate in
administrative tribunals will serve this
end.&#148;</div>

judges, to establish whether they feel that the changes will have any

						</b> For many people who come across a tribunal, it
might well be the second time that they have been confronted by the
judicial system, unless they are a frequent offender, in which case
they may be a regular. The Minister mentioned district judges, High
Court judges and immigration judges, all of which terms have a
description prior to the word &#147;judge&#148;. Would it not
therefore be sensible to call the judges that we are debating
&#147;tribunals judges&#148;? The Conservatives are concerned that
the name, qualification and position suggested by the word
&#147;judge&#148; is being diluted, which is not
good.</div>

						</b> The prefixes point out what the function of those
kinds of judges are. They are referred to by their staff as
&#147;judges&#148;. There is nothing to be gained by complicating
the nomenclature. I am not sure what the hon. Gentleman meant by
referring to offenders&#151;I hope that he understands that we are
not talking about criminal tribunals. To suggest that the high calibre
of people who are going to be put into the tribunals would, by their
nature, dilute, weaken, or undermine the calibre of the term
&#147;judge&#148; is offensive. Frankly, I suggest that he supports
the clause and discards the amendment as soon as
possible.</div>

Thornberry</b> (Islington, South and Finsbury) (Lab): Does my

&#147;judges&#148; whatever official title is used? When members of
the public who are not legally qualified appear before people who judge
them, they will refer to such people as &#147;judges&#148;. The

not give them the name that appears on the

&#147;umpires&#148; can easily suggest that there is some
particular curiosity about the nature of their considerations. Calling
a person a &#147;judge&#148; makes it clear what their function is.
Furthermore, it is the hallmark of independence&#151;the judiciary is
known for its complete independence. Although my hon. Friend comes to
the same conclusion, she comes from a different point of view. I invite

						</b> Clause 4 and schedule 2 set out provisions relating
to judges and other members of the first-tier tribunal. The hon. Member
for North-West Norfolk asked if I minded him raising
issues concerning amendment No. 2. Of course, I do not mind. However, I
worry enormously when concepts such as diluting the calibre of judges
are tossed about in Public Bill Committees merely for the purpose of
probing. Obviously, that was not wise because we are only just setting
up the new structures and hoping that everybody will contribute and
feel that they are highly regarded members of the new teams.</div>
					<a name="07031534000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Currently,
most tribunals include both legally qualified members and members
without legal qualifications. The qualifications of legal members vary
from tribunal to tribunal. The range of non-legally qualified members
varies a great deal. There are medical practitioners, accountants,
people with experience of disability issues, people with experience of
the armed services, and many other lay members. That structure will
continue.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column15" />Column number: 15</div>

new tribunals will be transferred from existing tribunals, appointed by
the Lord Chancellor following selection by the Judicial Appointments
Commission, or hold their office in the new system by virtue of another
office that they hold in the courts or tribunals. The use of such ex
officio members will enable judges with the appropriate expertise and
experience to be brought into the new structure on the invitation of
the senior president to help out, in
effect.</div>
					<a name="07031534000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some
non-legally qualified members of other tribunals will automatically be
members of the new tribunals. The same principle will apply within the
structure of the new tribunals so that, for instance, a judge of the
upper tribunal will automatically be an appointed judge of the
first-tier tribunal. Deployment will be under the control of the senior
president of tribunals and, in the case of judges drawn from the
courts, that will be in conjunction with the relevant territorial chief
justice.</div>
					<a name="07031534000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">In order to
safeguard the independence of the tribunals, the
judiciary and appointed and transferred-in judges are protected by a
prohibition on removal without the concurrence of the relevant chief
justice. Judges and other members of the first-tier tribunal,
transferred-in judges and salaried members are further protected in
that they may be removed only by the Lord Chancellor and only for
inability or misbehaviour. The senior president has responsibility for
maintaining arrangements for the training, welfare and guidance of
judges and other members of the first-tier
tribunal.</div>
					<a name="07031534000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">Judges and
members will be able to sit in morethan one jurisdiction if
they have the right skills and experience. That is undoubtedly an
advantage. The tribunal reforms will create a single pool of judges and
non-legal members, secure in their independence, free from political
interference, and encompassing a wide range of experience and
expertise.</div>

Bournemouth, East was not for one moment trying to undermine those

as a whole, comparing a chairman of a tribunal who might come from a
military background with, for example, a High Court judge or maybe a
lord justice of appeal. The point that he was making was about the
comparison between the lower-tier legal members and a Law Lord or
Appeal Court judge. I am pleased to be able to clarify that, and we
support the clause.</div>

break that down by territory and tell us how many are women and how
many are men? How many come from the black or minority ethnic
communities? How many are lay people who are not legally qualified? I
support the idea that lay people 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column16" />Column number: 16</div>are coming into the Tribunals Service, and I have always supported that,
but it would be interesting to know what numbers are in that category
and what percentage they make up. I expect that the list might be
immediately available, but if it is not will she let ushave it
at the earliest available moment? There were announcements last week
about widening judicial appointments, which are welcome on the Liberal
Democrat Benches. If we are to know how much we need to do that work,
we need to know the basis from which it

Bellingham:
						</b> We are looking at paragraph 1(2) of schedule 2
and the power to appoint judges of first-tier tribunals. This is a
probing amendment. Would the Minister tell us the meaning of this
sub-paragraph:</div>
					<a name="07031534000271"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A person is eligible
for appointment under sub-paragraph (1) only if the person...(d)
in the Lord Chancellor&#146;s opinion, has gained experience in law
which makes the person as suitable for appointment as if the person
satisfied any of paragraphs (a)to
(c).&#148;</div>
					<a name="07031534000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph 1(2)(a)
to (c) refers to people with legal qualifications. What kind of
influence will the Lord Chancellor bring to bear on his decision under
that provision? What kind of legal experience would make that person
suitable for an appointment? Of course, the Lord Chancellor&#146;s
views in this regard will not appear to be totally subjective. I would
be grateful if the Minister filled the Committee in on what sort of
considerations the Lord Chancellor will have.</div>
					<a name="07031534000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Will the
Minister comment on whether that provision runs counter to the
philosophy in the Constitutional Reform Act 2005? Have Ministers had
discussions with Baroness Prashar, who has done a superb job with the
Judicial Appointments Commission? Has she had any 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column17" />Column number: 17</div>
						input into the thinking behind how those
appointments are going to be made, particularly for those people who do
not have a legal background but who may have a great deal to offer? We
do not want to preclude them being appointed but we would like some
more detailed information. Therefore, it is a probing
amendment.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07031534000348"></a>Vera
Baird:
						</b> We are talking not about appointments
but about widening the pool of eligibility. The
provision does not run counter to the separation of powers or the
principles of the Constitutional Reform Act. If we accepted the
amendments, which we will not do, we would limit the Lord
Chancellor&#146;s power to extend eligibility for judicial office,
and limit the ability to appoint someone who has the necessary skills
and knowledge but who does not have a professional UK
qualification.</div>
					<a name="07031534000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman asked me what sort of person that might be. It is most
likely to be a legal academic or someone qualified in Europe or in a
Commonwealth jurisdiction. In a different statute, these provisions
have already enabled a small number of appointments to the Asylum and
Immigration Tribunal and to the Mental Health Review Tribunal, which
already have these eligibility requirements in place. We see no reason
why they should not be extended to the new first-tier and upper
tribunals in recognition of the specialised fields in which those
tribunals operate. Having particular skills or experience in a
specialised area can be invaluable to the operation of the
tribunal.</div>
					<a name="07031534000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I said,
it is important to remember that the extension of
eligibility is being proposed, not suitability. All applicants will
continue to have to meet the rigorous assessment and the demanding
criteria set by Baroness Prashar, and I join the hon. Gentleman in
praising her and lauding her highly. Rigorous criteria are set, which
will be applied. Merit and merit only will be the criteria on any
recommendation for appointment. I hope that he is reassured and that he
will be able to withdraw his

courts. Most tribunal judges will be transferred from existing
tribunals&#151;the EAT, the AIT or the JAC&#151;to one of the new
offices. We expect that judges from the courts will be deployed in
small numbers from time to time to bring in skill and expertise that is
not readily available, or just to help out. The list of the people who
can be used in that way comprises almost all the salaried judicial
offices in the mainstream core. None of them has a right to sit in the
tribunal; they can sit only if the senior president invites them and
the relevant chief justice agrees. We have made the pool as large as
possible, because the necessary expertise might reside in all sorts of
unexpected places, and</div>
					<a name="07031534000274"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a
District Judge (Magistrates&#146; Courts)&#148;</div>
					<a name="07031534000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">should not be excluded from that
consideration. They are not only experts in crime; they often have to
evaluate technical evidence, and they have a great deal of day-to-day,
real life experience in the lower courts. Some sit on family matters,
too, and undertake such work as licensing appeals, so they have a
diversity of experience.</div>
					<a name="07031534000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">The users of tribunals are
entitled to expect the best arrangements that we can manage, but that

						</b> The amendments are, again, probing amendments.
The Bill states that the Lord Chancellor must consult such persons as
he considers appropriate. What exactly does that mean? I should like to
ask the Minister about the Constitutional Reform Act and the separation
of powers inherent in it, because I am concerned that a great deal of
theBill is moving slowly but surely&#151;indeed, gravitating
relentlessly&#151;away from the spirit of that
earlier legislation, hence the probing nature of the amendments. Will
she clarify those points?</div>

							<a name="07031534000363"></a>Simon
Hughes:
						</b> I have a couple of additional questions, and the
Minister will see that I have added my name to the amendments, both of
which come from the Law Society of Scotland, which raised questions
with the hon. Gentleman and with me. The amendments probe the wider
question of what is behind the organisation of the new system. There
are later amendments about what we will call the groupings of the
organisation, but it would be helpful if the Minister explained the
theory behind the way in which the tribunal system will be divided into
areas. For example, the European Court of Human Rights sits in chambers
subdivided into groups of judges, so that more people can deal with
cases at any one time. There is obviously a logic in having groupings,
but if she could flesh out the thinking behind the provisions, that
would be helpful not only to us but to others who have an interest in
such
matters.</div>

							<a name="07031534000364"></a>Vera
Baird:
						</b> The amendments in the group concern clause 7, which
is about chambers, which is the term that has been selected to define
the way in whichthe new Tribunals Service is likely to be
grouped. At present, in order to form chambers the
Lord Chancellor 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column21" />Column number: 21</div>requires the concurrence of the senior president. The amendment would
additionally require him to consult more widely about the formation of
chambers. Amendment No. 37 relates to the assignment of functions
between the chambers. At present the Lord Chancellor or the senior
president make the order to assign the functions, each with the
concurrence of the other. Amendment No. 37 would also require whichever
of them was concerned to consult.</div>
					<a name="07031534000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">A detailed policy statement has
been published that explains how the order-making powers in the Bill
will be used, a copy of which has been placed in the Library. If it is
inconvenient for any member of the Committee to get a copy of that
policy statement, I am sure that we can bring some to the Committee, if
there are not some here already. The statement sets out how it is
proposed the order-making powers will be used. That document makes it
clear that the Government have already undertaken to consult widely and
fully on the establishment of the chamber structure, as one would
expect with such a new structure. The statement also gives an early
indication of the Government&#146;s thinking on both the criteria for
groupings and possible groups for the first tier, which will be useful
for hon. Members.</div>
					<a name="07031534000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our
starting point is that there might be three chambers. The hon. Member
for North Southwarkand Bermondsey asked me about the
Government&#146;s thinking. We are thinking in the direction of one
chamber to deal with tax and regulation, one to deal with social
security, and one to deal with mental health and related welfare
issues. However, the document also makes it clear that a final decision
on the initial shape of the chambers will be taken only after a full
and wide consultation, which we plan to hold later this year. That will
allow everybody who will use the chamber structure&#151;office
holders, judicial leaders, tribunal users and their
representatives&#151;to have the maximum involvement in the
development of the structure.</div>
					<a name="07031534000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">We plainly have no resistance
to consultation andwe intend to hold it. The only difficultly
in reinforcingthat consultation as proposed in the amendment
isas follows: quite minor changes to the allocation of
functions might subsequently need to occur, yet we would have
encumbered ourselves with a broad duty to consult in every case, which
might be disproportionate.
</div>
					<a name="07031534000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that I have
helped the hon. Member forNorth Southwark and Bermondsey to
understand our embryonic thinking. We shall supply him with a copy of
the policy document, so that he can study it further. I also hope that
I have satisfied the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk that we are
very much in favour of full and wide consultation, but that we do not
wantany subsequent minor changes to be saddled with a
disproportionate demand that we should consult. I therefore hope that I
have persuaded him to withdraw the
amendment.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07031534000368"></a>Mr.
Bellingham:
						</b> This group of amendments looks horrendous. It
looks like the debate could go on for hours and hours, but I assure the
Committee that it will not. The group is really very simple and looks
much worse than it is.</div>
					<a name="07031534000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our approach is twofold. First,
we have tabledthe amendments because we feel that language is
important. I said earlier that the tribunals need to be as
user-friendly as possible. There is a body of opinion that takes the
view that the word &#147;chambers&#148; is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column23" />Column number: 23</div>old-fashioned, formal and little bit arcane. If we want the system to be
as accessible as possible, we may have to look at the language.
&#147;Division&#148; is more purposeful, focused and, perhaps, less
formal. I ask the Minister to consider changing &#147;chamber&#148;
to &#147;division&#148;. She will correct me if I am wrong, but
Lord Denning once said, &#147;It matters less what you say, but how
you are heard.&#148; If we are saying strongly that these will be
informal bodies, it makes sense to change the terminology and use
&#147;division&#148;, which has more consumer resonance than
&#147;chamber&#148;. That is the first raison d&#146;être
for the amendments.</div>
					<a name="07031534000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
should like to probe the Minister further aboutHer
Majesty&#146;s Government&#146;s intentions in relation to the
organisation of the new tribunal system and the different
chambers/divisions. Obviously, we would like those to be called
divisions. Can the Minister tell us a little more about the proposed
groupings? Presumably, the plan is to group together similar
jurisdictions, thus allowing judicial deployment to be as flexible as
possible. Presumably, that is what she has in mind. We must also ensure
that expertise is maintained. How are we going to maintain expertise
within the new
system?</div>
					<a name="07031534000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
mentioned the policy statement. Many Committee members will have got
their copies from the Library. I am not asking her to do our research
for us, but she could make life easier by having copies of the policy
statement put on a table in the Room, because some Committee members
may not have had time to collect theirs from the
Library.</div>
					<a name="07031534000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are
talking about work in progress. The Minister said a moment ago that
there is substantial work in progress and a substantial consultation
taking place. I should like her to confirm that HMG will go down the
subject-matter route, rather than the geography route, in grouping
chambers throughout the country. We are concerned about the work load
of the legal members, particularly the non-legally qualified tribunal
members. When the Minister mentioned that a moment ago, she hinted, as
the policy statement makes it clear, that the Government are moving
away from the current silo system into three main groupings and gave
some details about what those will be. Will we have the same pattern
for the upper tribunals as
well?</div>
					<a name="07031534000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Finally,
will the Minister tells us how the consultation process is going? It is
an important consultation. Are all the different people who need to be
consulted being consulted? What form is the consultation taking? What
time scale is she considering in the process? I move the amendment in
the spirit of my two arguments for this probing
exercise.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07031534000369"></a>Simon
Hughes:
						</b> I shall be brief because I know that this matter
was raised in the House of Lords and that there was discussion about
the names. Unless the Minister is going to tell me that something has
changed in the last couple of days, the courts in this country are
divided into divisions, not chambers. That appears to work well.
However, I am all for trying to use words that the public relate to,
rather than words that sound more Victorian or old-fashioned. I should
be grateful if the Minister would seriously consider the amendments,
which would make the system sound more accessible to the public. That
must be in everybody&#146;s interest.</div>

							<a name="07031534000370"></a>Vera
Baird:
						</b> The last group of amendments that the hon. Member
for North-West Norfolk moved was tabled in the House of Lords Grand
Committee, but not moved. The discussion last time round was, in
effect, held under the present group of amendments, so I shall try not
to be too repetitive but to answer the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
questions as directly as I
can.</div>
					<a name="07031534000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">The proposal
would be to have within chambers, jurisdictions that were similar in
nature and of similar subject matter. I guess that that would also
require similar skills of scrutiny and similar experience. That is what
is in our minds at the moment, and we are thinking of that direction,
rather than geography. We will consult widely, although the
consultation is not yet under way. There will be a full consultation
document in the autumn, and any orders that emerge to set up the
chambers will be subject to affirmative order. There will be a full
opportunity for everyone who wishes to do so to
contribute.</div>
					<a name="07031534000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the
work load, people will be moved in and moved across jurisdictions only
if they agree, so they will have an understanding of their own work
load. Whether the upper tribunal will have chambers to correspond with
those of the first-tier tribunal is a very good question, but we have
not yet resolved it. We suspect that if there were, they would follow
those that we have in mind for the lower tribunal. We are interested in
having input on
that.</div>
					<a name="07031534000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the
timescale, we will start this autumn, and I presume that there will be
the usual Cabinet Office requirement of three months&#146;
consultation. Happily, there will be every opportunity for people to
have some input.</div>
					<a name="07031534000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
other limb of the amendments and the only one that has not been covered
is the chambers. The point of creating chambers is to concentrate
expertise. They will be set up when their nature has been determined by
the Lord Chancellor, with the concurrence of the senior president. The
pointers are in the policy
document.</div>
					<a name="07031534000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">The word
&#147;chambers&#148; will not be in everyday use. The Law Society
or the Law Society of Scotland criticised the word because it thought
that it was confusing and not modern. I am cheered that the hon. Member
for North-West Norfolk believes that language is important and I
suppose that he will give three cheers for the gender-neutral drafting
that my right hon. Friend the Leader of the House announced. We agree
totally that language is important and we are pleased to have the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s support. Indeed, we shall make him an honorary
sister later.</div>
					<a name="07031534000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">To be
fair to the hon. Gentleman, Sir Andrew Leggatt proposed using the word
&#147;division&#148; because it is consistent with terminology in
the High Court. We chose &#147;chambers&#148; because it is
different and is not used daily in the courts. They will call a
tribunal whatever they call it now, but &#147;chambers&#148; as
opposed to &#147;division&#148; is intended to be a little more
flexible because the Court of Appeal and the High Court, which have
jurisdictional divisions, are quite rigid in that effect. We chose a
word that indicates flexibility in
jurisdiction.</div>
					<a name="07031534000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope
that that explanation is sufficient to persuade the hon. Gentleman that
the language is tolerable, and that he will not press his
amendment.</div>

consultation. The Cabinet Office requires it to be three months and
there will be a full paper. We have already started the process in the
sense that we have issued a detailed policy statement so that people
can see which way our thoughts are going and prepare themselves for the
fuller consultation document. It will be the usual open consultation
and anyone who wants to make a submission can do so. I am sure that
Ministers will actively look for responses and input from relevant
people, which is common form. I assure the hon. Gentleman that we have
every intention of making the consultation as thorough as possible. A
whole series of new structures is being proposed and it is important
that we leave no stone unturned to ensure that we get the structures
right.</div>

guarantees of independence, security of tenure and so on for the new
tribunal judiciary. Further detail will emerge in the form of orders
and regulations after we have consulted within the framework, and after
people have had an opportunity to digest how the framework would work.
Those measures will have to be considered by the House by way of
affirmative resolution, so I do not think that the hon. Gentleman need

we can address it on Report&#151;will she say whether the senior

that

question as being a good one and says that it is being considered, such
as my question about the upper tribunals and whether the same system
will be used for them. She has pledged to my hon. Friendthe
Member for Hornchurch to consider a possible amendment on the clause
that we considered earlier, so we have had not too bad a
morning&#146;s work, particularly as hon. Members from my party have

						</b> This is a short, sharp, probing amendment.
Clause 7(2) refers to one or two persons being required to preside over
each chamber. I am intrigued as to why two people are needed, and I am
concerned that two different people might chair a tribunal during the
course of one hearing. Could that happen? It is unlikely, but will the
Minister clarify the
point?</div>

							<a name="07031534000381"></a>Vera
Baird:
						</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. The answer to
his specific question is that one could not change the personnel in the
middle of the case.I recall once going to do a university
disciplinary tribunal case for 10 students who had been demonstrating.
Half way through the summer during which the case was being heard, the
academics on the tribunal went off on their usual interesting
fact-finding missions overseas, and I came in one morning to find that
half the members of the tribunal who had been present for the previous
three weeks had gone, and completely different people had replaced
them. The appellate tribunal had no difficulty whatever in quashing
such convictions as there had been, and there would be a similar
outcome in any other cases of swapping in the middle of a case. So the
answer is no.</div>
					<a name="07031534000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
purpose is one of flexibility. We have not yet worked out, through the
consultation and input that I have mentioned, exactly what the
jurisdictions will be, what the chambers will consist of, and what the
exact size of chambers will be. It is hard to predict how many
presidents will be required to cover each chamber. There might be good
reasons to have two people presiding over one chamber, because of job
sharing,for instance, or other reasons of flexibility. If two
chambers merged to create a single chamber, it would probably be a good
idea to keep two presidents. It is all about flexibility, and there is
nothing to be gained from restricting it while so much is still at
large. I invite the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the
amendment.</div>

							<a name="07031534000383"></a>Vera
Baird:
						</b> Clause 7 and schedule 4&#151;the
latterhas yet to be debated&#151;set up the boundaries of
jurisdiction between the first and upper tiers. Together, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column27" />Column number: 27</div>they impose a duty on the senior president to developa policy
on the assignment of judges to chambersand to enable tribunal
judges to sit across different jurisdictions. Once existing tribunals
transfer in, a wide range of specialist jurisdictions will be brought
together, and it would dilute expertise and damage the service if all
judges and members were expected to deal with all kinds of
case.</div>
					<a name="07031534000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government
want a structure, a grouping of jurisdictions, so that similar work can
be dealt with appropriately by those who have the relevant experience
to deal with it. I call them chambers, but I keep an open mind on that
at the request of the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk. At the
moment, however, the term chambers commends itself to us. The division
into chambers will, I guess, follow the current jurisdiction or
boundaries, but it is intended to be more flexible. The Lord Chancellor
and the senior president can create chambers by
order.</div>
					<a name="07031534000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">Schedule 4
deals with the appointment of presidents by the Lord Chancellor. The
presidents are intended to provide judicial leadership within their
chambers and to guarantee levels of expertise, so that the chambers
will be able to issue guidance on changes in law and practice as they
relate to the functions allocated to their chambers. Deputy chambers
presidents will take on functions that can be delegated when necessary.
Some chambers presidents may be appointed directly; others might come
from the senior judiciary. The Lord Chancellor has to consult the
senior president at all times about such appointments, and if a senior
judge is appointed, he will have to seek nomination from the relevant
chief justice. If no appropriate candidatesfor tribunal
presidents come forward, the Judicial Appointments Commission will
suggest some.</div>
					<a name="07031534000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">No one
will be able to preside at the same time over more than one chamber in
either the first tier or the upper tribunal, but someone might preside
over one chamber of the upper tribunal and a first tier tribunal 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column28" />Column number: 28</div>at the same time. We want to use our experienced and skilled judiciary
as flexibly as possible, and the senior president has responsibility
for policy on the matter. To ensure the openness and transparency of
the system, the senior president will have to publish that policy,
saying how he proposes to assign judges and members. To ensure
appropriate executive accountability to
Parliament&#151;something that troubles the hon.
Gentleman, particularly because of the resource implications&#151;the
concurrence of the Lord Chancellor will be required before the senior
president&#146;s policy can be adopted.</div>
					<a name="07031534000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">Panel composition requirements
will be set by order of the Lord Chancellor; that will be done
jurisdiction by jurisdiction. The number and qualifications of members
assigned to sit on particular appeals must take account of recourse
implications, and scrutiny will be provided. The chamber structure will
enable the system to adapt swiftly as circumstances change, while
guaranteeing the experience and expertise that is so important to the
user.</div>
					<a name="07031534000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clearly, much
has yet to be fixed and determined through consultation, but clause 7
provides a good framework. I therefore move that it stands part
ofthe
Bill.</div>
