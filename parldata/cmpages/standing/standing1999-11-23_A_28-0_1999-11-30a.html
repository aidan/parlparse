<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Loughton </B>(East Worthing and Shoreham): I beg to move amendment No. 696, in page 91, line 4, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and of whom at least three shall be directors of authorised persons.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
On behalf of the Committee, I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Malins. I hope that you will find the experience as satisfying as the previous two Chairmen whom we have seen off. You are taking over the chairmanship as we approach an historic milestone, having virtually reached the Bill's halfway point. How long it will take to debate the second half of the Bill remains to be seen.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell </B>(North-East Bedfordshire): On a point of order, Mr. Malins. I apologise for interrupting my hon. Friend. I got a copy of the amendment paper from the Vote Office downstairs, but they are not available in the Committee Room.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Spare copies will be provided immediately.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> As it is hot, will it be in order for gentlemen to remove their jackets?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Absolutely.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> The clause deals with the compensation scheme in the new Financial Services Authority structure. Although it occupies a relatively small part of the Bill, it relates to an important matter, which gave rise to much debate in the City when the operation of compensation schemes by various self-regulating organisations became expensive for their members.
<P>
Subsection (1) sets up a body corporate to administer such a compensation scheme under a scheme manager, who should be capable of exercising the functions of the scheme at all times. Our amendment would add to subsection (3) a condition concerning the membership of the scheme management board. Obviously, we have no quibble with the election of a chairman and the board itself. However, will the Minister provide further details about who is likely to be serving on such a board?
<P>
Our amendment would insert an additional condition. It states: ``At least three members''-of the board-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``shall be directors of authorised persons.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We wish to insert that condition because, in the past, such a compensation scheme has proved to be contentious and complicated. Bringing together all the SRO compensation schemes-as will ultimately happen-is likely to create scope for argument. Recent figures show that current liabilities for compensation application to the Financial Services Authority and Investment Management Regulatory Organisation compensation schemes amount to about £11 million.
<P>
Those figures may be slightly out of date as they appeared earlier this year. However, they contrast with outstanding liabilities to the Financial Intermediaries, Managers and Brokers Regulatory Association and the Personal Investment Authority-responsible, of course, for the compensation scheme for the so-called pensions mis-selling debacle-which are currently in excess of £103 million and rising. Conservative Members are interested to know how the Minister envisages the compensation scheme working. The other SRO compensation schemes, which have few liabilities, will have to pool them with those of the PIA. As a result, a much larger sum might need to be paid because of the pensions issue. That goes to the heart of how the new merged compensation scheme will work.
<P>
Setting up the board will be difficult, and volunteers from the PIA compensation scheme will be keen to dominate because they will get the most out of it and their liabilities will be diluted among those of several other SROs with relatively few liabilities. However, some sharp-end practitioners should serve on the board. Such people know the business inside out and can therefore have a key input into the working of the compensation scheme.
<P>
Under the amendment, some board members-possibly the majority-would have experience of the relevant issues and would contribute to better-informed debate. Board members certainly need to have up-to-date knowledge of the sector. We are trying to enhance the workings of the board and to make it easier to take difficult decisions. That is because the genesis of the compensation scheme will be difficult, given the many conflicting calls on its funds.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howard Flight </B>(Arundel and South Downs): I add my welcome to you as our Chairman, Mr. Malins.
<P>
I want briefly to expand on the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham (Mr. Loughton). We are dealing with yet another cost centre, in addition to general levies, ombudsman costs and legal advice costs. What is the current estimate of the cost of the compensation scheme?
<P>
The second crucial issue is how costs will be fairly apportioned. That is an issue of examining not only existing compensation schemes but the different sectors of the financial services industry. Some, such as the venture capital sector, have a virtually clean record on compensation arrangements because their business does not give rise to such claims.
<P>
The Bill deals with how the industry looks after other people's money-OPM-and we are concerned about how the regulators will look after the industry's money. The amendment would ensure that industry specialists were members of the board. I was disappointed that the ombudsman scheme, in contrast, lacks industry specialists or representatives from the most relevant parts of the industry. The amendment would also ensure that such representatives were present to keep a general watch on how the industry's money was spent.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell </B>(North-East Bedfordshire): I join in welcoming you to the Committee's fascinating and detailed deliberations, Mr. Malins-you will undoubtedly shortly become an expert on them, although it is taking me a little while.
<P>
The amendment would insert in subsection (3) a provision for a chairman and a board, which must also include members of the scheme and managing directors
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``of whom at least three shall be directors of authorised persons''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The suggestion that there be at least three directors of authorised persons ties in closely with the scheme of the clause, although it must be said that that is similar to the scheme of the Bill as a whole, in that it is designed to give maximum control and flexibility to both the authority and the Treasury-in this instance the authority especially; the chairman would act with the Treasury's approval. There I lit upon subsection (4).
<P>
A glance at subsection (5) proves that my point is well made. Following a provision that the authority may remove the chairman from office, subsection (5) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``But the terms of their appointment (and in particular those governing removal from office) must be such as to secure their independence from the Authority''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
With your legal training, Mr. Malins, you and members of the Committee will recognise that the ultimate independence mentioned in this part of the clause is given to High Court judges, who are removable only on a motion of both Houses of Parliament. Crown court judges are given very substantial independence: they, like most people who sit in judicial office, can be removed only for serious misconduct. The clause does not mention that. I shall not stray too far into this because there may be a debate on clause stand part on which this type of observation is more appropriate.
<P>
Clearly, some board members should be people who represent customers. Of course, being a director of an authorised person does not mean that someone is not representing a customer. Indeed, a director of an independent financial adviser would probably be a highly suitable person to represent customers in the compensation scheme because they would be market professionals who knew what they were talking about, which is by far the most important factor with this type of body. They would be able to give wise advice and guidance on, say, the shortcomings of a pension provider, who would be regulated by the Personal Investment Authority-and this would properly give rise to a claim for compensation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nigel Beard </B>(Bexleyheath and Crayford): Given that in such a circumstance there are customers who are recipients of compensation on account of wrongdoing against them, and that the industry's practitioners will ultimately have to foot the bill, their interests will to some extent conflict. Is it reasonable, therefore, for one side-the practitioners-to be given a preferential position on the board, which will adjudicate on compensation?
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes a good point. It would not be reasonable for one to be given a preferential position, but that is not what the amendment proposes. The Minister may be able to demonstrate wise intention about the board's structure-I see him nodding in a self-congratulatory way, which I find charming. I may not be able to resist sitting down immediately in order to hear what he has to say. However, I shall defy myself for a moment and answer the hon. Gentleman's fair point.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
We are suggesting that at least three members of the board should be directors of authorised persons. That is not to give them a preferential position and I anticipate that the Minister will propose having some representatives of consumers-of the sort of customer who will obtain compensation. One tends to insert ideas into other ideas as one speaks, and I have already pointed out that if directors of authorised persons are also directors of independent financial advisers, they are likely to be representatives of customers.
<P>
It makes sense to have a balance between the three representatives that we suggest-our view is that there should be at least three. I envisage quite a substantial board. I do not know exactly how many the Minister proposes, but I anticipate at least nine and possibly more on the board, which will have wide issues to deal with. If there were between four and six directors of authorised persons, it would be sensible to include some directors, for example, of large pension providers or major fund managers: someone such as my hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham. Such people could provide the board with wisdom and experience.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Liz Blackman </B>(Erewash): I am wondering why the right hon. and learned Gentleman did not enshrine the word ``balanced'' in the amendment.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> The hon. Lady has a good point. We could have drafted a better amendment. I have been known to say in Committee that we could have drafted a better Bill I am not criticising the draftsmen, who are doing a valiant job.
<P>
<B>Liz Blackman:</B> As I have said before, there could not have been a better process for ensuring a competent Bill that will do the job that we all intend it to do. Everyone signed up to the process and was complimentary about it on the Floor of the House. The Bill has taken a long time because we are all trying to get it right.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I am sorry, but I could not hear the hon. Lady's last sentence. Would she mind repeating it?
<P>
<B>Liz Blackman:</B> Producing the Bill has been a lengthy process and we are all signed up to it because we are all trying to get it right.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> Once again, I entirely agree with the hon. Lady. I take her intervention not as a criticism of our efforts, but as encouragement to table constructive amendments, which is precisely what we are trying to do. I agree that there should be a proper balance in the appointment of members of the board. The hon. Lady will come to learn in a long parliamentary career-I hope that she will have the opportunity to learn from substantial periods in opposition-that probing amendments are often tabled in order to tease out important issues. She has illustrated how valuable that is because her contribution-and I look forward to hearing more from her-has brought out my agreement that balance is important.
<P>
Let me return to our point about having at least three directors of authorised persons on the board. If there were four or six, it would be sensible to have two from the provider's side of the market and two from the purchaser's. If a larger board were wanted, three would be sensible. That would provide the balance mentioned by the hon. Lady.
<P>
Will the Minister put some flesh on the bones provided by the generalised clause as to the kind of board that he wants?
<P>
I want to draw attention to the value of three or more directors of authorised persons in the context of subsection (5), which says that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the terms of their appointment . . . must be such as to secure their independence from the Authority''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Although board members can be removed, the intention obviously is that they should have some substantial security of tenure. They will not have to look over their shoulders at every moment to see whether they might be removed from the board if they are not good boys or girls and say things that do not please the authority or, God forbid, the Treasury.
<P>
A wise old friend of mine told his daughter on his deathbed not to spend too much of her life sitting on committees, advice that every hon. Member in the Room has been stupid enough to ignore. However, if the board members are public-spirited and like sitting on the board, the intention is that they will not be kept off it by an overweaningly powerful authority or the Treasury.
<P>
That is relevant because of a key point of the pluralism that underlies the best of British society. If decent people are directors of authorised persons, they have an independent existence and by definition have a paid job. I do not know whether payment will be made for sitting on the board; I imagine that there will be some modest payment, but a substantial proportion of the board members will not and should not look to it for their livelihood. The board members should have a public-spirited approach and an independent mind. That is the advantage of directors of authorised persons.
<P>
I hope that Ministers will accept in principle that that is right and desirable, and that they will therefore accept the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory </B>(Wells): This is the first amendment to the first clause of part XIV and I therefore want to make some general remarks about the compensation scheme. However, I will not try your patience by straying out of order, Mr. Malins, because my comments will show that the amendment is required.
<P>
I hope that it is in order to step back and remind hon. Members that the FSA is doing something of great importance in setting up the compensation scheme. It is also doing something quite difficult, because the compensation scheme will become large and will handle considerable sums. The scheme will be of considerable concern to those in the market who pay for it to be set up, and consumers will want to know that it is properly run and can award compensation in appropriate circumstances.
<P>
To establish the scheme, the FSA will have wide powers in laying down the rules and making the appointments. Indeed, there is a marked lack of checks and balances in the way in which the scheme will be constructed. An example is the statutory immunity that will be granted to the managers.
<P>
I shall refer, not for the first time, to the report of the Joint Committee that considered the draft Bill. Many members of this Committee served on that Committee and, therefore, will have studied the section to which I shall refer, but it perhaps received less attention than it deserved. The submission of the Delegated Powers and Deregulation Committee, printed in the report as annex B, expresses something that I have said many times, but it does so better than I have been able to do. It states that the Financial Services Authority will, in effect, create legislation that will not be subject to any form of parliamentary scrutiny. In paragraph 8 of annex B, on page 73 the report states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``A primary purpose of the draft bill is to create a single regulator-The Financial Services Authority-and to give it wide powers of enforcement. This leads to the bill conferring on the F.S.A. `legislative functions'. The F.S.A.'s `legislation' will not be set out in statutory instruments and so is not intended to be subject to direct Parliamentary control yet it is of far greater practical importance than the statutory instruments which ministers are empowered to make under the draft bill and which are rightly to be subject to Parliamentary control.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Delegated Powers and Deregulation Committee suggests that it can be argued that the exercise of those powers should be subject to parliamentary control in the normal way, but it concedes that that is probably impractical. Paragraph 13 of its evidence states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``it will be the Authority which will have the closest understanding of market conditions, and will consequently be best placed to deal with the detailed issues, including many technical issues . . . But we nevertheless believe that there are some further protections and disciplines which should be imposed in regard to the exercise of these powers.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In a later paragraph, the Committee sets out some of the additional checks and constraints on the FSA that it believes are not just important but essential-indeed, the Government have addressed some of them.
<P>
I refer to annex B to highlight the fact that the Bill will allow the Government, specifically the Treasury, to introduce secondary legislation-which, in my view, is inadequately scrutinised by the House-but that will, at least, provide an opportunity for the House to comment on and, if necessary, reject any such regulation. In addition, the Bill will, in effect, enable the FSA to create legislation through its own rule-making powers. Although consultation will take place on those rules, they will not come before the House under the Bill. However, we may wish to amend that in due course.
<P>
Controversially, a private company-the FSA-will, in effect, be given the ability to legislate. Those who break those rules could be subject to unlimited fines and imprisoned. An important civil liberties and constitutional issue is raised: the Government are delegating, not to a Government agency, but to a company, the ability to create laws. That is why we are constantly seeking checks on the FSA. The check that we propose under the amendment is modest; it would ensure that the board created by the FSA would contain members who could act as an external check and balance on the exercise of those powers. It is in that spirit that I ask the Minister to accept the amendment.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The general question that I have drawn to the Committee's attention is a refrain to which we shall return, probably later in part XIV, but we do not seek to render the FSA impotent unable to carry out its functions. Indeed, there is much in what the Deregulation Committee said. In some cases, there is no practical alternative to giving the FSA such powers, but it is essential that they should be accompanied by checks and restraints in primary legislation. Once we have passed the Bill, it is goodbye to the matter; from then on, the authority will be able to lay down rules that must be obeyed in all circumstances.
<P>
<B> The Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Miss Melanie Johnson):</B> I, too, welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Malins. I recall that we were last together on the Select Committee on Home Affairs, and it is a pleasure to have you chairing our Committee today.
<P>
I shall answer the points raised during our debate on the amendment, and explain the provisions of clause 183. As Opposition Members said, the clause requires the FSA to establish a body corporate to manage the compensation scheme set out in this part of the Bill. Five compensation schemes currently operate in the financial services sector-the building societies investor protection scheme, the deposit protection scheme, the friendly societies protection scheme, the investors compensation scheme and the policyholders protection board. Those schemes will be replaced by a single scheme.
<P>
The Bill will enable the FSA to take forward the basic structure and characteristics of the current schemes, including the current levels of compensation that those schemes can pay out, and build the scheme around a new and more effective framework. That is consistent with the Government's overall commitment to reduce overlap between different regulatory bodies, thereby cutting unnecessary costs and the potential for gaps. Such measures should bring major benefits for business and consumer alike. Our proposals for rationalising the various schemes into one have received widespread support from the industry and consumer groups.
<P>
I agree with much of the thinking behind the amendment. It is clearly necessary for the FSA, when appointing the board of the scheme manager, to ensure that it appoints people who have relevant experience and expertise to ensure that the scheme operates effectively and efficiently. The necessary experience will, in many cases, include experience of the industry, but I see no advantage in making the Bill so specific about the constitution of the board.
<P>
First and foremost, board appointments need to be made on the basis of merit-I am sure that no one would disagree with that. I do not suggest that the FSA would be hard-pressed to find three directors of authorised firms who are sufficiently competent to perform those functions, but it would be unfortunate if the authority was ever unable to appoint a highly suitable candidate because the quota proposed in the amendment had not been met. I shall deal with those circumstances shortly and sketch out what might happen.
<P>
If we were to require industry appointments, the individuals appointed might be thought to have been put in place to represent the sector in which they worked; the three appointees would therefore have to represent three particular groups. That might work for the policyholders protection board, as we would have to look for candidates only from the insurance sector, or for the depositors protection scheme, which would have to worry only about the banks; but there are too many other groups-including insurance, deposit-taking and investment-for every sector to be represented. In any case, we are generally against that. Appointments should be made in the public interest, not to represent particular interests. That is our view on board appointments to the FSA; the same thinking applies here.
<P>
To the extent to which people from the industry are appointed to the board, I would question whether they have to be directors of authorised firms. For example-this is relevant to the points that Opposition Members have raised-a highly regarded chief executive of an authorised firm may decide to retire, but want to carry on working part-time. Would not that chief executive be an excellent candidate, having not only a wealth of experience, but time to devote to the job?
<P>
It may be that in some of the larger firms, a senior manager, who is not a director, might be in a position to serve on the board as the compensation scheme manager. Of course, the FSA needs to ensure that the board has suitable experience and expertise, not only because it will wish to have the support of the industry and consumers, but because it would have failed in its duties in relation to the scheme if it did not do so.
<P>
I am sure that there is some more specific reassurance that I can offer members of the Committee on the likely shape of the Board. First, there is a certain parallel between the arrangements between the manager of the compensation scheme and the operator of the ombudsman scheme, which is established under part XV of the Bill. The board of the ombudsman scheme operator has already been appointed and includes the head of service quality of the Royal Bank of Scotland, a vice chairman of the Skipton building society and the secretary to the Nationwide building society, alongside a number of other people of standing within the industry who have relevant experience in other areas.
<P>
Secondly, the FSA has now advertised in the national press for directors of the compensation scheme. I am relieved to know that Opposition Members do not consult the press for such advertisements all the time. Consequently, they have missed this one. The FSA has advertised for a chairman and seven non-executive directors; that gives a sense of the scope that we are looking for. The advertisements state clearly that the FSA is seeking candidates who have an understanding of the role of non-executive public interest directors, financial services markets and consumer needs. In addition, experience in one or more of the following areas is required: the regulatory framework in financial services markets; overseeing or managing a compensation scheme or consumer service; any financial sector or insolvency law, and on boards or committees. Therefore, a wide range of experience and qualifications are required.
<P>
Another important point that is worth bearing in mind is that the practitioner and consumer panels will be able to comment on the compensation scheme. The panel can express its views on the arrangements for the compensation scheme, including board appointments to the FSA. The right hon. and learned Member for North-East Bedfordshire (Sir Nicholas Lyell) and the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs (Mr. Flight) referred to costs. The FSA has estimated some costs-obviously, they are only estimates. The base, or fixed costs and overheads, will be in the region of £2.5 million per annum. The detail of how that figure has been arrived at is set out in consultation paper 24, which was published in June this year. The allocation will be made under clause 184 to levy authorised persons, and classes of authorised persons. That is covered by subsection (4), which points the FSA in the direction of avoiding cross-subsidy. We shall discuss that issue when we come to clause 184, but it is worth noting the controls on management expenses in clause 194, which will also be discussed later.
<P>
We are all thinking along similar lines about what we expect of the board. As I have explained, amendment No. 696 is unhelpful in that it is too restrictive and might have the effect of moving from public-interest to industry-specific appointments. We do not want to reduce the availability of highly qualified people who could be useful board members. In the light of my explanation of our objections to the amendment, I hope that Opposition Members will see fit to withdraw it.
{**P5**}Mr. Loughton: I was hopeful at the beginning of the Minister's remarks when she said that she agreed with most of our underlying thinking and that we were all thinking in the same direction. However, given that she then failed to take on board the thrust of the amendment, I shall respond accordingly.
<P>
We do not dispute the need nor the desirability of a single scheme that, hopefully, will have cost savings benefits and will be more streamlined, although there are still concerns about cross-subsidy between different parts of the financial services industry, which we shall discuss when we come to clause 184. Nor do we dispute the panel's importance, which will need to be made up of people of high calibre who are chosen on merit, as the Minister outlined. The hon. Lady then made the case that it was not helpful to be so prescriptive about the membership of the panel and referred to the powers of the practitioner and consumer panels. Under clauses 8 and 9-it seems many months ago when we discussed them-there are fairly prescriptive terms for the selection of persons who should serve on those panels. Our wanting not less than three members to be directors which, on the hon. Lady's figures would still be in the minority, would still be less prescriptive than the make-up agreed by the Committee of consumer and practitioner panels.
<P>
It is also slightly grasping at straws to say that a quota system-to use the Minister's own words-could serve to deprive a highly suitable candidate who could be of great benefit to the compensation panel. She then cited examples of retired directors or senior managers. As she has agreed, it is essential to have experienced people from the sharp end of the business who are up to speed with the changes that take place. We all know how quickly aspects of the financial services industry change. Retired managing directors or chairmen could still continue on a part-time directorial basis and could qualify to do so under the amendment, but if they were not as up to speed as other serving directors of authorised persons, they may not be so attractive anyway. We have only to look at the make-up of the proposed ombudsman scheme board to see that there may be some lack of diversity between sharp-end practitioners and those who have made it their life to be professional regulators or to be involved with trade bodies.
<P>
It is an important element of the clause that practitioners should play a key part. It is slightly limp for the Minister to suggest, perhaps unintentionally, that, given that the advertisement has already gone into the newspapers, the board's composition cannot be changed from a chairman and seven members. There was some misunderstanding on the part of Labour Members who suggested that, if certain practitioners could lose out from having compensation awarded against other firms in the City, they would obviously be against awarding compensation. That argument represents the wrong end of the stick because the way in which compensation schemes have worked in the past is primarily to provide compensation to investors who have lost money with a firm that has gone under-certainly the one that is responsible for fund managers of which I am part does.
<P>
The explanatory notes make it clear that we are talking not about compensating for regulatory infringements, which is an entirely different matter, but about properly authorised financial services companies going out of business and leaving investors short of money or stock that those companies held in their charge. It is in nobody's interests-least of all industry practitioners-for a full compensation package to be unavailable to a bunch of disgruntled investors who have fallen foul of a firm that has gone under. One could make a case for saying that industry practitioners will be the keenest to ensure that the most generous compensation package is available to aggrieved investors because problems give the whole industry a bad name.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
There have been problems in the past. Under the fund managers scheme, the compensation package is typically limited to £48,000. That level of compensation has proved ineffective for people who hold large deposits with a bank or stockbroker that goes out of business, perhaps because it is hammered or for other reasons-fortunately, that does not happen often. If we go back to the dark old days before my membership of the stock exchange, when responsibility for the compensation scheme fell on its individual members, the level of compensation was unlimited. When the stock market crashed in the 1970s, with widespread ramifications for the ability of various firms to stay afloat, many individual members were obliged to contribute substantial amounts to the compensation scheme. One could say that the scheme worked better in those days than it will under the provisions for setting a limit.
<P>
Our amendment is in no way intended to give the firms that contribute to the compensation scheme a way out of paying their fair dues to customers of firms that go out of business. Having practitioners of the calibre that I suggested on the panel will put a greater onus on all firms to bear their equal share of the obligations under the compensation scheme.
<P>
The Minister mentioned that the scheme would have fixed costs of £2.5 million. I understand that that is only the cost of employing people in offices to run the scheme and I assume that it is not the value of the compensation scheme itself. Work must have been done on the figures from existing SRO compensation schemes, and we would like further information in that regard. What level of compensation will the combined compensation scheme pay in the early stages, just to maintain the status quo? We are talking potentially about quite a lot of money, particularly if there is a market downturn or a problem with a major bank that gets into trouble.
<P>
I am grateful for the Minister's response. I hope that we have assured Labour Members that the amendment would in no way let sharp-end practitioners off the hook in terms of paying up for the compensation scheme. Indeed, it would do quite the opposite, by providing an extra safeguard in the interests of customers who fell foul of a firm that went out of business and which was the primary source of compensation. The Minister claimed that the amendment was not helpful, but it is. For the reasons mentioned by my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells, it would help and improve the Bill by adding a little more detail. That little bit of detail is not as onerous as details that have already been included in clauses 8 and 9 on consumer and practitioner panels, so I am disappointed that the Minister did not go further than to say that she agreed with much of our underlying thinking. On that basis, I urge my colleagues to vote in favour of the amendment.

<P>

<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I agree with my hon. Friend. I did not necessarily expect the Minister to sign up to the idea of three directors being authorised persons. The amendment is partly a probing amendment, but also a constructive suggestion. It does not lead to balance or provide an overall scheme.
<P>
The Bill gives huge latitude to the FSA, which is, of course, a responsible body. It rightly provides guidance in other areas-my hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham referred to clauses 8 and 9-and should provide guidance here too. All that we ask of the Minister is to consider tabling a Government amendment, which would provide proper steer and guidance to the FSA in setting up this extremely important board. Without that, I agree with my hon. Friend that we should press our point.
<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> I am afraid that I shall have to disappoint Opposition Members further. Let me respond to some of their points.
<P>
The board of the scheme manager is a different body from the consumer and practitioner panels dealt with in clauses 8 and 9. Those panels are set up specifically to represent particular interest groups, so it is necessary to ensure that their members are appointed from the relevant pool of people. The board of the scheme manager is different: it is not supposed to represent any particular viewpoint or articulate the views of a particular interest group. That is why we want to leave the appointment process open.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> With respect, that cannot be right. Of course a compensation scheme must, by definition, be designed to represent the interests of those who need compensation. That will involve customers and consumers who will need to be represented. The process must be fair and should also represent the interests of those who will pay the compensation. The hon. Lady is simply wrong: she has not addressed our argument at all.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I beg to disagree with the right hon. and learned Gentleman. My point was that no particular interest group should be represented. The apportionment of members from the industry, for example, is inappropriate for this body, as opposed to the work of the practitioner and consumer panels in clauses 8 and 9.
<P>
The hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham asked about the cost of the scheme and of compensation beyond the costs of overheads. We cannot answer that directly because it depends on the volume and nature of claims in any year. It is impossible to predict what will happen next year. We can tell only what happened in previous years.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> That is right. However, I mentioned the experience of other compensation schemes over the past five or 10 years. Firms must have some idea of the levy on their business in order to decide whether they can afford to be members of the compensation scheme. If it is compulsory, they will need to assess whether they can afford to carry out their entire business. Surely there must be some idea of the likely ball park, based on past experience. I accept that past performance may not necessarily be a guide to future performance, but I am amazed that we have had no assessment of the likely impact of costs on individual firms.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> We know the amounts paid out under various schemes. I have some figures: the public protection scheme has paid out £153 million and recovered £110 million from liquidators; the investors compensation scheme paid out £125 million and recovered £14 million; and the policyholders protection board has paid out £220 million in compensation. Those are the figures and I would be happy to provide hon. Gentlemen with more, as they arise. However, as the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham conceded, the past provides no guarantee of what will happen in future. Those working in the industry know that well.
<P>
Finally, in response to matter raised by the right hon. and learned Member for North-East Bedfordshire and the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham, the Joint Committee did not examine the compensation scheme. In relation to appointments to the FSA board, paragraph 118 of the first volume of the committee's report concluded:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``We agree that such appointments should be made on the basis of relevant experience and personal qualities and that seats should not therefore be reserved for representatives of particular interest groups.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Therefore, I do not understand why right hon. and hon. Gentlemen want a different approach. However, we agree about ensuring that appropriate expertise should be available. Indeed, what I said earlier suggests that the advertisement, together with the desirable qualities and background, are exactly what they wish us, the FSA and compensation scheme to bear in mind in future operations.
<P>
I draw the attention of hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham to the fact that clause 185(1)(d) provides a power for the FSA to set a cap, so that firms know that they cannot be asked to pay more than a maximum amount in any one year. However, if right hon. and hon. Gentlemen insist on pressing the matter to a vote, I shall certainly urge my hon. Friends to oppose it.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> We now come to Government amendment No. 640, with which it will be convenient to discuss Government amendments Nos. 668 to 670.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> May they be moved formally?
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I should like a brief debate on the amendments.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 640, in page 91, line 19, leave out `and Markets'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss Government amendments Nos. 668 to 670.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> Our amendments are simple, and, to help Opposition Members, I shall outline their effects.
<P>
The scheme in the Bill is currently known as the financial services and markets compensation scheme. Our amendments rename it as the financial services compensation scheme. That was proposed because we and the FSA consider that the current title is somewhat unwieldy and could mislead the public. As hon. Members know, the scheme is intended to provide compensation to claimants if an authorised person is unable to meet their liability. The scheme will amalgamate the current bodies that deal with compensation: it is not there to pay compensation where, for example, an investment has failed to perform as a result of market operation. Essentially, it will provide protection against insolvency.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The underlying principle of the single scheme is to improve access for claimants and remove confusion about where claimants go for help and advice, and to recover some of their losses. We greatly hope that a single scheme will have a higher profile which will help to raise public awareness of relevant matters. It would be regrettable if the name of the scheme, which is the first point of consumer reference, misled claimants. I urge hon. Members to accept the amendments.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Amendment proposed: No. 721, in page 91, line 31, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(3A) The compensation scheme may provide for the scheme manager to have power to impose levies on authorised persons, or any class of authorised person, for the purpose of recovering the cost (whenever incurred) of establishing the scheme.'.-[Miss Melanie Johnson.].<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendment: No. 722, in page 91, line 38, after `(3)(b)' insert `or (3A)'.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> The amendment would allow the scheme manager to levy authorised persons participating in the scheme for its established costs. Is this different from levying to pay compensation under the scheme? I assume that it is simply for the setting-up of the scheme. Our anxiety is that liabilities under the scheme should not be so open ended as to frighten reasonable people from entering the market.
<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> We were also concerned about that. Clause 194 as drafted would allow the scheme manager to levy funds in respect of the scheme's management expenses-for example, IT costs, rent and other overheads. Neither amendment would enable the scheme manager to account for the cost of establishing the scheme. It is important that the scheme manager should have power to raise these funds, otherwise the FSA would have to pay the costs which, ultimately, would be offset by the authority's own levies. This would spread the cost of establishing the compensation scheme more widely, beyond firms that use it. We think it right that participating firms that will benefit from the scheme should contribute to the cost of establishing it. Amendment No. 721 will ensure that the scheme manager will be able to levy these costs and authorise firms in the scheme. Amendment No. 722 is consequential to it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I have been slightly alarmed both by the question asked by my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for North-East Bedfordshire and Minister's reply. My right hon. and learned Friend drew attention to the fact that the clause contains effectively an open-ended power to tax, or levy an open-ended compulsory payment on a class of people. It is controversial enough that Parliament has sub-contracted the power to raise money to the FSA: here the authority is sub-contracting the power to a scheme manager, not even to a board or corporate body. It is giving the power to an individual employed by a body corporate which is answerable in some way to the FSA, which is answerable to the Treasury, which ultimately is answerable to Parliament. We are a very long way down the chain. Will the Minister say what constraints have been put on these powers and what would prevent employed scheme managers from imposing levies that would be disproportionate to what is fair or reasonable. What constraints will be imposed? Will they have to consult about the levies or need permission from somebody in the FSA? This is important.
<P>
In this part of the Bill, we seem to be allowing the FSA to set up an insurance company. The authorised persons must contribute to it, which is quite different from the situation in a commercial undertaking. I could not make anyone contribute if I as an individual set up an insurance company with a friend, but it is stated in another clause that authorised persons must pay. We learned earlier in the Bill that the concept of an authorised person could be defined by the FSA, so people doing business in an unregulated part of the market could suddenly find themselves authorised. There is no escape from that.
<P>
There will be a captive class of citizen that must contribute to what seems to me to be an insurance company-managed by someone, employed by someone else-that is only tenuously and indirectly answerable. Perhaps the Minister will fill us in on the circumstances in which the levies can be made.

<P>

<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> We are talking about the power to impose levies on authorised persons and to build up the costs to administer the scheme. I asked a question relevant to costs in our last debate, but did not receive an answer. It was about the independence of the scheme's board members and how that ties in with costs. Will their salaries and security of tenure guarantee it? Does that matter fall under the powers to impose levies on the authorised persons? I would be grateful if the Minister could flesh out an answer to that.
<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> The right hon. Member for Wells may have slightly misunderstood what I said, but, if not, perhaps I am not clear on what he said. I shall try to give an explanation that I think might underpin some of his difficulties.
<P>
``Scheme manager'' means exactly the same thing as the corporate body envisaged; it is not an individual. I am not sure whether there has been some confusion about what I have said and the way in which the right hon. Gentleman has taken it.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> If I understood the Minister, she said that ``scheme manager'' means the same thing as the corporate body. I understood ``corporate body'' to mean that the scheme manager would have an independent legal persona. Is that not correct?
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> Yes, but ``scheme manager'' does not mean a manager of the scheme. It means the body corporate. In the terms of the clause, the two are identical. If that was understood, I must have been confused by some of the early points made by the right hon. Member for Wells. If he has any further points, perhaps he could clarify them exactly.
<P>
The FSA scheme rules govern the levying power by virtue of clause 184(1) and are subject to clause 125 safeguards, including consultation. That relates to the cost of establishing the scheme, as does the amendment. The situation is about the cost of setting up the scheme, not about how it continues, and about ensuring that those who ought to contribute to it do so appropriately, rather than those who ought not to.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I simply want to remind the Minister to be kind enough to answer my question.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Does the Minister wish to reply now?
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I shall do so after the right hon. Member for Wells has spoken.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> Perhaps I can help the Economic Secretary. When she is receiving in-flight refuelling, it is often helpful if another member of the Committee intervenes and keeps the debate going while she refreshes her memory. I am grateful to her for pointing out that the scheme manager is not an individual employee of the corporate body. However, my objection does not fall because Parliament is subcontracting the power to impose compulsory levies to the FSA, which, under the clause, can subcontract that power to a scheme manager, which might be a corporate body, further down the chain. The result will be that authorised persons must make those payments whether or not they like it; they will be captive and will have no choice in the market.
<P>
I am concerned that the power to receive money to establish a scheme will be open ended. If the scheme manager is unnecessarily extravagant or makes mistakes, which must be paid for, in establishing the scheme, the cost will simply be unloaded onto the community of authorised persons. I am worried that that is without check. I hope that the scheme manager will consult, obtain permission or at least act with proportionality and balance in establishing the scheme or setting the fee.
<P>
I know that subsection (3) contains guidance on the various classes of authorised persons who might be asked for different sums in proportion to the risk, but only in the context of the compensation scheme. I am talking about the establishment and running costs of the scheme. I should be grateful to the Economic Secretary if she could tell us what guidance will be given to and constraints placed on the scheme manager.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I shall deal first with the points on independence made by the right hon. and learned Member for North-East Bedfordshire. Clause 183(5) requires the terms of the board's appointment to be
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``such as to secure their independence from the Authority.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is an important point, which addresses the issue raised by the right hon. and learned Gentleman.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> Of course it does, but I asked whether that independence would be secured by giving the members of the board a term of office and a salary, so that they could live, feed their families and be independent. How does that tie in with the costs?
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> They will be remunerated. I have referred the right hon. and learned Gentleman to clause 183(5). I am unsure what further guarantees he wants. The members of the board will be appointed in such a way as to ensure that they are independent of the FSA and they will be remunerated for their work.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I do not think that the Economic Secretary understands the point that I am making. All those employed by the FSA will be remunerated for their work, but most will not be independent of the FSA. I want to know how the members of the board will be independent in terms of their remuneration and terms of service and what that will cost.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> Perhaps I can write to the right hon. and learned Gentleman about those points, because there is nothing more that I can helpfully say now.
<P>
The FSA, not the scheme manager, will make the levy rules and determine the rates. That deals with the points made by the right hon. Member for Wells.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I am a little confused. Perhaps I misheard the hon. Lady, but I thought that she said that the levies would be imposed by the FSA. The amendment states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The compensation scheme may provide for the scheme manager to have power to impose levies on authorised persons''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Is she now saying that that is incorrect and that the authority will have such power? If so, the amendment is defective.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Perhaps it would be in order for me to refer to my earlier ruling about braces and the removal of jackets. If it becomes hot in the Room, members of the Committee are entirely free to remove their jackets or to put them back on if it becomes excessively cold.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I am grateful to you, Mr. Malins, for your further instructions about braces and jackets.
<P>
The amount will be set by the FSA. I hope that the right hon. Member for Wells will find that information helpful. He is still looking confused.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for her explanation; it is reassuring. However, amendment No. 721 states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The compensation scheme may provide for the scheme manager to have power to impose levies on authorised persons, or any class of authorised person, for the purpose of recovering the cost (whenever incurred) of establishing the scheme.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment does not refer to the authority. It refers explicitly to the scheme manager, which we now understand will not be an individual, as I first thought, but a corporate body. Furthermore, we learn elsewhere in the clause that the scheme manager has certain independence from the FSA, and probably rightly so. Therefore, buried elsewhere in the clause-and given the terms of the amendment-it seems definite that we are sub-contracting the power to impose levies to the scheme manager, and that is the source of my concern. Is the hon. Lady now saying that that is not the case?
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I hope that I can help the right hon. Gentleman. On the one hand, the rate will be set by the FSA; on the other hand is the question of where the costs will come from to meet that. Those two issues are separate and our amendment relates to where the costs will be found. The rate relates to the FSA, not to the scheme manager.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I am sorry to press the point, but it is important for the matter to be clarified. I do not understand how the amendment can refer only to the actual physical transfer of cash, when it states boldly that the scheme manager has the ``power to impose levies''. Is the Minister saying that that should be qualified in some way, that the provision will not give the power to impose levies and that the rate and the amount of the levy will be set elsewhere?
<P>
Some confusion has arisen. Is she saying that an override provision elsewhere in the Bill qualifies such action? If so, the amendment is at best ambiguous and should be corrected. I understand that the power to impose levies for the compensation scheme may be separate, but we are now talking explicitly about recovering the costs of establishing the scheme. The proposed new subsection gives an unqualified power for that to the scheme manager. No other meaning can be given to it. I may be being obtuse, but I can read English. Perhaps the hon. Lady would like to take further advice and return to the matter, because I should like a proper explanation of the amendment.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I should like to take further advice. Although I have more information in front of me, I do not think that it will satisfy the right hon. Gentleman. It is not helping me very much either. I shall write to members of the Committee to clarify the answers to those points.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Tyrie </B>(Chichester): I welcome you to your new role as Chairman, Mr. Malins. I hope that you will find serving on the Committee as enjoyable and enlightening as I have-more than I had bargained for.
<P>
Clause 184 lays down conditions that must be fulfilled. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The Authority must by rules establish a scheme''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Subsection (3) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The compensation scheme must, in particular, provide for the scheme manager''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
to do certain things. However, proposed subsection (3A) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The compensation scheme may provide for the scheme manager''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The word ``may'' means that it is at his discretion, unlike his other responsibilities. Will the Minister clarify the reason for that distinction?

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 724 and 725.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> Amendments No. 723 to 725 are technical amendments which align the definitions of ``relevant person'' used in the provisions dealing with the scheme manager's investigation and inspection powers.
<P>
The definition used in the relevant clauses needs to be slightly different from that which applies in the rest of this part, because it needs to distinguish between an insolvent firm and the insolvency practitioner who would otherwise be regarded as standing in the shoes of the insolvent firm.
<P>
The definition of ``relevant person'' in the rest of this part involves persons who were authorised persons or appointed representatives at the time of the act or omission giving rise to the claim against them. However, the mere refusal of the insolvency practitioner to pay out under a contract might be regarded as the omission giving rise to a claim against him. The ``relevant person'' clearly needs to be the authorised person or appointed representative whose acts may give rise to a liability under the scheme rather than the insolvency practitioner who confirms it. This is already made clear in clause 196.
<P>
Amendment No. 723 provides that the definition of ``relevant person'' introduced in clause 184 does not apply to clauses 190, 191 and 196.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 724 and 725 reproduce the definition from clause 196 in clauses 190 and 191 and I urge the Committee to accept them.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 643 and 672.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Will the Minister set out a little more clearly what lies behind the amendment and what difference, if any, there will be between EEA firms that function under the passport arrangement and domestic firms? The Government's notes on amendment No. 642 imply that an EEA firm can elect to participate in the compensation scheme, but that a domestic operator will be obliged to participate.
<P>
That seems quite wrong. The compensation scheme should apply to all operators in the marketplace, with compulsory membership. Citizens dealing with Deutsche Bank would naturally imagine that the bank was a member of the scheme-along with the National Westminster bank, should it survive, and other UK entities. I may have misunderstood the drafting, but that is not entirely clear. Subsection (3)(b) mentions the ``power to impose levies'' and so forth, but where in part XIV is the obligation to join the compensation scheme set out, and on whom is it binding?
<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> The amendments deal with how a firm's participation in the scheme is described. The change is essentially a drafting one. Before I explain the logic of the change, however, I shall describe briefly how the EEA firms fit into the scheme.
<P>
Clause 184 currently provides for EEA firms to be members of the scheme. Membership of the scheme will be compulsory for authorised persons carrying on relevant activities, except in the case of EEA firms that are members of equivalent schemes in their home state. I hope that that answers the point raised by the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> That is most helpful. Thank you.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> Those firms will not be automatically covered by the scheme for the activities that they carry on here by virtue of their single market directives passport, but they may choose to be members if they so wish. That avoids EEA firms having to pay twice, first for being a member of their home state scheme and then by virtue of being authorised by the FSA.
<P>
The amendments do not make any substantive changes to the way in which EEA firms fit into the scheme. They simply deal with the way in which firms can be said to participate in the scheme. The concept of membership is not entirely appropriate for firms that participate in the scheme, regardless of whether they are EEA or UK firms.
<P>
The scheme comprises a set of rules for authorised persons, and whether or not a firm is a member does not seem to fit. Amendment No. 642 therefore introduces the idea of participating in rather than belonging to the scheme. EEA firms have the option of participation in the scheme in relation to schedule 3 activities. Amendments Nos. 643 and 672 carry that concept into the rest of part XIV, so that the provisions apply consistently.
{**P5**}Mr. Flight: I thank the Minister for that answer. However, the FSA has pointed out that arrangements for regulation and compensation in other European countries are generally substantially inferior to those in the UK, at least in the FSA's perspective. I am concerned that, under those arrangements, the citizenry at large will automatically assume that all EEA firms functioning in the UK will be members of the common compensation scheme, and do business with them on that basis, yet the home state compensation schemes may be substantially inferior and it may be difficult to gain access to them.
<P>
Health warnings are required by existing regulations in relation to all sorts of things. It seems to me, at the very least, that if the arrangements that the Minister described are obligatory under EU directives, it should be required that any EEA firm not a member of the scheme should give clear a health warning to all its customers.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
{**P5**}Sir Nicholas Lyell: I am grateful to the Minister, but let me try to put the relevant questions into plain English. Under the amendment, someone operating in the UK market through membership of the EEA could choose whether to become a member of, and participate in, the compensation scheme. I cannot think why anyone would choose to do so, because of the cost. Few customers will be thrilled about joining the compensation scheme, which would raise the idea of failure. There may be a statement about authorisation under the French or Danish regulatory scheme. Is participation entirely voluntary for anyone who enters through the EEA? If there were failure, in circumstances that entitled the United Kingdom consumer to compensation, would that compensation come from an EEA scheme in the relevant country or from the United Kingdom scheme, notwithstanding the fact that the body whose failure has caused the compensation to arise has made no contribution to the cost? Would the cost fall entirely on UK contributors? I shall wait to hear the answer to that question before I ask another question about EEA members.
{**P5**}Miss Johnson: The amendment would have no substantive effect. An EEA firm must belong to a scheme, but it will-if it wishes-also be a member of its home state scheme because the investor compensation and public guarantee directive requires every member state to set up such a scheme. There is no question of customers failing to be protected. They are bound to be able to make a claim. Directives also provide that information is supplied to customers and potential customers about the home scheme, and the FSA will also have to make rules requiring that. I hope that that deals with the right hon. and learned Gentleman's first point.
{**P5**}Sir Nicholas Lyell: To clarify, if the default that gives rise to compensation occurs when someone in an EEA scheme in a home country has elected not to join our scheme, could our compensation scheme order that other country's scheme to provide compensation or would the hapless investor have to pursue his claim in the EEA member state? If so, is that adequate?
{**P5**}Miss Johnson: UK consumers would have to apply to the EEA home state scheme for compensation, which would be due under that scheme. They will not be covered by the UK scheme unless the EAA firm has opted to join it. As I said, it is an opt in. The UK is not allowed by the directive to insist that EEA firms join the UK scheme. However, it is necessary to leave the option open to them. None of that applies to activities under passporting or to part IV additional permissions. However, it meets the requirements that we must meet under the directive, allowing the option, although we cannot insist on it.
{**P5**}Mr. Flight: We are not entirely happy with certain clauses which require that UK firms are bound by the Bill when doing business outside the UK. Reciprocal arrangements ought to be possible so as to evade the undesirable EU directive, which will be a major issue, especially in relation to retail.
<P>
Many businesses in this country are owned by parents in other EU states. The British public will expect the compensation scheme to protect citizens. They will not understand when an EU bank in Britain is a subsidiary, as opposed to a branch, so there will be widespread confusion about whether they are covered by the compensation scheme. The FSA and Government will then be faced with scandals when someone with a serious problem must use a compensation scheme in Paris or Rome, only to find that there is no compensation covering their claim or that they cannot get anywhere.
<P>
Earlier, I said that compensation schemes elsewhere are significantly less generous. That touches on a question that I wish to raise in our clause stand part debate and is relevant to our current discussion. What are the maximums-if any-that people can recover under the compensation scheme? I have found references to maximums, but I am not familiar with the history of the banking compensation scheme. If people lose substantial amounts of money, is there-as I recollect-a cap of £100,000, or does that relate to the ombudsman scheme? What is the quantum that can be recovered under our scheme if people incur substantial losses when a financial services business fails? What are the quantums under schemes in other EEA countries? I do not expect the Minister to answer immediately, but the matter ought to be examined,

<P>

<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I am happy to provide the hon. Gentleman with further information on the relevant figures. We are doing what we need to under the directive; indeed, we are doing all that we can. That may not satisfy the hon. Gentleman, but it is an answer none the less.
<P>
The FSA is currently consulting on the quantum and, as I mentioned earlier, the proposals are set out in consultation paper 24.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> Clause 184(6) states that clauses 185 to 188 will make further provisions about the scheme. I do not intend to go into the details of those provisions. However, subsection (6) states that clauses 185 to 188
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``are not to be taken as limiting the power conferred on the Authority by subsection (1).''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Subsection (1) states that the authority must establish by rules a compensation scheme. If the subsequent clauses do not limit the authority's powers, what is their purpose beyond providing an illustrative list of some of the things that the authority might do? The next three clauses are quite long and are peppered with the word ``may''; indeed, there is not a subsection in them that does not include it. Of course, it is sometimes helpful to have the word ``may'', in a Bill because it limits the Government or the relevant authority. It implies that those involved may do one thing and nothing else, so it is a constraint on them. However, subsection (6) makes it clear that the subsequent clauses do not have that effect and do not limit the scheme or the authority's powers in any way. The only provision of any relevance is therefore clause 184(1), which simply states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The Authority must by rules establish a scheme for compensating persons''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I do not quite understand the point of the Bill, let alone of the subsequent clauses, if it does not restrict what the authority can do at least to an extent. Perhaps the Minister can enlighten me.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Will the Minister comment further on subsection (4), which makes it clear that levies should be appropriate to participants' risk records? I have grave doubts about whether one compensation scheme will be better or cheaper than several, and clause 185 states that there will be many different funds. The claims records in different parts of the financial services industry are wildly different. If the levies are to be applied fairly, the single fund will have to keep very detailed, almost actuarial records of different industries' claims. Goodness knows how it will apply those fairly to prevent parts of the industry with virtually no compensation history or bad track record from being forced to subsidise those for which the reverse is true. How does the FSA propose to operate fairly in that regard?
<P>
As regards the use of different funds, will the several different compensation schemes be under the one umbrella? I do not see how it will be possible to act fairly towards different sections of the industry otherwise. Or is the intention that costs will be spread and that those parts of the industry that have hitherto had an excellent no-claims record and no costs will find themselves chipping in for banking or PIA-type claims? As I mentioned, the venture capital industry will be extremely upset should it be hit with costs that are not related to its areas of activity.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I have two points. I want some clarification in relation to the cost aspects of securing independence for board members, as required under the preceding clause: I do not say it unkindly, but thus far no one has given enough thought to how secure that important independence. Will the Minister clarify the salary structures and terms and conditions which should help to secure it? The length of the term is also relevant.
<P>
My second question is bigger and is brought into focus by the clause. Our debate on the clause so far has dealt with liability for compensation and with the opportunity for the UK citizen doing business here to obtain compensation when the provider is passported as opposed to being regulated directly by the FSA. Over the weekend I read a comment in Graham Sergeant's column about the large proportion of City activities that are earned from and governed by the EU. Will the Minister tell us approximately what proportion of the business controlled by the FSA will be UK business to which the schemes apply? What proportion will be provided by huge, world-class companies such as AXA-which operate through passporting-to which compensation provisions will not apply?
<P>
It will strike you as pertinent on your first day as Chairman, Mr. Malins, that we are setting up the largest piece of regulation, let alone just financial regulation, ever established by the UK Parliament-
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> Anywhere in the world.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> My hon. Friend knows more about it than I do. It is possible that the majority of the business that the Bill purports to cover will not be covered by it, as it will be passported. I would be grateful to hear what the Minister has to say about that. I reiterate my question about the clause-what proportion of business will be covered by these compensation provisions?
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> I have some brief questions about subsection (9). If EEA members elect not to join our scheme, might not that suggest that the regulatory burden in the UK is heavier and more costly than in other home states. Sometimes the cost can be clearly quantified by dividing the overall costs of running the scheme by the number of participants. Secondly, is not the main argument for the scheme-that it will help consumer confidence and benefit the businesses that are being regulated-invalid because EEA firms, the only ones with a choice, will have voted with their feet, saying, ``Thank you, but we do not need the extra credibility; we do not think that it will benefit us or enhance our business.'' I should be grateful for the Minister's response.
<P>
I will not labour this point because it is more pertinent to clause 189 but the fact that we are setting up the provision in this way indicates that, as with so many other areas of the Bill, a review procedure must be built in after an interval. It would allow us to return to these questions after, say, three years, to examine whether what we put in place was of benefit to the industry. If it proves not to have been, it will have been a crazy legislative proposal to put into statute in its present form. The only scope for a review procedure will be that which comes up tangentially in the annual report requirements set out in clause 189, to which I shall return at the appropriate time.
<P>
My third question relates to top-up cover. The explanatory notes to clause 184(9) state, in relation to passported firms, that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``such firms may join this UK scheme for top-up cover where benefits under the scheme are higher.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In the event of top-up cover being available, does that mean as soon as an EEA firm has joined our scheme it will get the full benefits of it, or the costs, but lose the full benefits of the-
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Malins. I apologise for interrupting, but Westminster Hall is also sitting this morning, a fact that will not have escaped hon. Members' attention. When we began to debate clause stand part, I thought that there would be a fairly rapid move to clause No. 185, which would be taken separately. My hon. Friend the Financial Secretary has of course been with us throughout the debate but unfortunately I am unable to stay to answer questions and it is he who will have to do that. I regret that I have to leave to go to Westminster Hall. I apologise to the Committee.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The Minister's position is entirely understood. I thank her for her observations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> I was coming to a close on the issue of top-up. Will a passported firm that has elected to go for the top-up provisions lose the costs and benefits in its home state regime? In other words, for the purposes of this business, will he become entirely covered in the UK scheme or might he find himself subject to claims in both jurisdictions? What does the directive say?
<P>
<B>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Stephen Timms):</B> I shall attempt to pick up from where my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary left off, although I suspect that some of my answers may be a little incomplete, in which case no doubt hon. Members will ask their questions again. I apologise for that.
<P>
Subsection (4) was inserted in response to concerns that were raised during consultation. Many respondents were anxious that amalgamating compensation schemes which deal with different types of business would result in one bit of the industry subsidising the losses of another. We hoped that that would not happen. Hence subsection (4).
<P>
The right hon. and learned Member for Wells asked what is the point of clauses 185 to 188 given that subsection (6) allows for anything to be added later anyway. Clearly, the intention is to set out in the clauses that follow the things that one would expect to be in the rules for the scheme. However, the list is not exhaustive. The right hon. Gentleman drew attention to the use of the word ``may'' throughout clause 185. It is, therefore, not mandatory to deal with each of the points mentioned. Equally, however, we are not saying that clause 185 contains an absolutely exhaustive list. A balance clearly has to be struck between being exhaustive and allowing for unforeseen issues that might need to be addressed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> As I read the provisions, we are dealing with the skeleton or minimum requirements that must be met­hence the use of the word ``must'' throughout clause 184. On top of those, there are the top-up, discretionary, indicative possibilities in clauses 185 to 188. Have I got that right? If so, that suggests that the amendment that we agreed a moment ago is defective because it is indicative, not compulsory.

<P>

<B>Mr. Timms:</B> No, I do not think that it is defective. The hon. Gentleman's summary of what is going on in the clauses is broadly right. The right hon. Member for Wells asked what point there was in having all the things in clause 185 if we were saying in clause 184 that we could add other things as well. It is simply a question of balance and of listing things that we would expect to be tackled, without saying that they all absolutely must be or that nothing else could be. The aim is to give a steer on what the rules should contain. That is a sensible approach, given the nature of the exercise on which the authority is embarking.
<P>
The right hon. and learned Member for North-East Bedfordshire asked about securing the independence of those who are involved. My hon. Friend the Economic Secretary has undertaken to write to him and to all members of the Committee with further information about how the FSA proposes to meet the requirement that clause 133(5) imposes. It is probably best to deal with that point more fully in writing, and I know that that is my hon. Friend's intention.
<P>
The hon. Member for Chichester (Mr. Tyrie), asked about top-up cover. A firm that elects to join the scheme will have split cover. Cover from the home state will be up to the maximum, and any cover over and above that provided by the home-state scheme will come from the UK scheme. An EEA firm will be a member of both the home-state scheme and the UK scheme. An EEA firm that participates in the UK scheme will, of course, have to pay levies here and in the home state. The amount of the levy can take account of the proportion of cover for which the firm opts. I hope that that answers the hon. Gentleman's question.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr Tyrie:</B> Will the Minister have a go at my other two questions because he answered my first one extremely well. His answer dealt with the point entirely and explained the reference to top-ups in the explanatory notes.
<P>
My other two questions are more qualitative. One relates to whether we shall find out where the regulatory burden in this part of the Bill is greatest by watching to see how many EEA firms end up joining our scheme. If there are only a few, that will give some clue to where the regulatory burden really lies and whether we have found ourselves with a heavier burden.
<P>
Secondly, we will find out whether EEA firms consider that their credibility will be enhanced by joining our scheme. The strongest, single argument for the compensation scheme from the point of view of the firm is that it will benefit from the extra custom that will come from people who are reassured by the scheme's existence. If the scheme does not have that effect, EEA firms will not join it. If it does, they will vote with their feet and join it. Is not that the clearest possible proof of whether we have got the provision roughly right? All others are bound compulsorily into the scheme, but EEA firms are the only organisations that can vote with their feet.
<P>
The answers to those two questions will be extremely valuable, given that EEA businesses are likely to rise as a proportion of the total. Such a useful indicator should be taken into account in the subsequent review of the structure of the scheme once it has been up and running for a few years.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I certainly agree with the hon. Gentleman that it will be interesting to see what happens. Passporting firms that choose not to participate might simply be seeking to avoid duplication. That would not necessarily give the precise indication that he suggested because they do not need to participate in more than one scheme. However, it will be interesting to see what unfolds.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> It may have been an oversight, but the Minister did not answer my question about the sort of business that the Bill will regulate. What proportion will be passported business? Can he throw any light on what is an important question for the future of the City?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I do not have a figure that I can give to the Committee this morning. I agree with the hon. Gentleman that the matter is important. My hon. Friend the Economic Secretary will take advice on it and include a reference to it in her letter to him.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> I understand that the Minister cannot answer my question at the moment. No doubt there will be an opportunity for us to return to it. I should be grateful to receive the letter, but I should also be grateful if he could think about the matter carefully so that we can focus on it fully when appropriate to do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I thank the Financial Secretary for his response to my questions about subsection (6). It was what I expected, but the fact that he gave it without being ambiguous was useful. He confirmed that the subsequent clauses Nos. 185 to 188 do add up to a little more than a steer-I referred to it as an ``illustrative list''-of the sort of things that the compensation scheme could do.
<P>
I am still worried, however, that in law there is no limit on the authority's powers when setting up the scheme. The scheme manager will also have pretty good discretion, a point on which the Economic Secretary is to get back to me. There will be few limits on those powers, whether exercised by the FSA or by the scheme manager. An innocent newcomer to the subject might suppose that clauses 185 to 188 define or limit the powers of what I would call an effective insurance scheme, but that is not so. Therefore, the Bill would have been no different legally if it had asserted, as in clause 184(1), that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The Authority must by rule establish a scheme for compensating persons''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That would define the powers.
<P>
I am concerned that a systematic policy of giving the FSA maximum discretion is unfolding. We shall return to that matter, of which the clause is an example. This short debate has been important in reinforcing my perception of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The clauses that follow clause 184 do a little more than the right hon. Gentleman suggests. He is right to say that I said that a steer was being given to the content of the rules. Those clauses provide a framework of what might be expected in the rules, which is slightly more than he suggests. However, those drafting the rules will be limited by what it is reasonable for the compensation arrangements to cover, taking account of the FSA's objectives under the Bill. The discretion to which the right hon. Gentleman refers will be limited by those overriding objectives and by what is reasonable in the light of them. We have struck that balance throughout the Bill, and I suggest that it is right.

Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Clause 185 deals with the different funds that might be set up, which are described in greater detail in clause 188. I shall repeat a question that Ministers have answered only generally. Precisely how will the different risks and levels of contribution be handled for the various sections of the industry? The fact that that matter will be considered in principle is fine, as is done under clause 184, but none of the provisions and mechanisms in clause 185 tells me how that will be handled.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> We have already discussed the content of clause 185. I shall explain what will happen in more detail. Clause 185 builds a framework for what provisions the scheme may make. We have discussed what the word ``may'' means in that context. The basic power to establish the scheme will exist under clause 184. Clause 185 amplifies those provisions to give an indication of how the power can be used. We wanted to avoid tying up the scheme and the FSA in too much legislative detail.
<P>
Subsection (1) sets out the matters for which provision may be made. Subsections (2) to (6) are intended to assist in making the scheme as effective as possible, setting out how the rules can be adapted to different or special circumstances as they arise. The question posed by the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs relates to subsection (2), which will enable the scheme to reduce cross-subsidisation to a minimum by making different provisions for claims relating to different groups or sub-groups. One can imagine a number of ways in which that might be done, although the hon. Gentleman is right that the detail is not set out in the Bill. It is an appropriate matter on which further detailed work can be done, given the steer that the clause provides. We all agree that that is a desirable characteristic of the scheme.

<P>
The clause allows the FSA to make rules enabling the scheme manager to take over the rights of claimants against insolvent firms in order to recover debts-the amount in addition to anything to which they are entitled under the scheme-that claimants would otherwise have been paid by the receiver of the insolvent firm. The amendment corrects an error in clause 186(1)(b), which currently provides that the scheme has a right of recovery against the relevant person only when that person is insolvent. A firm does not necessarily have to be insolvent for the scheme to become involved. The definition of default for the purposes of the scheme is determined by the FSA's rules, which might include the situation where a firm goes into receivership but is not necessarily insolvent. In that case, the scheme manager should still have a claim against the firm, to recoup compensation that it pays to the firm's customers. As initially drafted, the scheme would not have that right.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 647, 648 and 653.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> Under clause 186(2), the scheme may make provision to allow the scheme manager to attend creditors' meetings and court hearings in relation to the winding up and bankruptcy of relevant persons. These are similar entitlements to those that the FSA has under clauses 321 and 324, relating to insolvency. They are necessary for the scheme to keep itself informed of the progress of an insolvency, given that it would have a direct financial interest in the outcome. Even if the scheme has not yet become liable to make payments in relation to that insolvent firm, the clause will enable it to sit in at the relevant meetings and hearings, so that it can be aware of future liability to pay claims, but it will have no voting rights at such meetings, unless it has assumed the rights of creditors. Prior knowledge will enable the scheme to plan and budget before it has to meet claims. The way in which it is set out in the Bill will be improved by this group of amendments, which will do three things.
<P>
First, amendment No. 645 puts the scheme manager's rights in insolvency proceedings into the Bill rather than leaving them to scheme rules. Secondly, the amendments align the scheme manager's rights with the FSA's rights in insolvency proceedings involving authorised persons and appointed representatives under part XXII. Thirdly, the amendments provide for the scheme manager to participate in administration proceedings as well as in winding up proceedings. Amendment No. 647 inserts a reference to administration that is missing from the list of procedures set out in subsection (3).
<P>
I hope that the Committee will find those improvements useful and that they will accept the amendments.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Do the amendments cover EEA passported firms that have joined the scheme or joined the scheme for their top-up and then become insolvent? They obviously will not be UK firms-they may be French or German. Do the powers enable the scheme manager to step into the shoes of those companies in the insolvency proceedings, as they will be outside this country?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The answer to the first part of the hon. Gentleman's question is yes. Will he ask the second part of his question again?
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> If a German firm becomes insolvent, the insolvency proceedings will take place in Germany, not the UK. If the scheme manager has a claim because the firm is a member or a top-up member of the scheme, it is no good providing for the scheme manager to participate in the those proceedings in the UK, under UK law. The rules should allow him to step into the shoes of his equivalent in insolvency proceedings in another country.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I think that the answer to the second part of the question, as amplified by the hon. Gentleman, is no. It does not give extraterrestrial powers-[Interruption.] I mean extraterritorial; but it does not give either. It covers firms over which the UK courts have jurisdiction under the Insolvency Act. It goes no further than that.

<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> This group of amendments changes the reference to rules in clause 186(3), making them insolvency rules rather than scheme rules. Subsection (3) effectively confers on the FSA the power to make rules intended to override other insolvency rules on the conduct of an insolvency-for example, by conferring an entitlement on the authority to participate in meetings.
<P>
The amendments now make it clear that the rules in question are those made under the relevant insolvency legislation in each part of the United Kingdom. They also make drafting changes to ensure consistency throughout the clause. The slightly different formulation of amendment No. 651 is necessary to reflect the way insolvency rules would be made in Scotland for that purpose.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> The clause enables the scheme to make arrangements for the continuity of insurance policy holders. Via the FSA, it has been leaked that several insurance companies hitherto regulated by the Department of Trade and Industry have for some years been below their solvency ratios and nothing much has been done about that. Therefore, if the ESA takes up the role of regulating insurance companies and applies a rigorous approach, there could be problems with quite a few insurance companies, and quite a few policy holders might need to be dealt with. To what extent has the Treasury considered how to deal with what the clause provides, and how much of a problem may arise in relation to it under the transfer of insurance company responsibility to the FSA?
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> Does the clause in practice amount to a mutualisation of insurance liabilities in respect of long-term insurance policy, and has any estimate been made of the costs and benefits?
<P>
The Minister is no doubt informed as to the current situation in relation to long-term insurance business-I am grateful to see him nod-but unfortunately I am not. Will he explain what happens at the moment should a company carrying out such business go to the wall? How does the market pick up its responsibilities, and will things be changed or kept broadly the same under the clause?
<P>
I know that mutualisation has been discussed a lot in the insurance industry. Going too far down the mutualisation road-the fears about which I would like the Minister to address-would encourage chancers to offer too much in the hopes of profiting from the premium income, without their over-worrying about the effects of having to pay out when the time arrives.-[Interruption.]
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs mentioned Lloyd's sotto voce over his shoulder, and he is absolutely right to do so. I ought to declare an interest, in that I was a member of Lloyd's at material times. Discussions on mutualisation were an issue when Lloyd's went through its difficulties. Whether the analysis of what happened was correct is still for debate, but the subject remains a live issue in the insurance market. I imagine that the FSA has directed its mind to the subject, and it certainly should do so. Enlightenment from the Minister on that would be welcome.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I am not aware of the leaks to which the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs referred. I do not think that we expect any more difficulties on this subject than on any other. I hope that that reassures him.
<P>
We are not going further down what the right hon. and learned Member for North-East Bedfordshire called the mutualisation road. The provisions have been brought forward from the Policyholders Protection Act 1975, which was amended by the Policyholders Protection Act 1997. The long-term nature of long-term insurance policies means that special arrangements are needed to protect policyholders if their insurer gets into financial difficulty.
<P>
The policyholders protection board currently pays compensation in cases in which insurance companies are in default. In the case of general insurance, such as home or motor insurance, the type of loss that a consumer may face will be limited to the value attached to the time that a policy has left to run or the value of a claim that a policyholder needs to make under his policy. However, losses associated with long term insurance are addressed rather differently by the policyholders protection board, which has a duty to seek to continue coverage, compensating only when it is unable to do that.
<P>
When a general insurance company goes into liquidation, policyholders will lose the remaining period of cover for which they have paid a premium, unless they have a claim against the policy at the time of the insolvency. However, when a long-term insurance company becomes insolvent, the loss to the policyholder is much greater than the cost of the premiums for the unexpired term because, in many cases, life insurance is a savings mechanism as well as an insurance mechanism. In addition, changes in a policyholder's circumstances since taking out the policy may make buying a replacement policy difficult or expensive.
<P>
Therefore, when the scheme is liable to pay compensation, it may be required by rules to seek out another authorised firm that will take over the long-term policies or one that will issue a substitute policy. The scheme may also take an interim option, which will entail a receiver taking on the administration of the policies. That is essential to protect consumers who would otherwise face more worry and expense. However, substitute cover is currently restricted by limits on ordinary payments, which are 90 per cent. of the value of the amount for which the defaulting firm is liable. We expect that arrangement to be carried forward by the FSA. The organisational structure has changed somewhat, but the principles are the same.
<P>
The Bill allows the scheme to make compensation payments, should it prove impossible for new policies to be secured. However, its first move should be to take action under clause 187(3).

<P>

<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> The Minister may have an opportunity to find the answer to the following question. Does the FSA know what proportion of income is taken up by being a member of the current schemes so as to give long-term protection to policyholders? Will the Minister will answer that early in this afternoon's sitting?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I shall endeavour to do so.
<P>
In conclusion, any payments made by the scheme in order to facilitate the continuity of insurance will be recovered from levies on the industry sector in the same way as compensation payments.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
