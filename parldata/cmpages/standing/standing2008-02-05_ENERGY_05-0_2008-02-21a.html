						<b class="B">
							<a name="080221130000429"></a>The
Minister for Energy (Malcolm Wicks):
						</b> Thank you,
Mr. Amess. I welcome you to the Chair for the business part
of our Committee. Before the Committee adjourned, I was saying that I
appreciate the commendable intention behind the amendments but, because
of the existing environmental protections that I outlined, I consider
them unnecessary. In my view, these matters should be dealt with under
existing environmental laws. Those can and will be amended as necessary
to ensure that we continue to have a robust regime that ensures that
relevant controls are in
place.</div>
					<a name="080221130000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
summary, any approvals granted for an offshore gas or carbon dioxide
storage project will contain conditions, where necessary, to protect
the environment. In granting any approvals, the Secretary of State will
have had to consult the relevant environmental bodies. I should make it
clear that in our role as the licensing authority for petroleum
extraction, we have been considering such environmental issues for many
years and have built up considerable expertise, which will be applied
to the new regimes under the Bill.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column154" />Column number: 154</div>
					<a name="080221130000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that I have provided
some reassurance to hon. Members that the environment is being, and
will continue to be, adequately protected, which of course we are very
keen to see. I therefore hope that the hon. Member for Northavon will
withdraw the
amendment.</div>
					<a name="080221130000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">A number
of issues were raised about the marine environment, and understandably
and usefully so, given policy developments in that area. The hon.
Member for Northavon asked in particular about the interaction between
this Bill and the proposed marine Bill. We have already had some
dialogue on that matter involving my hon. Friend the Member for
Sherwood as well. The marine Bill will not change the current licensing
arrangements in respect of offshore methane gas storage, as those will
remain with my
Department.</div>
					<a name="080221130000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I
mentioned, my Department has a large, dedicated offshore environment
and decommissioning unit, which includes a specific inspectorate. The
unit regulates the offshore oil and gas and renewables industries, in
the context of sustainable development, with a raft of legislation for
the protection of the environment. Specifically, that unit liaises
closely, where necessary, with the Marine Fisheries Agency, although
that body is not a statutory consultee. However, as my hon. Friend the
Member for Sherwood outlined, the marine Bill has not yet been
published and certain matters have still to be decided. He made
sensible and practical points about time
scales.</div>
					<a name="080221130000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Northavon asked whether offshore gas storage would be
subject to the requirements of the strategic environmental assessment
process. I can assure him that that has been scoped into the next
strategic environmental assessment, which is due to commence this
year.</div>
					<a name="080221130000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">Several
hon. Members raised issues relating to the Crown Estate. The hon.
Member for Wealden asked whether the Crown Estate had any role in
statutory nuisance issues. To the extent that statutory and common
nuisance apply to CO<span class="Sub">2</span> storage activities offshore, either
the operator or the Crown Estate could be liable. That would depend on
the specific circumstances in which the nuisance occurred. It would be
up to the Crown Estate to indemnify itself against any potential
liability in the lease or authorisation that it would grant to the
operators.</div>
					<a name="080221130000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Northampton, South asked whether the need for a Crown Estate
lease and a licence from the Department for Business, Enterprise and
Regulatory Reform would place an undue burden on developers. We do not
believe that to be the case: the creation of a new tailor-made
licensing regime has been welcomed by the industry. The system that we
are putting in place is analogous to the onshore area where a developer
would need to seek agreement with the landowner for the site
development, as well as consents under the Town and Country Planning
Act 1990. That is the right
approach.</div>
					<a name="080221130000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
hon. Friend the Member for Southampton, Test expressed concerns about
the Crown Estate&#146;s position to insist on unreasonable lease
terms. The Crown Estate is under a statutory obligation not to exploit
its monopoly position under the Crown Estate Act 1961. The Crown Estate
has extensive experience of administering offshore rights, and it is
working effectively in relation to offshore renewable energy
zones.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column155" />Column number: 155</div>
					<a name="080221130000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, North-West sought an assurance that
the licensing process would not result in unnecessary delays. We will
be consulting industry on the application process to ensure that it is
as smooth as possible. However, we mentioned earlier in our debate that
environmental considerations will need to be taken into account to
ensure that we comply with environmental legislation before issuing
licences.</div>
					<a name="080221130000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">I feel
that, both this morning and this afternoon, we have had a reasonable
dialogue on the subject. In view of my reassurances, I wonder whether
the hon. Member for Northavon, who initiated an important and
significant debate, would
nevertheless&#151;</div>

							<b class="B">Albert
Owen</b> (Ynys M&#244;n) (Lab): I was a
little late arriving and I wonder whether the Minister has had the
opportunity to look into the question of whether the Welsh Assembly

matter.</div>

						<a name="080221130000432"></a>
							<b class="B">Charles
Hendry</b> (Wealden) (Con): I asked the Minister who would be
responsible for assessing the geological safety of the proposed storage
areas and who would carry out subsequent assessments. I wonder whether
he has had a chance to consider the matter and whether this would be an
appropriate moment to respond to those
questions.</div>
					<a name="080221130000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="080221130000433"></a>Malcolm
Wicks:
						</b> I remember the hon. Gentleman raising those
matters, and I apologise for not covering the point. Again, I shall
respond either later or in writing. Of course, it is vital territory.
Our inspectorate will receive training to cope with the new
technologies. Technical assistance will always be available to
undertake monitoring, but I shall be able to say more about that in due
course.</div>
					<a name="080221130000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was about
to ask the hon. Member for Northavon whether, in the light of my
assurances, he might consider withdrawing his useful
amendment.</div>
					<a name="080221130000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="080221130000434"></a>
							<b class="B">Steve
Webb</b> (Northavon) (LD): The Minister never fails to charm
me. He gave a helpful and constructive response, but one or two issues
remain outstanding, some of which were raised by other hon. Members.
For instance, the hon. Member for Southampton, Test raised the issue of
Crown Estate; the Minister&#146;s reply seemed to be that they are
basically good guys and it has not been a problem so far&#151;I
paraphrase only slightly. There is a lack of accountability under the
clause, and I am not wholly reassured on the
point.</div>
					<a name="080221130000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
central point, about timing, was raised in exchanges between the hon.
Member for Sherwood and the Minister. We do not have a marine Bill, and
we do not know when we are likely to see a draft Bill. The critical
point of the amendment is to deal with what in other circumstances
might be called an interregnum. In other words, after the coming into
force of this Bill, but before the coming into force of the marine
Bill, who will do the work that the marine management organisation will
be doing once it exists? It is that period about which we are
particularly worried.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column156" />Column number: 156</div>
					<a name="080221130000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">Once
we have a marine management organisation, even though the marine Bill
will probably not give it a remit over the matters that we are
debating&#151;the Minister assured us that the Department undertakes
such consultation routinely&#151;and although we might try to amend
the marine Bill to that effect, can we assume that the marine
management organisation will be consulted? If the organisation is
adding something to the process and is not just another tier of
bureaucracy&#151;if there is some added value&#151;where are the
safeguards and reassurances to come from until it exists if we do not
amend the Bill to require the granting of licences to be subject to the
kind of consultation that we are talking about?</div>
					<a name="080221130000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
said that various EU directives already protect the marine habitat.
Presumably, however, the Government think that superimposing a marine
management organisation would add something. However, until it comes
into being something is missing, otherwise it would not need to be
invented; I mean the strategic dimension. Before we adjourned this
morning, I spoke about the worry of a gold rush or a scattergun
approach being taken to applications for licences. Prior to there being
a marine management organisation, where will the strategic spatial
planning in the marine environment come from? When thinking about
granting licences, there should be consultation on those key
environmental factors.</div>
					<a name="080221130000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="080221130000435"></a>Malcolm
Wicks:
						</b> Will the hon. Gentleman nevertheless recognise the
points raised my hon. Friend the Member for Sherwood that we do not yet
have a marine Act and Parliament has not yet judged it? When there is a
marine Act, as I hope that there will be, my Department and the
relevant agencies can begin to look at the practical specifics
necessary. I have given a reassurance that we are going to work very
closely with the new legislation, the Department for Environment, Food
and Rural Affairs and the new marine management organisation.
Meanwhile, I was trying to reassure the hon. Gentleman that we have
environmental protections in place and that my Department is well
versed in it, given the history since the 1960s of oil and gas
exploration. I am reminded, and I may have mentioned earlier, that we
are already covering these with the Marine and Fisheries Agency in
advance of the creation of the MMO. We are, as ever, as joined up as we
could possibly
be.</div>
					<a name="080221130000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="080221130000436"></a>Steve
Webb:
						</b> I am grateful for that intervention. I will not
labour the point, but the concern that the hon. Member for Sherwood
raises about the fact that we have a gap between the passing into law
of this Bill and of the marine Bill reinforces our concern; it does not
undermine it. The Minister is saying that we do not have a draft Bill,
we do not have a Bill and we do not know what it is going to look like,
but this regime will be in force until we have a marine Bill. Our
concern is about what will be the regulatory regime between now and
then. The Minister seems to be saying, quite interestingly,
&#147;it&#146;s alright, it&#146;s all covered&#148;. We are
going to have the marine Bill anyway, which is going to either not add
value, in which case it is pointless, or it is going to add some value,
which will not be present in the period up to the coming supporting
marine Bill.</div>
					<a name="080221130000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="080221130000437"></a>Malcolm
Wicks:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman will recognise
that despite the wonderful Department behind me, I 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column157" />Column number: 157</div>can only deal with what we have at present in terms of legislation. I
have tried to reassure him that going forward we will make all the
appropriate connections. I imagine that the hon. Gentleman might have
been going on to ask me about the powers of the Welsh Assembly,
following the question from the hon. Member for Ynys M&#244;n. I
would reassure the hon. Gentleman, if he asked me that question;
although my Department&#146;s licence will cover the 12 nautical
miles of Welsh territorial waters, a licence will also be required from
the Welsh Assembly under the Food and Environmental Protection Act
1985. That is the answer to an anticipated possible question, echoing
the question from my hon.
Friend.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="080221130000438"></a>Steve
Webb:
						</b> I am grateful. It is great to have questions
answered that I have not even asked. It could set a precedent for the
rest of our deliberations. In fact, we could just wait for all our
questions to be answered. I take the point from the hon. Member for
Ynys M&#244;n that the our amendment does not cover the Welsh
Assembly and it probably should have done; I accept that
comment.</div>
					<a name="080221130000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are
worried about the period up to the coming into force of the Bill that
we do not yet have. We will take on the Minister&#146;s assurances,
because we believe that the energy considerations should not be
subsidiary to the environmental considerations, which is what we are
pointing out through the amendment. Having received those assurances, I
beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div>

						</b> On the Government side of the Committee there is
probably a hackneyed new clause 4 quip, but I will not make it. The
clause makes provision for the Secretary of State to make regulations
under the negative procedure, which will set out who can apply for a
licence, requirements that must be satisfied by or in relation to the
licence applicant, how the application for a licence must be made and
the information that an application must contain any accompanying
documents. Additionally the regulations under the clause may require
the payment of an application fee, which will be assessed in line with
the Treasury&#146;s fees and charges guidance. That is in line with
our other licensing regimes such as for oil and gas licensing under the
Petroleum Act 1998.</div>

						</b> It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship
this afternoon, Mr. Amess. The Minister will be delighted to
know that new clause 4 is in my name, but he will have to wait a little
longer for the chance to discuss that. I imagine that it will cause the
Labour party as much consternation and debate as the original clause
4.</div>
					<a name="080221130000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
that we are discussing seems very straightforward. It sets out who may
apply for a licence, what requirements must be met in relation to that,
the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column158" />Column number: 158</div>manner in which the application should be made, the information that
should accompany it, and the fee. I wonder, however, whether the
Minister has also considered whether it should contain a reference to
the appropriate time for which a licence should last. I imagine that
there have been discussions about that in his Department. One would
clearly expect licences to last for a period of years, but does he have
it in mind that they should last for five, 10 or 20 years? Some
guidance on that would be
helpful.</div>

about making stipulations with regard to who is responsible for the

under your chairmanship once again, Mr. Amess, at this
clause 4 moment. Perhaps you will permit me to rephrase a question that
I asked a little earlier, which is also directly relevant to the clause
that we are now considering, about a risk identified in the impact
assessment. That is the possibility that the time scale for
introduction of the licensing regime might act, in the words of the
risk assessment, as a disincentive to developers in the short term. The
impact assessment also raises again the possibility that the narrowness
of the licences will discourage innovation in storage
technology.</div>
					<a name="080221130000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">Perhaps,
bearing those two matters in mind, the Minister will suggest the time
scale on which the licensing regime is expected to come into force, and
reassure us that there will not be a slow grinding of the wheels of
Government, to the point at which the industry becomes disenchanted and
frustrated with the current, less adequate
regime.</div>

							<a name="080221130000442"></a>Malcolm
Wicks:
						</b> The hon. Member for Wealden raised the question of
an appropriate duration for the licence. I imagine that that could vary
to an extent, but I am advised that we are talking about quite a long
time scale. Licences might possibly typically last for 40 years, or
something of that kind. There will be different issues perhaps for
carbon capture and storage, which we shall come to. I am hoping to give
the hon. Member for Cheltenham some advice on the question that he
raised this morning.</div>
					<a name="080221130000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was asked who would monitor
the regime, and the answer is that it would be one of our departmental
inspectors.</div>

							<b class="B">Mr.
Hugo Swire</b> (East Devon) (Con): The Minister has just
informed the Committee that licences may be granted for up to 40 years.
Presumably the value of that licence will depend largely on what is
being licensed. For that period it might vary enormously, in terms of
supply, and so forth. What mechanism has been built into the licensing,
or indeed the Bill, that would allow the value of the licence to be
readdressed at any point while it was in
force?</div>
					<a name="080221130000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="080221130000444"></a>Malcolm
Wicks:
						</b> I think that on that one I may need to come back to
the hon. Gentleman. There may be an opportunity later to consider that
matter.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column159" />Column number: 159</div>
					<a name="080221130000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our general
approach is that once a licence is granted, although certain things may
change, we do not want to change existing licences retrospectively. I
have heard the question about the possibility that values may change,
and I will try to find an opportunity to return to the matter for the
hon. Gentleman. I think that I had also better find another opportunity
to return to the matter raised by my Liberal Democrat
colleague.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="080221130000445"></a>Charles
Hendry:
						</b> I wonder if the Minister will also provide greater
clarity on another matter. Is it his expectation that the licences will
be tradeable? If, for example, Exxon decides to apply for a licence to
store gas in one of these facilities, and then wishes to sell it on to
Conoco, could that happen in a straightforward way or would the licence
have to be returned to the Government and a new licence
issued?</div>
					<a name="080221130000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="080221130000446"></a>Malcolm
Wicks:
						</b> Yes, they will be tradeable in that sense. From my
experience of this, through the pilot partnership with the industry, we
can see that some of the bigger players are phasing down their
operation in the North sea and some of the smaller more enterprising
companies are taking over the licences. The hon. Gentleman raises an
important point about the regulatory regime that we need to put in
place in practice as well as in principle. There is the idea of
&#147;use it or lose it&#148;. We need gas storage and it is
important that these facilities stay in
operation.</div>
				
					<a name="080221130000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="080221130000447"></a>Mr.
Swire:
						</b> The Minister has gone some way towards answering my
original question. By definition, if these licences are tradeable, we
will need to establish a value at the time of trade. Will that be up to
the free market, or do the Government see themselves as having a role
at that
time?</div>
					<a name="080221130000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="080221130000448"></a>Malcolm
Wicks:
						</b> It has to be up to the market within the regulatory
framework. If the hon. Gentleman is asking whether we would put forward
certain ideas about costs and prices, I would say that those are not
things for us to decide. Such things are always best left to the
market.</div>
					<a name="080221130000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Cheltenham asked what the risks and disincentives were in
delaying the legislation. We expect the first application for licences
to take place in January. We understand that on the back of our

applications. I hope that those words reassure the Liberal Democrats
that we intend to move very
quickly.</div>

Wicks:
						</b> It might be helpful if I briefly
introduce the clause. It makes provision for the Secretary of State to
grant a licence on such terms and conditions as he or she sees fit. For
the most part, standard terms and conditions will be appropriate to all
licences of a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column160" />Column number: 160</div>particular type. Others might be peculiar to the circumstances of a
particular licence. The conditions will seek to ensure that appropriate
environmental protections are in place, or they will provide for the
licensee to submit information to the Department to enable it to
perform its regulatory functions. For example, the conditions may place
an obligation on the licensee to undertake the licence activities in a
way that does not interfere with other uses of the sea or the sea bed.
The licence may include a duty to consult and to maintain effective
communication with fishing interests, or to refrain from activities
that unjustifiably interfere with navigation or fishing interests. We
will consult fully on the proposed standard terms and conditions and
hope to start this consultation in the summer. When making regulations
prescribing model clauses under clause 6, there will be an opportunity
for interested parties to put forward their views before the regime
comes into effect.</div>

							<b class="B">Mr.
Brian Binley</b> (Northampton, South) (Con): May I say what a
pleasure it is to serve under your direction, Mr.
Amess?</div>
					<a name="080221130000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although I
welcomed the support of the hon. Member for Glasgow, North-West on an
earlier occasion, I took some exception to the fact that he was happy
that companies could afford a bob or two with regard to the provisions
on licensing. The truth of the matter is that the Committee would be
doing a disservice if it did not take into account the need to preserve
good cash flow in companies. That means that they do not want to tuck
away resources when it is unnecessary to do so. Companies need to use
all their resources to the best possible advantage. Those two
considerations alone&#151;and there are many others&#151;overtake
the comment about this being just a bob or two. I hope the hon.
Gentleman will forgive me, but I felt that I needed to get that on
record.</div>
					<a name="080221130000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand
the need for a financial security test with regard to the financial
standing of certain licensees when that test suggests that their
ability to meet their obligation may be at risk. However, we need to
temper that with an understanding that this should not be an automatic
presumption to ensure that companies do not make unnecessary financial
provision over a sizeable period of time. That would tie up financial
resources that I believe are necessary to develop what is a relatively
new industry. I know the Minister would not want that to
happen.</div>
					<a name="080221130000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">We know that
industry is going to have to pay a sizeable investment price if we are
to crack the question of global climate warming. We know that we have
to make several changes with regard to infrastructure, how we run our
businesses and transportation&#151;the list is endless. I do not want
to tie up money unnecessarily in a Government holding somewhere that
detracts from the ability to move on to make the investment necessary
to deal with climate warming. I hope that the Minister will agree that
it should not be an automatic presumption that, during CO<span class="Sub">2
</span>storage operations, there should be financial provision whereby
money is lodged and held right across the piece as a matter of ongoing
procedure.</div>
					<a name="080221130000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
ask that there is not such an automatic presumption. It would place a
massively onerous obligation on the balance sheets of companies and
take up significant capital. More importantly, it would be immensely
damaging to medium and smaller companies that might wish to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column161" />Column number: 161</div>be involved. We need to get all the resources we can involved in this
procedure. The presumption would place a proportionally greater
disadvantage on those people than on the very big operators. I am sure
the Minister would want to be aware of that concern. I hope that he
will give me the reassurances that I
want.</div>
					<a name="080221130000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is considerable concern about the amounts that we might be talking
about to allay the risk, from the Government&#146;s perspective. I
know from people to whom I have talked that if they do not know what
that financial implication might be, it might stop plans proceeding. We
need to know the amounts and the timings, so perhaps the Minister can
give us some thoughts in that
regard.</div>
					<a name="080221130000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
there is a question of when it might become necessary to make some
financial stand-by to alleviate the risk from the Minister&#146;s
perspective, which I understand. I have spoken about the considerable
financial cost involved and that will be particularly grave if it has
to be made at the time of the permit application. There is some leeway
to allow that provision to be made either before construction starts,
or before the storage operation itself starts. I ask the Minister for
guidance because this impacts on a number of organisations that might
wish to be a part of the infrastructure that the Minister is trying to
create, but could be put off by that lack of
knowledge.</div>

Horwood:
						</b> Following on from what the hon.
Gentleman has raised, particularly in terms of the impact on smaller
companies that might wish to engage in this business, there is mention
in the impact assessment of Petroleum Act 1998 costs. I am not familiar
with the Petroleum Act, so perhaps the Minister could expand on what
that is based on. There is talk of a price for the licence of
&#163;3,000, but a potential cost to the companies developing it of
&#163;31,000 a project. I think that that underlines some of the
concerns that the hon. Gentleman might have had, although I remember
raising earlier the possibility of perhaps extracting a little more
money from those companies that are enjoying windfall
profits.</div>

							<a name="080221130000452"></a>Mr.
Swire:
						</b> I think that it is the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
party&#146;s policy to do something about what he sees as levying a
windfall tax on the profits of the existing companies. He has just
stated that perhaps some of that money could be used towards helping
other companies to get into the business. Would not that be a strange
precedent, and is that really what he is trying to
say?</div>

Horwood:
						</b> I was asking questions, not setting out party
policy&#151;I should make that very clear. I was seeking a response
from the Minister on the potential funds available in the energy
companies for various
purposes.</div>
					<a name="080221130000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">The issue
that I wanted to address regarding this particular clause relates to
the conditions that are attached to licences, particularly those
relating to the environment. I was rather reassured by the
Minister&#146;s promise of full consultation on the conditions, which
is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column162" />Column number: 162</div>a very positive commitment, and I hope that there will be engagement
with many organisations that are concerned about the
environment.</div>
					<a name="080221130000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">Earlier
today, the Minister talked about the environmental impact being
&#147;paramount&#148;&#151;I think that that was the word that
was used. Is he able to expand on that? Does that mean that
environmental considerations will, in effect, supersede all commercial
considerations? Will considerations be attached particularly to public
health? The gases set out in the earlier part of this chapter of the
Bill make a rather explosive list. Presumably public health
considerations&#151;in terms of leakage and so on&#151;might be a
major consideration. Will those be the kind of things that might attach
to conditions?</div>
					<a name="080221130000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">What is the
type of time scale over which these conditions might apply, and how
flexible will they be if evidence of a public health risk or, indeed,
environmental damage, emerges? As we have established, we are talking
about time scales of possibly as long as 40 years for the operation of
these licences. If such evidence emerges, will the conditions attached
to the licences be flexible enough instruments to allow for action to
be taken to mitigate or eliminate those
risks?</div>

						 This clause seems very straightforward and

questions in my mind, which I would be grateful if he could
answer.</div>
					<a name="080221130000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">In setting
out the sort of terms and conditions that might be relevant here, I
think that the Minister said that the installation should not interfere
with other users of the sea bed. I am not quite sure what he means by
that, so could he expand on it further? How will that be
achieved?</div>
					<a name="080221130000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">By
definition, I would have thought that putting hundreds of millions of
tonnes of concrete into the sea bed is going to interfere with what
goes on there. Who does the Minister have in mind? Other users of the
sea bed? Are these fishermen, trawlermen or other people who earn their
living in that respect? Otherwise, the thought going through my mind
that an assortment of crustaceans might be affected&#151;crabs and
lobsters and so on&#151;as users of the
seabed.</div>

they will be incredibly relieved about, they will be able to go back
and say, &#147;Well, on 21 February 2008, the Minister gave us an
assurance that we would not be interfered with.&#148; Judicial review
has happened too often with energy issues
already.</div>
					<a name="080221130000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will
the Minister expand a little more on what he has in mind? Is this
something that he sees as being a permanent structure because there are
risks of things going calamitously wrong with some of these
installations? We are talking about combustible gases. Clearly, in the
event of an emergency, the lobsters would come out ready to eat. The
point here is that the Minister has flagged up an issue, but exactly
what he has in mind is far from
clear.</div>
					<a name="080221130000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister has spoken about &#147;use it or lose it&#148;. Is that
one of the terms and conditions that he might have in mind? Is he
saying that if someone applies for a licence but does not actually use
it, it would be revoked? Perhaps the Minister will expand on his
thinking.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column163" />Column number: 163</div>
					<a name="080221130000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will the Minister talk a little
more about the implications of clause 5 for decommissioning and, in
particular, whether he would use this as an opportunity to set out how
a facility should be left at the end of its operating life, and how it
should be decommissioned? What will happen about ensuring that
necessary funds are available to carry out that decommissioning work at
particular
installations?</div>

						</b> This has been a useful discussion. Let me try to
cover some of the points that have been made. My response will probably
not be as coherent as I would like, if I had more
time.</div>
					<a name="080221130000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
terms and conditions that are likely to be in the licences include
placing an obligation to retain the gas within defined geological
boundaries, placing the operator under a general obligation to protect
the marine environment from pollution, requiring a licensee to obtain a
lease from the Crown Estate, and placing an obligation on the licensee
to undertake licensed activities in a way that does not interfere with
other users of the sea or sea bed&#151;the hon. Member for Wealden
noted that remark in particular. What does that mean? There is a duty
to consult and to maintain effective communication with fishing
interests&#151;not necessarily fishes themselves, I suppose, although
I had better be careful&#151;to refrain from activities that
unjustifiably interfere with navigation or fishing interests, to deal
promptly with compensation claims, to give the Ministry of Defence
notice of installation movement and seismic surveys, and to maintain
and install underwater beacons to MOD specifications. Those are some of
the things that we have in
mind.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="080221130000458"></a>Mr.
Swire:
						</b> On the question of settling any insurance claim,
and if one subscribes to the enduring principle of the polluter pays,
will it be incumbent on companies applying for a licence&#151;and
indeed being awarded an operating licence&#151;to prove that they
have sufficient insurance to meet any claim for compensation that might
be made against
them?</div>
					<a name="080221130000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="080221130000459"></a>Malcolm
Wicks:
						</b> Subject to further consideration,
that would seem eminently sensible. We will try to clarify that, and
there is ongoing discussion about the nature of the licences. I have
indicated some of the criteria and some of our objectives, but that was
a useful point.</div>
					<a name="080221130000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
terms of the point about use it or lose it, I made the comparison with
the UK continental shelf&#151;the North sea&#151;where we have
brought this in. I would guess that the matter is ultimately for the
Crown Estate, but we will be consulting on this issue, among others, in
due course. My judgment would be that on gas storage, for example, if a
company decided after 10 years that it wanted to enter another market,
it would seem sensible to ensure that where there was commercial
interest, another company would take that over, not least because of
national security
considerations.</div>
					<a name="080221130000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was
asked about the costs of licences and I think the hon. Member for
Cheltenham recognises that the difference is that the figure of
&#163;3,000 or thereabouts could be for submitting the licence, which
covers the administrative costs to our Department. The larger fee
mentioned is just an estimate of the internal cost to the company of
preparing their application, and that needs 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column164" />Column number: 164</div>to be weighed against the potential benefits of up to &#163;400
million to companies and the economy from such a
proposal.</div>
					<a name="080221130000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
environmental considerations, when I use the word
&#147;paramount&#148;, I am simply saying we are not going to play
fast and loose with the environment&#151;that is crucial. We have to
comply with EU legislation on environmental matters, but on other
matters raised regarding terms and conditions, we intend to consult
with industry before any of these regimes come into place. There will
be plenty of time for discussion on these
matters.</div>

Horwood:
						</b> I am beginning to sense that the Committee does
not seem to have a great consensus on exactly what these terms and
conditions might be and where they might be directed, although there is
a broad sense that they might have a strong environmental focus. We do
not really have a sense of the price levels, although the impact
assessment had those numbers that the Minister quoted, which were based
on the Petroleum Act 1998. It might be helpful if he could explain
where those costs come from. Would it not have been better to have some
sense of the conditions in the Bill rather than leaving all this to
secondary legislation? For instance, should the primacy of
environmental considerations be set out? Would he consider that
suggestion as a possible amendment at a later
stage?</div>

case.</div>
					<a name="080221130000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have done
my best to outline some of the key points that would be covered by a
licence. To be fair&#151;the hon. Gentleman is a fair man and I
always like to be fair to myself on these occasions&#151;we have not
passed this Bill yet, although I hope that Parliament will enact it. We
are working hard on some of these details. I do not think&#151;this
is a general issue around the law&#151;that being ultimately specific
in the Bill is sensible, if only because this is a fairly fast-moving
technology and sometimes one can be
over-specific.</div>
					<a name="080221130000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Northampton, South made some interesting remarks, much
of which were about carbon capture and storage. He made some important
points to which I will return when we consider the clauses concerning
carbon capture and storage. I hope that that will be
sensible.</div>
					<a name="080221130000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">As for terms
and conditions, I am reminded that we will be consulting on this in due
course and publishing a consultation document in June. One would
probably get into trouble with parliamentary colleagues if one
consulted before a Bill had received its Second Reading. One has to do
these things in the appropriate order.</div>
					<a name="080221130000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for Cheltenham
talked about a worry that we could be too narrow in terms of licences,
given the technological developments that will take place. For that
reason, we are setting out enabling powers for the licensing regime. We
want to encourage innovative new technologies in relation to offshore
technology to come forward under this regime. We feel confident that in
a fast-moving territory&#151;in terms of liquefied natural gas, gas
storage, and later CCS&#151;it is important to put in place a
regulatory framework that we think will be fit for purpose in the long
term.</div>

of North sea oil and gas into the mid-sixties&#151;the Government and
relevant agencies, such as the Health and Safety Executive, and the
companies themselves have always put a huge premium on the safety and
mainly the safety of the workers. We saw an incident the other day when
people took no chances in evacuating an oil rig.</div>
					<a name="080221130000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand the public
concerns about gas storage and CCS. We need to ensure that we are
protecting the public health through the appropriate agencies such as
the HSE. That is a very significant point, not least when some of these
technologies are fairly new to most of us, let alone our constituents.
We need to reassure people and make sure that these issues are covered
in the appropriate regulations.</div>

					<a name="080221130000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">One thought on competition
rules occurs to me. Can the Minister clarify how competition rules will
apply to the people who set up and operate such facilities? Would there
be the normal ability to refer a matter to the Competition Commission
if there were concerns about vertical integration in terms of who owns
different aspects of the supply chain? If the starting point is to
provide greater security of supply, there would be concerns if people
could own a gas storage facility and chose not to use it so as to pump
up prices of gas elsewhere in the supply chain. I do not expect that to
happen, but I will be grateful for reassurance from the Minister that
it will not be able to happen.</div>

						</b> That raises an important point.
My off-the-cuff response would be that Ofgem, the regulator, would be
able to look at those aspects. Ofgem is not the regulator for offshore
installations and all that&#151;not the ones that we are discussing
here&#151;but we have a regulator of the market and its effective
operation is in place. The regulator will need to be mindful of the
changing territory, both literally and metaphorically, in relation to
this matter. I understand the hon. Gentleman&#146;s example of gas
storage. Effectively, although it is new territory, normal competition
rules would apply, which is what I said in a less pr(c)cised way a

						</b> I thought that at this stage the
Committee might like me to make a short speech again. The clause makes
provision for the Secretary of State to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column166" />Column number: 166</div>make regulations that will set out model clauses that could be applied
to all licences&#151;that is, standard terms and conditions. Some of
our discussion already applies to this clause as well. However, to
ensure that the terms and conditions relate to the activities being
undertaken, it will be possible to set out different model clauses for
different cases, which follow from the general provisions contained in
clause 88(2). For instance, it may be appropriate to have a different
set of model clauses for offshore gas storage than for the unloading of
LNG.</div>
					<a name="080221130000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Secretary of
State will also have the power to modify or exclude particular model
clauses when granting a particular licence, should the need arise.
Furthermore, amended sets of model clauses may be laid down by making
further regulations under the clause. Those new model clauses would
apply only to licences granted after the amending regulations came into
force. Such amendments would, of course, be made only where it was
necessary in the light of experience or changed circumstances. We will
consult fully on the draft regulations to give interested parties an
opportunity to comment on those standard terms and conditions before
the regulations are made. Once made, the regulations will be laid
before Parliament, and will be subject to annulment for a period of 40
days. To further improve transparency, the model clauses will also be
published on the DBERR website.</div>

					<div class="hs_AmendmentLevel2">&#145;(c) has a
decommissioning programme for the facility, which has been approved by
the Secretary of
State.&#146;.</div>
					<a name="080221130000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
7 relates to the offence of carrying on unlicensed activities. As it
stands, it looks at the how a facility should be operated during its
lifetime, but it does not look at how that facility should be
decommissioned once it has stopped being used. My contention is that
decommissioning needs to be included from the outset, so that we can
put it on a level playing field with other activities in the energy
sector&#151;for example with wind farms, which have to have a
decommissioning programme in place when they are established. Indeed,
the hon. Member for Copeland has spoken about the need for a level
playing field in relation to the requirements that the Government are
proposing for nuclear facilities.</div>
					<a name="080221130000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">A failure to decommission a
site effectively would lead to significant hazards, especially to
shipping, if part of the rig or the injection system is left in
position. Such facilities will inevitably decay over time if they are
not being used or well maintained, especially in the rough seas that
they are being proposed for. Amendment No. 7 would simply require that
before a facility could start to be used for the importation or storage
of combustible gas, there would need to be an approved decommissioning
programme in place, which has been signed off by the Secretary of
State. This could include, for example, a decommissioning programme to
state what needs to be removed at the end of the period of use; the
establishment of a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column167" />Column number: 167</div>decommissioning fund, and perhaps in that fund, a charge on the parent
or associated company&#151;as is being proposed with the nuclear
decommissioning programmes.</div>
					<a name="080221130000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">It would seem that this is a
modest change, but it would avoid the need to address this issue at a
later stage when a facility has perhaps stopped being used, and the
original users have ceased to exist in their current
form.</div>

							<a name="080221130000468"></a>Martin
Horwood:
						</b> The intention behind this amendment seems,
sensibly, to make decommissioning a de facto part of the licensing
process. My only qualification would be that there might be neater ways
to do it than are in the amendment&#151;perhaps even slightly less
aggressive ways. It could perhaps mirror what is present in other parts
of the Bill where the decommissioning programme seems to be more
closely tied in with the licence application process, rather than
creating what seems to be a new offence in operating without a
decommissioning programme. That seems to be a rather punitive approach
from Conservative Members, but perhaps that simply represents a
temperamental difference between Liberals and Conservatives.</div>
					<a name="080221130000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">There also
does not seem to be much detail about what actually constitutes a
decommissioning programme. In the nuclear part of the Bill, it is
referred to as a &#147;funded decommissioning programme&#148;. Of
course, this may reflect the general consensus that nuclear waste
having to be disposed of is environmentally bad&#151;and an
environmental risk in a much more serious sense than the gas being
stored on this occasion, which is at least economically, if not
environmentally, good. Perhaps there is a rationale to having a
different basis, but I wonder whether the hon. Members for Wealden and
for Billericay, who are proposing the amendment, or the Minister have
considered how a decommissioning programme for these installations
would be funded, and how those funds might be protected.</div>
					<a name="080221130000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">In general, I am sympathetic
to the intention of the amendment, which incorporates decommissioning
into the licence regime. I would be interested to hear from the
Minister why this part of the Bill differs in that respect from other
parts of the
Bill.</div>

							<a name="080221130000469"></a>Mr.

						</b> I thought for one moment that the hon. Member for
Cheltenham was going to suggest that the decommissioning programme or
plan could be funded by a windfall tax on the existing companies, but
that money has been pledged by the Liberal Democrats to so many
different areas that probably the pot is, as we speak,
empty.</div>
					<a name="080221130000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
is a good proposal from my hon. Friends the Members for Wealden and for
Billericay. I do not see how it is draconian. Decommissioning is just
as interesting as the commissioning of these activities and licensing,
and it is something that exercises hon. Members on both sides of the
House in this day and age. Indeed, there are those of us&#151;myself
included&#151;whose reservations, particularly about the nuclear
programme, concern the aftermath and what happens to the material once
it has been processed and so on. There are those of us who care
passionately about the environment and want to see plans in
place&#151;before any commissioning is undertaken&#151;that would
show how a redundant plan could be implemented at the given
time.</div>

							<b class="B">Dr.
Stephen Ladyman</b> (South Thanet) (Lab): I could understand

						</b> Indeed, that may well be the case, but we are not
just talking about gas storage. We are saying that written into the
Bill should be the principle that there is a plan or a fund set aside
that could be used in decommissioning. I think it is a fairly
uncontentious amendment and I hope the Minister will address it, given
the fact that it has been supported by the Liberal Democrats as
well</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="080221130000472"></a>Malcolm
Wicks:
						</b> This has been a useful discussion. I hope to
persuade the hon. Member for Wealden that for the reasons I am about to
outline the amendment is not required. I think that the problem can be
tackled in another way.</div>
					<a name="080221130000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for East Devon drew the comparison with nuclear decommissioning
and I suspect that there may be an opportunity later to discuss that
subject. I do not anticipate that the nuclear clauses will go through
on the nod, so I hope that he will forgive me if I do not go down that
path at the
moment.</div>
					<a name="080221130000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
need to ensure that the activities we are seeking to license through
the gas unloading and storage regime are subject to a robust procedure
for managing the final stage of the process, in other words
decommissioning. Through this amendment the hon. Member for Wealden
appears to be seeking a provision that would make it a criminal offence
not to have a decommissioning programme approved by the Secretary of
State at the time the offshore gas storage or unloading facility is
operational. Although I agree with his sentiments, I cannot agree to
this amendment for two reasons.</div>
					<a name="080221130000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">First, we
are extending through schedule 1 of this Bill the existing
decommissioning provisions in part 4 of the Petroleum Act 1998, to
include offshore gas storage and unloading and related activities. This
means that operators will be required to draw up and carry out an
approved programme for the decommissioning of their installations. Such
obligations can also be placed on certain other interested parties such
as companies associated with the operator. This amendment would in
effect create a different regime for gas unloading and storage from
that which will apply to oil and gas developments.</div>
					<a name="080221130000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are
proposing a number of changes to the decommissioning regime in the
Petroleum Act under chapter 3 of part 3 of this Bill. These changes
will allow the Secretary of State to require decommissioning security
at any time during the life of an oil and gas field if the risks to the
taxpayer are assessed as unacceptable.</div>
					<a name="080221130000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are also
looking to protect the funds put aside for decommissioning so, in the
event of insolvency of the relevant party, the funds remain available
to pay for decommissioning and the taxpayer&#146;s exposure is
minimised. Once the Bill is passed the Petroleum Act regime, including
the changes I have mentioned, will also apply automatically to offshore
gas unloading and storage facilities. Changing the requirement for
decommissioning projects on a piecemeal basis, which would be one of
the implications of this amendment, would lead to inconsistencies
across the different applicable licensing regimes. By linking 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column169" />Column number: 169</div>offshore gas with the existing regime we provide a single, consistent
approach to decommissioning, with any changes made to the Petroleum Act
regime flowing through to the offshore gas licensing regime. However,
if the amendment were accepted a different requirement would be put in
place for offshore gas unloading and storage, and regimes would start
to diverge.</div>
					<a name="080221130000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
this amendment could create confusion over which penalty regime would
apply to decommissioning. For instance, part 4 of the Petroleum Act
1998, which will apply to offshore gas unloading and storage, provides
a penalty in the case of a conviction on indictment of a term of two
years&#146; imprisonment and/or an unlimited fine. However, the
penalty for the part of the Bill where the amendment is suggested is in
the case of conviction on indictment an unlimited fine. That is a
lesser penalty regime than that of the relevant part of the Petroleum
Act 1998.</div>
					<a name="080221130000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope I
have provided some reassurance to the hon. Gentleman that the
provisions around decommissioning facilities are appropriately covered
under this regime and explained the drawbacks to having a piecemeal
approach to decommissioning obligations. I thank him for introducing an
important debate on the significant topic of decommissioning but wonder
whether he might consider withdrawing his
amendment.</div>

would be a bar on that organisation or person applying for a licence to
import or store combustible gas for a time to be determined by the

potentially very dangerous and if anything goes wrong, there is a very
serious risk to life, sea life and the environment. The Bill sorts out
the activities that would not be permitted. These include, in clause 7,
acting without a licence, or in clause 8, acting without prior consent
where it is necessary to have such consent, or a failure to keep good
records. Those penalties would rarely, if ever, be used, but would add
an important further measure to discourage breaches and I hope that the

them.</div>

Horwood:
						</b> I am all for effective
deterrence, especially when people and the environment are at risk, but
I do see a potential problem with the way the amendment is framed,
which perhaps reflects a weakness in the way clause 7 is framed. By
holding individuals responsible, these fines or punitive measures could
easily be evaded if the individual cannot be identified. Since we have
a clear trend towards corporate responsibility, it seems odd that in
this obviously corporate area, we are holding only individuals
responsible. It is difficult to imagine a private individual
surreptitiously indulging in a bit of gas storage on the side. There
are visions of &#147;Trotter&#146;s Combustible Gas Storage
Limited&#148;&#151;I think that we can all imagine how that episode
would end. If the argument is that the corporate fines would never be
large enough to act as a deterrent to large companies, who have a bob
or two, we simply have to make the fines sufficiently cripplingly to
make sure that they are a
deterrent.</div>
					<a name="080221130000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 8 has an unsatisfactory delegation once again of complete
discretion to the Secretary of State. No disrespect to Ministers, but
this an unfortunate trend in the legislation&#151;everything seems to
be left to the Secretary of State or to Ministers to determine at some
later stage, instead of being in the Bill. It is crucial, because if
the period envisaged is six weeks, that amounts to a slap on the wrist;
if it is a lifetime ban on applying for a licence, that would close
down the business. Clearly that is a critical consideration and I would
be interested to hear what the Conservative spokesman feels might be
the relevant time scale.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column171" />Column number: 171</div>

hon. Member for Wealden and the
Minister.</div>

Wicks:
						</b> In response to the hon. Member for Cheltenham, I
should say that when we talk about &#147;a person&#148; in clause
7, that could include a company and any corporate body. I think that
that does ground it in corporate
responsibility.</div>
					<a name="080221130000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
grateful to the hon. Member for Wealden for raising such an interesting
and pertinent point with his suggested amendment. As hon. Members may
know, clauses 7 and 8 relate to the enforcement provisions of the new
offshore gas storage and unloading regime. In particular, clause 7
stipulates that it is an offence to undertake any of the activities set
out in clause 2, such as the unloading of gas to an installation or
pipeline, without a licence granted under clause 3. Meanwhile, clause 8
specifically covers offences once a licence has been granted, such as
the breach of certain specified licence conditions.</div>
					<a name="080221130000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clauses
form part of a suite of provisions designed to ensure that a licence is
obtained for the activities listed in clause 2 and that the terms and
conditions governing the licence are adhered to. Adherence to the terms
and conditions of licences will ensure that the necessary safety,
environmental and other protections are in place for the offshore
storage of gas, and, indeed, the unloading of liquefied natural
gas.</div>
					<a name="080221130000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
currently proposed penalties for failing to obtain a licence, or for
non-compliance with licence conditions, are, we believe, proportionate
and sufficiently strong to deter licence holders from committing the
offence. The penalties for any person found guilty under either clause
7 or clause 8 consist of a fine of up to the statutory maximum, which
is currently &#163;5,000 in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, and
&#163;10,000 in Scotland, on summary conviction, or an unlimited fine
for conviction on indictment.</div>
					<a name="080221130000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for Wealden
suggests that we should add to the existing offences and provide the
Secretary of State with the power to stipulate that a person guilty of
an offence under the gas unloading and storage regimes should be barred
from applying for future licences for a period to be determined by him.
Perhaps I can provide some reassurance that we have already given those
issues a great deal of thought. I am confident that we have the right
penalties for the offences, without the amendment.</div>
					<a name="080221130000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">The penalty provisions in
clauses 7 and 8 are based on an existing enforcement regime, which has
worked successfully to date: the penalty provisions of the submarine
pipelines regime in the Petroleum Act 1998. I believe that the
liability to a potentially unlimited fine will act as an effective and
proportionate deterrent to operators engaged in offshore gas or carbon
dioxide storage.</div>
					<a name="080221130000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">If in the
future it should be felt that a broader range of penalties was
necessary, including a bar on persons who had been found guilty of an

<div class="Column"><a name="Column172" />Column number: 172</div>provide for such a scenario. The power afforded to the Secretary of
State by clause 4(a) allows for regulations to be made detailing who
may apply for such a licence. I hope that that goes some way to
answering the point made by the hon. Member for Wealden about the
responsibilities and duties of the

consider that the amendments are necessary, first because I am
confident that we have adopted the right balance in our offence

that we already propose to give to the Secretary of State under clause

what the Government have been seeking to achieve in the other
provisions of the Bill. I think that there would be interesting legal
challenges if it should be decided at some future date that a
particular person or organisation might not apply for a licence because
the Government had been unhappy with their performance elsewhere.

							<a name="080221130000482"></a>Malcolm
Wicks:
						</b> To ensure that the Department, as the licensing
authority, can keep tight control of activities undertaken by licence
holders, the clause sets up penalties for breaching certain key licence
conditions. There are also penalties for misrepresentation and
non-disclosure in relation to licences. The offences attracting
criminal penalties under this clause include carrying out an activity,
such as a drilling operation, without first obtaining the prior consent
specified by the licence; breaching any conditions attached to a
consent; or failing to keep records, give notice, or make a return or
report, as required by the licence. Anyone found guilty of such
offences will be subject to a fine not exceeding the statutory maximum
on summary conviction or an unlimited fine on conviction on indictment.
The licensee, as the person responsible for the licence, will be liable
for all 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column173" />Column number: 173</div>offences under the licence even where they are not directly responsible,
for example, where the unauthorised activity is carried out by a
subcontractor.</div>
				
					<a name="080221130000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
it is recognised that licence holders may not always be at fault.
Subsection (2) accordingly ensures that licence holders will have a
valid defence, if they can show that they exercised due diligence in
trying to comply with the licence conditions. In the case of a
contractor, due diligence could include appropriate monitoring and
supervision of a contractor who was acting on behalf of a licensee even
if the contractor subsequently still failed to comply with conditions.
Subsection (1) provides for the Secretary of State to specify, by
order, further kinds of breaches that will amount to an offence. That
will allow the Department to put in place new criminal sanctions for
conditions that may be needed in the licence in the future in response
to changes in the industry. The penalties for non-compliance with
licence conditions are, we believe, proportionate and sufficiently
strong to deter licence holders from committing the
offence.</div>

like a little clarification from the Minister on the phrase

					<a name="080221130000383"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It is an

knows, or ought to know, to be relevant to an

					<a name="080221130000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">That

middle of the night and played on your PlayStation&#148;. I do not
know the legal groundings of it; it sounds vaguely
Rumsfeldian&#151;there are the things that we know that we know, the
things that we know that we do not know and the things that we do not
know that we know. When one introduces to that the things that we know
that we ought to know that we do not know and the things that we do not
know that we ought to know, it becomes a recipe for chaos. I will be
grateful if the Minister can give us further guidance and clarification
about the legal definition of those few
words.</div>

						</b> I am a little concerned about
subsection (2). It may be following standard legal wording, for all I
know, but I will be grateful for clarification on it. It says
that</div>

					<a name="080221130000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">That becomes
important because of the issue that I have raised before of the long
timescales over which this is operating. If we are talking about
decades, it is plausible that evidence of environmental damage or 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column174" />Column number: 174</div>public health risk may only emerge over time. We are talking about
serious issues: gasses that may prove very toxic to wildlife or
potentially or mixtures of methane, butane and propane, I am not a
chemist but if that was bubbling to the surface, I would not put a
match near it. If we had a serious explosion or another
environmental disaster resulting over long term from the operation of
these facilities, and the body corporate was able to say that 15 years
ago a completely different management operation had done due diligence
at the time, what is the consequence of that? Who picks up the tab? Who
picks up the liability for any damage done, for the clean up operation
or for whatever would be necessary? Would it be the taxpayer? Would
there be a giant loophole that allowed the company responsible to get
away with the environmental disaster, if it were to
happen?</div>

Wicks:
						</b> Of course, I agree with the hon. Gentleman that we
are talking about very serious matters, both substantively and also
because of the need to reassure the public, as he indicated earlier. I
will reiterate what we mean by due diligence. Due diligence will be
found where the licence holder has done everything it can reasonably be
expected to do to avoid a breach of the licence. Where a contractor is
used to carry out a particular operation, due diligence will be shown
where proper steps have been taken to select a competent contractor and
there has been an appropriate level of supervision of the
contractor&#146;s operation. I am not a lawyer but it is common on
the one hand to specify penalties but to be sensible about what we mean
about responsibility through due diligence procedures of different
kinds.</div>
					<a name="080221130000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think the
hon. Member for Cheltenham stepped into different but related territory
which we touched on earlier today, namely how to monitor these
facilities&#151;geologically and so on&#151;over a long time. The
proper responsibility will be with the company but our Department,
where necessary with technical experts, will also be in the business of
inspection. That is the major way we tackle the concern raised by the
hon.
Gentleman.</div>

							<a name="080221130000487"></a>Martin
Horwood:
						</b> I do not think this quite
tackles the issue. Over a long time, with the way that companies shift,
change, merge and sell parts of themselves, it is almost inevitably
going to be a different company. Could companies exploit this clause or
regulations relating to it as a giant loophole to evade liability for
some environmental consequences which might genuinely not have been
foreseen but for which they should be responsible&#151;or someone
should? There is a big question mark over who is liable 20 years down
the
line.</div>

							<a name="080221130000488"></a>Malcolm
Wicks:
						</b> The best way I can deal with this
is to say that when we are drawing up appropriate regulations and when
we are consulting we should look at this issue. Obviously, in this
territory we are talking about the long term. I mentioned the period of
possibly 40 years to the hon. Member for Wealden when questioned about,
say, gas storage. It could be longer. When it comes to carbon capture
and storage, which we are coming to later, we are talking about
millennia, which raises interesting issues of different kinds. On the
other 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column175" />Column number: 175</div>hand, the issue about what to do 30 years on when a company at fault has
gone bust or been merged, is presumably familiar in law. I suspect it
is not unique to this circumstance. It is an important point and we
will consider it as we move forward in terms of
regulation.</div>

Secretary of State with a direction-making power.</div>
					<a name="080221130000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">I agree with the Liberal
Democrat spokesman that the Secretary of State is a pretty busy
character in this. Knowing Secretaries of State, they do occasionally
delegate. You appreciate the formal use of this term.</div>
					<a name="080221130000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is to
provide the Secretary of State with a direction-making power to direct
a licence holder to take appropriate steps in the event of a breach of
licence conditions. For example, if the licence requires equipment to
be maintained to a good standard, a direction may require the equipment
to be repaired or replaced. This provision is an important part of the
suite of enforcement provisions and enables the Secretary of State to
take a lighter-touch approach to remedy the breach before considering
criminal proceedings, if he considers such an approach would be
appropriate.</div>
					<a name="080221130000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">Moreover, it may not always be
sufficient simply to punish the licence holder for breaching a licence
provision. The Secretary of State may wish to direct the licence holder
to comply in a way that minimises any damage already caused. Before
issuing a direction, the Secretary of State must consult the licence
holder. This will provide the licence holder with an opportunity to
explain why the breach has occurred. If the licence holder fails to
comply with the direction, the Secretary of State will have the power
to ensure that the necessary action is taken and to recover the costs
with financial interest from the licence holder.</div>
					<a name="080221130000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Secretary of State may
also make arrangements for any person to comply with the direction on
the licence holder&#146;s behalf. Subsection (9) ensures that this
clause does not affect any provision made by the licence itself. For
instance, the licence may already include a power of direction in
certain circumstances. Again, Mr. Amess, it touches on the
importance of regular inspection to see whether things are going badly
wrong in this respect, so that these directions can be
made.</div>

Brian Iddon</b> (Bolton, South-East) (Lab):
I am sorry I have not raised this matter with the
Minister previously but it has only just occurred to me during this
session. I do not know whether the drafting agents have considered this
either, but I think it is worth raising.</div>
					<a name="080221130000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the
2002-2003 session of Parliament, I steered through a private
Member&#146;s Bill which became the Marine Safety Act 2003. I had the
pleasure to work with the late Lord Donaldson and learned a lot about 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column176" />Column number: 176</div>safety at sea. My point is that, undoubtedly, some of these transfers of
gas will occur using shipping and could be transferred to an onshore
facility&#151;it could even conceivably be transferred to an offshore
facility such as a spent oil rig or gas rig.</div>
					<a name="080221130000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">Lord Donaldson&#146;s two
major reports on safety at sea led to the setting-up of a person called
SOSREP&#151;the Secretary of State&#146;s Representative,
representing the Secretary of State for Transport. Together with my
legislation and Lord Donaldson&#146;s legislation, that has given
SOSREP the powers to direct captains of ships to do whatever it is
intended they should do to avoid a catastrophe at sea. These are
enormous powers and we are further advanced in this country than any
other in the
world.</div>
					<a name="080221130000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">My point is
that, if this Bill is giving this Secretary of State powers of
direction, is there going to be any conflict with the powers of
direction that SOSREP has&#151;who is currently Robin Middleton,
based in Southampton. I can conceive of situations where these powers
of direction may, indeed, conflict with the powers of direction of
SOSREP. I realise the Minister may have difficulty giving me an answer
today, but I think this matter should be considered seriously before
the Bill becomes an Act of

						</b> May I just second what the hon.
Member for Bolton, South-East has just said? In my own constituency in
East Devon, there has been tremendous concern about ship-to-ship
transfers of heavy oil, particularly from Russian ships. More recently,
we have had a marine tragedy which could have been a lot
worse&#151;that of the ship the MSC Napoli, which the Minister and
other members of the Committee will be familiar with. That experience
was very interesting, because I first encountered the SOSREP, Robin
Middleton, in that capacity, and he did an extremely good
job.</div>
					<a name="080221130000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">At
the beginning of that situation, members of the Committee may remember
the almost 19th or 18th century wrecking scenes on the beach. There was
confusion at the time as to who the lead agency was. In the aftermath
of the Napoli having been grounded, there was a misunderstanding or a
lack of clarification as to which was the lead agency&#151;whether it
was the Devon and Cornwall Constabulary or whether it was SOSREP, in
the form of Robin Middleton. On clarification, it was SOSREP who then
really took the lead in all
this.</div>
					<a name="080221130000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think it is
important; I agree with the hon. Member for Bolton, South-East that it
does need to be clarified as to the respective roles so that in the
event of an emergency, such as the one I have just alluded to, the
emergency services&#151;and indeed, all those agencies
involved&#151;know who takes the lead
position.</div>

This clause gives the Secretary of State the power to apply to the

activities prohibited under clause 2. For example, if there is evidence
that a gas-unloading activity is taking place, or is about to take
place, without a licence, the Secretary of State may apply for an
injunction requiring the operator to cease the activity immediately.
This is a further safeguard to ensure the integrity of the licensing
regime. Given that such unlicensed activity would be a criminal offence
under clause 7, we expect this power to have to be used only rarely.
However, it is a useful power to have in reserve. I therefore move that

best will in the world, whatever qualifications they have and whatever
energy and drive they have when they take on an appointment, people
will lose some of that over a period of time. These two amendments
would give the Secretary of State the power to determine an appropriate
length of appointment for an inspector&#151;we leave it to his
discretion, or indeed to that of a SOSREP, to decide what that time
scale should
be.</div>

						</b> Earlier I was questioning the
wide latitude being given to the Secretary of State by some parts of
this Bill, but in the case of this amendment, we seem to be lavishing
very detailed powers on the Secretary of State which I am not sure
really is appropriate. There seems to be too much detail and I thought
the Conservative party was in favour of reducing red tape. The
important point is that this is based, as I understand it, on the
existing licensing regime for the petroleum industry and we should
hesitate to muck about with it too much. I am all for giving more
general, strategic powers and having those more closely
defined&#151;we referred earlier to the primacy of the environment in
the issuing of licences and issues of that kind, but when it gets down
to detailed human resource issues that should be naturally included in
any appointment process, that seems ludicrously over-detailed. I seek
clarification from the Conservative spokesman, but I cannot see the
justification for these detailed
prescriptions.</div>

Wicks:
						</b> Although I think that the Committee has stuck to
its task very diligently this afternoon, as a sideshow, I am enjoying
the traditional debate about the power of the state between the Tories
and the Whigs, which has been going on for several centuries and which
I follow with close attention. It is not for me to make a judgment. I
understand the concern of the hon. Member for Wealden. Any politician
facing regular general elections has to be jealous of open-ended
appointments, so I understand the
prejudice.</div>
				
					<a name="080221130000402"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.30
pm</div>
					<a name="080221130000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before
addressing the amendments, I would like to set out a little of what we
are trying to achieve with clauses 12 and 26, because the proposals
also relate to clause 26. Those clauses give the Secretary of State the
power to appoint inspectors to inspect facilities used for offshore gas
or carbon dioxide storage or related activities. They also give him the
power to make regulations setting out the powers and duties of
inspectors and other persons acting under his direction, for example,
surveyors or other contractors. Examples of such powers 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column179" />Column number: 179</div>and duties are the power to enter premises, to carry out an
investigation, to require information or to take samples. The
regulations can also set out the facilities and assistance that
licensees must offer inspectors in carrying out their
duties.</div>
					<a name="080221130000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">Inspectors
play a crucial role in ensuring that the terms and conditions of the
licence are adhered to. They are the eyes and ears of the regulating
authority and provide a valuable resource to ensure that the oil and
gas industries comply with a raft of legislation that is in place to
protect the environment. I suspect that we are in agreement so
far.</div>
					<a name="080221130000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
get to the point, in almost all instances, inspectors are civil
servants, recruited on civil servants&#146; terms and conditions of
employment. The amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Wealden to set
out in regulations the appropriate length of appointment for an
inspector appears, therefore, to cut across contractual matters that
are normally covered within a contract of employment. Equally, if a
contractor is employed for the purpose of inspection, the duration of
their employment will be stipulated in the contract of
employment.</div>
					<a name="080221130000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are currently a number of inspectors who act on behalf of the Secretary
of State in respect of oil and gas licensing. Our proposal is not to
recruit more inspectors, but to extend the powers of the existing
inspectors, bringing their knowledge and experience of oil and gas into
the new regime. With thanks for probing the Government, I wonder
whether the hon. Gentleman might consider withdrawing the
amendment.</div>

Hendry:
						</b> The Minister began by talking about why
politicians will be jealous of people having these sorts of contracts.
I remember well on the final day of the 1997 election campaign, when I
was the MP for High Peak, being told by somebody in a factory,
&#147;The problem with you Members of Parliament is that you do not
understand what it is like to work on a short-term contract.&#148;
Within 24 hours, I
did.</div>
					<a name="080221130000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am grateful to
the Minister for clarifying the issues. I understand that two types of
people may act as inspectors: those who are civil servants and it would
therefore be inappropriate for them to have a particular period of
appointment and people who are brought in from outside, in which case
it would be standard working practice for the term of the appointment
to be stated in their contract. That provides the assurance that we
need and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div>

Hendry:
						</b> As you will have seen,
Mr. Amess, these amendments also relate to the clauses on
inspectors. They relate to the penalties that can be given out where 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column180" />Column number: 180</div>people have deliberately obstructed inspectors in their work. As with
earlier amendments, we want to send a clear signal that we recognise
the potential dangers of the activities being carried out in relation
to the importation and storage of combustible gas or CO<span class="Sub">2</span>.
That is especially the case with CO<span class="Sub">2 </span>storage, given that it
is a very new technology and science and it will be a long time before
we understand all of the risks
involved.</div>
					<a name="080221130000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
inspectors are fundamental in ensuring safety. We should not
contemplate anybody blocking their work. The inspectors should have
access to inspect whatever they want, wherever they want and whenever
they want. We need to understand the motivation behind somebody
refusing access to an inspector. They could, for example, say that a
dangerous manoeuvre was going on and the inspector would understand why
they might suggest that he should come back at a different time, if the
inspection did not relate specifically to that manoeuvre. It would also
be understandable if the relevant person whom the inspector needed to
see was
unavailable.</div>
					<a name="080221130000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
almost every other circumstance, we would have reason to be suspicious
of why an inspector should be refused access or obstructed in his or
her work. A fine provides punishment, but the threat of revoking a
licence if the operator wilfully obstructs an inspector is far more
powerful. I hope that the Minister will agree. He may say that that is
covered in clause 30, on the termination of licence regulations, but we
believe that more detail is needed on the circumstances in which
licences could be terminated and it should not be left so vague as the
clause currently provides it to
be.</div>
					<a name="080221130000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">Operators need
such a level of guidance, given the tens of millions they are being
asked to invest in the projects. They need to know in what
circumstances the licences could be removed. We do not seek an
exhaustive list, but we need an indication of the level of offence that
would result in such draconian steps. I would suggest that blocking the
work of an inspector would be grounds for such
revocation.</div>
					<a name="080221130000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="080221130000504"></a>Martin
Horwood:
						</b> Perhaps my phraseology in relation to the last
amendments was a little harsh, but I am also puzzled by these
amendments and whether they need to be included at all. I suspect that
they do not.</div>
					<a name="080221130000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
amendment No. 11, I find it difficult to believe that the Secretary of
State does not have the power to revoke the licence of someone who acts
to obstruct the work of inspectors, which appears to be the object of
the clause, if the licence has been appointed by him. That is a natural
part of any licensing regime that would come out of the regulations and
the design of the licence, on which we have already been told there
will be consultation, before we see the meat of the licensing regime.
In a sense that is the meaning of the word &#147;license&#148;.
There is only continued license to operate providing the terms of a
licence are not broken, which obstructing the work of inspectors would
clearly do.</div>
					<a name="080221130000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">Even if
provision does need to be included more clearly in the Bill, as the
hon. Member for Wealden suggests&#151;I would love to take credit for
this, but my talented researcher Anna Harvey suggested to me that there
were more logical places in the Bill for similar amendments to be made,
such as clauses 7 and 8, which 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column181" />Column number: 181</div>we have already gone past. Perhaps it provides an opportunity to explore
with the Minister exactly what the Secretary of State could have the
power to do in sanctioning those who operate without a licence or break
the terms of their
licence.</div>
					<a name="080221130000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">Coming
to amendment No. 14, I find myself once more puzzled that it needs to
be included. As the hon. Gentleman stated, it could be said that clause
30 already covers the matter. That is exactly right. It sets out the
regulations under which a licence may be terminated. Obviously, it is
important to outline specific provisions to clarify what those
circumstances would be, but that would also be a natural part of a
licensing regime.</div>
					<a name="080221130000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
explanatory notes to the Bill suggest that any provisions of a licence
relating to its termination will be made under the regulations in
clause 30. So, I cannot see the purpose of the amendment. Perhaps, on a
probing basis they provide the Minister with a useful opportunity to
explore the powers that might be exercised in those
circumstances.</div>

words carefully when I said that I knew it would not be accurate to say
that in the hon. Gentleman&#146;s case. That is important. However,
just in case, parliamentary privilege is a wonderful thing, is it
not?</div>
					<a name="080221130000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">To encourage
compliance with these requirements, clause 12(5) specifies that the
regulations may also create offences relating to inspections. For
example, it would be an offence to obstruct an inspector when he is
exercising his duties under the regulations. The clause lays down
penalties that may be imposed for such offences. Those offences will be
punishable</div>
					<a name="080221130000386"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;(a) on
summary conviction by a fine not exceeding the statutory maximum or
such lesser amount as is specified in the regulations,
and</div>
					<a name="080221130000387"></a><div class="hs_brev">(b) on conviction on
indictment by a
fine.&#148;</div>
					<a name="080221130000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
maximum penalty provisions contained in clauses 12 and 26 reflect those
outlined in the Petroleum Act 1998 for offences against submarine
pipeline inspectors. That enforcement regime has worked successfully to
date. The liability to a potentially unlimited fine will act as an
effective and proportionate deterrent to operators engaged in offshore
gas or carbon dioxide storage. I remind the Committee of that because
these words are now becoming familiar to
me.</div>
					<a name="080221130000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
it is felt that financial penalties are insufficient in relation to
offences committed against inspectors. A revocation of a licence may
present an additional sanction. Under clauses 5 and 19, the licensing
authority could include a provision in a licence that specifies that
the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column182" />Column number: 182</div>licence could be revoked if the licensee committed any offence as set
out in the relevant regulations. Moreover, in the case of carbon
dioxide storage, the appropriate sanction might not be revocation of
the whole licence, but withdrawal of the rights of the operator to
continue storage activities. That is because we may wish the operator
to continue to be bound by the monitoring and the remediation
obligations under the licence, even if they no longer have the right to
continue storage activities.</div>
					<a name="080221130000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that I have reassured
the hon. Member for Wealden that the proposed penalties for offences
relating to inspections are adequate. I hope that I have also explained
that a revocation provision is not required in the Bill because it
could be included in the terms and conditions of licences if the
regulatory authority deemed it necessary. There are circumstances in
which that might not be appropriate. I would like to reassure
colleagues and the hon. Gentleman that refusing to allow an inspector
entry to a site would be very serious indeed, but that is true across a
range of areas from this to child protection. Such a refusal would be
enough to attract a penalty or the loss of a licence. That will be in
the terms and conditions of the licence.</div>
					<a name="080221130000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman has been very kind this afternoon. I hope that in the light
of those reassurances, he will consider withdrawing his
amendment.</div>

						</b> Where a gas storage development intends to use a
geological feature that contains hydrocarbons, in addition to a gas
unloading and storage licence, a developer will also need to obtain
rights under a petroleum production licence. That is due to the
inevitable production of indigenous hydrocarbons, which will be mingled
with the stored gas when it is recovered. Where the intention is not to
use a geological feature containing hydrocarbons, such as a salt
feature, no rights would need to be obtained under a petroleum
production licence.</div>

some cases, a developer with a gas unloading and storage licence may

avoidance of legal doubt, stating that a petroleum production licence
is not required. The clause empowers the Secretary of State to make

the Science and Technology Committee carried out an investigation into
carbon caption storage and published a report in February 2006, we
discovered that enhanced oil recovery is the only way of clearing out
considerable oil reserves that are in the interstitial cavities of the

evaporated, or that it is as evacuated as possible of petroleum oil. If
enhanced oil recovery has not been carried out, there will be
substantial petroleum oil reservoirs down in those cavities.</div>

that enhanced oil recovery is very common these days, and that most of
the reservoirs that would be used for the storage of gas, and later
carbon dioxide, would be empty of petroleum oil. However, the evidence

Gentleman, who clearly speaks from a very expert and knowledgeable
perspective. However, I too, was intrigued to know how on earth this
could literally be done. We have talked about the powers of the
Secretary of State being very wide, but the power to give a direction
in respect of a &#147;relevant stratum&#148; of a geological
storage area, seems an extraordinarily technical power to give to a
Secretary of State. I would be interested to know in respect of
subsection (3)&#151;I am not sure that the Minister quite explained
this and I am not familiar with the Petroleum

enhanced oil recovery becomes viable unexpectedly in the course of the
operation of one of these facilities, the Secretary of State will have
almost boxed themselves into a situation in which a particular regime
applies to that and there is not sufficient flexibility to allow it to
take place on a viable or commercial basis. I would therefore welcome

						</b> We now move on to carbon capture
and storage. The debate has often been ahead of me on this one and,
indeed, ahead of the Bill, although there have been one or two cases in
which it has been appropriate to discuss CCS alongside other activities
relating to gas. Therefore some background will perhaps be
helpful.</div>
					<a name="080221130000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">CCS
with power generation involves capturing carbon dioxide that would
otherwise be released from fossil fuel power stations and storing it
permanently in geological formations such as depleted oil and gas
fields. Although CCS is considered a promising climate change
mitigation measure, it has yet to be demonstrated in relation to a
commercial-scale power station. CCS has the potential to reduce
CO<span class="Sub">2</span> emissions from fossil fuel power stations by up to 90
per cent., which is a key reason why it has created such interest, not
least in
Parliament.</div>

					<a name="080221130000282"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government, as the Committee knows, have announced their commitment to
the development of CCS by supporting one of the world&#146;s first
commercial scale demonstration projects. We had a useful evidence
session on that very subject. This chapter of the Bill is intended to
provide the regulatory framework for storing CO<span class="Sub">2</span> under the
sea bed. The next 20 clauses that we shall be debating relate to this
important part of the Bill, which will enable this important technology
to go forward here in the UK.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column186" />Column number: 186</div>
					<a name="080221130000283"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Committee will notice some similarities with the provisions of offshore
storage of natural gas and the unloading of LNG. We have these
provisions as a different part of the Bill because CO<span class="Sub">2</span>
storage is a separate issue from offshore natural gas storage or the
unloading of LNG. Moreover, there are some differences between the
regimes and some additional clauses that reflect the specific issues
relating to CO<span class="Sub">2</span> storage. These provisions are necessary
because existing legislation is not suited to licensing an underground
storage of CO<span class="Sub">2</span>.</div>
					<a name="080221130000284"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
provisions in this chapter are intended to address these shortcomings.
They provide a comprehensive and adaptable legal basis for regulating
the storage of CO<span class="Sub">2</span> in the offshore area. The offshore areas
thought to have particularly promising geology for the storage of
CO<span class="Sub">2</span> are the depleted oil and gas reservoirs of the North
sea. This clause prohibits the storage of CO<span class="Sub">2</span> and related
activities beneath the UK sea bed potentially out to 200 nautical
miles, unless it is carried out under a licence and in accordance with
the provisions of that licence. In addition to the storage of
CO<span class="Sub">2</span>, the prohibition also extends to the exploration of a
site to assess its suitability for storage, the conversion of a site to
make it suitable for such storage and the building of relevant
installations.</div>

Horwood:
						</b> The Minister has raised the important point of
the appropriateness of the geology. That is clearly an important
potential advantage for Great Britain in pursuing carbon capture and
storage technologies because we have a great deal of experience in
exploiting these kinds of geological features. But he will recall that
it was pointed out during the evidence session that some of these
geological features, such as the Miller field, are exhausted. Unless
they are exploited for carbon capture and storage on a relatively quick
time scale, they will be capped and lost as a potential facility. The
time scale of this is critically important. If we have a regime that
extends the time scale too far, we will find that that advantage from
geology starts to reduce quite sharply with geological features
becoming less available as they are capped and effectively removed from
the possibility of exploitation for these
purposes.</div>

Wicks:
						</b> I do not understand why the hon. Gentleman feels
that this regime&#151;presumably the one we are discussing now and in
the forthcoming clauses&#151;will unnecessarily extend the time
scale. We are all anxious to tackle global warming and reduce
CO<span class="Sub">2</span> emissions here in the UK and worldwide just as quickly
as possible. Time is not on our side. I certainly wish that CCS had a
history of 20 years and we would be talking more about its universal
deployment. But we are not there yet scientifically and
technologically. The costs, as we noted the other day in Portcullis
House, are obviously considerable. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman can
return to this theme on another occasion. I do not want to stop him
intervening again, but we have hours of delicious debate on this
subject ahead of
us.</div>

						</b> I am extremely grateful to the
Minister and you will guide me, Mr. Amess, if we veer too
far off the immediate clauses before us. The Minister talked about the
necessity of getting CCS on stream as soon as possible. The competition
regime that the Government are considering and which is relevant to the
Bill will not bring it on stream as fast as possible. As 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column187" />Column number: 187</div>fast as possible would be projects like the Peterhead project by BP,
which would have been on stream by 2011, which is a good three or more
years ahead of the competition outcome. In fact, the Carbon Capture and
Storage Association told us in evidence that there were potentially
four or so other projects, which I think the association will provide
details of to the Minister, which could be on stream ahead of the
competition regime. Surely, if the Minister means what he has just
said&#151;he pointed out that he wants carbon capture on stream as
fast as possible&#151;there is a major flaw in the
Government&#146;s thinking on carbon capture and storage, which is
presumably reflected in the Bill&#146;s
approach.</div>

						</b> I will return to the clause in a
moment, but with your permission, Mr. Amess, I feel that I
should answer that point. The Liberal Democrats are asking for more and
more and for more and more money to be spent because of urgency. I am
genuinely proud that the United Kingdom, alongside only a few other
countries&#151; Norway and perhaps the United States&#151;is ahead
of the game. I think that I said in the evidence session that I wish
that we were not ahead of the game and that there were 15 or 20
countries with us, given the urgency of climate change policy. No one
has demonstrated the whole project&#151;the whole chemistry set. We
have useful evidence from around the world and examples of good
practice, and we have mentioned Sleipner gas fields where
CO<span class="Sub">2</span>
						<span class="Sub"> </span>has been stored successfully. As I understand
it, and I think that I do understand this part, no one has built a
power station with CCS technology and then demonstrated the stripping
out of the CO<span class="Sub">2</span>, the transportation and the successful
storage.</div>
					<a name="080221130000289"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although,
to some extent, I share the frustration of the hon. Member for
Cheltenham about the time scales, it is important that we in the United
Kingdom, on behalf of the taxpayer, have said that we will spend
considerable amounts. His colleague, the hon. Member for Northavon,
teased out of me that we are probably talking about a total of hundreds
of millions of pounds&#151;not a few shillings or a few bob&#151;to
demonstrate the technology. Even the Liberal Democrats have to have

cost. We have heard the phrase &#147;as soon as possible&#148;.
Does the Minister dispute that BP and others expected that the

hundreds of millions of pounds of taxpayers&#146; money and I do not
think that it would have been fair to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column188" />Column number: 188</div>have said to BP or anyone else ahead of a competition, &#147;Okay,
we&#146;ll support you.&#148; We want to demonstrate this with
coal, and a coal-fired power station was not the Miller field,
Peterhead, project. We want to demonstrate it with coal because of the
worldwide significance of coal in contributing to the rising
temperatures of our planet and climate change. I do not think that the

that.</div>

some Australian states, I believe. The useful collaboration with the
Norwegians is important here because we are doing a lot of technical
and important work with them. Anyway, we will not say how we look

storage licence. We recognise that with the advent of the single
electricity market across Ireland, there are increasingly different
considerations in respect of proposals in Northern Ireland from
proposals that might come forward in the rest of the UK. To reflect the
differences, therefore, I believe that it would be prudent for my
Department and for the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment
in Northern Ireland to pursue a formal memorandum of understanding
setting out how we would work with the relevant authorities in Northern
Ireland before granting any consents for carbon dioxide storage
facilities in Northern Ireland territorial waters. That rather

It is quite possible that in 10 years we will have established that it
is, as we all think, technically feasible to capture and store carbon,
but we might have decided that it is not economically viable to make
that happen without masses of taxpayers&#146; money or a very high
price for carbon. Our primary concern is that the Government would be

						</b> I agree with the Minister.
However, that should be seen against the background of what the
licensing regime will achieve. Owing to the way in which the Government
are going about the programme, it will achieve less than if the pilot
scheme had been done in a more all-embracing manner. I am not going to
continue quoting from the evidence sessions because I think that you
would rule me out of order, Mr. Amess, for straying away
from the clause. However, similar representations were made by
Centrica, Scottish and Southern and others. The only people who spoke
in favour of the Government&#146;s approach were from E.ON and
Npower, which indicated that they wish to bid for contracts under the
proposed pilot
scheme.</div>
					<a name="080221130000312"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
understand the Government&#146;s argument, which the Minister has
just made, about the importance of the export potential to China.
However, we are doing that at the expense of our nation&#146;s
domestic interests. There would be massive potential for exporting
pre-combustion technology. It is one of the most exciting energy
technologies around. To some extent, we are closing the door on that
opportunity because of the Government&#146;s approach. Their message
seems to be, &#147;You might be developing one of the most exciting
energy technologies on the planet, but do not expect any help from us
in doing so&#148;. Through pre-combustion, CO<span class="Sub">2</span>
						<span class="Sub">
</span>can be captured in its totality at much less expense than can be
the case for post-combustion. However, as we have heard in
interventions, the pilot scheme in Peterhead closed down through lack
of support.</div>
					<a name="080221130000313"></a><div class="hs_Para">The point
that I am making was made clear recently by the chief executive of
Shell, Jeroen van der Veer. He has argued that there are two approaches
to the current energy challenges: what he called
&#147;scramble&#148;, where we all do what comes into our heads
first and think about 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column191" />Column number: 191</div>what is right for our narrow domestic interest; and what he called
&#147;blueprint&#148;, where we co-operate to maximum effect. That
absolutely should be the way forward for carbon capture and storage. As
the Minister said, other countries are getting involved in that process
as well. Very few are as far ahead as we are. However, we should be
working together and learning from each other&#146;s work, rather
than ploughing our own furrows. We should be trying to achieve the most
in the shortest possible
time.</div>
					<a name="080221130000314"></a><div class="hs_Para">Time
is not on our side&#151;literally, I see, looking at the clock. The
pilot scheme is unlikely to be up and running before 2014. It will then
take us some years to evaluate and learn the lessons, so commercial
exploitation of the technology is unlikely before 2020&#151;five
years after we will get hit by the energy gap. What that means in the
short term is that we will be seeing applications for new dirty
coal-powered plants being brought forward&#151;they will be
significantly cleaner than their predecessors, but still very
dirty.</div>

the way in which we are going to go.</div>

should be looking at how we can work with others to make that happen,
and that is the background against which these clauses need to be
considered. There are many hon. Members who, on Second Reading and
during our discussions in the evidence sessions, have made
it clear that they want a broader approach to be taken on
this.</div>
					<a name="080221130000317"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also have
concerns about the general licensing approach. The witnesses from the
Carbon Capture and Storage Association said that they need a single
licensing agreement. How will the Government help them to achieve that?
In their written submission they
said:</div>
					<a name="080221130000392"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Recognising
that offshore CO<span class="Sub">2</span> storage will have many technical and
operational parallels with current hydrocarbon exploration and
production activities, for which substantial regulatory expertise
already exists within the Department for Business, Enterprise &amp;
Regulatory Reform (BERR), the Association would strongly favour a
comparable &#145;one stop shop&#146; licensing arrangement for CCS
projects over which BERR has singular
responsibility.&#148;</div>
					<a name="080221130000318"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will
the Minister give us assurances that the approach that he is putting
forward in this Bill will help to achieve that? Oil and Gas UK made the
same sort of
representations:</div>
					<a name="080221130000393"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;On
the issue of carbon capture and storage (CCS) and natural gas storage,
Oil &amp; Gas UK is concerned that the new licensing scheme does not
properly take into account the interaction with the existing petroleum
licensing regime or respect the legal rights already conferred,
especially on any transfer of a petroleum licence. We believe there
needs to be a clear and unambiguous statement within the Bill on the
primacy of vested rights under existing Petroleum Production Licences
in the event of any conflict between these and the terms of new CCS or
gas storage licences.&#148;</div>
					<a name="080221130000319"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope the Minister can give some
clarification on
that.</div>
					<a name="080221130000320"></a><div class="hs_Para">In clause
16(3), there is a reference to waters in gas importation and storage
zones. Does that potentially 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column192" />Column number: 192</div>include anywhere in the wider 200 mile limit around our shores and
outside the 12 mile limit? What is the process of identifying and
establishing those
zones?</div>
					<a name="080221130000321"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will
the Minister say something about the use of saline aquifers on land?
Subsection (3) defines a controlled place as being at sea, but some of
the witnesses indicated that the best use of saline aquifers would be
where most of the potential storage would take place. I think they said
that 14 billion gigatonnes of CO<span class="Sub">2 </span>could be held there out of
a 24 billion gigatonnes storage requirement. Some of that would be on
land. How do the Bill and the licensing arrangements relate to
land-based saline
aquifers?</div>
					<a name="080221130000322"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
will the Minister say something about enhanced oil recovery? At the
moment, carbon capture and storage applies where there is an enhanced
oil recovery capability. There are international treaty obligations
that tie us into that and stop us from simply using the sea bed as a
dumping ground for carbon dioxide. What are the Government proposing to
relax those treaty obligations so that this technology can genuinely
move forward and we can achieve the most from
it?</div>
					<a name="080221130000323"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister will
be aware that we are supportive of the general principle, but we are
disappointed by the narrowness of the Government&#146;s approach.
There is more that we could achieve in a shorter time scale than will
happen as a result of the Government&#146;s approach. I hope that it
is not too late to make some corrections to these
failings.</div>

						</b> I feel that my pearls of wisdom may be interrupted,
but I will give it a go.</div>
					<a name="080221130000325"></a><div class="hs_Para">I start by
asking a general question about this chapter of the Bill on the storage
of carbon dioxide. I would like to ask the Minister what I call my
idiot&#146;s question. Carbon dioxide is one greenhouse gas.
Presumably there are other greenhouse gases that could possibly be
captured and stored. I appreciate that this is the biggest one and the
one we are talking about now, but would it not be better to legislate
generally rather than to legislate for this gas and then find ourselves
coming back when we have some technology for liquefying or storing
methane, or whatever else it happens to be? Why did the Minister
not&#151;and why does the Bill not&#151;legislate in general terms
because presumably the structural issues of licenses and so on would
apply to any other greenhouse
gas?</div>
					<a name="080221130000326"></a><div class="hs_Para">If I may digress
a second, I think that I should put on record my concern about the
remarks that were made about one of the witnesses. I have a lot of time
for the hon. Member for Wealden. I do not know him very well, but when
I have come across him, I have found him to be very fair minded and
constructive. I hope that when he leaves today he will reflect on
maligning a witness. I think that suggesting that he was special
pleading is really not appropriate and I hope that the hon. Gentleman

Webb:
						</b> In the debate so far, Mr. Amess, you have
allowed us to start off a whole section on carbon capture and storage
and to range somewhat more freely than I am sure we will do on
subsequent clauses. In that spirit, I have a couple of observations
triggered by the Minister&#146;s comments and by the thoughts of the
hon. Member for Wealden on carbon capture and storage.</div>
					<a name="080221130000333"></a><div class="hs_Para">The important context for the
Liberal Democrat position is, and I hesitate to say this, from a
European Union briefing that makes the following interesting
assertion:</div>
					<a name="080221130000394"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;While
energy efficiency and renewables are in the long term the most
sustainable solutions both for security of supply and climate, EU and
world C02 emissions cannot be reduced by 50 per cent. by 2050 if we do
not also use other options such as carbon capture and
storage.&#148;</div>
					<a name="080221130000334"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is a
clear statement from an organisation that presumably has no commercial
axe to grind that carbon capture and storage is absolutely essential to
meeting these targets. I was genuinely interested in the comment made
by the Member for Wealden that in a few years time, we might decide
that carbon capture and storage is uneconomic. I suppose that it
depends on what is meant by &#147;uneconomic&#148;. The Stern
report said that unless we tackle the problem now, it will be far more
expensive to tackle it in the future. I am not aware of a plan B on
this and although the costs that we are talking about may be
frightening, the costs of not acting may be more frightening still.
That is why we need to get the licensing regime right.</div>
					<a name="080221130000335"></a><div class="hs_Para">I take the
Minister&#146;s point that the licensing regime in the Bill is
technology-neutral. The Bill itself does not favour one technology or
another, but clearly Government policy has done so, and he referred to
the competition that the Government have initiated. He said that we
need to get on with CCS as quickly as possible. What my hon. Friend the
Member for Cheltenham was saying&#151;and I do not really think that
the Minister has addressed this point&#151;is that Government policy
has actually obstructed getting CCS up and running sooner. That is
demonstrably true. The Minister shakes his head, but the Carbon Capture
and Storage Association said in evidence to the Committee that not only
the Peterhead project, but four others&#151;all of them
pre-combustion technologies&#151;are now on &#147;go slow&#148;
because they are not eligible for the competition. Had the Government
included those projects within the competition, there would have been a
strong incentive to get going, get moving, get them in competition and
then we could have been applying the licensing regime to post- and
pre-combustion technologies.</div>
					<a name="080221130000336"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="080221130000543"></a>Charles
Hendry:
						</b> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that it is not right
for there to be a race between individual countries in this area, with
each trying to win some sort of championship at the end? The scale of
these projects 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column194" />Column number: 194</div>is so huge that countries ought to be working together internationally
to decide which is going to work on pre-combustion and post-combustion
and how we ensure that a range of technologies is tried so that we can
work out which has the most
promise.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="080221130000544"></a>Steve
Webb:
						</b> I absolutely agree with the hon. Gentleman: I know
that the Conservatives are great on European co-operation,
internationalism and on Governments co-ordinating things rather than
just leaving them to the markets. I agree that what he has just
described is necessary in this case. It is another example of why
constructive co-operation across Europe is such a good thing. That is
the approach that we need.</div>
					<a name="080221130000338"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
will probably tell us repeatedly during the course of the
Committee&#146;s proceedings&#151;he already has twice&#151;how
good Britain is, but does he not realise that the consequence of the
policy that he has just described has been to drive CCS projects out of
Britain to other countries? For example, I asked BP what it will do now
that the Government have scuppered the Peterhead project, and it said
it would move them to Abu Dhabi. In other words, the projects will go
elsewhere, as will the technology, potentially, and Britain will lose
out.</div>
					<a name="080221130000339"></a><div class="hs_Para">The problem
with carbon capture in that regard is that the licences that we are
talking about will effectively only be implemented in the first
instance on the Government&#146;s demonstration post-combustion
project&#151;if the Government think that that is the first thing
that will happen, I presume that it is the first application we will
have. Our worry relates to the time scale.</div>

							<a name="080221130000545"></a>Malcolm
Wicks:
						</b> I want fully to understand the argument. I am not
sure whether the hon. Gentleman is saying that we should have abolished
the idea of a fair competition between companies and given it to one
company&#151;and I think that he has BP in mind. Is he arguing that
we should have done that, or that we were wrong to make that judgment
between pre and post? Given that considerable amounts of money from
companies go into those exercises, we felt that it was only fair to
make our judgment about the technology, and we choose post. Does he
think that we should have kept all of them going, given that we could
only fund one project? Maybe the Liberal Democrats could fund five, but
because we can only fund one, at some stage a judgment has to be
made.&#151;<i class="I">[</i>

					<a name="080221130000341"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
received advice that the rate at which coal power stations are being
built in China means that they will hopefully one day require
post-combustion, so does the hon. Gentleman think that that advice was
wrong and that the Government were wrong to follow it and to reflect on
the global issues, not least of which is China? Does he think that we
should have reflected only on the UK? Those were difficult judgments,
and I think that we made the rights ones. I will be interested to hear,
in the real world, what judgments he would
make.</div>

							<a name="080221130000546"></a>Steve
Webb:
						</b> I am grateful that the Minister anticipated a day
when I shall have ministerial responsibility, so I shall practise now.
In answer to his question on whether it should have just been given to
one company, it clearly should not. However, my critical point is that
I do not 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column195" />Column number: 195</div>think that the Government&#146;s approach is up to the scale of the
problem. The Minister&#146;s argument is, &#147;We are a bit
strapped for cash. We will fund one, but we could not possible fund
two, so we had to choose one technology.&#148; His argument is that
there is not enough money to have a look at two major
technologies.</div>
					<a name="080221130000343"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although the Carbon Capture
and Storage Association told us in evidence quite how exciting the
potential for pre-combustion technology is, I do not dispute the
potential benefit of the other technology and the international
dimension, which is clearly also important. However, I shall give an
example of where money might come from to enable both technologies to
be pursued. There might be two competitions or two approaches. In our
evidence sessions, we talked about the &#163;9 billion that the
energy companies are getting from the European decision to hand them a
free emissions trading permit, which the Government had a part in. A
person as sober and grounded in the real world as the director general
of Ofgem has said that that was a &#163;9 billion windfall. That is
not the hundreds of million that the Minister talked about for the
Government&#146;s competition on post-combustion, but a &#163;9
billion windfall.</div>
					<a name="080221130000344"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given that the Minister thinks
that the companies should&#151;I almost quote&#151;get off their
backsides and do some of this stuff themselves, why do not the
Government not ensure that, having given them that windfall, some of
the money is used precisely for that purpose? That way, we would not
have to make this false choice between two technologies, both of which
could be critical, dare I say it, to the future of the planet. My point
is that if, as their planet slowly fries, our grandchildren say,
&#147;If you had gone for two technologies that were actually up to
the scale of the problem, we might not be in this mess. But you
couldn&#146;t find the money so you only chose one and, as a result,
we haven&#146;t achieved the critical improvements we need&#148;, I
think that they would hold us
responsible.</div>

on that point, Mr.
Amess.</div>
					<a name="080221130000350"></a><div class="hs_Para">Without
referring to the intervention, the general, important point remains.
That point is that the difference between our approach and the
Minister&#146;s is that the Government say that they will put public
money into one technology but not another; they hope that the private
sector will fund the other. That is essentially the Government
position, rather like how they hope that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column196" />Column number: 196</div>the private sector will do something about fuel poverty instead of the
Government making it do something. The same issue applies to carbon
capture and storage. The Government could&#151;via a mechanism that
we might consider&#151;make the private sector do those things or
threaten it with some penalty if it did not, but they have not chosen
that route. This section of the Bill and this set of technologies are
so vital and Mr. Burke, the expert witness, said powerfully
that if we did not get it right, we would be in real trouble. My worry
is, therefore, about the Government picking one technology over
another.</div>
					<a name="080221130000351"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to
ask the Minister about another closely related aspect and that is the
work&#151;which the Minister mentioned&#151;that the Government are
doing in co-operation with China. That work is the UK-China near-zero
emissions coal project with which I am sure he is very familiar. I do
not know whether he was on the plane with the Prime Minister when he
went to China; I do not know whether he gets to go on those
jaunts.</div>
					<a name="080221130000352"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
understanding is that the EU and China are working together on a
near-zero emissions coal agreement, which incorporates demonstrating
and building carbon capture and storage technology in China. I wonder
how that squares with what the Minister says. I am not suggesting it is
inconsistent&#151;I think it is great. The Minister seems to be
saying that we need that approach in the UK because we can sell it to
the Chinese, but are we not already working jointly with the Chinese,
separately on the demonstration projects that he talked about? How do
those two things fit together? Does he know&#151;I do
not&#151;which CCS technologies are being considered for the UK-China
near-zero emissions coal project? I think that somebody in the room
probably does, which is a help. Can he clarify how all of those things
fit together?</div>
					<a name="080221130000353"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
specific question on the clause is: we are doing a whole section just
on CO<span class="Sub">2</span>; are there other gases that we would want to bring in
at some point, and could we be doing that now rather than having to
legislate again? My general contextual question is to try to stress
that our view is that although competition and public money are
welcome, the scale of the problem means that picking one technology and
putting all the public&#146;s eggs in that basket with no public
money in the other basket is profoundly
mistaken.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="080221130000552"></a>Dr.
Iddon:
						</b> I will try to be as brief as possible. I am a
chemist and so I start from the premise that I would not be burning
fossil fuels in the first place, because particularly coal, but also
oil, are sources of chemicals for generations well into the future.
Petroleum oil will run out far earlier than coal. I accept that we have
enormous coal resources throughout the world, particularly in places
such Australia but also of course in this country.</div>
					<a name="080221130000355"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the question of pre-capture
or post-capture, I am also slightly worried about what the Government
are doing. I will read out the conclusion that the Science and
Technology Committee came to in its February 2006 publication, HC 578
volume
1:</div>
					<a name="080221130000395"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Although
it is clearly important that pre-combustion, post-combustion and
oxyfuel capture technologies be developed, we believe that for new
plant pre-combustion capture offers a significant advantage, in a
carbon constrained world, as a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column197" />Column number: 197</div>potential source of hydrogen. As the technology develops, the Government
should take into account the potential strategic importance of
polygeneration systems based on pre-combustion capture technology and
consider the case for putting in place incentives to promote the use of
this technology in new build
plant.&#148;</div>
					<a name="080221130000356"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
emphasise that that is &#147;in new build plant&#148;. Obviously it
will not be cost-effective to retrofit post-carbon capture technology.
That would be too expensive in a plant that has only a few years to
live. We therefore dismiss those because Britain will be closing its
older plants shortly. I do not know about China or the rest of the
world; I suspect that in the rest of the world, particularly in
developing countries, those plants will be made to last as long as
possible. Perhaps post-carbon capture on older plants in other
countries is a
possibility.</div>
					<a name="080221130000357"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are
by no means sure about the relative costs of post-carbon and pre-carbon
technologies. Post-carbon technology relies on the fact that the carbon
dioxide coming out of the plant is separated from all other gases, such
as oxygen and nitrogen, by forming a complex diamine carbonate, and
then heating the solvent, as it is often called, which boils off the
carbon dioxide so that it can be transferred to storage. Diamines are
not cheap chemicals and large amounts will be necessary to capture the
huge volumes of carbon dioxide coming out of a coal-fired generating
plant. Those are getting bigger and are not the small plants that we
had post-1940. They are huge and one can see them when driving around
the countryside. The cost of that will not be insignificant in my
view.</div>
					<a name="080221130000358"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Select
Committee was also quite clear about pre-carbon capture technology. If
we are building new plants anywhere in the world, especially in this
country, they should be carbon capture-ready. The Science and
Technology Committee, after taking a lot of evidence, recommended that
pre-carbon capture technology is the only answer because it generates
hydrogen. Anyone who went to the Hitachi &#147;Inspire Life&#148;
exhibition either yesterday or today will have seen how the Japanese,
who are leaders in all technologies, regard the hydrogen technology for
driving cars in
particular.</div>
					<a name="080221130000359"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
think that hydrogen will be one of the transport fuels of the future
because it does not produce carbon dioxide. The Japanese have realised
that and are developing the hydrogen economy quite significantly. If we
do not jump on this opportunity and encourage pre-carbon capture
technology now, I do not think that the hydrogen economy in this
country will be kick-started. Therefore, our transport economy will
still rely on hydrocarbon fuels to generate the electricity that drives
the cars. We will miss a trick and will lose out in competition to the
Japanese if we do not kick-start the hydrogen economy. The only way to
do that is to have pre-carbon capture technology on all new fossil fuel
burning
plants.</div>

Iddon:
						</b> I can tell the hon. Gentleman that pre-and
post-carbon capture technologies are not new. In the Algerian desert,
oil is being extracted with huge quantities of carbon dioxide in it. It
is called the In Salah field and that carbon is now being captured and
stored in the desert in the way that I have described. Pre- carbon
capture technology is also well known in the chemical industry. The
technologies are not new, but using them in the electricity generating
industry with coal burning plants is. I do not know&#151;I suspect
that nobody knows&#151;whether post or pre-carbon capture technology
will win out, but the difficulty with the Government&#146;s decision
is that we are not going to be able to test that, as the hon. Member
for Northavon said. I would have preferred, as I said in the
evidence-taking sessions, at least parallel competitions, if not one
competition involving pre and post-carbon technology.</div>
					<a name="080221130000362"></a><div class="hs_Para">As a
scientist, my difficulty is that, if we take the line that the
Government are obviously taking&#151;I agree that retrofitting of
existing plants is extremely important and I do not disagree with what
the Government say about it&#151;it will send the wrong signals on
the other technology. As has been said, the danger is that the
technology will go elsewhere, but we cannot afford to lose it, because
it produces
hydrogen.</div>

Wicks:
						</b> I was listening with such care to my hon.
Friend&#151;he is clearly a great expert on science. I am merely a
relatively ignorant former science Minister, so I learned a great deal
from him.</div>
					<a name="080221130000364"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall not
trespass too much at the moment into the pre and post-combustion
discussion again&#151;I have made my comments on that. If it is
appropriate, I might say more next week. I shall respond to a number of
the remarks in the limited time available in no particular order. I
suspect that I shall continue with my dissertation in response next
week.</div>
					<a name="080221130000365"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Wealden asked about international collaboration. The UK
plays a significant role in a number of international initiatives with
the aim of accelerating the deployment of CCS technology. For example,
we have a memorandum of understanding with the United States that
provides for working together on joint R and D projects, and we expect
that the relationship will lead into CCS demonstration, co-operation
and sharing. We are also actively participating in the carbon
sequestration leadership forum, which is led by the
USA.</div>
					<a name="080221130000366"></a><div class="hs_Para">Co-operation
within the EU is wide-ranging and includes work on the zero-emissions
fossil fuel power plant technology platform. As has been mentioned, the
UK has an energy memorandum of understanding with China, under which we
are jointly developing R and D projects. The near-zero emissions coal
initiative was announced as part of the EU-China partnership on climate
change at the EU-China summit in September 2005. Also, co-operation
with the North sea states, particularly Norway, focuses on the work of
the North sea basin task force. There is quite a strong international
dimension to what we are doing.</div>
					<a name="080221130000367"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Gentleman asked about
the European Union. We hope that other member states step into the
arena, as it were, on carbon capture and storage. The EU has spoken of
the need for perhaps 10 to 12 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column199" />Column number: 199</div>demonstration projects, which it aims to deliver by around 2015; as we
know, we have promised to deliver one of the projects. I repeat that
we, alongside Norway, are very much leading on such matters in the
continent of
Europe.</div>
					<a name="080221130000368"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
obviously welcome the fact that a number of companies have a strong
interest in the different technologies. The point I made in the
evidence session the other day was that it does not need to be
Government alone who demonstrate the project. It would be good for
corporate social and environmental responsibility if one or two of the
world&#146;s big energy companies could demonstrate
projects.</div>

							<a name="080221130000556"></a>Martin

way?</div>

							<a name="080221130000558"></a>Martin
Horwood:
						</b> The Minister made the point that the energy
companies should be prepared to put their own money in, but BP put tens
of millions of pounds into the Peterhead project. The truth is that
none of the projects will be viable without some measure of public
support. They will clearly ask for the largest possible amount of
public support and we might want to minimise it, but it is important to
recognise what they put
in.</div>

							<a name="080221130000559"></a>Malcolm
Wicks:
						</b> I suspect that in certain parts of the world
companies will do that without Government support in future, and we
will be able to test that hypothesis. In clause 1(5), there is a power
to designate one or more areas as gas importation and storage zones. In
exercising that power, it will have to be considered whether to
designate a single zone covering the whole of the relevant offshore
area or adopt a step-by-step
approach.</div>
					<a name="080221130000373"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
was asked about other greenhouse gases, which was a perfectly
reasonable point. CO<span class="Sub">2 </span>is the most applicable greenhouse gas
in the context of fossil fuel burning, including in power generation,
but we do not rule out the need to consider measures for emissions of
other greenhouse gases. Given the challenge of climate change, CO<span class="Sub">2
</span>is public enemy No. 1, if I can put it like
that.</div>
					<a name="080221130000374"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
was asked about the overall regulation of carbon dioxide storage. The
Bill intends regulation through the Secretary of State but allows his
powers to be transferred 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column200" />Column number: 200</div>to an appropriate agency. We have not yet decided which will be the
appropriate authority. We have some time to think about that, but
whichever is chosen, it will have the appropriate expertise to regulate
carbon dioxide storage
effectively.</div>
					<a name="080221130000375"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have
talked about offshore storage, but the hon. Gentleman asked me about
onshore storage. I am advised that it is currently prohibited by the<i class="I">
</i>European Union. <i class="I">[Interruption.] </i>Was it the hon. Member for
Wealden? There are so many Euro-enthusiasts on the Opposition Benches
that I could not quite recall. We hope that a forthcoming EU directive
will remove that prohibition; the use of a saline aquifer on land will
be assessed when the directive comes
forward.</div>
					<a name="080221130000376"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was asked
about enhanced oil recovery, which is important and helps to make CCS
more cost-effective. The development of the emissions trading scheme
and a higher price for carbon is another important development, but
enhanced oil recovery is critical. Through clause 32, we will have the
power to define the circumstances under which it will require a
CO<span class="Sub">2 </span>storage licence, and we expect to use
it.</div>
					<a name="080221130000377"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
was asked about the need for a clear statement in the Bill about the
primacy of vested rights under existing petroleum production licences.
The Bill is an enabling framework, and it would therefore not be
appropriate for it to contain the detail of our proposed regulatory
arrangements, on which, as hon. Members know, we shall shortly consult.
We expect the consultation to cover, among other things, the proposed
interaction between petroleum rights and CO<span class="Sub">2 </span>storage
licences, but in any event, there is no possibility of taking away
vested rights. For instance, if a petroleum licence holder already has
consent to drill in a particular area, we could not take it away by
granting a gas storage licence over the same area. We are, however,
amending section 47A of the Petroleum Act 1998 to ensure that, in
deciding to give such a consent, we can take into account gas storage
and CCS activities. That is already the case for wind farm activities,
and we shall consult on guidance that we will issue in relation to the
new activities.</div>
					<a name="080221130000378"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
apologise if there were other questions that I have not dealt with, and
I hope that I have persuaded the Committee to support the
clause.</div>
