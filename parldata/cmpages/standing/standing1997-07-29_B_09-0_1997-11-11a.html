<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Social Security (Mr. Keith Bradley)</b>: This morning I spoke about the amendments up to No. 244. I turn now to amendments Nos. 245 and 246.
<P>
Amendment No. 245, as the hon. Member for Newbury (Mr. Rendel) said, provides for a decision of the Secretary of State in lookalike cases to be made in accordance with an earlier relevant decision. Like the other amendments, it would introduce unfairness by providing full arrears to some customers but not to others. I covered that point this morning.
<P>
Hon. Members will be pleased to know that amendment No. 246 is an exact replica of Government amendment No. 71, which we shall come to shortly. I seek permission to leave discussion of the issue raised by the other amendment until that point. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will therefore decide not to press amendments Nos. 245 and 246.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Rendel (Newbury):</B> I may have misheard the Minister. Did he say that amendment No. 245 would be unfair because it would mean that some people would be paid fully and others would not?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> Yes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> How, in that case, does he square what he has just said is wrong with the amendment with what I said was wrong with the clause? It was exactly the same point. A person whose test case goes through will be paid fully, and other people who make claims but who will not be paid until the date of the decision, will not be paid fully. That is exactly the point that I was making about the Clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> May I return to that point when we deal with amendment No. 246 and Government amendment No. 71? As that point is covered by Government amendment No. 71, the hon. Gentleman might not need to press amendments Nos. 245 and 246. Perhaps he would like to reflect on that idea.
<P>
Amendment No. 248 seeks to remove clause 27 (4), which puts beyond doubt the fact that restrictions on arrears will also apply where the commissioner or court determines that regulations are invalid, or what is known as ultra vires.
<P>
The Secretary of State makes regulations on the basis of her understanding of the powers laid down by Parliament. It is rare for that power to be misunderstood, but where it happens, there are well established procedures for handling those cases. In 1989, in the Cotton case, a tribunal of commissioners established that restriction on arrears may be applied in such cases.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 249 and 271 seek to exclude decisions of the European Court of Justice from the restrictions that I described earlier. The Bill makes it clear that decisions of the European Court of Justice are determinations by a court, so similar restrictions on arrears apply. That is not a new provision. The words are in the Bill to clarify existing legislation. The amendment seeks to exempt those judgments and would result in potential unlimited backdating of arrears for some people.
<P>
Clause 27 may not be popular, but it is fair. It treats all relevant determinations in the same way. It would be unfair to exempt the decisions of the European Court of Justice, and it could also result in the court's becoming clogged up with cases as people try to circumvent the restrictions. 
<P>
In the light of what I have said, I urge the hon. Member for Newbury to withdraw the amendment, but I will elaborate later on Government amendment No. 71, which covers the points raised by amendments Nos. 245 and 246.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> I am grateful for the Minister's response, but he has still not answered the question that I asked in my intervention. I hope that he will be able to do so because my question was critical and goes to the heart of what is wrong with the clause. The way in which some people, but not others are being treated is unfair. That was precisely the argument that the Minister used against the amendments and it is precisely the one that we are using against the clause. If the Minister relies on that argument in objecting to the amendments, he is implicitly accepting our arguments against the clause, which is obviously critical to the issue.
<P>
With regard to the Minister's remarks on other amendments, I am delighted that one of the Government amendments is precisely in line with one of our own, amendment No. 246. Combined with that originally was amendment No. 245, which replaces the words that the Minister has sought to link with another Clause. He assures us that the effect of simply deleting the words as suggested in Government amendment No. 71 is equivalent to substituting them with the words in amendment No. 245. I have not had time to study that explanation in great depth, but in the light of the Minister's assurance I am happy to withdraw amendments Nos. 245 and 246--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. For the information of the Committee, amendments do not need to be withdrawn if they have not been moved. The question on them is simply not put.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B>You are right, Mr. O'Hara. Thank you for reminding me.
<P>
The Minister seemed to suggest--this was part of his argument with regard to other amendments--that there was a danger that amendment No. 249 might lead to considerable volumes of back payments being made. Our argument is that, if someone puts in a claim that is later found to be fair and correct in every way, it is not unreasonable to suppose that that person should be paid the benefit from the date of the original claim. That should be the case even if the benefit is withheld while the appeal tribunals or whoever look into the fairness and correctness of that or a similar claim. It is right and proper that the money should be paid back, and I would be horrified if that was not done, as the Government seem to intend.
<P>
In our society, a basic fairness surely dictates that the Government should not have the power--we have, after all, a democratic Government--to impose the restriction on a minority of people who may have fair claims that they should not be paid their money just because that would cost the taxpayer money. The benefit claimant has properly sought that money and should be paid. The fact that the state makes provision not to pay the money for a time does not mean that it is right, fair or moral for the Government to withhold such payments in the longer term when they have been properly claimed.
<P>
The clause reeks of a lack of natural justice, which should not be allowed to persist. I would be sorry if the Government insisted that it did.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Do you withdraw the amendment?
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> No, I am not withdrawing the amendment.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, we may take the following amendments: Government amendments Nos. 71 to 73.
<P>
Government amendment No. 81.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> The amendment is purely technical. It removes references to the commencement date of the provision that have been carried forward unnecessarily from the Social Security Administration Act 1992. Those references were introduced in the Scoial Security Act 1990; they are now superfluous. Clause 44 replicates the provisions in clause 27 for child support. The purpose of amendment No. 81 is the correction of a minor drafting error by removing superfluous words, and to amend clause 44 in a similar way to that in which amendment No. 72 amends clause 27. I commend the amendment to the Committee.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<P>
<B>Mr. Steve Webb </B>(Northavon): I beg to move amendment No. 273, in page 18, leave out lines 18 to 26 and insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(7) For the avoidance of doubt, a decision of a Commissioner or the court in a claimant's favour on a point of law is not a relevant determination unless it is the first occasion on which a Commissioner or the court has determined the point of law in favour of any claimant.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> Subsections (7) and (8) of the clause are designed to allow regulations to prescribe how the date of a relevant determination is to be determined. A decision could have been made by commissioners, a court or the House of Lords, and any date could be the relevant date. Subsection (8)(b), however, allows a discretion to permit the last date on which a decision is made to be the relevant date.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
To return to the case of Halliday, which we discussed this morning, at each stage the decision was in favour of the appellant. Commissioners, those involved at the next stage and finally, the House of Lords, all agreed that money was due to the appellant. It is therefore rather odd for the Government to say to the appellant that, although the first decision is proved right, that date will not be counted as the relevant one, and that they will wait for the final decision. People could be deprived of one or two years' money, even though the first decision was right and proven to be so. That relates to the point made a few moments ago by my hon. Friend the Member for Newbury.
<P>
The purpose of the amendment is to remove subsections (7) and (8), which allow the earlier or the later date to be chosen at whim, and to require that, if at every stage the verdict goes in favour of the appellant, the first occasion on which that happens should be deemed to be the relevant date.

<P>

<B>Mr. Keith Bradley:</B> As members of the Committee will know, clause 27 is not a new provision. It serves the same purpose as sections 68 and 69 of the Social Security Administration Act 1992 but it will make that provision clearer and, we hope, less prone to argument about the intention behind the legislation.
<P>
Clause 27 restricts arrears of benefit to similar cases following a decision on a lead case by the commissioner or the courts. I make no apology for that. The extent of the arrears in those similar cases depends on the date of the relevant determination, and which decision is the relevant determination is obviously important. Subsections (7) and (8) provide for regulation-making powers to determine that date.
<P>
The regulation-making powers are important, as different cases can be identified in different ways. For example, a commissioner may decide a case one way but on appeal, the Court of Appeal may take the opposite view, while the House of Lords may decide that the commissioner's interpretation is correct. In such cases, regulations will specify the date of the commissioner's decision as the date of the relevant determination. Amendment No. 273 would, however, apply that simple rule to all cases, even though some decisions are not sufficiently clear cut.
<P>
Sometimes the points of law that the courts consider will be different from those addressed by the commissioner--perhaps something in the commissioner's reasoning will raise a point of law for the court which is not a point of law before the commissioner, or maybe the court will identify a different point of law altogether. The regulation-making powers are important if we are to accommodate the different points at which the commissioner or court interprets a statute with the effect of awarding or increasing benefit. Regulations are necessary to build in such flexibility for complex cases, and I hope that my explanation will allow the hon. Gentleman to withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> I appreciate the point that the Minister is making and I understand that decisions at various stages may reflect different points of law and thus may not be exactly comparable. Presumably, however, what is comparable is the outcome--whether the appellant is entitled to benefit and if so, how much. Our amendment would mean that if it is decreed at the end--whether or not the same point of law applies--that the appellant should receive the same amount of money as the commissioners decreed in the initial decision, albeit for a different reason, why should that not still apply?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> The point that I am trying to make is that the amendment would apply a simple rule to the date of determination, even though decisions at different points may lead to different dates of determination. The simple rule may not apply across the board to all those determinations, which is why we need regulations. Rather than relying on one simple rule, as under the amendment, we need to be able to specify in each case what date of determination would apply.
<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> I understand the point that the Minister makes. It may well be that the amendment as drafted would not achieve our desired outcome, so I am more than content to withdraw it at this point. I hope, however, that the Minister will consider the principle that we were driving at. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<H4><center>Incapacity for Work</center></H4>

<B>Mr. Keith Bradley:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 74, in page 20, line 29, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `( ) Provision may be made by regulations for matters of such descriptions as may be prescribed to be determined by the Secretary of State, notwithstanding that other matters fall to be determined by another authority.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Clause 31 essentially re-enacts subsection (2) of section 61A of the Social Security Administration Act 1992. The amendment ensures that the clause also re-enacts subsection (3) of section 61A, which was omitted when the Bill was first published, as I am sure that all members of the Committee noticed.
<P>
The amendment inserts a new subsection (2) into the clause. It provides the power to make regulations that enable the Secretary of State to decide whether someone is incapable of work, when the question arises in the context of a claim for a disability premium in housing benefit or council tax benefit. All other aspects of claims for these benefits are determined by local authorities. The regulations under the existing power will continue in force under the new power.
<P>
The amendment ensures that the issue of whether a person is capable of work continues to be determined by officers with the right expertise. It ensures consistency in all the relevant benefits. I commend it to the Committee.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.

Clause 31, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<H4><center>Industrial Diseases</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Keith Bradley:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 75, in page 20, line 36, leave out subsection (2).
<P>
The amendment removes a provision that is no longer needed. Clause 32, which relates to industrial diseases, re-enacts section 62 of the Social Security Administration Act 1992, with minor changes to reflect the decision-making provisions in the Bill. Subsection (2) is a re-enactment of section 62(2)(b) of that Act, which provides for the making of regulations related to the payment of fees in connection with medical examinations.
<P>
The medical examinations in question were examinations by Department of Social Security doctors of persons in occupations in which there was a risk of contracting pneumoconiosis. They were conducted when the person took up the occupation, and at regular intervals while they remained in it. The regulations providing for these examinations, and the fees payable by the employer for such examinations, were revoked in 1994 because they duplicated regulations made under the Health and Safety at Work, etc. Act 1974. It follows that the provision in clause 32(2) is no longer required. I invite the Committee to agree to its removal.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`, most appropriate for the claimant, and'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I shall raise one issue under the amendment. It relates to the argument made by the Opposition throughout the Committee's proceedings about regulations that we have never seen. I do not propose to re-fight that battle, because the Minister has made helpful noises, although we are still waiting for draft regulations. One had assumed that the Committee would allow time for the regulation powers towards the end of the Bill. We live in hope.
<P>
The amendment is intended to ensure that the regulations will prescribe the manner in which people should be notified of the determination of their case. We believe strongly that such prescription of the determination should be in easily understood language, so that the customer fully understands the determination, and also understands the reasons behind it. Will the Minister elaborate on how the Government will prescribe the wording in the regulations, and their mechanism, so that they are easily understandable to the customer or the client?
<P>
<B>Mr. Keith Bradley:</B> I shall explain why the provision is unnecessary.
<P>
First, I would remind the Committee that the day-to-day administration of housing benefit and council tax benefit is the responsibility of local authorities. The Government provide the legislative framework for the schemes, but it would be inappropriate to attempt to be prescriptive in areas such as customer service. That is clearly a matter for the authorities themselves.
<P>
The housing benefit and coucnil tax benefit regulations already specify information that local authorities must include when notifying claimants of the decision on their claim. The precise details are specific to the claimant, and depend on the reasons for the notification.
<P>
Subject to such legal requirements, the authorities themselves decide on the wording and format of their notifications, and they are free to add whatever additional information they decide is appropriate. They may use notification letters, for example, to tell the claimant about other local services, and to publish addresses of local legal and advice agencies, such as citizens advice bureaux.
<P>
It is, of course, important that letters be clear and user-friendly. It s obviously in authorities' interests to ensure that they meet those criteria, and that they avoid misunderstandings and unnecessary inquiries.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> If I have correctly understood the Minister, he said that it is up to local authorities, because they handle housing benefit and council tax benefit claims, to decide how to notify their clients. It would therefore be wrong or inadvisable for the Government to interfere. If my interpretation is correct, what is the need for subsection (2)?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> Regulations and guidance are necessary to ensure that the notifications are made in a form that is sensible, appropriate and easily available; mere non-notification would be nonsensical. It is obviously in everyone's interest to ensure good practice, and that is why the guidance is issued to local authorities. It assists them to make every effort to notify people in an understandable way, in user-friendly language, and, where appropriate, using other forms of communication if English is not the native tongue.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> What about the regulations?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> The regulations enable that to be done. The guidance that supports the regulations gives examples of good practice, to ensure that the best possible form of notification is used.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Burns:</B> I am grateful to the Minister. I do not want to make a big deal of the matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> You are, though.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> I may be, but I remind the Minister yet again that that is the purpose of the Committee. It is to probe, and to study the Bill line by line before legislation is enacted. That is our duty as an Opposition, and there is no point in the Minister gratuitously criticising us for doing our duty.
<P>
The Minister told the Committee that there was no need for the amendment because local authorities were responsible for notification and that the Government should not interfere. When I questioned him on the need for subsection (2), he seemed to change tack and replied that the matter would be covered by regulations and in the quidance issued to local authorities. He then specified a range of areas in which the Government believe that the local authorities should--with the Government's guidance--be making the decision-making process plain to clients.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I return to my original point: either it is the Government who, by means of the power in clause 34(2), enable the process, or--as the Minister said in the first place--it is up to the local authorities and nothing to do with the Government. It has to be one thing or the other. If, as my understanding of the Bill leads me to suspect, it is the first alternative, the amendment is a perfectly reasonable way of enhancing the process.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> The hon. Gentleman is trying to misinterpret what I said. The Bill strikes a balance between the alternatives that he described. Regulations detail the minimum requirements for notification, in that notification must be made. It is in local authorities' best interests to determine, through guidance and good practice, what is most appropriate for their areas.
<P>
For example, in an area such as my constituency in Manchester, where there is a large ethnic population, it may be appropriate to provide notification in a range of languages. Local authorities with little or no ethnic community may feel that such provision is not necessary.
<P>
Local authorities must be flexible in the arrangements that they make, therefore, but good practice must apply. We want to achieve the best possible customer service information. Regulations will lay down the minimum requirements, but the extent to which local authorities build on that--the balance that must be struck between regulation, guidance and good practice at the local level--cannot be prescribed in the Bill in the way suggested.
<P>
I hope, in the light of the more extensive explanation, that the hon. Gentleman will feel able to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> I am grateful to the Minister. In the spirit of co-operation, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 259, in page 21, line 18, after `priority,', insert `except'.
<P>
Again, I shall be brief, as I do not wish to detain the Committee. The amendment would effect a slight shift of emphasis in subsection (4). As I have said time and again, we have not yet seen the regulations to which the clause refers, but the amendment would give priority to those already claiming income support or jobseeker's allowance when it comes to being awarded the other benefits mentioned in the subsection.
<P>
That would make sense, as those who already claim income support and jobseeker's allowance are the most in need of the other benefits. I hope that the Minister does not find the proposal controversial and that he will be sympathetic to the reasoning behind the amendment, which would enhance the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Keith Bradley:</B> Clause 34 re-enacts section 63 of the Social Security Administration Act 1992, underpinning measures to encourage unemployed people to take up work. The amendment would require local authorities to prioritise all housing and council tax benefit claims from claimants previously receiving jobseeker's allowance or income support, unless otherwise stipulated. I do not believe that the amendment would assist the long-term unemployed in the way that our measures do. It might help the Committee if I explain how the measures in clause 34 work.
<P>
The extended payment scheme provides for an extra four weeks housing benefit and council tax benefit to be payable to those starting work, where they have been unemployed for 26 weeks, and have been getting jobseeker's allowance or income support. Once their extended payments come to an end, people may be able to continue getting housing benefit or council tax benefit, depending on their level of income. Current regulations made under this provison require local authorities to give priority to follow-on claims made in such circumstances--that is to those who have claimed an extended payment. This fast-track arrangement benefits those who have not worked for some time. It ensures that there is little or no delay between the date the last extended payment was made and the date the new claim is processed.
<P>
The amendment which takes no account of the length of time people have been on benefit--would result in equal priority being given to claims, irrespective of whether there was likely to be an urgent need for such a payment. That would be unlikely to help those most in need of the sort of hand-up that the current arrangements are intended to provide--those who have been out of work for a long time.
<P>
In addition, if authorities identify certain categories whose claims they should deal with more quickly, they are free to do so. To require a more streamlined arrangement must be the exception rather than the rule. The clause provides fast-tracking, especially for those who have been unemployed for some time and who need encouragement to find work and become independent again. Thus it covers the hon. Gentleman's point. The amendment is unnecessary and would detract from the help that we are committed to providing for the long-term unemployed, so I hope that the hon. Gentleman will feel able to withdraw it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> In the light of those comments, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

Clause 34 re-enacts the existing powers in section 63 of the Social Security Administration Act 1992 relating to housing benefit and council tax benefit decisions. That is necessary because as part of the replacement of the old decision-making and appeals provisions by part I of the Bill, the whole of part II of the 1992 Act is being repealed, including section 63. As drafted, the clause simply re-enacts the whole of section 63 without change.
<P>
We want there to be no doubt, however, as to our ability to make regulations that place a limit on the payment of arrears following a review of those benefits. Other social security benefits rely on more explicit powers to make regulations providing for matters arising from reviews. The proposed addition to clause 34 would put the matter beyond doubt for housing benefit and council tax benefit by introducing a similar provision.
<P>
In future, when a change is reported within a calendar month, a claimant will receive arrears of benefit in full.
<P>
<B>Mr Oliver Letwin (West Dorset):</B> Will the Minister explain a puzzling feature, which reminds one of many other paragraphs in the Bill? If the Government's intent is as he described, to allow for regulations providing for the payment of arrears--an aim to which Opposition Members would subscribe--why does the Government amendment make no reference to payments of arrears, and why does it couch the provisions for regulations in such wide terms? the phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``matters arising out of the revision on review''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
could be about arrears or any other matters.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> I fear that the hon. Gentleman will have to wait for the regulations, which will make that absolutely clear. We need the amendment to enable the hon. Gentleman to make proper scrutiny, in due course, of the regulations for which he so thirsts.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Is the Minister saying that the Government, in all their wisdom and that of their advisers, are unable to couch the amendment in terms such as, ``regulations may make provision for the payment of arrears arising out of the revision on review of such determinations''? Does he claim that such an amendment would not have the effect that he desires?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> I fear that the hon. Gentleman's wording would not fulfil the requirement to consider the circumstances in which the provision may apply. One needs to examine the housing benefit review process and the circumstances in which changes will be made. The regulations will make that clear. The hon. Gentleman's suggested narrow specification would not allow the regulations to be all-embracing, and would be over-prescriptive about how regulations could be made. His wording would limit flexibility. I cannot therefore give him comfort on that point.
<P>
Where the change results in a lower benefit entitlement, the revised assessment will, as now, take effect from the date of the change regardless of when it is notified to the authority. That is in line with the arrangements for the other benefits provided for under clause 11. I should emphasise that the new rule affects only people who delay for more than a calendar month the reporting of a change of circumstance which entitles them to more benefit. The 52-week limit on payment of arrears will continue to apply in all other circumstances--for example, where there has been an administrative delay in awarding another benefit which entitles the claimant to higher rate housing benefit, or where benefit arrears are due because of an official error.
<P>
I remind the Committee that we have a statutory duty to consult the local authority associations on the detail of regulations. I shall consider their responses with our customary care. Those matters must go out to consultation and be the subject of regulations; I want to make it clear that they will not be available to the Committee for discussion.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<P>

<B>Miss Julie Kirkbride </B>(Bromsgrove): I beg to move amendment No. 260, in page 21, leave out lines 35 to 37.
<P>
I should like to break my Committee duck by speaking about the clause which, as drafted, allows local authorities to suspend council tax and housing benefits in a variety of circumstances. That may be because entitlement to those benefits is in doubt, but it can also apply where there is a query or an appeal, or when the Benefits Agency is at fault.
<P>
The Conservative party is not opposed in principle to the suspension of benefits, having introduced it under the Asylum and Immigration Appeals Act 1993. However, it is extremely surprising that such a draconian measure, which extends much more widely across the benefits system, should have been introduced by the Labour Government.
<P>
I should remind Labour Members that when the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport was in opposition, he asked the previous Government whether they realised that their measures would affect the genuine and non-genuine alike. That must be the case with the Bill's proposals. They will affect a vast number of cases; many of them may be genuine and the Benefits Agency may have been in error. Such people would not receive their money despite the fact that they were in no way guilty of any attempt to defraud the system.
<P>
The amendment would change the rules to provide for circumstances in which there is a question mark over entitlement to benefit--for example, when the Benefits Agency is in error. People on very modest incomes who may not have bank accounts may be unable to manage without housing benefit and council tax benefit. They might be in distressed circumstances if, through no fault of their own, their entitlement were removed while the question mark over it was considered.
<P>
Will the Minister say whether there is a difference in approach? Will he reconsider introducing this draconian Bill across such a wide area of the benefits system--wider than we ever intended when we were in power? Will he reconsider the circumstances in which the measure might apply? People on very modest incomes might, through no fault of their own, need help with their council tax to maintain the roofs over their heads. In such circumstances, should their benefit be stopped, while, for example, a fault that resulted in the Government's computer breaking down for two or three days--these things happen--is being investigated?
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Dismore (Hendon)</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> A concession is coming.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Dismore:</B> I congratulate the hon. Member for Bromsgrove (Miss Kirkbride) on her maiden speech in the Committee. It probably made more sense than most of the speeches made so far by those on the Opposition Front Bench.
<P>
We have a duty to ensure that housing benefit is paid correctly but I am concerned that if benefits are unfairly suspended, that could lead to arrears impacting on the claimant's security of tenure, leading in turn to evictions, which could create more problems for the Government and local authorities than the problem that the clause is intended to solve.
<P>
I am particularly concerned about ethnic minorities. Confusion can arise over unfamiliar or similar names, possibly leading to unjustified suspension of benefit. Can the Minister assure us that the power will be used only in cases where there is a serious problem rather than a vague suspicion and that guidance will be given on the need to be especially careful with names that may not be familiar to the officers dealing with those cases?
<P>
<B>Mr. Howard Flight </B>(Arundel and South Downs): I second the excellent speech to the amendment by my hon. Friend the Member for Bromsgrove. I ask bluntly whether we have a correct understanding of clause 35(2)(b), which is the most obscurely worded paragraph that I have so far encountered in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I question whether there are not many other subsections and paragraphs that vie with that one in their degree of obscurity.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Perhaps my brain is exhausted by such obscurity. What is the position of the Labour party on suspension of payments? Has it changed its stance since 1996 and come round to our way of thinking?
<P>
If we understand the paragraph correctly, where there is a case of determination as the result of the error of officials, suspension can fall justly as well as unjustly, and that is the crucial point of the Minister's principled objections to suspensions in the past.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> I am amazed that the only occasions on which we have heard contributions from Labour Members apart from the Minister, they have been made by the hon. Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore), when the Government have obviously decided that they will throw a morsel to their Back Benchers to give them a concession. Whenever the hon. Gentleman expresses his concern about some matter, the Minister makes a concession. Clearly, the hon. Gentleman values his future in the new model Labour party and does not want to compromise his promotion prospects, so he is being fed those lines. [Interruption.] I am not sure why the Government Whip, who is clucking like a hen, is not spreading the largesse around the rest of the mutes on the Labour Benches. They have not opened their mouths, with the exception of the hon. Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun (Mr. Browne), the lawyer from Scotland, who gave us some duff advice on the Scottish legal system, which is irrelevant as we are discussing a Bill dealing with English law.
<P>
Clause 35 is another of the Governments self-denial clauses. It deals with the emotive and difficult subject of suspension of benefits, in this case housing benefit and council tax benefit. There are, at a quick guess, eight Government Members who have not uttered a word about the Bill, presumably at the bequest of the Government Whip. What a contrast there is between this afternoon's debate and the labour party's position before the general election. Fifteen months ago, when the debate on the Asylum and Immigration Bill and its ensuing statutory instruments centred on the same principle of suspension of benefit, the Labour party was in uproar. Labour Members said that the principle was unfair and that the Conservative Government were cruel in causing so much harm, misery and suffering to poor people in this country.
<P>
This Bill is based on exactly the same principle, yet, with one exception, not a single Labour Member is prepared to criticise it. The exception is the hon. Member for Hendon, to whom the Minister has extended a concession, as his speech will show. If I am wrong and the Minister is not about to offer a concession, I apologise to the hon. Gentleman: clearly, the Government Whips do not care greatly for those who wish to break out of the straitjacket imposed by the Minister without Portfolio, the hon. Member for Hartlepool (Mr. Mandelson).
<P>
If the previous Government had won the general election, they would have supported clause 35. Conservative Members are consistent, so we shall not vote against the clause, but we wish to highlight the staggering gall--I think that is the best parliamentary term for it--that the Minister has displayed in bringing forward a proposal that the Labour Party in oppossition would have opposed in principle. Moreover, he will not accept an amendment that would improve the clause. It is yet another example of the Labour party saying something in opposition and doing the exact opposite when it is in government.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I am somewhat abashed to follow the eloquence of my hon. Friend. [Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Before the hon. Gentleman attempts to follow that eloquence, I point out that I was generous with the hon. Member for West Chelmsford (Mr. Burns). He was skilful in intimating that he would return to the amendment, although he never did. His speech was more suitable for a clause stand part debate, although even then he concentrated too much on the Governments attitude to the clause than would be suitable for such a debate.
<P>
However, the hon. Gentleman did it skilfully: I found it difficult to call him to order, but I did notice what was going on. I ask the hon. Member for West Dorset, when he speaks, to be aware that I did notice.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I am grateful for your advice, Mr. O'Hara. However, I lack my hon. Friends skill and must restrict myself to a precise discussion of one matter arising from the amendment.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Bromsgrove omitted one matter in her excellent contribution in support of the amendment. That is that clause 35(2)(b), to which the amendment refers, has a certain peculiarity characteristic of much of what has gone on in the Committee. We are dealing not simply with the way in which a problem originating with a local authority or some other arm of centrla Government or local government can lead to a suspension of benefit. We are dealing also with the way in which such a suspension of a right is to be the subject of regualtions--once again without constraint.
<P>
That adds insult to injury. It is bad enough that people should face the suspension of their benefit when it is consequent on something for which they are not responsible. It is, however, too much that they should face that while nothing in the Bill constrains the form or content of the rules that we are discussing and when, as so often in the Bill, the Secretary of State is merely giving herself power to make regulations. I suspect that that is why Labour Members have raised the problem; if so, the Opposition welcome that. We look to the Minister to accept not merely the amendment but its spirit, and to replicate it elsewhere in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Keith Bradley:</B> The debate on the amendment has been interesting. I, too, congratulate the hon. Member for Bromsgrove, who asked me to find out whether there were ways in which I could deal with the issue. Unfortunately, I can deal only with the amendment that she has moved and have to limit my remarks to it. I may, however, be able to give her some comfort as regards the administration, as opposed to the amendment.
<P>
Amendment No. 260 would remove the power to suspend benefit where it appears to the authority that its determination of a claim might have to be reviewed. I do not think that the hon. Lady would wish that to happen. Surely, she accepts that there are circumstances in which it may be appropriate to suspend benefit to ensure that the information required to establish whether the entitlement is valid can be pursued. To remove all power to suspend benefit would take a weapon form the local authority and hinder the good administration of housing benefit and taxpayers' money. I do not think that that is the hon. Lady's intention.
<P>
The comparison with asylum seekers is bogus. The argument in that situation was not about suspension, but about entitlement to benefit and we should not confuse the two issues. We are talking about suspending benefit--perhaps for a short time--while details are sought to clarify and ensure the correctness of information that has been provided. There will then be an opportunity to restore benefit entitlement.

<P>

<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> On a point of order, Mr. O'Hara. It appears that the Minister is discussing something other than the amendment and paragraph (b), which are not related to the matters that he is discussing. He seems to be discussing paragraph (a).
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> That is not a point of order for me. It is for the Minister to ensure that his remarks are relevant to the matter under debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> I am sure, Mr. O'Hara, that if my remarks had not been relevant you would have ruled me out of order, so I am comforted by that.
<P>
Clearly, we must consider how suspension is used in practice. As my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon eloquently said, it is essential that the administration of suspension be done sensitively. We debated this matter a little this morning. We must consider the circumstances in which the suspension is made--that is, the applicant's circumstances and the hardship that may flow from the suspension. It is essential for the administration of suspension that the right people be informed of the right decisions at the right time. That is all a matter of the good administration of the housing benefit scheme by the local authorities, and no one would argue that matters should be any different. That does not, however, undermine the principle, in which the Government strongly believe, that the power to suspend should be retained in the clause. That is what the clause is about and that is why I hope that we will resist the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> The Minister was answering his hon. Friend the Member for Hendon and no one would disagree with the eminently sensible point that he made about the local authority having to run an effective and efficient housing benefit system to provide the client with a first-class and swift decision-making process. What, however, happens to--and what reassurance can the Minister offer--those local authorities that are clearly incapable of running a first-class, effective and efficient housing benefits system? Of course, the vast majority of local authorities are capable of running a system to varying degrees. A few, however, are notorious for not being able to organise a party in a brewery. What safeguards are there for people who live in those local authorities' areas, when the system seriously fails them?
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> I am happy to respond. Clearly, some drift was allowed under the previous Government. The new Government are taking action to address the issues raised by the hon. Gentleman, through the housing benefit verification programme and the housing benefit fraud programme, which will lead to more efficient administration of the housing benefit system by local authorities. We are determined that that change should occur.
<P>
Detailed guidance is now provided through the Benefits Agency to all agencies that impact on it, about how suspensions should be used. Information and guidance are made available to welfare rights organisations. The information is translated into welfare rights handbooks, so that guidance on suspensions is clear. The power in the Bill will, if sensitively and practically used, be to the benefit of the Government and of local authorities, and will be in claimants' best interests. Claimants can thus provide the information that is required to ensure that their entitlement is sustained. There has been confusion in the debate about undermining entitlement as against the power to suspend. Clause 35 is about suspension of benefit, not about denying entitlement to benefit.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I remain puzzled by the Minister's response. In the Committee, he has usually at least addressed the point at issue. We have not always agreed with him, but he has been strict about doing that. The point at issue now is amendment No. 260, which relates to subsection (2)(b). The Minister addressed his remarks exclusively to the question of whether it would be appropriate to remove the right of suspension. The Opposition are not suggesting that. The right of suspension is permitted clearly by subsection (2)(a), in all circumstances in which the right of suspension would apply to doubt about whether the conditions for entitlement to benefit are fulfilled.
<P>
I do not understand how the Minister has begun to address the points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Bromsgrove or by the amendment by arguing for retaining a right of suspension. The Opposition are not confused about suspension and entitlement--rather, the Minister appears to be confused about the difference between paragraphs (a) and (b).
<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Question proposed, that the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I am sorry to labour the point, but I think that the Committee deserves a response from the Minister. The Minister has failed entirely to explain why subsection (2)(b) is present in the Bill. He has not explained what paragraph (b) seeks to achieve, or why it is legitimate for it to do so. He has restricted himself exclusively to trying to defend paragraph (a), which the Opposition are not attacking. When the point is put to him, instead of explaining, in his customary affable and intelligent manner, why we are mistaken, he remains in his place. The Committee deserves an explanation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Keith Bradley:</B> I cannot accept the hon. Gentleman's protestations. I have addressed precisely the issues that are exclusively relevant to the amendment and to the clause, I will, however, look carefully at the transcript in Hansard, and if there has been any confusion--I must stress that I do not believe that there has been confusion--I will write to all members of the Committee to clarify the points that I have made. I hope that the hon. Member will accept that assurance in good faith.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 186 to 193.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> The amendment corrects a drafting error in clause 40. It changes the word ``him'' to the words ``Secretary of State''. That brings the drafting of clause 40 into line with that of clause 10, which deals with the revision of other social security decisions.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 186 to 189 and 191 to 193 share a common purpose. They relate to decisions taken by an appeal tribunal on an application for a child support departure direction. Amendment No. 190 clarifies the right of appeal against decisions on applications for departure directions. Amendments Nos. 186 to 189 will allow decisions on departure directions to be revised or superseded in due course, in accordance with the new powers in clauses 40 and 41. That approach is in the spirit of the Bill and will allow a speedy correction to be made when an obvious error has occured. It will also allow any decision on a departure direction application given by a tribunal to be reconsidered, following a change of circumstances, without the need to go through the process of a further application, as is the case at present.
<P>
Amendment No. 190 is needed to clarify the fact that where the Secretary of State has given a decision on an application for a departure direction, either to make a direction or to refuse the application, the absent parent, the parent with care or, in Scotland, the child of the assessment has a right of appeal under the new section 20 inserted into the Child Support Act 1991 by clause 42. That is the situation at present, and the Government have no intention of changing it.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 191 and 192 ensure that the provisions of the new section 28ZA in clause 43 will apply not only to decisions made by the Secretary of State on an application for a departure direction, but also to a departure direction given by a tribunal to which the Secretary of State has referred the applications for decision.
<P>
Finally, amendment No. 193 is required to ensure that in relation to an application for a departure direction, in which the case is referred to a tribunal for decision, the definition of ``adjudicating authority'' is the one in new section 28ZC in clause 44, and will include the appeal tribunal. That will mean that the new provisions relating to cases of error will also cover decisions taken by appeal tribunals on applications for departure directions referred by the Secretary of State.

<P>

<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Would the Minister repeat that slowly, because I entirely failed to understand what he said? I could not follow him because he was speaking so fast.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> I assume that the hon. Gentleman does not mean my whole speech--
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Just the last sentence.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> That will mean that the new provisions relating to cases of error will also cover those decisions taken by appeal tribunals on applications for departure directions referred to them by the Secretary of State.
<P>
I realise that these matters are complicated, but I am sure that the Committee is now satisfied with that clarification. I commend the amendments to the Committee.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> The notes on clauses helpfully remind us that clause 40 returns us to the subject of our discussion of clause 10, here applied to child support.
<P>
I do not suppose that there is any member of the Committee, or any Member of the House, who is not aware from constituency work of the great problems associated with arbitrary or seemingly arbitrary decision-making in the Child Support Agency. It is the common experience of the victims--if I may put it that way--of the Child Support Agency that they find it extraordinarily difficult to determine why decisions are made.
<P>
For example, I draw the Ministers attention to the problems that typically arise in relation to assessment of arrears and the determination of the speed with which arrears are to be paid off. It appears that very junior officials retain wide discretion over such matters, and in my experience--and, I suspect, that of other Members of the Committee--that discretion is often exercised in ways that are puzzling to applicants and, indeed, unjustifiable and later reversed.
<P>
In relation to clause 40, we are dealing with terrain already beset by considerable arbitrariness, which I think hon. Members on both sides of the Committee would agree has to a considerable extent undermined the confidence that ought to be felt both by those who are the beneficiaries of the Child Support Agency, or at least those given tutelage over the ultimate beneficiaries--namely, in most cases, the mothers--and by the victims of the Child Support Agency: the fathers.
<P>
By applying the principles of clause 10 to the Child Support Agency, the clause widens the scope for arbitrariness and moves that arbitrariness up not just one but many rungs, by enabling not just junior officials in a restricted manner but the Secretary of State in a wide manner to make and unmake decisions--to revise them more or less ad hoc. Precisely the same problems arise in relation to clause 40 as arose in relation to clause 10--in particular, problems relating to the way in which the Bill gives powers of revision to the Secretary of State.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
For example, I draw the Minister's attention to the final words of new section 16(1)(b). Unsurprisingly to those familiar with the Committee's proceedings, it states that:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``regulations may prescribe the procedure by which a decision of the Secretary of State may be so revised.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>Here is our old friend--I should say ``our old enemy''--unconstrained regulation, allowing the Secretary of State to make provisions in a system that is already plagued by excessive arbitrariness.
<P>
The Minister should reconsider the construction of clause 40 and ask whether, given the circumstances of the Child Support Agency, he wants to implement it. To put it more weakly, will the Secretary of State want to use the clause and exercise through regulation the discretion that it allows? If not, surely the Minister should be asking himself whether the clause gives any assistance to the Department or whether, on the contrary, it will raise questions and further aggravate the widespread lack of confidence in the Child Support Agency.
<P>
<B>Mr. Keith Bradley:</B> As the hon. Gentleman points out, clause 40 mirrors clause 10. Its purpose is to streamline and simplify the way in which decisions are made. It will allow discussion and enable mistakes to be corrected at an early stage. As was said when we considered clause 10, there is an impediment in the system that currently prevents that from happening, causing many of the aggravations that the hon. Gentleman recognises and which I well understand from my constituency cases as well as from my Government responsibilities.
<P>
The provisions are intended to help the streamlining process. They will enable both parties to discuss any changes, new information and the correction of errors at the earliest opportunity. That will mean that people are not locked into confrontation through a formal appeals tribunal, which does not help either party--it delays proper assessment and leads to arrears, as the hon. Gentleman rightly said.
<P>
I believe that the clause will help the Government in their intention to make the Child Support Agency work more efficiently and effectively for all who have dealings with it. I hope that the Committee will take note of those words and of my view about how the provision should work in practice. As in all these matters, implementation is critical to achieving our objectives--again, the hon. Gentleman makes a good point about that. As I said, we shall draw on the expertise of outside bodies to ensure that problems are properly dealt with not just in the legislative phase but in the implementation phase.

<B>Mr. Flight:</B> May I ask the Minister to give some description of the nature of the regulations that are proposed under the clause, which will empower the Secretary of State to supersede virtually all decisions in this difficult area? My experience of child support cases--like that of other Committee members, I suspect--has invariably been that orders have been issued without the Child Support Agency appearing adequately to have researched the background. Frequently, spouses have not declared their means or have been prompted to backclaim, often unjustly.
<P>
I can imagine a draconian power being useful but I can also imagine it exacerbating problems. The clause does not communicate to me how, in practice, it will alleviate the sort of problems that arise from the Child Support Agency. Merely giving even more fiat powers to the bureaucracy strikes me as going in the wrong direction. Most of the cases with which I have been involved have endeavoured to get facts across to the bureaucracy to demonstrate why its fiat decisions have been wrong. Will the Minister say a little on the nature of the proposed regulations that will give the Secretary of State powers to do virtually everything?
<P>
<B>Mr. Keith Bradley:</B> As the hon. Gentleman understands, clause 41 mirrors the provision in clause 11 and I refer him to some of the remarks from that debate. The clause will remove the inflexibility built into the system, allowing the Child Support Agency to supersede decisions in a more efficient and client-focused way, by focusing on the assessment rather than the processes that need to be followed before a new assessment can be made.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Will the Minister explain how it will help the Secretary of State and the Child Support Agency to be more client-focused if the Secretary of State acts ``on his own initiative''--a phrase used at least twice in the clause--rather than at the request of an applicant?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> We had that debate on clause 11, so we do need not delay the Committee now.
<P>
I was talking about focusing on the assessment rather than the processes that need to be followed before a new assessment can be made. The clause will allow operational managers to design procedures that reflect more accurately the needs of clients. It will ensure that child support assessments can be kept up to date more efficiently. That is clearly what we intend to gain with the clause. We are trying to modernise the system and ensure that the administration of the Child Support Agency has the flexibility to deal quickly and effectively with the many changes in circumstances affecting people.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> The biggest item that I have found missing is the ability for people involved in disputes to sit down with a Child Support Agency officer and go through the facts. Communication is permitted only by telephone or paper. Will clause 41 do anything about that crucial omission? There is a need for one-to-one interviews to resolve problems speedily, rather than having a lengthy process of appeals and tribunals.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> Clearly, when there is such a requirement, it should be available, but research evidence points in the other direction. Parties to the Child Support Agency would rather have the information conveyed to them by telephone. However, we shall consider the hon. Gentleman's comments, as we are determined to ensure the most effective administration of the Child Support Agency.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 41 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 42</center></H4>
<H4><center>Child Support: Appeals to Appeal Tribunals</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 180, in page 25, line 44, leave out from `refused' to end of line 3 on page 26.
<P>
The amendment will remove the right to appeal against refusal to supersede the child support maintenance assessment. Clause 41 provides for clients to make an application to have their assessment superseded. That provision will be used when there is a change in the circumstances of one of the parties. In the vast majority of cases, an application for supersession will have real grounds behind it which will need to be considered. After the agency has considered the application, a new maintenance assessment will be issued even if the amounts that it contains do not differ from the intitial assessment. So the assessment will involve a fresh dispute period and a fresh right of revision or appeal. Therefore, in nearly all cases, there will be a right of appeal relating to the supersession of a decision.
<P>
The amendment will have an effect only where it is immediately obvious that an application for supersession has no grounds. Unfortunately, some absent parents are less than happy with being made to face up to their responsibilities and provide for their children. Experience shows that some people repeatedly challenge their liability without any grounds. In those cases, no supersession will be granted.
<P>
Without the amendment, such vexatious applications would automatically include a right of appeal which could mean that an application drags on for years, wasting the time of all those involved and costing significant sums. The amendment will simply reduce the extent to which the appeals system can be slowed down by deliberate disruption, preventing the prompt resolution of disputes involving those with valid complaints.
<P>
I am sure that all hon. Members know of appeals that have been purely vexatious. Customers who have any grounds for supersession to be considered will have rights of appeal and have nothing to fear from the amendment. I commend it to the Committee.

<P>

<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Conservative Members would accept that there are vexatious litigants in child support cases, as there are in most other parts of benefits administration and social security in general. However, there is another phenomenon, with which the Minister must be familiar from his constituency work, in that some of those whom the Child Support Agency employs from time to time appear to take a personal, subjective view of matters that come within their immediate jurisdiction. That is perhaps understandable and probably arises from the fact that many people feel a certain moral indignation about some of the reasons why people go before the Child Support Agency.
<P>
To return to a point echoed by Liberal Democrat Members, it has been my experience and, I suspect, that of other members of the Committee, that the relationships, which are necessarily telephonic or epistolary and often with people who are inarticulate or not good at writing, are so poor that emotional and personal heat is generated in an area that rational and dispassionate justice should occupy. Under such circumstances, distinguishing between vexatious litigants and those who have a case can be more difficult than it would be if those charged with administering the benefit--or, in this case, justice--maintained dispassion and regarded the case as would a neutrual observer.
<P>
It would be extremely helpful if the Minister explained precisely who will take the decision on who is and who is not a vexatious litigant and, consequently, who will trigger what the Minister has described as an exceptional blocking of the appeal right. If he says that that will be done at a senior level--a fortiori by the Secretary of State or the Minister, although I doubt whether that will be so--we would be greatly reassured. However, if he says that such a decision can be made at operational level by those directly involved with the case or by their supervisors, we would have severe doubts as to whether that would lead to the proper administration of justice in this complex and extremely contentious matter.
<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Keith Bradley:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for those comments because the way in which cases are handled is important.
<P>
I heard what the hon. Gentleman said about child support officers becoming emotionally involved. Although one can never put emotion aside, we have good professional officers in our agencies and I hope that they deal with all cases in an even-handed way to ensure that the rights and entitlements of both parties are properly respected. If the hon. Gentleman knows of particular cases in which emotional attachment has led to unfairness or inequity of treatment, they will be investigated.
<P>
Refusal to supercede would be unusual in these circumstances. The hon. Gentleman should not feel that there is a whole raft of such circumstances, with decisions on that point being made on a regular basis. Details of the arrangements to simplify the decision making in appeals still need to be worked through. That will be done on enactment and the results will be made available through regulations and guidance.
<P>
I do not want to be too certain about that particular point, but because of the context in which such decisions are taken, they would have to be reviewed by a reasonably senior officer. However, decisions are always open to challenge, and people can ask for them to be reviewed internally at that point in the process. I do not think that decisions are taken lightly or unreasonably, but if the fears of the hon. Member for West Dorset about the balance of support prove to have any foundation, I shall, as I said, examine the problem.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
<B>Mr. Keith Bradley:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 181, in page 26, line 33, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `( ) In deciding an appeal under this section, an appeal tribunal--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) need not consider any issue that is not raised by the appeal; and<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(b) shall not take into account any circumstances not obtaining at the time when the decision appealed against was made.'<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendment No. 82.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> Amendment No. 181 deals with two matters concerning child support decisions made by appeal tribunals. Paragraph (a) makes it clear that the appeal tribunals need consider only those matters raised in the appeal application, leaving them free to concentrate on the circumstances giving rise to the appeals. The amendment does not remove the right of a tribunal to consider issues not raised by an appellant if it believes that mistakes may have been made, but it ensures that the decision is at the discretion of the tribunal. The amendment brings clause 42 into line with clause 13, which contains a parallel provision for other social security appeals. Paragraph (b) ensures that the agency rather than the appeal tribunal is able to deal with changes of circumstance. That provision was introduced for other social security tribunals by Government amendment Nos. 63 and 64, which have been approved by the Committee.
<P>
Amendment No. 82 will ensure that an appeal tribunal hearing an appeal against a decision on vaccine damage payment will consider all the circumstances of the case from the time the decision was made to the date of the appeal hearing. Our general policy for appeals to tribunals is that the tribunals should not consider all changes of circumstances before the date of the hearing. However, it is sensible to make exceptions for a small number of special cases.
<P>
The vaccine damage payment scheme provides for a one-off payment rather than a benefit or a maintenance award for a given period. It is not necessary for a tribunal to decide whether the medical evidence available to the appeal tribunal was relevant at the time when the appeal decision was made. For example, an appellant may provide a brain scan, which was not available at the time of the decision, showing extensive brain damage. It makes no difference whether the brain damage was present at the time of the Secretary of State's decision or later. Whether a vaccine damage payment should be made will depend on the available evidence. I therefore commend the amendment to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> the Minister will not be surprised at our raised eyebrows at Government amendment No. 82, which, despite our rigorous preparation, had escaped our notice. Although we warmly welcome that amendment, we express our astonishment that the Government should draw a fundamental distinction between a vaccine damage case and, for example, another complex disability or medical case. We are delighted that there should be any line on vaccine damge, but all the Government's arguments until now that changes after the date of the appeal should not be considered and that the tribunal should not consider other factors seem staggeringly undermined by the amendment. Had it been preceded by an intervention from the hon. Member for Hendon, we might think that it presaged a complete volte-face. However, let us welcome the amendment and look forward to extensions of the principle it enshrines on Report.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
On proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> Although I may be straying out of order by doing so, I should like to raise with the Minister an important point that was made by the Child Support Agency in Dudley when I visited it a week ago and which would, if it were addressed in the legislation, benefit all hon. Members who receive masses of constituency post on the subject. Under the present rules, decisions taken by the CSA have to be reconsidered after two years so that the absent parent's contributions and other circumstances can be reviewed. The difficulty with the legislation is that because of the problems of the CSA, the review may be made three years after the original decision, which means that if a review should have been made in, for example, June 1996 and is looked at in June 1997, the absent parent will be given a bill that is a year out of date. That parent has been reasonable and responsible in making contributions for those three years, but is suddenly presented with a demand from the CSA for huge arrears and accused of being a very naughty person for not making the proper contributions.
<P>
As the CSA begins to catch up with its backlog of work and gets round to the delayed reviews that should have taken place within two years of the original decision, more and more of our constituents may find that they are in arrears, when all along they have acted with the best of intentions and in good faith.
<P>
I am not certain whether those remarks are pertinent to the clause, Mr. O'Hara, and I apologise if they are not, but the Government should take the point into account because as the CSA addresses its backlog, we shall find that--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I have been extremely generous with the hon. Lady. The clause refers to appeals; I was waiting for her lengthy introductory remarks to refer to that subject, but they have not done so. Unless she is going to address it now, I must rule her out of order.
<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> That being so, I would say that there may well be appeals against those decisions, in which case the Government might have to address those issues in the broader context.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> Does my hon. Friend also agree that if the Government felt that the problem would be overwhelming, they could amend the clause to establish an appeals procedure for review decisions to be made within one or two years?
<P>
<B>Mr Keith Bradley:</B> Order. Do not try to be clever.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Member for West Chelmsford is turning his back to me.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> I apologise, Mr. O'Hara. I thought that you were pulling me up because the Minister distracted me by calling me to order, when only you can do so. I thought that I was making a valid point.
<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> I thank my hon. Friend for his advice and I thank you, Mr. O'Hara, for indulging my remarks. I appeal to the Minister to try to address the issues, if not now, then at a later stage, and save us all a lot of trouble.

<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> I do not wish to stray out of order and although it is not relevant to the clause, I recognise the problems identified by the hon. Lady, which have arisen because of the incompetent way in which the previous Government introduced the Child Support Agency. We are trying to solve those problems and to make the work of the agency more efficient and speedy. The review process will remain in place, but I hope that it will be completed within a time that is relevant to the case and not, as the hon. Lady has said, be exacerbated by delays. I understand the problem and as we must not stray out of order on this point, I hope that the hon. Lady recognises that we are considering those issues in our overall review of the Child Support Agency.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> The clause relates to the Child Support Agency and the concept of staying a decision or appeal, which we discussed on clauses 25 and 26 in relation to social security benefits. We were not keen on the idea then, and we are even less keen now. There might be a case for staying a decision on a social security benefit pending a test case on the grounds that it would save the Government money. One assumes that that is at least part of the motivation for clauses 25 and 26. In clause 43, however, it is not clear that even that motivation applies.
<P>
The already slow and cumbersome appeals and decision-making process of the Child Support Agency needs stays like it needs a hole in the head. A stay will further add to the uncertainty surrounding the maintenance assessment in respect of the child. The Government are keen to encourage lone parents to move from welfare into work. One facet that would help a lone parent to make that move is certainty about her maintenance entitlement. If she is to take, for example, the sort of low-paid job that would be boosted by family credit and maintenance, and each of those elements is part of her in-work income package, she needs certainty about the maintenance element. Clause 43 proposes that she might have to hang on for six or 12 months while a lead case is decided. Even then, we do not know whether it will produce more maintenance or less. So it is not clear that the clause will even save the Government money; it may cost them money if it delays the implementation of a maintenance assessment that would be higher than the one that would otherwise be applied.
<P>
The clause will not, therefore, save the Government money; nor will it help lone parents, who face yet more uncertainty about the amount of maintenance entitlement and about when they will get it. If absent fathers cannot even be chased for that maintenance for as much as a year while a lead case is being decided, the problem could go on forever.
<P>
We believe that it is even worse to stay child support decisions than it is to stay ordinary benefit decisions. For that reason, we do not agree that the clause should stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Keith Bradley:</B> The clause allows decisions relating to child support to be held back pending resolution of the lead case. It mirrors the social security provisions of clauses 25 and 26.
<P>
Currently, cases and appeals must be decided even where we know that the decision rests on a point of law being challenged in another case. The clause enables us to delay making decisions, or to make a partial decision, until the other, lead case has been decided. Where a case depends on a lead case, clause 43 will give the CSA two options for dealing with it.
<P>
The agency may delay the look-alike case entirely, so that it does not have to make a decision about it until the lead case has been decided. That may be an appropriate course of action if the lead case will be decided in a short time, and it will be advantageous both to the agency and to the client. That has two implications. First, obviating the need to make a decision on a case and then revise that decision once the lead case has been decided will minimise unnecessary work. The agency will then be able to make more effective use of its resources.
<P>
Secondly, and more importantly, it means that clients will be spared the inconvenience of having a decision made on their cases that will then have to be revisited, perhaps resulting in maintenance debt and the need to recover money from the parent with care. However, when it is likely to take some time to decide a lead case, it would not normally be appropriate for a decision to be delayed, as that would mean that the parent with care would have to wait months or even years--as the hon. Member for Northavon (Mr. Webb) rightly pointed out--before receiving any maintenance for her child. In such circumstances, the agency would seek to make use of the provisions in the clause to make an interim assessment, which will result in a safe rate liability maintenance.
<P>
That will ensure that the parent with care receives some maintenance while the lead case is pending, and that the absent parent does not pay more than is right. The clause will ensure that the agency can make decisions on cases that rest on lead cases in a manner that is appropriate to the individual case. That will enable it to make best use of its resources and to provide the best possible service to the client.
<P>
I hope that that explanation will enable the hon. Member for Northavon to support the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for dealing with our anxiety about the clause, and I am reassured by the Minister's confirmation that, in practice if not explicitly in the Bill, only lead cases that are decided in short order will result in a stay. For those reasons, I am willing to agree that the clause stand part.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 43, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 44</center></H4>
<H4><center>Child support: Cases of Error</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 279, in page 28, line 40, leave out from `sections--' to end of line 4 on page 30.
<P>
My speech to the amendment resembles the previous speech made by my hon. Friend the Member for Northavon, in that it returns to some of the arguments aired this morning and earlier this afternoon in connection with clause 27. However, this amendment also deals with the Child Support Act 1991 rather than the other benefits affected by that clause.
<P>
The amendment deals with the way in which the ante-test case rule may be applied to stop decisions being taken. It would then provide that decisions will be dated from the date on which the test case is decided, rather than from the date on which the original application for maintenance was made to the Child Support Agency.
<P>
We proposed a series of amendments to clause 27 but, sadly, the Committee threw them all out. The amendment would simply remove new section 28ZC of the Child Support Act 1991, which is mentioned in the clause. The deletion is considerable. All hon. Members would be pleased if legislation were shorter and sweeter. The amendment would remove rather more words from the Bill than those proposed in the Government amendment, which take out very few. We would remove more than a page.
<P>
The holding in abeyance of all other similar cases when a test case has gone to the child support commissioner is a crucial issue. If the commissioner decides against the Secretary of State, an assessment for maintenance in all other cases can be made only from the date of the commissioner's decision rather than from the date of the original application. That may hold up people's maintenance for some time, which would affect children to whom maintenance is due, not just the wives who applied for it. It could be that for two years perhaps, such children would have to live without the correct maintenance package. Even payment of arrears often does not make up for that. We all know of cases in which people have found it difficult to pay large sums in arrears, so they have to pay in dribs and drabs. However, even that is better than the arrears never being paid.
<P>
We should do our best to ensure that arrears are paid, and paid from the date of the original application for maintenance. We owe that to the children--however difficult it is, we ought to be trying.
<P>
<B>Mr. Keith Bradley:</B> The amendment would remove most of clause 44 as the hon. Gentleman said, specifically the section introducing limited retrospection in cases where an understanding of the law has been overturned by the child support commissioners or the courts. That part of the clause allows that, in certain cases, a commissioner's or a court's determination can be applied without having retrospectively to alter the maintenance assessment for those concerned.
<P>
Limited retrospection is necessary for absent parents and for parents with care. Without it, a commissioner's or a court's decision could lead to the absent parent's maintenance being increased retrospectively, leaving him with a debt which he might find impossible to pay. Alternatively, if the absent parent had overpaid, the extra payment may have to be recovered from the parent with care, who may be unable to refund the money. It is extremely important for the stability of both parties that they know that their maintenance payments will not change retrospectively and that they can plan for the future with a degree of certainty.
<P>
The clause also saves the CSA time and money. Without limited retrospection, whenever a commissioner's or a court's decision overturned an understanding of the law, the agency would be forced to go through the affected cases from their first date, calculating the maintenance assessment for each period. Any discrepancy between the amount paid and the new amount assessed would have to be collected.
<P>
With that explanation of why limited retrospection is needed--to ensure certainty for parents with care and for absent parents in child support cases--I hope that the hon. Member for Newbury will withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> I am quite surprised to hear that defence of the clause, if only because it also applies to virtually everything else that goes on in the CSA. The CSA is notorious for deciding maintenance cases very late, sometimes years late. That can create the most appalling difficulties with arrears. The Minister is correct that deciding such cases late leads to extensive arrears or money being paid back. In both cases, he is right to say that that causes the most horrendous problems. Sometimes, as I said, arrears are paid off very slowly. Does the Minister agree that his extremely good argument for avoiding my amendment works equally well in favour of removing the CSA and going back to a better system? His argument was strongly in favour of that outcome and he made some telling points about what is so desperately wrong with the CSA. He may have made them inadvertently, in answer to my amendment, but they were well made and I was delighted to hear them. Hopefully, we will have them in Hansard: I have a feeling that they may be quoted back at him on other occasions.
<P>
In conclusion, I accept that this is a difficulty with the CSA, and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Keith Bradley:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 182, in page 30, line 32, leave out `superseded' and insert `reversed'.
<P>
The amendment clarifies the procedure for changing vaccine damage payment decisions made both by the Secretary of State and by an appeal tribunal. A vaccine damage payment is not a social security benefit. Using the word ``reversed'' as opposed to ``superseded'' clearly distinguishes vaccine damage payments from social security benefits. More importantly, the term ``reversed'' better describes what happens when a vaccine damage decision is changed.
<P>
A vaccine damage payment is a one-off payment--it is either awarded or it is not. If it is not, and the payment is made at a later date, it is clear that the original decision has been reversed. The amendment is a straightforward clarification of the Bill's drafting, and I commend it to the Comittee.
