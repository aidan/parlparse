<P>
<H5>9 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Oliver Heald </B>(North-East Hertfordshire): On a point of order, Mrs Michie. Yesterday, several members of the Committee were served with a legal opinion on clauses 46 to 49 that was prepared by a senior human rights barrister under the auspices of Justice. Could a Law Officer attend the Committee when we debate those clauses so that we can hear the Government's detailed legal response to that opinion?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> That is a matter for the Minister. A Law Officer can attend the Committee. However, I shall let the Minister respond.
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Home Office (Mr. Charles Clarke):</B> The hon. Members for North-East Hertfordshire (Mr. Heald) and for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Allan) and I attended a conference yesterday run by the organisation that prepared that legal opinion. I am perfectly happy to arrange for that opinion to be circulated to all members of the Committee. I shall take time to consider the question raised by the hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire about a Law Officer attending the Committee. However, I shall ensure that the opinion is circulated to all members of the Committee for their information.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> I am grateful to the Minister.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Maclean </B>(Penrith and The Border): On a point of order, Mrs Michie. I wonder if you and your co-Chairman, Mr. O'Hara, would reflect on another small, innovatory step that may assist the Committee in its deliberations. You, Mrs Michie, will know that Mr. O'Hara permitted the Minister and his officials to circulate documents to the Committee by e-mail. One is grateful for that, and it has been helpful. The only difficulty is that one has to print that material elsewhere and bring the papers to the Committee Room.
<P>
The small step that I mentioned would be to permit us to bring our laptop computers into the Room so that we could read those messages on our computer screens. One day, Mrs Michie, when the Room is cabled for the purpose, we could even conduct our affairs interactively down the line. If a Committee wished to meet at  9 am, we could conduct business from the safety and sanctity of our bedrooms.
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The Chairmen's Panel has already discussed the matter. At least for the moment, it is not permitted.
<H4><center>Clause 7</center></H4>
<H4><center>Issue of warrants</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Richard Allan </B>(Sheffield, Hallam): I beg to move amendment No. 65, in page 9, leave out lines 12 to 14 and insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(a) by a judge; or<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(b) in a case falling within subsection (2), by the Secretary of State.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss the following amendments: No. 66, in page 9, line 16, leave out from ``case'' to end of line 17.
<P>
No. 67, in page 9, line 29, leave out a ``senior official'' and insert ``the Secretary of State''.
<P>
No. 97, in clause 10, page 11, line 47, leave out from ``State'' to end of line.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> The amendments bring us back to the question of the judicial oversight of the issuing of warrants. Under the Bill, warrants will be issued by the Executive, in the person of the Secretary of State. We had a long debate on the subject on clause 5. I do not intend to be repetitious by restating those arguments, but we wish to continue making our policy clear. We believe that judicial oversight is necessary at all stages when issuing such warrants. We shall continue to table amendments to that effect-and, if necessary, to make the point with our votes.

<P>
Amendments Nos. 65, 66 and 67 would make a straightforward change. The Bill provides for the Secretary of State to issue the warrant and, failing that, a senior official. We propose that a judge should issue the warrant; failing that, the Secretary of State should have that power. In our debates on clause 5, we made it clear that we believe that such a system can operate. The Government response was that it was not appropriate and, because it was not practical, they rejected it in principle. We, as a matter of principle, want judicial oversight of the issuing of warrants.

<P>
We believe that it is a practical solution to the problem. The amendments seek to put a marker down.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> Perhaps the Minister does not intend to respond, but I should like him to respond to one point.

<P>
<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> I beg your pardon, Mrs Michie, as I may have misunderstood. I am ready to speak about the amendments, but I was not sure whether you would first call the hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire to speak to amendment No. 97, which is tabled in his name.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Amendment No. 97 is grouped with the other amendments, which is why I looked at Mr. Heald.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> Perhaps we could hear from the Minister first.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> I much prefer the hon. Gentleman's words to laptop speaking, as he speaks so much more eloquently on these matters.

<P>
As the hon. Member for Hallam said, we discussed much of the substance of the amendments during the debate on clause 5. I shall not repeat those arguments as there is a genuine difference of opinion between the Liberal Democrats and other parties. I understand that difference, but I do not think that there is much to be gained by going round the houses again.

<P>
It may be helpful, however, for me to explain procedure in urgent cases, to provide clarification for the hon. Member for Hallam and to deal with points made, at least implicitly or virtually, by the hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire.

<P>
First, the senior official who signs the warrant must be expressly authorised to do so by the Secretary of State. Secondly, the express authorisation must relate to that particular warrant only, so it is not a general power, but is particular to the warrant. Thirdly, the official who signs the warrant must endorse on it a statement that he has been expressly authorised by the Secretary of State to do so. The warrant therefore physically shows authorisation by the Secretary of State.

<P>
<B>Mr. David Ruffley </B>(Bury St. Edmunds): Will the Minister give way?

<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> I shall do so when I have explained the whole process.

<P>
Even when the urgency procedure applies, the Secretary of State must have given personal consideration to the application in order to give instructions to a senior official for the signing of the warrant. As an additional safeguard, the warrant is to last for only five days in such circumstances. I hope that explanation gives some reassurance to the hon. Member for Hallam and deals with the issues raised by amendment No. 97. The provisions have been carefully considered and authorisation and action are strictly prescribed.

<P>
The other circumstances that allow a senior official to issue a warrant relate to a request made under an international mutual legal assistance agreement. The interception subject or the premises where communications are to be intercepted must be outside United Kingdom territory. In such circumstances, a warrant may be issued if the competent requesting authorities have already issued an interception order against the subject of interception. As no decision is being made on the merits of the case, and the purpose of the warrant is solely to provide technical assistance such as satellite interception of a telephone on foreign territory, we consider it appropriate for the warrant to be issued by senior officials rather than by the Secretary of State.

<P>
On the fundamental issue raised by the hon. Member for Hallam, our view remains that the Executive should retain responsibility for the issue of warrants, and that a role exists for senior officials in the strictly prescribed circumstances that I have tried to set out.

<P>
I have explained the limited circumstances in which a senior official may issue a warrant, but strictly limited circumstances are also applicable when a senior official is allowed to modify a warrant-an issue raised in the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire. A senior official may modify the unscheduled part of an interception warrant only in an urgent case, when he has been expressly authorised to do so by the Secretary of State and a statement of that fact is displayed on the modifying instrument contained in the document. That arrangement is exactly the same as the urgency procedure used for the issuing of warrants. A scheduled part of a warrant may also be modified by a senior official without being referred personally to the Secretary of State-strict limitations are also attached to these provisions.

<P>
We have allowed senior officials to modify the scheduled part of a warrant to take account of changes in technology. For example, criminals may possess a number of different telephone numbers and addresses and regularly change them to avoid detection. We believe that it is important to keep up with such developments. It is no longer practical to obtain a separate warrant for each address and then a fresh warrant every time a telephone number is changed. For those reasons, senior officials will be allowed to modify warrants to take such developments into account. It must not be forgotten that officials are only allowed to modify a warrant already issued by the Secretary of State and that they are not permitted to add new names or purposes on that basis.

<P>
The discussion is not theoretical. Many criminal organisations understand the potential of frequently changing telephone numbers, and do so to seek to avoid surveillance. It is necessary to have the legal instruments in place to enable us to keep pace with what is being removed.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> We understand why express authorisation may be needed. A Minister may be on a plane over the Atlantic or in a far-flung part of the world in which it is not possible for him or her to sign a warrant. Given the state of modern technology, is it standard practice for the drafting of a warrant to be seen, read and fully comprehended by the Secretary of State before express authorisation for it to be signed by the official is given?

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> My understanding is that the answer is yes. As we have discussed, I have never signed a warrant so I cannot give the hon. Gentleman personal testament. If I have the procedure wrong, I shall write to him.

<P>
<B>Mr. A. J. Beith </B>(Berwick-upon-Tweed): Do subsection 2(b) warrants arising from the international mutual assistance treaty, which can be signed under the hand of the official, cover matters not currently warranted?

<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> First, I must modify my answer to the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds (Mr. Ruffley) and clarify the issue. I have been advised that warrants have occasionally been explained over the telephone in the examples mentioned-the Secretary of State has not necessarily seen the text.

<P>
With regard to the questions from the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith), my understanding is that we are not considering new areas of assumed warranting, except under the mutual assistance treaty as noted. The obligations entered into under the treaty are within the law, which is clearly set out.

<P>
I hope that I have dealt with the points raised, that the hon. Member for Hallam will withdraw his amendment and that the hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire will move his. We could then see where we stand. If the Committee divides, I urge hon. Members to reject both amendments.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> Before rising to speak to an amendment, it is always helpful to hear from the Minister on a subject such as the modification of warrants. What would be the effect of the Liberal Democrat amendment if it changed the urgent procedure-currently under the hand of a senior official-so that it had to be under the hand of the Secretary of State? Would that not remove some of the purpose of subsection (2)(b)? We are considering an urgent procedure, designed for cases in which the Secretary of State is not available. It would surely not be possible for him to sign warrants in such circumstances, although he might authorise them.

<P>
Clause 10 gives the Secretary of State the power to modify the provisions of an interception warrant or a clause 8(3) certificate. We ask the Committee to consider clause 10(4), which says that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>a warrant or certificate shall not be modified under this section except by an instrument under the hand of the Secretary of State or of a senior official.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The extent of modification allowed in such circumstances is unclear. It would seem that a warrant could be openly modified-clause 10(1)(a) simply says ``modify''. Clause 10(1)(b) says that modification could be necessary under clause 5(3)(a), (b) or (c), which give the general grounds for granting an interception warrant.

<P>
Would it be possible to turn an interception warrant for one category of persons or premises into a warrant for a different category or into one for the same category but with reference to a different person? If the provisions are that wide ranging, it is right for a senior official to make the decision? Equally, clause 8(3) certificates cover a wide category of communications, but there is no requirement that they specify names and addresses. Could a new category of communications be intercepted on the basis of a modified warrant? Should not that decision be made at the higher level of Secretary of State?

<P>
A senior official is defined as a senior civil servant, which is the grade of principal or above. I have the highest respect for that level of civil servant, especially in the Home Office, not least because my wife was one for many years. Is it right to give this role, which elsewhere is ascribed to the Secretary of State, to a senior official? A senior official is usually able to modify a warrant only with the Secretary of State's permission. Should the provisions be so wide ranging that they allow a warrant or certificate to be transformed?

<P>
<H5>9.15 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Beith:</B> I should like to clarify the scope of subsection 2(b) cases, which can be dealt with by a senior official. Is that limited, as clause 5(3) is, to mutual assistance relating to serious crime, or does it cover other types of mutual assistance? Whose officials are capable of signing the warrant? Presumably, the senior official who is authorised to sign a warrant will be a senior official in the Department of the Secretary of State to whom the application would otherwise have been made, but that is not specified. Will the Minister confirm that the term ``senior official'' does not refer to a senior official of an agency, even if that person is on the same pay grade as a senior civil servant or is a seconded senior official with senior civil service status? It needs to be clear that that official is acting under the authority of the Secretary of State in a supervisory or checking role. He should not be the person associated with the initiation of the warrant.

<P>
In a not entirely helpful intervention-I had a coughing fit at the time-I asked whether the activities were previously covered by warrants. We might question the interposition of the senior official because it would be better for his role to be carried out by the Secretary of State. However, the present system would be improved if activities that were not previously covered by the warranting system were brought within its scope. One reason why such activities were not covered was because they related to the interception of someone outside the United Kingdom and, therefore, had not taken place on British soil.

<P>
If the Secretary of State does not sign the warrants, one of the advantages of the present system, as opposed to the judicial system, disappears. By signing the warrants, the Secretary of State has a complete awareness of the use of interception. He knows from personal experience what interception is taking place and to what extent it is proportionate to the threat. He can apply criteria that he has developed for circumstances in which he might question or reject a warrant. That advantage disappears when the warrant is signed by a senior official. It is rash to assume that the Secretary of State will fully acquaint himself with the decisions taken in individual cases by senior officials. Secretaries of State are busy enough with all their other duties, including signing warrants that they must sign, without going back over those that senior officials may sign. One of the perceived advantages of the executive warranting system, from the Government's standpoint, diminishes somewhat if a senior official carries out that duty.

<P>
Why is it necessary for an official to sign the warrant in the relevant cases? They are not defined by urgency. There may be a need for signature by an official in urgent cases in the relevant category. However, we are not considering merely urgent cases, but all cases
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>in which the warrant is for the purposes of a request for assistance made under an international mutual assistance agreement by the competent authorities of a country or territory outside the United Kingdom and  the interception subject is outside the United Kingdom; or  the interception  is to take place in relation only to premises outside the United Kingdom.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is the number of such requests, or the automaticity with which they may be granted, that makes it more appropriate for them to be dealt with by an official? Is that because they are in some way governed by the treaty? I am not yet convinced that there is good reason to take this responsibility out of the Secretary of State's hands.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> Will the Minister clear up some confusion on my part? I have been looking at section 5 of the Interception of Communications Act 1985-which corresponds to clause 10-and the power under clause 10 for senior officials to sign modifications to warrants. Why has it been necessary to change the regime under clause 10? I am puzzled.

<P>
<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> I shall deal first with the points about urgency and the mutual assistance convention and then with the matter raised by the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds.

<P>
Urgent cases are restricted to those in which interception is required outside normal office hours. That usually means that action is required within 24 hours. The urgent procedure is normally applied only when the loss of an imminent importation of drugs is likely; when there is a serious threat to life; or when the loss of the intelligence would damage national security. That gives us an idea of the scale of importance that is involved. I hope it reassures the Committee that there would not be a wide range of urgent cases. Urgency would arise only in specific circumstances.

<P>
I have mentioned the three protections that are built into the urgent procedures. First, officials will reach a decision on what constitutes an urgent case, in line with the criteria that I have described. Secondly, the Secretary of State can refuse to give oral authority for a warrant if he is not satisfied that the case falls within the criteria. Finally, the interception commissioner will be able to oversee the use of the urgent procedure and comment on it in his annual report.

<P>
In answer to the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds, the change to the arrangements set out in the Interception of Communications Act 1985 is needed to make the powers effective against people changing telephone numbers-or addresses, but telephone numbers are the key issue. The power to modify is precisely focused to achieve that. I see that the hon. Gentleman is not quite satisfied.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> Can I conclude that the Interception of Communications Act 1985 was effective, and that before it was passed individuals did not frequently change telephone numbers and addresses? Was a grave defect included in the Act by the legislators in 1985?{**UF3**}Mr. Clarke: That is precisely the case, but I make no criticism of the 1985 legislators. Telephone numbers with a large number of digits, which we are all now familiar with, have been introduced since 1985, and the ability to change telephone numbers has been rapidly developed. That has happened only in the past 10 or 15 years. As the hon. Gentleman says, it is a defect in the Interception of Communications Act 1985, but not a defect for which I criticise the legislators of the time. It is simply that events have moved on.

<P>

<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> That is privatisation for you.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> Privatisation has had several effects, but I shall not discuss them now.

<P>
On the question of interception warrants in cases of mutual legal assistance, the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed asked whether they would be issued only in circumstances of serious crime. The answer is yes. Secondly, he asked who the senior officials would be. The term refers to senior officials in the Department who advise the Secretary of State, not to officials in the agencies or anywhere else. I hope that that gives the right hon. Gentleman the assurance he seeks. The provision refers to the senior civil service officials in the Department, who will be acting under the authority of the Secretary of State and will be accountable to him on the principles that have been set out.

<P>
The right hon. Gentleman also asked why the power is necessary at all. It is necessary to cover the situation, under article 16 of the draft European Union convention on mutual assistance in criminal matters, in which the United Kingdom Government are asked to serve an interception warrant on a satellite ground station in the UK for the purpose of facilitating the interception of a subject on the territory of another member state. In those circumstances, and only in those circumstances, we do not believe that it is necessary for the Secretary of State personally to issue the warrant, as no decision is being taken on the merits of the case. That is the nub of the argument, rather than the issues of quantity or authenticity raised by the right hon. Gentleman. The key issue is that no decision is being taken on the merits of the case.

<P>
We intend to allow a member of the senior civil service to issue an interception warrant on behalf of the Secretary of State without his personal authority. That is because the only judgment required in that situation is whether a valid interception warrant has been issued by the requesting member state. In practice, it is unlikely that member states will make requests for mutual legal assistance under article 16 to intercept satellite telephones being used on their own territory. That is because satellite operators have now developed a service provider intercept solution, which removes the need for member states to make requests under article 16.

<P>
<B>Mr. Beith:</B> The Minister misheard me. I said ``automaticity'', and my presumption was right. That is to say, there are very few grounds on which such a request could be refused and, from what the Minister says, I understand that those are grounds of validity. However, the fact remains that the Secretary of State may go through life unaware of how the powers are being used. Will the Minister answer that point?

<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> I shall indeed address that point, and I am sorry that I misheard the right hon. Gentleman. He is right that automaticity is the key issue.

<P>
In reply to his other question about the Secretary of State's awareness of the process, I can tell him that my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary is very aware of the issues involved, as were his predecessors, because he is personally engaged in such decisions. Even in urgent matters or in cases of mutual legal assistance, he is aware of the decisions that are taken, and his awareness is not diminished by the processes that we have described. Of course, there are other arguments about the judicial issue, but the procedures do not lessen the fact that the Secretary of State is uniquely placed to know all the circumstances. The Secretary of State's position is not weakened, either in practice or in theory.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> I asked the Minister about the scale of modification that is permitted, and I should like to put an example to him. If the authorities obtained a closed circuit television picture of someone entering premises in circumstances that suggested that he or she was a drug trafficker, and the Home Secretary was approached and was satisfied with that information and, therefore, issued a warrant in respect of Fred Bloggs and the premises, but the police later discovered that they had misidentified the person on the CCTV camera-in fact, it was his brother, Joe-could a senior official modify the warrant so that it referred only to Joe Bloggs? Is there a point at which modification stops and a new warrant starts? If so, what is that point? I should be concerned if senior officials could transform one warrant into another.

<P>
<H5>9.30 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> I understand what the hon. Gentleman is saying. The answer in the example that he gives is no; it would not be possible to do so. The proposal is intended to deal with the situations of urgency to which I have referred, and specifically with telephone numbers, which are even more of a preoccupation than addresses. It would not be possible to change a warrant as the hon. Gentleman suggests; doing so would, in effect, create a new warrant. I know that he is seeking clarification, but I assure him that such modifications can be made only to the unscheduled parts of a warrant, not to the scheduled part. The scheduled part, which cannot be modified, contains the key information to which we have referred. Such modifications will be limited to the circumstances that I have described.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> I am sorry to keep going on, but clause 10 (1) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Secretary may at any time-<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) modify the provisions of an interception warrant.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Subsection (1)(b) deals with certificates. Subsection (4) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Subject to subsections (5) to (8), a warrant or certificate shall not be modified  except by  the Secretary of State or  a senior official.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Is the Minister referring to subsection (5)?

<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> Yes, I am referring to subsection (5), which states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the Secretary of State has himself expressly authorised the modifications; and  a statement of that fact is endorsed on the modifying instrument.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
As I said earlier, that deals with the concerns that the hon. Gentleman expresses.

<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> If I recall correctly, members of the senior civil service are those at grade 5 and above. When reference is made to members of the senior civil service, I hope that that means those at grade 5 and above.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> That is my understanding. I hope that the hon. Member for Hallam will withdraw the amendment. if he does not, I shall urge the Committee to oppose it.

<P>
<B>Mr. Beith:</B> Given that any such approval will be granted by a group of senior officials under international mutual assistance arrangements, will Home Office Ministers answer questions from time to time so as to make public how many warrants have been granted? When asked to give details of the number of warrants in any particular category, the Home Office generally says that it cannot do so because that would give too clear an impression of how such powers are used. I have often found that argement unconvincing.

<P>
The Minister has been extremely helpful in explaining how frequently certain warrants are issued by referring to a previous report of Lord Nolan and saying that the situation had not changed from the judgment given in that report. We all accept that the Secretary of State will not know about this category in detail, and there is no reason why the Home Office should not show annually that that facility has been granted and signed by officials in X cases. No more detail and no further information would be required, but it would guarantee that the Secretary of State saw that information.

<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> Will the right hon. Gentleman tell me whether the Intelligence and Security Committee and the independent judicial scrutineers have the right to look at and scrutinise warrants granted on international mutual assistance, or must they be restricted solely to domestic matters by the Secretary of State?

<P>
<B>Mr. Beith:</B> My Committee has no right to look at warrants, but the judicial scrutineers have the right to look at all warrants, to establish whether they were validly granted and to report on them. Their reports are guided by the views of the Home Office and the agencies about how much information should be made public; ours are subject to the removal, with the agreement of the Prime Minister, of any matters that would undermine national security. We are given a little more information on warrants than is publicly available, but we do not look at individual warrants, nor should we do so.

<P>
<B> Mr. Clarke:</B> As the right hon. Gentleman knows, the number of warrants issued is published annually in the commission's report. I shall consider the right hon. Gentleman's request in respect of the category that he mentioned. The general doctrine, which both sides of the House accept, is correct: we should not publish the information in detail. However, I understand the right hon. Gentleman's point in respect of a narrowly defined group-those that come under the convention on mutual assistance. I give the right hon. Gentleman my assurance that we will consider the matter.

<P>
<B>Mr. Beith:</B> I am grateful for the Minister's assurance. If we did not make an exceptional arrangement, it might be possible to discover from some of the countries concerned-but not from others-what use they made of the system. Some countries, with less anxiety than we show, would automatically publish how much use they made of the power. It is logical, straightforward and no threat to the effectiveness of operations for an annual figure to be published stating that three, five, 15 or more applications had been made and granted under the procedure. I am grateful to the Minister for agreeing to consider the matter.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> When officials believe that new addresses and telephone numbers have been obtained by a villain or a wrongdoer, what is the mechanism by which they identify those further addresses? On what grounds do they believe that those addresses or telephone numbers are those of an alleged wrongdoer? I ask because the Foundation for Information Policy Research states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The 1999 IOCA consultation also proposed allowing subsequent addition of extra ad-hoc ``addresses'' to a warrant by officials.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is the subject of the clause to which the amendments relate. The FIPR continues:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The appending of unidentified Internet accounts, or sub-netted/translated/spoofed IP-addresses of uncertain provenance, to warrants of extended duration, by civil servants inured to a daily diet of communications villainy, could be the last straw which breaks the constitutional convention of direct ministerial accountability to Parliament.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I take that to mean that there is a possibility of a fishing expedition by civil servants when they are legitimately trying to identify new addresses that may be used by wrongdoers in an effort to evade law enforcement. Nevertheless, if my interpretation of what the foundation said is right, there may be a problem when officials gather further addresses and telephone numbers. Will the Minister say something about that?

<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> The process is tightly constrained, and, as I have said, there are legal safeguards. When the agencies need a warrant, they put together a carefully considered intelligence case. I pay tribute to their professionalism in that regard; they go through the process very carefully. The agencies carry out feasibility checks for telephone numbers and addresses-the points that the hon. Gentleman raised. I hope that he will accept that that is necessarily done in secret, to ensure the greatest possible effectiveness. There is no question of any unjustified use of addresses or telephone numbers in that process.

<P>
The hon. Gentleman referred to the points raised by the foundation. They are not soundly based. Yesterday, I attended a conference that dealt with some of those points, as did other members of the Committee. The professionalism of the agencies is of a high standard, the warranting process is strict and the circumstances in which changes can be made are tightly constrained. There is no chance of there being a general fishing expedition of the kind that the foundation and the hon. Gentleman described.

<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> This has been a useful debate; it has concentrated on issues other than judicial authorisation, which we discussed earlier. I am grateful to the Minister for his typically helpful response to my right hon. Friend's suggestion about the publication of information on the numbers of warrants issued. My party believes that the citizen has the right to know in general terms about how such powers are used. I hope that we can move forward on that basis.

<P>
With regard to the amendments relating to judicial authority, we have, as the Minister rightly said, a difference of principle that we will be unable to resolve. So that we can put on record our belief that the Bill should be amended, I ask for a Division.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> I want to raise two issues.

<P>
Subsection (1)(a) states that the warrant
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>shall not be issued except-<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) under the hand of the Secretary of State.</UL></FONT>
<P>
That must mean that the warrant will be a written document. It will be issued subject to the requirements of clause 8, which suggests that it should be a written document. Clause 8 refers to naming and describing people and making various provisions that, it seems to me, would be consistent only with the existence of a document in written form. In other parts of the Bill, however, such formalities are dispensed with. In clause 21(1) and (2), which deal with communications data, and clause 46(4), which deals with decryption notices, the notices required are different from the warrants mentioned in this clause. That could lead to confusion. Having three or four different notices and documents could cause security and verification problems. Will the Minister produce a series of clearly identifiable warrant, request and authorisation forms for the whole Bill? Will he deal with the problem of verifying the identity of the person who makes the request, issues the warrant or puts in the notice?

<P>
<H5>9.45 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
Although the problem is probably less acute in clause 7 than in clauses 21 and 46, what thought has the Minister given to the security issue? An authorisation under clause 22 must be granted in writing or in such a manner that a record is produced, which could mean in an electronic form. A similar provision applies to a notice under clause 21(4)-a record must be made, but it need not be in a particular form. The same applies to clause 46.

<P>
Many people who manage security for large institutions have raised the issue with me. Mark Drew, the head of security at Norwich Union, sent me a document that said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The issue is one of proving who is making the request, is it lawful, and are they who they say they are. Under the Data Protection Act requests can come from a number of agencies and in a number of ways or forms. Business experience shows that access to data has been made informally, with little or no authentication or credentials  Often the request gets presented or routed to a junior member of the back office staff unaware of the requirements of the regulations. To avoid reckless discloure it is therefore necessary to authenticate the validity of the request  if there is an authority to whom recipients can go for confirmation of the warrant/order that will confirm the credentials of the requestor then life will be much simpler and each request could carry with it the prompt as to how it could be authenticated.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
We are dealing with sensitive matters. Large institutions owe a duty to their customers to secure the information that they hold on them and to communicate with them. Has the Minister thought about the issue? One of my main criticisms of the Bill is that its regimes for interception warrants, communication data and decryption are different. The poeple who can apply, the grounds for applications and the notices for the person on the receiving end are different for each regime. I am not sure that such a system is in the public interest. It is certainly not in the interests of those who are trying to conduct business and co-operate.

<P>
At the conference that many hon. Members attended yesterday, we heard from a person with great experience in the information technology industry. I believe that he has been involved in decryption since 1985 and in the industry for 30 years. He said that once we started alienating the people whom we needed to help us to fight crime, we would begin to lose the battle. Everything should be done to encourage those people, whom we need to co-operate with us. If all the documents are different, it is difficult to authenticate the person making the appraoch as a genuine police or National Criminal Intelligence Service officer. The Minister must convince us that he has thought through the issues surrounding these notices and warrants.

<P>
Drawing on my benefit fraud ministerial experience-the Minister always like to hear about it-I know that the Benefits Agency had to deal with documents which had to be relevant to the Department of Social Security and identifiable if they were forgeries. Much thought and effort went into establishing exactly what various documents looked like, taking identification points and a range of other criteria into account. That enable a genuine benefit book page to be identified as such. Has the Minister done similar work in the present context?

<P>
Under the clause, a senior official may issue a warrant when the purpose falls under an international mutual assistance agreement. The provision, however, does not specify that the agreement must be either compliant with the European convention on human rights or made with other democratic countries. Could a senior official issue a warrant under an agreement if the country seeking the issue of the warrant has issued an interception order without considering one or more of the criteria listed under article 8 of the ECHR?

<P>
If an agreement were made in Europe, one would hope that all European Council countries would follow the ECHR. If one of them did not-a mistake could be made by one of our partner countries in issuing interception warrants or, worse, as a result of an over mighty act of power-an ECHR breach could occur. Under mutual assistance agreements, we would be bound to issue the warrant here, but would it be right to do so? Proportionality is supposed to be part of the process. Can this country simply abdicate that and say, ``No, we don't have to worry about the ECHR because someone in France has dealth with it''? Can responsibilities be delegated to another country in that way?

<P>
The Minister says that only the draft directive on mutual assistance is on the stocks, but the Bill allows any international agreement to be reached. What defence is there to convention proceedings against the UK for issuing a warrant when we have relied on another country, and the procedures of the convention had not been followed? How can reciprocity be automatic? The right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed touched on that point. Is automaticity possible under the convention? If so, on what grounds? Is it fair to put a senior official in the firing line in those circumstances?

<P>
<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> On the issue of a written document, under subsection (1)(a), warrants have to be personally signed by the Secretary of State in written form. Throughout the rest of the Bill, there is an array of different levels of process involved in different procedures. That is intentional, because we are dealing with entirely different levels of activity and surveillance. Under clause 62, codes of practice are set out to harmonise the operation of different processes throughout the Bill. The hon. Gentleman mentions the forms of procedure and verification and so on, which will be dealt with in the codes of practice set up in clause 62. He may wish to table amendments to address those points when we come to that clause.

<P>
Clause 62 and the codes of practice relate to parts I to III of the Bill, section 5 of the Intelligence Services Act 1994 and part III of the Police Act 1997. Clause 62(3) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Before issuing a code of practice  the Secretary of State shall-<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) prepare and publish a draft of that code.
<P>
That code of practice is being drafted at this minute. It is intended that the public consultation to which that clause refers will take place in the summer to enable us to consider representations about the draft. Clause 62(4) goes on to say:
<P>
The Secretary of State shall lay before both Houses of Parliament every draft code of practice prepared and published by him under this section.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
The purpose of the codes of practice is to ensure that the community as a whole is easy with the processes that we operate-a point made at the conference yesterday. We intend to achieve a simple and clear set of processes so that the confusion about which the hon. Gentleman may be concerned does not arise. He and others will judge whether the codes that are drafted achieve that end. We believe that we will be able to show the Committee and the House a draft of the code in about a month's time.

<P>

<B>Mr. Heald:</B> It would help if the Minister could confirm that the code will deal with what the document looks like for each of the three procedures. Moreover, will there be a verification point that people can contact to confirm the document's authenticity?

<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> I confirm that those issues should be addressed in the code of practice. I shall ensure that those drafting the code are aware of what the hon. Gentleman has just said. Clause 62 is intended to address those points.

<P>
I think that it was an amendment tabled by the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed and the hon Member for Hallam to clause 4(1) that addressed the hon. Gentleman's second point. I made a commitment then to write to the Committee about the EU convention and clause 4(1). I hope to be able to send that letter today or tomorrow, so that numbers of the Committee have it before we sit next week and can explore the issues in the detail that they deserve.

<P>
The principle of the Bill is that all actions should comply with the Human Rights Act 1998. If any EU member state changed its political regime in such a way that that Act was being violated, that would affect not just what we are talking about here but our international contracts and communications in a range of areas, and would, as the hon. Gentleman implies, be an extremely serious matter. That is all that I want to say on the issue now. I should prefer to deal with it fully and comprehensively in my response on the matter that was raised under clause 4(1).

<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> I fully accept that, but can the Minister deal with a point that does not relate to whether the ECHR would apply to these agreements generally? If an official were to sign a warrant, or be involved in the process by modification or in some other way, relying on a decision made by somebody in another country-this is the ``automatic'' point that the Minister made-would we be in the clear or could we be in breach of the ECHR because of what a Belgian or French judge had decided?

<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> I shall address that point in detail. First, the absolute obligation of Ministers and officials in this country will be to act within the Human Rights Act 1998. They will not be allowed to act incompatibly with that Act. However, the question of ECHR compatibility will be crucial for the country as a whole, and not simply in the context of the Bill, in deciding what mutual assistance arrangements are entered into. I concede that that is relatively easy to define at the point of entering into a mutual agreement, but the regime of a country with which we had agreement under ECHR-compatible conditions might change. Even in those circumstances, the first obligation of Ministers and officials in this country would be to act within the Human Rights Act 1998 and, therefore, in a way that is compliant with the European convention on human rights.

<P>
With the permission of the Committee, I shall deal with those interesting issues more fully in my letter to the Committee later this week.

<H5>10 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> The European Informatics Market has raised one or two points with me and I should be grateful for the Minister's reponse on them. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Clause 8(2) may present technical problems in associating a block of data being communicated with a specific target, however identified. For example, intermediate communications links may not know the originating or destination address explicitly. This may reflect on the information that service providers will be asked to keep for interception purposes. It was confirmed at<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
a recent open meeting
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>that both ``targeted'' warrants and ``certificated'' warrants could be issued to any service provider.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Perhaps the Minister will comment on those technical problems.

<P>
I have received an inquiry about that clause from a Mr. Cooper who is concerned about mutual assistance in criminal matters between nation states. He states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>From the record of formal proceedings of the committee<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
so far,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I see that the government has stated that the main purpose of<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Clause 8
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>is to facilitate compliance with acts of the European parliament. However, as was observed by both of you-<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
that is a reference to the hon. Member for Hallam and me-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the clause, as drafted, permits such mutual assistance to take place beyond the confines of the European Community, and the constraints on such co-operation are not tightly defined.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He then quoted my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Worcestershire (Mr. Luff) and continued:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I should like to draw your attention to the UKUSA agreement between the United Kingdom, the United States of America, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, and its significance in mutual assistance in the interception of communications for intelligence purposes between the signatories.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>As you may be aware, there has been much coverage in the press of late on the subject of an international interception system referred to as ``Echelon'', which is reputedly the embodiment of this agreement. The British government however, has thus far stubbornly refused to acknowledge the existence of such a system, in spite of statements made by other signatories confirming its existence, and describing how it has been used in the past.
<P>
He then cites numerous websites and continues:
<P>
I am concerned that one possibly overlooked facet of the broad scope of this clause is to permit the fairly indiscriminate use of such a system  in the interception of communications of British Citizens without the provision of a proper system of oversight of its use.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I wonder if these are concerns that the minister may be legitimately questioned on at this stage in the proceedings now that Mr. Heald has agreed not to press his amendment? If so, I should very much hope that you would do so.
<P>
I should be interested to hear what the Minister has to say about the issues.

<P>
STAND has a website devoted almost entirely to the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Bill, which contains a great deal on clause 8. I do not necessarily adopt all the points that it raises, but I think that the Minister should nevertheless respond to them. STAND's spokesman states:
<P>
One of STAND's recurring worries is that each introduction of new powers for interception creates a greater opportunity for mass surveillance. This was one of our major objections to the government's previous key escrow proposals. In that case, placing copies of many users' private decryption keys in a central location would have made it much easier for determined groups to collect intelligence en masse.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We know that the Minister has abandoned that plan. STAND continues:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>One of the downsides of the unsecured Internet we use today is that, without sufficient safeguards, it makes it as easy to gather information on the public as a whole, as it does individuals.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He then refers to subsections (1), (3) and (4). He raises a question about external communications in subsection (4), saying:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``External communications'' means a message sent or received from outside the UK. In other words, the Security Services have a mandate to monitor all incoming and outgoing international traffic, without regard to who it's from or to, merely under the control of the general permission from the Home Secretary.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That appears to refer to the general point made by
Mr. Cooper. Under the heading ``Our objections'', STAND continues:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Now, let's consider this blanket permission in the light of the Internet. How much of your everyday Net communications fall into this category? Do you access your mail via Yahoo, or Hotmail, or Netscape? Do you use ICQ, AIM or Napster? Do you subscribe to mailing lists, hosted on US machines? Do you buy shares online at Charles Schwab or E*Trade?<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He lists some other services, then continues:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>If so, congratulations. The Home Secretary has just granted the security services and police permission to monitor you-with almost no legal oversight. After such strenuous efforts, aren't we getting paranoid? Why would they want to monitor you, anyway?-<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
he asks, continuing:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The simple answer is: they don't have to. All of the Net's international traffic passes through a handful of points. There, the security services  can tap everyone.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He goes on to talk about trawling, monitoring and other methods. He then continues:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Actually, it doesn't even have to be suspicious in a criminal sense. Perhaps it's commercially sensitive, interesting. If you're in business, you might like to consider just how many of your deals with foreign companies may be construed to affect ``the economic well-being of the United Kingdom''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He concludes under the heading ``We'd like'':
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>This has to go. In a globalized economy, it makes no sense to treat communications with overseas companies differently from talking to a partner in the next county. If the government wishes to tap international traffic, let us use the same principles that RIP requires of monitoring internal communications. The security services have to have specific warrants to target individuals or locations. There can be no excuse for the mass surveillance of British citizens' everyday lives, no matter how distant their colleagues.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
STAND has a substantial website dealing with the Bill. It obviously feels strongly about clause 8, and I would be grateful if the Minister could answer some of those points.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I should be grateful if hon. Members would refrain from reading out long extracts from letters, as it tends to hold up the proceedings a little.

<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I, too, was worried when I read through clause 8, once I had picked through the various provisions. I was especially concerned about the proposals for certificated warrants in subsection (3).

<P>
However, I shall turn first to clause 8(1), which describes two models of warrant for intercepting communications: the AA model and the RAC model. One is either a personal member and can receive assistance wherever one goes, or one is tied to a particular car and the vehicle is covered. We seem to have similar models in the Bill, in that either an individual or a set of premises will be tracked.

<P>
In the case of warrants issued against individuals, questions must be raised, in the modern world, about the breadth of interception allowed, especially when we consider the range of addresses referred to in clause 8(2), which provides for the warrant to include addresses
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>that are to be used for identifying communications which are likely to be or to include  communications from, or intended for, the person named<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
in the warrant. What link would have to be made between an individual and a particular address, be it a physical address, an e-mail address or a telephone number that the Minister had deemed to be associated with that individual? When confronted with a warrant, what test will the Minister apply in deciding whether that address is appropriate for that individual? The net could be cast far too wide, and a range of possible addresses, most of which would not be relevant, could be suggested to the Secretary of State.

<P>
If we get that judgment wrong, general trawling warrants will be able to specify a complete set of mailboxes and a particular server, rather than mailboxes that are genuinely associated with the individual in question. An individual could set up 50 mailboxes and 50 mobile phone numbers, which the security services or the police might wish to specify in the warrant. We should ensure that all-not 20, or even 49-are genuinely associated with that individual. The test in subsections (1) and (2) is therefore important.

<P>
I am concerned about the certificated warrant in subsection (3). The Government are granting themselves the kind of authority to which the hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire referred. As I understand it, were the Government to decide that words such as ``bomb'' or ``cocaine'' fitted the definition of a serious crime, they could issue a certificate and listen for such words by monitoring traffic on a communications pipeline between the United Kingdom and the United States.

<P>
Such a certificate would grant a wide-ranging power of interception. Would it be issued under this warrant? I accept that those words may be associated with serious crimes, but I worry about proportionality. As the hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire pointed out, monitoring all e-mail traffic between the United Kingdom and the United States for the use of key words is technically straightforward, and subsection (3) will grant that power to a Home Secretary who is minded to do that. Is that the intention behind the powers in subsection (3), or is a much narrower form of interception and certificate intended?

<P>
The issue of external communications is also important because the concept of territoriality in communications, particularly telecommunications, to which this provision refers, is diminishing. Clause 19 defines ``external communication'' as
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>a communication sent or received outside the British Islands.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Minister should comment on circumstances where a UK citizen is signed up to an American internet service provider that is located in the United States, but is communicating with another British citizen. The communication originates in the UK, and the UK is its destination, but it is sent in the meantime to a server in the United States, and re-sent or collected on request by a British citizen.

<P>
Will there be additional safeguards for communications between residents in the UK? In such circumstances, the warrant should specify the individual or the premises. However, if the second, certificated form or warrant will apply to those communicating externally, we must clarify what is meant by a communication to a ``British Islands'' citizen. Clause 19 does not make that clear, and the Minister may need to return to the concept of external communication when we consider it.

<P>
<H5>10.15 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
In general, I wish to hear the Minister's understanding of the different types of warrant. Will any communication that is deemed to be an external communication centrally received outside the United Kingdom be subject to a general picking-up procedure, rather than one that requires individual names to be placed on the warrant?

<P>
Will the Minister clarify his view of the tests that are to be applied in associating an individual with an address, and the level of certainty that will be required regarding the appropriateness of the address for the individual? I should be interested to know how he thinks the powers differ from those that exist and have already been used, especially in the context of IOCA.

<P>
Finally, will the Minister give us a definitive statement on the rumours about Echelon which have been circulating for some time? As yet, we have had no official confirmation from the UK authorities as to whether they are engaged in large-scale picking up of the traffic that goes across the interconnectors between the UK and the United States. Information comes out of other countries about the different apporaches that they take to revealing what the state does in respect of interception, so greater clarity about what the Government intend to do would assist our understanding of the kinds of interception that take place on a regular basis.

<P>

<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> It is important to remind ourselves of the clause's differentiation between external communications and non-external communications. Clause 8(1) is fairly sensible and clear. It presumes that an interception warrant must name one person or a single set of premises as the interception subject. That is fine. However, subsection (3) drives a coach and horses through that. It states that there will not need to be the specificity that is outlined in subsection (1) if
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) the description of communications to which the warrnat relates confines the conduct authorised or required by the warrant to conduct falling within subsection (4);<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Subsection (4) refers to ``external communications''-that is, messages sent or received outside the UK-and whether their interception is authorised under clause 5(6), which is the general sweep-up provision in that clause. That is fine. However, subsection 3(a) continues:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>and<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(b) at the time of the issue of the warrant, a certificate applicable to the warrant has been issued by the Secretary of State certifying-,<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and it then refers to compliance with the categories in clause 5(3)(a), (b) or (c), which are the grounds of national security, detecting or preventing serious fraud and protecting the economic well-being of the UK.

<P>
The problem arises from the definition of external communications. As the hon. Member for Hallam observed, individuals may use a service provider in the UK, cheerfully thinking that it is classed as internal traffic and not therefore caught by the external communications carve-out. However, as has been pointed out by trade journals and other interested parties, I may unknowingly, using a UK domestic service provider, have my traffic routed via New York or Amsterdam-for example, when internal routes are congested. I could be sitting in this country, cheerfully-but wrongly-assuming that clause 8(3) does not apply to me. I might be transacting commercial busines through a UK internet service provider, in which case my communications could be intercepted under clause 8(3).

<P>
Why is there a carve-out for external communications? Neither the explanatory notes nor any documents proffered by the Government make that clear. It does not seem to make much sense. I want to echo the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Hertfordshire and those of the hon. Member for Hallam on the potential for mass surveillance. If the Government merely want to tap international traffic, will the Minister explain why the arguments that we adduced are wrong? What appears to be internal traffic could be classified as international traffic, which would give the authorities carte blanche to intercept and have access to electronic communications circulating within the United Kingdom.

<P>
First, can the Minister provide a principled explanation of the existence of clause 8(3) and the carve-out for external communications? Secondly, could the definition of external communicatons incorporate what would otherwise appear to be internal traffic if an internet service provider in this country, for whatever reason-such as congestion on a particular day-had to reroute what I innocently presumed to be internal traffic to New York, Amsterdam or another location?

<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> Does my hon. Friend suspect that human rights convention is being applied to a practice that probably already exists?

<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> My hon. Friend makes an important point, which I hope that he Minister will address in his reply. It is probably my ignorance-I may not have read the relevant consultation documents, of which there are many-but it is not clear why external communications are subject to this carve-out. I am perfectly happy with subsection (1)-which has certainty and specificity-but I have looked in vain for an intellectual or principled justification for the external communications carve-out. I would greatly appreciate an explanation from the Minister, in his typically helpful and thorough fashion.

<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> I am worried about clause 8. I fear that the Government have made the wrong judgment about how to deal with the internet and e-mails. If I telephone friends in America, or even friends in the European Parliament, I know that Government communications headquarters, Cheltenham is automatically monitoring such calls. Millions of telephone calls and wireless communications are monitored. That should not trigger any activity unless I were to say to one of my friends in the European Parliament-it would be extraordinary if I were to say such a thing-``Paddy, you can bring in the gelignite tomorrow.'' The computers are programmed in such a way that they would pick up that interesting phrase, and in due course certain people would, I hope, study it, and they might apply to the Secretary of State for a warrant to intercept all my communications because I might say something that would assist in the detection of serious crime or terrorism. We may not like it, but it is a fact of life that all our telephone calls, and transatlantic and foreign traffic can be monitored. GCHQ and other sites that are operated by our American allies perform that task.

<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> Is the right hon. Gentleman comfortable with the fact that if he calls a friend in the United States, an interception warrant would not be necessary to monitor the call, but if he calls a friend in Leicester or Leeds, a warrant would be necessary? Is there a difference in principle between calling friends in the United States and friends in Leeds?

<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> There is no difference of principle. However, we have to deal with the situation that is before us. We might be able to set back the clock, but it would not be acceptable if a Government tried to take away GCHQ's rights to monitor traffic-mainly international traffic-and calls that are made around the world. Doing so has assisted in our country's defence. On balance, I am 51 per cent. happy to accept that GCHQ may listen to my international telephone calls. The fact that computers have listened to billions of calls a year means that we can catch the two or three calls that it is necessary for us to catach for this country's safety and security.

<P>
I recently wrote to my American friends and Members of the European Parliament, but there is no question of the Government's opening each of those letters. It is appalling to suggest that all the letters that we put in the post should get the prisoner-of-war-camp treatment, be opened and studied by the Government and routinely passed on, unless they wanted to hang on to the odd one or two.

<P>
We are in the present situation partly by historical accident. The Government do not open all of our letters, but they listen to all of our telephone calls. When the internet and e-mail facilities were developed, the previous and present Governments had a problem. What should be done about the fact that letters can be sent by wireless? Should the Government not open each letter, and treat e-mails like ordinary snail mail? Such mail has absolute privacy, unless the Government have suspicions about someone and take out an interception warrant. There are a few hundred or a few thousand such cases each year. Alternatively, should the Government treat e-mail letters-our personal correspondence-like telephone calls, and monitor all of them? The Government concluded in susbections (3), (4) and (5) that they should treat all e-mail letters as though they were telephone calls. They have sought powers to monitor and to trawl through all e-mails and, if necessary, to deal with those that may be of interest to the security services.

<P>
I am not certain of the technicalities, but if I subscribe to Hotmail.com, and send an e-mail through it this afternoon from my office upstairs to an hon. Friend who is elsewhere in the Palace, that letter would leave this country, go God knows where in the United States and, with a bit of luck, arrive back a few seconds later in my hon. Friend's computer. That involves sending an external communication, but not to someone who lives abroad or who has an external address. I suspect that millions of people in this country use Hotmail.com because it is free-although it is not terribly secure. There are many similar systems, including Yahoo! Each of the big internet service providers offer similar facilities, including Microsoft-

<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> Netscape.

<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> I stand to be informed about other new providers. Each of them involves a major American influence, and they offer apparently free e-mail services, which means that they involve external communications. I cannot see a solution, but I hope that the Government agree that the situation is as I described it. What are they to do with our private e-mails? They concluded for their own reasons that they would use the certification system to monitor all that traffic. If I had been the Minister three years ago, I would probably have been advised to do exactly the same thing, and I would have done it in the interests of detecting serious crime, of the economic well-being of the United Kingdom and of the security of the nation. However, we must place it on the record and admit openly to the British people that, on consideration, that is what we have decided to do, so there will be no private e-mails for anyone.

<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> This has been an interesting discussion, and it is opportune to lay to rest some of the concerns that have been widely expressed.

<P>
The Interception of Communications Act 1985 has never permitted indiscriminate interception, and neither will the Bill. I want to place that on the record. Under both the IOCA regime and this regime, interception is limited to those communications specified on the warrant, which must be approved personally by the Secretary of State. Under clause
 5(2)(b), the interception approved by the Secretary of State must be
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>proportionate to what is sought to be achieved.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The word ``proportionate'' is an important one to set against the word ``indiscriminate'' and other such words that have been bandied about, not particularly in the Committee but elsewhere.

<P>

<B>Mr. Heald:</B> Will the Minister give way?

<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> The hon. Gentleman and his colleagues have said a lot, and I would like to finish what I have to say. I will, of course, allow him to make his point later.

<P>
None of the intercepted messages can be examined by anyone unless the messages are certified by the Secretary of State. Uncertified messages may not be read, looked at or listened to by anyone. The hon. Member for Hallam asked about communications that are likely to be included in that category. The intelligence case has to be made, and there must be good grounds for the Secretary of State to believe that interception will achieve the aim of the warrant. Of course, the Secretary of State may issue a warrant only when he or she believes that that is necessry for one of the purposes set out. Members of the Committee have expressed concern about subsection (3), but it is a direct equivalent of section 3(2) of IOCA.

<P>
The right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border (Mr. Maclean) asked a question about the treatment of communications between two systems in the British Isles that are connected via the United States. Clause 19 defines ``external communication'' as
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>a communication sent or received outside the British Islands.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That means that the interception of communications between the right hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friend the Member for North-East Hertfordshire would have to be warranted explicitly under clause 8(1). A communication that goes through ISPs in the United States is not an ``external communication'', and its interception cannot therefore be warranted unless it meets the requirements in that subsection.

<P>
``The concerns are genuine, but they are dealt with by the way in which the Bill is being addressed. Interception of calls via the United States must be authorised under subsection (1), and only for the specific purposes set out, which we have discussed: serious crime, national security, and economic well-being. Interception must also be warranted by the Secretary of State. If someone is targeted in the United Kingdom, a clause (8)(1) warrant must be sought. Clause (15)(2) contains other safeguards.

<P>
The Bill carries forward the aims of IOCA, and it contains a series of explicit defences and securities that should allow citizens to feel confident that their private e-mails will not be read in the way that has been suggested. As with any warrant, the Secretary of State cannot issue a warrant unless he believes that it is necessary for one or more of the specified purposes. He must further be satisfied that the conduct authorised by the warrant is proportionate to what it aims to achieve. He must take into account whether the information that is sought could reasonably be obtained by other means. The question of feasibility, which was raised by EURIM, as the hon. member for North-East Hertfordshire pointed out, must also be considered. Feasibility checks are done to see whether interception can be carried out. Warrants are not authorised unless they are feasible. I have not completed my speech; there are other points that I wish to raise. I have completed my answers to what I think is the substance of the concerns which, not unreasonably, have been raised more widely outside this place, although I think that the regime is more robust than people suggest.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> My right hon. Friend the Member for Penrith and The Border gave an example of proportionality. He said that it might be proportionate to tape all the communications that leave this country to find two or three conversations in which serious terrorism was being discussed. If the Minister agrees with that-and it has certainly been the regime at GCHQ-is not he saying that the same would be true for the internet: that it would be proportionate, as is now the case, for all the communications going outside the country on the internet to be intercepted so as to find two or three conversations about terrorism?

<P>
<B>Mr. Allan rose-</B><P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley rose-</B><P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> May I, Mrs Michie, give way to the hon. Member for Hallam next, and deal with both points in due course? Afterwards I shall answer all the other questions.

<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> To return to the point about the definition of external communications, I hope that the Minister will agree to look again at the clause 19 definitions in this context. We seem to be talking about the first originator and the final recipient, but the way in which the system is now developing means that messages are ``sent or received'' several times before they go from the first originator to the final recipient. That needs to be looked at. Also, how does one distinguish UK citizen to UK citizen messages that are going down the same pipe as UK citizen to external citizen messages? It appears to me that the certificated warrant would cover a pipe-a specific communications medium-that was being searched instead of picking out which of them would end up as final UK recipient and which would be the final external recipient.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> I give way to the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> I am grateful to the Minister, but the point has been made.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, not I, will be the judge of what is not proportionate. As the right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border was generous enough to acknowledge, these are difficult decisions. I know that my right hon. Friend takes these decisions seriously and directly, as his predecessors did. I cannot comment on the points about Echelon that the hon Members for North-East Hertfordshire and for Hallam made, precisely because a discussion about what is and what is not proportionate obviously has to relate to an analysis of what the threat may or may not be. I am not privy to this information; only the Secretary of State will be, when he or she takes the decision.

<P>
Clearly, there is room for a great many interesting hypotheses about the circumstances and game-playing exercises in which a decision about what might or might not be a particularly proportionate way of handling these things would be taken. In common with Governments of all parties over time, we do not believe that general speculation about how these judgments are to be made would be in the public interest when we are dealing with some of these general issues. Although I understand the legitimacy of the points that have been raised, I shall not accept the invitation to go down that course, except to emphasise-because it is important to do so-that all interception is carried out in strict accordance with the law, as successive commissioners have confirmed. When the Bill is enacted, that will continue to be observed scrupulously.

<P>
On external communications, I can only repeat that if a UK citizen is to be targeted, a clause 8(1) warrant is required. I hope that that reassures hon. Members.

<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> May I reinforce the point that I made earlier to the Minister? He as accepted that clause 8(3) gives a general power to monitor external communications. However, the individual may not be deliberately targeted but will be swept up within it. The safeguard will not necessarily apply if the UK citizen to UK citizen traffic is getting swept up in something that is intended to be for external communications.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> I understood the point that the hon. Gentleman made. I assure him of two things. First, I understand his point about the chain of communication. Secondly, the agencies concerned understand slightly better than I do how those chains operate, and they understand that the law of the land must be scrupulously applied. I hear what he says about the definition of external communications in clause 19(2), which I think is rigorous and stands up. In light of his comments, I will have a look before we debate that clause to see whether anything can be done. My provisional strong view is that the wording is clear. The assurances that I have given should satisfy the Committee.

<P>
My final point concerns the global economy. We are part of a global economy and communications system, and that changes everything. But we do not have world government; we have a series of national jurisdictions sometimes qualified by international treaties. Some of the people in the internet business believe that as we now have world communications and a global economy, we should have world government to regulate it consistently throughout the world. But we do not, and that is why different regimes exist for domestic and external communications.

<P>
As a young man I was a Utopian for world government; I am getting a bit older now and I am sure that before I die we will have world government, but we are not there yet. In those circumstances, we must acknowledge that distinctions need to be drawn between domestic and external legislation.

<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> Now we know the Prime Minister's real aim.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> What I want to make absolutely clear is that during the rest of my life there will be no more boom and bust. With those comments, I urge the Committee to agree that clause 8 should stand part of the Bill.

<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<P>
Clause 8 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<P>
Clauses 9 and 10 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<H4><center>Clause 11</center></H4>
<H4><center>Implementation of warrants</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> Concern has been expressed about subsection (4), which deals with the duty of compliance. It reads:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Where a copy of an interception warrant has been served by or on behalf of that person to whom it is addressed on-<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
one of three groups of people-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>it shall  be the duty of that person to take all such steps for giving effect to the warrant as are notified to him.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The part that causes concern is the definition of a person who has a warrant served on him in subsection (4)(c), which is
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>a person not falling within paragraph (b)-<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
 in other words, someone who does not provide a public telecommunications service, but
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>who has control of the whole or any part of a telecommunication system located wholly or partly in the United Kingdom.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The concern is that that could include just a man
 with a telephone. Because of the way in which telecommunications services are defined, it appears that someone who has a private telephone linked to the public telecommunication system could have an interception warrant served on him because he has control of part of the telecommunications system located wholly or partly in the United Kingdom. It is one thing to have a warrant served on a business of substance requiring assistance with intercepting communications, but if an employee of a small company, or just an individual, were involved, that would be a daunting prospect-particularly as it is backed up with the threat of two years' imprisonment for non-compliance. Under clause 18(2) employees would also face five years' imprisonment if they were to reveal the contents, details or even the existence of the warrant.

<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
There appears to be no time limit on this imposition, or in so far as there is, it is very open-ended. Concern has been expressed that people who are really not competent to deal with this type of process may be caught by it. One feature of the internet is that small users can operate a public telecommunications system on-line. By widening the definition, the Bill seems to put a substantial liability on them and on the smallest users and micro-companies involved.

<P>
Fast connectivity and server-based services increasingly mean that the facilities that would hitherto have been kept on-site are being moved to remote locations, connected by private networks across the public internet. This means that private communications between individuals at a business can be sent across the net. That involves the difficulty that the state may be prying at too low a level in clause 11(4), and that could affect confidence in the system. Those who use the internet, telephones and so on should have confidence in whatever they are using.

<P>
Many people would like to be convinced that telecommunications services in this context would improve communication between individuals rather than off-site systems that one person uses. We should also like clarification of what the Home Secretary considers to be reasonable compliance. Subsection (5) contains a defence, so to speak, or a form of compliance that is less than full compliance. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>A person who is under a duty by virtue of subsection (4) to take steps for giving effect to a warrant shall not be required to take any steps which it is not reasonably practicable for him to take.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
What does the Minister think ``reasonably practicable'' means in this context? In other areas the Minister has taken substantial powers to regulate, or at least to make orders about all sorts of subjects. ``Reasonably practicable'' is a phrase that is used in law in many other contexts, but none is equivalent to this. What does the Minister think is the legal meaning of ``reasonably practicable''? For example, if it would involve a disproportionate effort for somebody to comply, that would be practicable, but the effort involved would be disproportionate to the person's business or his personal circumstances. Would that be unreasonable or does ``reasonable'' in that context mean something else? Is it a question of the individual's circumstances or a more objective issue? Does it go as low as just a man with a phone, or is the level higher? The words in subsection 4(c)-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>who has control of the whole or any part of a telecommunication system-<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
seem to go very low, when one considers how telecommunication system is defined.

<P>

<B>Mr. Allan:</B> We have some concerns about the clause-and on clause 12, to which amendments have been tabled-specifically on the way in which implementation will take place. There will be major culture clashes between those who operate systems, particularly internet systems, who have a strong culture of freedom and a wish for private communication, and the Government, who will try to intercept communciation. Operators will not necessarily try to break the law, but will try to find technological solutions, driven by consumer demand, because customers will want a commitment that their communications will not be intercepted. There will be huge demand for secure systems, particularly from those whose communications the Government may wish to intercept. A service based in Finland in the early days of the internet enabled people to send things out anonymously, and we could see a similar development here.

<P>
I shall give the Minister a specific example. A service provided entirely by a company based outside the United Kingdom may issue dynamic addresses and encryption for the individual subscriber, so that there is no way of pinnig down a firm address. As far as I can see, the only bit of the telecommunication system on which someone could serve a warrant is the bit that provides the copper wire going to the end point, which is totally mobile. The individual could wander round the UK with a laptop, logging on randomly through different telephone lines on different telephone numbers, none of which the state can get a handle on. He could use internet addresses assigned apparently randomly according to the service subscriber/provider, but not in a way that can be traced, and perhaps using a dynamic encryption system that cannot be traced. In those circumstances, the only body on which the warrant could be served is BT, because it is likely to be providing the bit of copper wire.

<P>
How does the Minister envisage the Government getting round that? There will be demand from those for whom privacy is, legitimately or illegitimately, important, and that kind of service will soon be offered and operated. We shall not be able to serve warrants in such cases.

<P>
Will the Minister reconsider how the way in which warrants are issued will interact with company procedures? In this clause and clause 18(2) the Government seek to keep the presence of a warrant secret, but there may be reasons why they cannot. A company's procedures or cultures might require the serving of a warrant to be reported, and that may be passed outside the United Kingdom. The UK operator may be trying to observe the law properly, but a company whose headquarters is in a country with a different concept of freedom of information might seek procedures that enable it to publish outside the UK the fact that interceptions have taken place. I can see such chains existing and the Bill being unable to cope with a company's procedures. A philosophical question then arises. If a company with such procedures is externally domiciled, to what extent should the UK seek, through domestic law, to restrict such practices? I envisage challenges from companies based externally on what is their own business and their own policies.

<P>
I return to the point made by the hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire about the extent to which telecommunication system is defined. It seems to me that the warrant could be served on a child listening in on a family's upstairs extension, if the clause is to cover any element of the telecommunication system, even down to a second telephone extension.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that it sits ill with the Minister's constant refrain about acting in accordance with the law if the law is so widely drawn that almost anything would be in accordance with it? Surely the law should be restricted so that acting in accordance means something.

<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I agree. We have identified a number of areas where, as an unfortunate consequence of the way in which rights of privacy and so on are drawn up, there is an all-encompassing brief. The hon. Gentleman referred to the broader range of companies that will be affected, many of which are small businesses. Even relatives on telephone extensions could be affected. The proposed legislation would allow warrants to be served on a huge range of people who can be deemed to be operating some part of a telecoms system. That exposes dangers.

<P>
The Government may indicate that warrants would tend to be served only on larger telecoms companies and internet service providers, which are more high-profile. However, a mushrooming of smaller and smaller telecoms companies down to micro level is likely in the coming years, and the Government will want to issue warrants on very small companies, which come and go and constantly reform themselves according to the dotcom market. As the hon. Gentleman said, there is a risk that observance of the law will be rendered difficult because of practical issues rather than unwillingness to comply. The law can encompass too broad a scope. Will the Minister indicate how the law will evolve in the light of how technology will evolve? I am not trying to give people ideas for companies, but merely drawing attention to consumer demand. Internet culture is about freedom, privacy and technological exploration. People will legitimately try to find a route around legislative challenges. In many ways I sympathise with that culture, which is about the freedom of the citizen to go about his own business without state interference. I have a great deal of respect for that.

<P>
The application of clause 11 will not be as straightforward as would be the case if it were to apply primarily to domestic systems. In many cases, interception will apply to very dynamic systems, 99 per cent. of which could be deemed to be external to the UK. Therefore, UK law would not apply directly to those individuals who control the parts outside, but to those who control the parts within the UK. From a technical point of view, such individuals may have a limited role and be hard to track down.

<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> I have one main concern about the clause. It relates to the use of the words ``reasonably practicable'' in subsections (5) and (6). My hon. Friend the Member for North-East Hertfordshire asked what the definition of ``reasonably practicable'' would be. The insidious point is that ``reasonably practicable'' is whatever the Government think when they impose obligations under clause 12.

<P>
Clause 12 allows the Government to impose obligations on internet service providers or communications companies. Clause 11 relates to what happens if someone does not comply with those obligations. If the person says that it was not reasonably practicable to do so, the Government can say, ``Ah, but you didn't comply with the order telling you all the things that you have to do, so it will be more practicable in future.'' I shall preface my remarks so that I am not misunderstood by civil servants, and invitations to the Bill drinks party are not rejected out of hand.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> I give an absolute assurance that the hon. Gentleman will be invited to the drinks party whatever he says in the Committee.

<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> I am grateful to the Minister.
<P>
The Minister is served by excellent officials from the Home Office. The quality of the advice that they give with regard to criminal law, and their knowledge of jurisprudential matters, is second to none. The Foreign Office likes to think that it picks the cream of the graduates, but in my experience the Home Office usually gets the best.

<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> What about the Treasury?

<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> I shall not go down that route. Under all Governments, it includes people who cannot count.

<P>
During the previous Government's period in office, we were pressed by colleagues to change the definition of obscenity. In response to a request from the Home Secretary, a brilliant civil servant produced an outstanding and persuasive paper giving all the pros and cons of doing that. That is where officials excel; it is their forte. I would even defend the quality of the staff in the animals, burials and coroners unit, which many in the Home Office deride.

<P>
The Home Office has a major weakness, as do all Government Departments, including the Department of Trade and Industry. If, this afternoon, the Minister were to ask his staff to design a mousetrap that worked, they would come back in three years' time, 10 times over budget, with something that worked periodically, perhaps on a Tuesday afternoon. Government is not a centre of excellence when it comes to technology. There are plenty of examples, under this Government and the previous Government, of failure to deliver, on time and on budget, systems that worked-including police radios, automatic fingerprint recognition, computerised fingerprint records and various other computer systems. Technological matters are not the forte of the Home Office or any other Government Department.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> Passports.

<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> There is a whole range of examples. By the end of this Parliament, we will be able to quote against the Government as many bungled technological projects as I wrestled with in the past. The Home Office is not unique in that respect. The Department of Trade and Industry is as incompetent at dealing with technological matters as any other Department. I prefaced my remarks by saying that Government Departments are excellent at concepts, producing papers and-especially the Home Office-giving legal advice. In that respect, their quality is second to none. However, technology is not their thing. They are similar to my classics master, who was brilliant at Latin and Greek, yet on Friday afternoons, when we used to look at slide pictures of ancient ruins, could not work out how to plug in the projector.

<P>
Officials in the Home Office and other Government Departments, are to draw up, under clause 12, regulations telling technical experts in the computer and communications industries what they have to do in order to comply with what the Government want. Those same minds devised the key escrow proposals, which were issued by the previous Government and initially taken up by this Government. People then realised that the proposals were crazy-impractical, nonsensical and absolute rubbish. Yet Ministers of both Governments, properly advised by their staff, had believed that they were ncessary and workable. If-God help us-they had passed into law, we would now be imposing regulations on all the internet service providers to intercept communications and have a key escrow facility, which would be totally impractical.

<P>
Under clause 11, people could go to prison for up to two years if they did not implement Government instructions been drawn up by people who-with the best will in the world-do not have that as their forte. If providers say that the instructions are impracticable and will not work, they could go to prison. That involves a potential injustice. For the clause to work, poachers would have to turn to gamekeepers. The Minister would regularly have to contract out to the latest whiz kids in computer technology the obligation to draft regulations under clause 12, which will have to be changed virtually every month.

<P>

<B>Mr. Allan:</B> The right hon. Gentleman makes an excellent point: regulations will have to be drafted by people in the industry. Is he aware that the Government have eventually drafted their T-scheme proposals for electronic commerce? The Government are asking that an encryption certification system be developed by the industry, rather than civil servants, who, as the right hon. Gentleman suggests, might produce an inferior system.

<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> I accept what the hon. Gentleman says. The Government will of course consult relevant parties on clause 12, but there must be more than the usual consultation; they must ask that a system be developed that is practical and workable. The major players such as Microsoft-everyone will agree with what Microsoft says-will develop a system that is perfect for their internet service providers. The only operating system on which last week's edition of Computer Shopper contained information was Linux. I accept that, in respect of intercepting communications, it does not matter whether e-mails are sent via Microsoft or Linux. Nevertheless, in a relatively short time, a new computer operating system has appeared on the market. Moreover,it is rumoured that the TCP/IP protocol-whatever that may be-will be changed. Such a change was attempted in respect of the parliamentary internet-which, as we all know, is not brilliant-and it caused horrendous problems.

<P>
The type of system and protocols may not matter to the interceptors but it matters to communications experts and internet service providers. The Government appear to want to invent regulations stating, ``You must now build in a capability that will make it technically feasible for us to tap in and intercept''. In the meantime, whiz-kid companies on the frontiers of technology will be developing systems that are incompatible with, say, Microsoft or Linux, and the result will be a dog's breakfast. The risk is that the development of those systems will be hindered by dangerous Government regulations, although I do not doubt that the previous Government would have produced equally dangerous regulations.

<P>
The Government want to impose regulations under clause 12. Under clause 11, they want to sentence to two years' imprisonment those who fail to do what is reasonably practicable to comply with regulations that may be totally impracticable. The Government must clasp the internet service providers and computer boffins closer to their breast and create a separate Home Office unit consisting of such people. The regulations will need to be changed monthly or regularly; otherwise, the technology will grind to a halt.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> I rise to support the powerful arguments advanced by my right hon. Friend, and I have one technical point for the Minister. For those who fall foul of clause 4, clause 11(7) establishes punishments that, in the light of my right hon. Friend's remarks, are almost draconian. We have heard about the problems associated with the phrase ``reasonably practicable''. How will the use of the word ``knowingly'' in clause 11(7) be interpreted by a criminal court?

<P>
Clause 11(7) states that those guilty of an offence will be liable
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) on conviction on indictment, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years or to a fine, or to both;<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(b) on summary conviction, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months or to a fine not exceeding the statutory maximum, or to both.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
So that we can gauge the seriousness with which the Government view contravention of clause 11(4), will the Minister tell us what other criminal offences incur punishments similar to or identical to the punishments and penalties in subsection (7)(a) and (b)? That would give some context to the magnitude of the offence. Prima facie, great uncertainty obtains in relation to breaches of subsection (4). The relevant reasons were set out powerfully and persuasively by my right hon. Friend the Member for Penrith and The Border.

<P>
<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> The clause deals with the way in which interception warrants can be implemented once they have been authorised, and it sets out the role of different people in the process. The clause states that any service provider that is required to effect an interception should be provided with the relevant paperwork-that will reassure it that the paperwork has been properly authorised. The codes of practice in clause 62 will clarify the way in which that process will operate. I shall return to that matter in a moment.

<P>
The clause will place a duty on the person who is required to comply with a warrant to give effect to that warrant. However, there is a qualification-the clause states that no one should be under a duty to take steps that are not reasonably practicable. That matter was discussed by the hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire. Criminal and civil liabilities are provided in respect of those who do not comply with the duty. I place on record and emphasise the fact that the provisions are required to underpin the integrity of the interception process, but they are very much a last resort-we do not expect them to be in general use. It is important to remember that the clause involves compliance with individual requests for interception, but that it does not cover any requirement to maintain an intercept capacity-that matter is dealt with in clause 12.

<P>
In relation to the phrase ``reasonably practicable'', anyone who runs a telecommunications system must give reasonable assistance when he is served with a warrant. That assistance may involve no more than offering access to the system, if that is the most that can be offered. Private systems will not be required to provide any intercept capacity. For example, an office or hotel switchboard might be asked to provide reasonable feasibility-that may be the only feasible way to intercept.

<P>
The definition of ``reasonably praticable'' is of interest to the Home Office, but it will be for the courts to determine whether a person should be sued or prosecuted for failing to comply. Ultimately, the courts will determine what is reasonable.

<P>
I hope that I can lay to rest some of the concerns that the hon. Gentleman expressed by stressing that we believe that reasonableness should involve taking into account the circumstances of the individual or organisation asked to comply in the way that we suggest. We expect the courts and the Home Office to take that into account.

<P>
The hon. Member for Hallam made a powerful and important point about the culture clash. The right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border raised the matter in a slightly different way-he made an early offer to provide alcohol for the drinks party that we shall have at the end of our Committee. During consideration of the Terrorism Bill, he volunteered to bring one or two small contributions from the highlands. I hope that he will honour that commitment for each of the Committees on which he sits.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> It was an early pledge.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> Yes it was.

<P>
In response to the points raised by the right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border and the hon. Member for Hallam, I stress that the key point involves collaboration and the need to work with industry. We have stressed at every stage that we support that approach. One of my first obligations when I became Minister was to deal with the mandatory key escrow point, which was to be dealt with in the Electronic Communications Bill. My hon. Friend the Minister for Small Business and E-Commerce and I discussed the best way to deal with the matter. We felt that the system's weakness was that the industry was in dialogue with the Department of Trade and Industry but not sufficiently in dialogue with the Home Office. Perceptions developed on all sides that were not necessarily helpful, and we agreed that it was best to deal with the matter in this Bill, not the Electronic Communications Bill. We developed substantial system dialogue, which of course involves disagreements, in an effort to deal with the concerns that had been raised.

<P>
I did not fully agree with the comments by the right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border on centres of excellence. In the public service, there are outstanding centres of excellence in IT in some areas, but I am wrestling with other areas in which the technology is not so effective. My hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department sits on a committee, which I chair, to consider ICT through the criminal justice system. That is a classic illustration of the difficulties that we face in achieving consistency, but I shall not detain the Committee with that. I accept the right hon. Gentleman's points, but there are some areas of very high quality excellence within the system.

<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
The key point is that we can establish the system only through partnership. That is why we dropped the mandatory key escrow proposal and why the T scheme is run by the Department of Trade and Industry. That is why we committed ourselves as strongly as possible to developing the codes of practice and to working with industry rather than against it. I agree that if a politician or civil servant in Whitehall tried to decide what might be right without any dialogue, it would almost certainly be wrong. The purpose of the process is get the sytem established.

<P>
I acknowledge that that will not necessarily achieve total agreement on everything, but the dialogue that is taking place is likely to achieve agreement in those areas. There is an interesting cultural point about the people involved. The internet is no longer just for nerds and anoraks; it is universal in our society. The culture of the people involved will, therefore, change and we are trying to address that change directly in the Bill. The hon. Member for Hallam said that people will try to find ways of evading the system and we have said publicly that law enforcement will take a hit from new technological development. Nevertheless, it is right to try to obtain the system that gives us the confidence to move forward.

<P>

<B>Mr. Heald:</B> Does the Minister agree that it is all very well to have good intentions, to negotiate and to implement partnership, but many of the bodies concerned would like to see stronger protection in the Bill? Is he not prepared to lock in the ability for matters to be debated and to include provisions that strengthen the partnership by giving some protection to the people with whom he is negotiating? The Minister may be talking to them and they may like that, but they are not yet satisfied with the Bill. It would be helpful if the Minister could signal some concessions.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> I do not think that ``concessions'' is the right word. It is a question of finding the right way forward and we are trying to do that. The hon. Member for Hallam raised important technical issues. There are important economic issues concerning cost, which we shall discuss when we come to clause 12. There are important procedural issues, which we want to deal with in collaboration, and discussions proceed. Our intention is to achieve that because, if there is ultimately a culture clash between the industry and law enforcement, the system will not succeed. It is a question not of niggling with particular phrases, but of implementing a culture that will work.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> Will the Minister tell the Committee what criminal offences attract a similar penalty?

<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> I beg the hon. Gentleman's pardon, but I cannot do that. I do not have a list of similar offences in front of me at the moment, but I am happy to refer him to the relevant legal documents in which he will see the sort of cases that arise in this area, and a substantial list of the sorts of financial penalties. His hon. Friend the Member for North-East Herfordshire, with his substantial legal experience and rapier mind, may be able to help the hon. Gentleman.
