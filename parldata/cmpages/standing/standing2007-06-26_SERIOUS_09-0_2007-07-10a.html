							<b class="B">Mr.
Douglas Hogg</b> (Sleaford and North Hykeham) (Con): We are
extending various powers to accredited financial investigators that are
currently enjoyed by police officers under the Proceeds of Crime Act
2002, and I am cautious whenever I see a proposal that powers of
seizure should be entrusted to somebody other than a police officer. We
need some clarification on why that is happening in this case and what
safeguards
exist.</div>
					<a name="07071038000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07071038000432"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department
(Mr. Vernon Coaker):
						</b> I will speak to clause 72
and add points that are relevant to one or two of the following
clauses. I am aware that the right hon. and learned Member for Sleaford
and North Hykeham tabled amendments to leave out this and the
subsequent three clauses. As he said, those clauses provide for
accredited financial investigators to act under the powers of the 2002
Act. Such investigators already have access to an array of powers:
investigating money laundering; investigating the extent and the
whereabouts of a suspect&#146;s benefits of crime; and, applying for
an order to restrain a person&#146;s assets. Those powers have proved
a great
success.</div>
					<a name="07071038000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government recognise the important contribution of the agencies for
which such investigators work to the rise in the value of money
recovered from criminals. An extension of those powers beyond the
police and Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs to others, such as
the Serious Fraud Office, fraud investigators in the Department for
Work and Pensions and the immigration service, has strengthened our
overall capacity in the recovery of the proceeds of crime. The
important point is that we are trying to improve our capacity to
recover the proceeds of crime from people who are seeking to gain from
criminal activity.</div>
					<a name="07071038000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">Currently,
appropriately accredited financial investigators can apply for
restraint orders. Those are interim orders to freeze property and are
made in anticipation of a confiscation order following conviction.
Police and customs 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column282" />Column number: 282</div>officers have separate powers to seize property, subject to a restraint
order, to prevent its removal from their jurisdiction. The clause will
extend the powers of accredited financial investigators, giving them
the ability to seize such
property.</div>
					<a name="07071038000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07071038000433"></a>Mr.
Hogg:
						</b> I intervene at this point only because the Minister
is nearing the end of his notes. What troubles me is the identity of
the accredited financial investigator. We are referred to section 435
of the 2002 Act, which I have here. However, when I go to that section,
I find no definition of who the accredited financial investigator is. I
tell the Minister that the Committee would be much happier if it knew
something about the identity of those individuals who are so
undesignated.</div>
					<a name="07071038000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07071038000434"></a>Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> The right hon. and learned Gentleman anticipates
my remarks. The accredited financial investigators will first undergo
training by the National Policing Improvement Agency, which will then
accredit them and monitor their performance. Hon. Members will be aware
that other clauses move the responsibility for training financial
investigators from the Assets Recovery Agency to the National Policing
Improvement Agency. Therefore, they will be trained and accredited by
the NPIA, will be expected to conform to a code of practice and will be
monitored in carrying out their duties. Of course, as well as
accrediting them, it will be perfectly possible for the NPIA to take
away that accreditation. Its responsibility, therefore, is to accredit
people; and, if they go through the appropriate training and are
accredited, they will be able to exercise those powers. I am coming to
a point that may answer the right hon. and learned Gentleman&#146;s
next
question.</div>
					<a name="07071038000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07071038000435"></a>Mr.
Hogg:
						</b> It may be that I anticipate the next answer. The
Minister has told us who will train the financial investigators, and I
am jolly glad to know that. But where are they seated; are they private
sector characters or are they seated in public organisations? At the
moment I do not have a sense of who will employ, instruct and pay them,
on whose behalf they will act, and where they are to be
found.</div>
					<a name="07071038000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07071038000436"></a>Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> As I have said, the right hon. and learned
Gentleman&#146;s incisive mind, which we have all come to respect,
absolutely anticipates my next remarks. An accredited financial
investigator will need to be a member of the staff of a body listed by
order by the Secretary of State. Those are public bodies that have a
criminal investigation role. They include the Financial Services
Authority, the Environment Agency and fraud investigators from the
Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. In answer to his
point, the accredited financial investigator will need to be a member
of such a body, as designated by order by the Secretary of
State.</div>
					<a name="07071038000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07071038000437"></a>Mr.
Hogg:
						</b> May I sound a word of caution? I listened to the
organisations listed by the Minister and I think that we are moving
quite a long way from law enforcement agencies. For example, he
mentioned some of the DEFRA organisations and the Environment Agency.
While they may have some enforcement role to perform, we are moving
quite a long way from organisations whose 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column283" />Column number: 283</div>primary responsibility is the enforcement of criminal law. I am not
going to oppose the measure, but I do think that there is a problem,
and we need to watch carefully those whom he has
designated.</div>
					<a name="07071038000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07071038000438"></a>Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> I think that the right hon. and learned Gentleman
is absolutely right. We all want to recover the proceeds of crime from
individuals, and he is quite right to alert the Committee to the
extension of powers and sound a note of caution. I give the reassurance
that we will, of course, monitor how those powers are used. We expect
the NPIA to take its responsibilities very seriously, as it will be the
regulatory body for the training of those accredited financial
investigators.</div>

							<b class="B">James
Brokenshire</b> (Hornchurch) (Con): The clause will give
effect to schedule 12, which will extend the powers in the Regulation
of Investigatory Powers  Act 2000 to all criminal
investigations undertaken by 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column284" />Column number: 284</div>Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs. The clause has been raised in
the context of the ongoing review of HMRC&#146;s powers. The Law
Society has raised a number of concerns in relation to the provisions,
stating:</div>
					<a name="07071038000388"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In
our responses to the ongoing consultation we have made clear our view
that HMRC should not have wider powers than those available to the
police.</div>
					<a name="07071038000389"></a><div class="hs_brev">It is equally
vital to ensure that the use of any new powers is authorised at an
appropriately senior level within HMRC. At present, the senior
authorising officers for the police are Chief Constables (Commissioners
for the Metropolitan and City police forces), whereas for HMRC those
authorised will be officers of HMRC. We believe the act must make clear
the level of seniority required to authorise such intrusive powers and
should identify an equivalent level of seniority to that of Chief
Constable. In addition, the officers in question should be limited to
those in HMRC&#146;s new Criminal Investigations
Directorate&#151;as is the case with the proposed powers of
arrest&#151;who have received thorough training in the exercise of
these powers.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07071038000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those seem
sensible and reasonable points. What assurance can the Minister give
that they have been or will be
addressed?</div>
					<a name="07071038000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07071038000443"></a>Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> It may help the Committee if I say a few words
about the clause. In answer to the hon. Gentleman, my understanding is
that those authorised will be senior officers. At present, only five
officers within HMRC are authorised to act in that sphere of work, so
it is not a widespread responsibility&#151;only a small number of
specially trained officers have
it.</div>
					<a name="07071038000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another point
worth making to the hon. Gentleman is that work in that area is divided
into criminal and civil cases. One aspect of the arrangements that
concerned people was that the two parts of HMRC&#146;s operations
should not be merged, as they are very distinctive and it is a small,
specialised
body.</div>
					<a name="07071038000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
77 and schedule 12 extend the surveillance powers available to HMRC to
tackle serious crime. At the moment, they are available only when the
crime relates to an ex-Customs and Excise matter. The clause would make
them available also for serious crimes that relate to ex-Inland Revenue
matters. The change is necessary to address the emerging patterns of
criminality targeting ex-Inland Revenue tax systems, such as
self-assessment, tax credits and gift aid. That criminality involves
not only the evasion of tax on income or commercial profits, but
organised attempts fraudulently to extract money from the Exchequer.
For example, in June four people were jailed for a total of 19 years
for committing a &#163;1 million fraud involving the gift aid scheme.
The extension of the powers would allow HMRC more effectively to
investigate and bring to justice criminals engaged in serious attacks
on ex-Inland Revenue systems. The powers would help to establish the
links between those involved in the criminal activity, the financial
structure of the activity, and where the proceeds of the crime are
located. For example, the serious criminals behind organised tax credit
fraud involving identity theft may engage foot soldiers to operate bank
accounts for them. The extended powers would make it easier to
establish the links between the foot soldiers and the major players,
allowing the full extent of the crime to be
uncovered.</div>
					<a name="07071038000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">HMRC
consulted on the change from March 2006 to January 2007. The majority
of those who responded were in favour of what is proposed, provided
that the powers could be used only in criminal investigations 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column285" />Column number: 285</div>into serious tax crime, and that they continued to be subject to the
same safeguards and controls that apply to HMRC criminal investigations
into ex-Customs and Excise matters. The same concerns were voiced when
the clause was considered in another place. I am pleased to assure the
Committee on all those matters. The powers can and will be used only by
trained specialist officers who work only on criminal investigations.
They cannot be used by other HMRC staff engaged in civil compliance
work, such as checking the accuracy of tax returns. The powers cannot
be used to inquire into major tax avoidance, on the ground of
safeguarding the economic well-being of the UK. They can be used only
when necessary, and they must be proportionate to the
circumstances.</div>

am</div>
					<a name="07071038000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
interception of communication requires a warrant from the Secretary of
State. Intrusive surveillance must be approved by a surveillance
commissioner, and the most intrusive property interference also
requires the approval of a commissioner. All property interference must
be reported to the commissioners, who can quash any authorisation. As
the hon. Gentleman will know, use of the powers will be overseen by the
independent Interception of Communications Commissioner and the Office
of Surveillance Commissioners. Complaints can be made to the
investigatory powers tribunal, and HMRC is subject to inspection by HM
inspectorate of constabulary. None of that will change.</div>
					<a name="07071038000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">I assure the hon. Gentleman
that only senior officers will be able to apply for warrants, and there
will be rigorous internal controls on applications. I think that that
is the reassurance that the hon. Gentleman sought. It will involve only
a small number of people in HMRC, and only senior directors will be
able to apply for warrants.</div>

were to debate the amendments in some detail it might preclude a stand
part debate. For myself, I am content that we should debate the
substance of the clause on the amendments, but it is, of course, a
matter for you. I intend to deal briefly with the question of firearms
through the amendments.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07071038000449"></a>The

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07071038000450"></a>Mr.
Hogg:
						</b> I am grateful, Mr. Benton.</div>
					<a name="07071038000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having looked at the
legislation that touches on firearms, I doubt whether the amendments
are necessary&#151;and I rather doubt whether clause 78 is necessary.
However, the amendments at least enable us to explore that conclusion,
and perhaps the Minister will give some reassurance.</div>
					<a name="07071038000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 160 would ensure
that the officer could not exercise the powers conferred on him by
clause 78 unless he had reasonable grounds to suspect that firearms
were present. That is intended to provide some additional safeguards
for the citizen. At the same time, I would extend the power to search
and seal to include noxious substances and explosives. The object is to
cover the current situation with terrorism.</div>
					<a name="07071038000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">One needs to ask&#151;I made
my opening observation for this reason&#151;what clause 78 brings to
the party. What new powers does it confer on the constabulary? It is
possible that it confers one&#151;the power to seal off&#151;but I
am not sure that it extends the powers of the constabulary beyond
that.</div>
					<a name="07071038000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am troubled
by the fact that their lordships spent a lot of time on this in the
other place. I know Lord Marlesford well, and have a great deal of
respect for his judgment. I notice that he tabled this amendment, or
something like it, on some three occasions and rallied to his cause a
lot of noble Lords, who supported it and incorporated it in the Bill.
Therefore, I approach the matter with some diffidence. However, I do
have difficulty in understanding why they did that. Section 47 of the
Firearms Act 1997 enables a constable, as now is, to stop a person whom
he has reasonable grounds for believing to have a firearm, search him,
detain him and, if necessary, search his vehicle as well. If I ask what
section 78 of the Bill brings to the party, the answer is the
sealing-off power, but I am not sure what is meant by sealing off that
is not already provided by section 47.</div>
					<a name="07071038000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">Lord Marlesford attached
considerable importance to the use of metal detectors, sensibly making
the point that one can use metal detectors without carrying out a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column287" />Column number: 287</div>physical search, by running them up and down somebody&#146;s clothing.
I should have thought that the use of metal detectors already came
within the power of search. I do not think that search necessarily
means putting one&#146;s hands in people&#146;s pockets, but it
could involve a metal detector if one wanted to use one.</div>
					<a name="07071038000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although it is not offensive in
any way, I rather doubt that we need section 78. I should be grateful
if the Minister would reassure the Committee on that point. Would he
also be good enough to address my amendments? I have not checked this,
but I suspect that there is already&#151;in terrorism legislation and
perhaps also in firearms legislation&#151;a power to search where the
officer has reasonable grounds to suppose that noxious substances or
explosives are present. If that power does not exist, it should do, and
in the absence of that power I would strongly recommend my amendments.
However, I might have to support clause 78 in order to incorporate them
into law.</div>
					<a name="07071038000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07071038000451"></a>James
Brokenshire:
						</b> The clause touches on the apparent need to
strengthen the powers of the police to seal off areas in which they
suspect that a person or persons may be carrying firearms, and to
undertake certain searches.</div>
					<a name="07071038000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">I know that the Minister takes
a close personal interest in the matter. He and I have attended various
events at which the families of those affected by gun crime have been
present. I am sure that he would agree that we cannot overstate the
tragedy of such incidents for the people involved. He was moved, as I
was, by an event that we attended recently at City Hall. The testimony
of some of the mothers and other close relatives showed the devastating
impact of that terrible crime on many families in this country. Last
year,  50 people lost their lives through gun crime. I am sure
that the Committee will agree that that is 50 people too
many.</div>
					<a name="07071038000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am on record
as having said that we need to be careful in examining the issue and
considering whether further stop-and-search powers are required. I
stand by that. However, we are prepared to support measures if there is
an identified gap in the law, or if it can be demonstrated that the
measures are appropriate and necessary and would make a significant
impact in terms of dealing with this appalling crime.</div>
					<a name="07071038000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clearly the
culture of carrying weapons needs to be changed. It can be either for
the protection, or perceived protection, of the person involved, or as
part of asserting some sort of status within a criminal gang culture.
Getting guns off the streets must be an essential part of the strategy
to deal with serious violent crime. We must also do all that we can to
prevent weapons getting into this country in the first place, which is
why we support the establishment of a border police force to strengthen
our borders. We would also support measures to examine more closely
items coming into this country using the postal or courier services to
ensure that weapons are not being smuggled
in.</div>
					<a name="07071038000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is also the
cultural issue that I have talked about. We have to challenge the guns
and gangs culture, strengthen communities and the family unit and
undermine the criminal gangs. These gangs seek to recruit more
vulnerable members of the community into a pattern of crime, which,
once they are engaged 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column288" />Column number: 288</div>within it, is extremely hard although not impossible to break. They also
seek to disrupt the traditional bonds of kinship and family and other
linkages within society that might prevent that type of
activity.</div>
					<a name="07071038000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">My right
hon. and learned Friend&#146;s amendment is about effective law
enforcement and ensuring that the police have appropriate powers to
address this problem. Lord Marlesford, in moving his amendment which is
now incorporated into the Bill as clause 78,
said:</div>
					<a name="07071038000390"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
purpose of the amendment is very simple: it is to help to get guns off
Britain&#146;s streets, and thus to reduce gun crime, which is
causing misery not just to those who tragically get caught up in it but
to the far greater number whose anxiety has been growing over recent
years. Whether they are right or wrong, they perceive themselves as
vulnerable. The amendment would give the police a simple and
over-riding power which would enable them to make it far more risky for
anyone to carry an illegal firearm.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report,
House of Lords,</i> 30 April 2007; Vol. 691, c.
917.]</div>
					<a name="07071038000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
will no doubt say in response to that point that the police have not
asked for these powers, that the Association of Chief Police Officers
says it is not necessary and that there is no gap in the law. However,
their lordships felt that there was a shortcoming. My right hon. and
learned Friend has identified a number of potential issues that need to
be examined closely to see whether there is a gap in the law. As
currently drafted the clause appears to have a very wide ambit. For
example, it can designate an area within which a search for firearms
can be conducted. The meaning and scope of that need to be examined
carefully. This provision would therefore need to be amended and
refined in some way and it is certainly something that must be looked
at actively if the clause is included in the Bill.</div>
					<a name="07071038000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">I note that my right hon. and
learned Friend seeks to extend the ambit of the clause by including
explosives and noxious substances. I would prefer to consider those
aspects as part of the Privy Council review of terrorism, given that it
touches on those sorts of issues. It might be more appropriate to
consider the way forward in the light of how the Privy Council
committee reports back on the serious issue of terrorism more
generally. We hope it will come forward with constructive solutions and
proposals that can gain cross-party
support.</div>
					<a name="07071038000400"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11
am</div>
					<a name="07071038000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
understand that concerns have been raised in relation to the clause and
its scope. However, the noble Lord makes the more general point that we
need to consider carefully whether we need enhanced powers. We are
prepared to work with the Minister to discuss any measures that might
be appropriate, and if he is minded to table an amendment on Report or
to consider other proposals, then, subject to that discussion, he would
have our support if appropriate measures are deemed to be necessary and
are brought forward.</div>
					<a name="07071038000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">In that context, therefore,
although I note that the Minister will no doubt seek the wholesale
deletion of this clause, I would ask him to reflect carefully on the
points that my right hon. and learned Friend made about the issues that
might arise from this clause, which is why he tabled his amendments.
Before discounting this clause out of hand, the Minister should also
examine whether a clause of some form should be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column289" />Column number: 289</div>retained in the Bill that might address certain issues that have
obviously been of concern to their lordships and which may be required
to ensure that our law enforcement agencies have the power and
authority to intervene appropriately to combat this appalling crime,
which claims too many lives in this country each
year.</div>
				
					<a name="07071038000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07071038000452"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Jeremy Browne</b> (Taunton) (LD): Thank you very much,
Mr. Benton, for giving me the opportunity to speak to clause
78 and amendments Nos. 160 and 161.
</div>
					<a name="07071038000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
start with an understanding of what their lordships were trying to
achieve, because if one looks at the backdrop to this clause there is a
great deal of cause for concern. Last year, for example, there were 46
homicides involving firearms in the UK. In 2005-06, there were 4,036
robberies involving firearms, a 10 per cent. increase on the previous
year. Handguns were used in 4,652 offences during 2005-06, an increase
of 7 per cent. on the previous year. Finally, shotguns were used
in  639 offences during 2005-06, a 7 per cent. increase on the
previous year.</div>
					<a name="07071038000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">We now have
in this country a serious and escalating gun crime problem; it is not
necessarily escalating in every category, but the overall trend is
clearly upwards. The police have responded to that problem. Fifty-five
per cent. of firearms offences occur in the areas covered by just three
metropolitan forces: the Metropolitan police here in London, the force
in Greater Manchester and the West Midlands police. They have all put
in place specific programmes and initiatives to try to deal with gun
crime. Of course, the temptation for us as legislators is always to
think that the solution to problems of this sort is additional
legislation. It may be, in part, the solution on some occasions, but
the solution is also, of course, partly about the operational
initiatives undertaken by the
police.</div>
					<a name="07071038000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">So we have
this problem and that was no doubt the reason for the new clause being
introduced in the first place, and also for the House of Lords deciding
to support it. However, having said all of that, when one reads the
clause there are many reasons for concern. I note that the right hon.
and learned Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham said, during his
contribution a few moments ago, that he did not regard the clause as
being &#147;offensive in any way&#148;. Well, I was quite surprised
that he said that, because there are reasons why people who are
concerned about civil liberties&#151;I know that he is one of
them&#151;would have reservations about the drafting of this
clause.</div>
					<a name="07071038000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">For example,
it gives any officer, even the lowest ranked officer, the power to seal
off an area&#151;that area is not defined&#151;by any means
necessary, which is an extremely wide remit, if he has &#147;reason
to believe&#148;, which again is an extremely wide remit, that
something is being done that is untoward involving a
firearm.</div>
					<a name="07071038000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07071038000453"></a>Mr.
Hogg:
						</b> Of course, the hon. Gentleman will also remember
that one of my amendments would require the officer to have reasonable
grounds to believe.</div>
					<a name="07071038000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07071038000454"></a>Mr.
Browne:
						</b> I take the point. The right hon. and learned
Gentleman&#146;s amendments would improve the clause, but he said
that he might not wish to move them because he might see merit in
removing the clause altogether. My view is that, although the
motivation 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column290" />Column number: 290</div>behind the clause is honourable, the provisions of the Criminal Justice
and Public Order Act 1994 give the police the powers that they require
to deal with the problem. What is more, they are more tightly drafted
than the clause and more likely to ensure a balance between giving the
police the rightful ability to exercise their power to protect the
public and reassuring the public that their liberties are
safeguarded.</div>
					<a name="07071038000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
existing legislation is more practical in its application than this
widely drafted clause. For those reasons, subject to what the Minister
says, I suspect that there will be a consensus that, although
politicians must repeatedly turn to this issue to try to deal with the
problems, the clause is not the best way to do
so.</div>
					<a name="07071038000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07071038000455"></a>Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> I thank the Opposition Members who have
contributed to this important debate, which is of concern to everybody
throughout the country. Everybody wants to see gun crime and
firearms-related offences fall. Notwithstanding the points that the
hon. Member for Taunton made about the number of homicides, the overall
number of firearms offences in the year to December 2006 fell by 16 per
cent. Although there are issues to be resolved, there are also some
good points worth
mentioning.</div>

Coaker:
						</b> We all have problems with what our constituencies
are called.</div>
					<a name="07071038000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">I agree with
much of what the right hon. and learned Member for Sleaford and North
Hykeham said and I agree with the purpose of his amendments. The
Government will vote against the inclusion in the Bill of clause 78,
which will account for one of his amendments. With respect to his other
point, I understand that the power to search for explosives and so on
is contained in other terrorism-related legislation. Such points might
be subject to the review to which his hon. Friend the Member for
Hornchurch alluded. From those comments, I hope that it will be clear
that the amendments are unnecessary. The Government will vote against
the clause; the other amendment is covered in other
legislation.</div>
					<a name="07071038000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Hornchurch mentioned the various events that we have been to
together. He made a point about the force of argument that the families
of victims bring to the debate. I know such families in Nottingham and
I have become friends with some of them. In one case, I was friends
with a family before their son became a victim of gun crime. I find it
remarkable that those families often turn their grief to the pursuit of
a way to reduce gun crime in the future. Those people, whose lives have
been devastated by an appalling murder, have the power and strength to
turn their grief towards something positive. One cannot fail to be
moved by those families, as were the hon. Gentleman and I and many
hundreds of other people at City Hall.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column291" />Column number: 291</div>
					<a name="07071038000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">With all due humility, I say
that I am not often accused of saying that it is important to protect
the subject&#146;s civil liberties. It am often accused of quite the
opposite&#151;of riding roughshod over centuries of tradition and the
civil liberties of individuals. In this case, although no one can doubt
that the intention of those who tabled the clause is to reduce gun
crime, we have to be proportionate and sensible about it, and the power
proposed in the clause is draconian. Do we really want a police
constable who suspects that there might be a gun in an area to be able
to seal off that area, with no specification as to its size, with no
limit or safeguard in respect of the length of time that should be
allowed for, and without any reference to a senior officer? That leaves
aside the practicality of such an operation, which would involve
hundreds of police, blue tape and goodness knows what else.</div>
					<a name="07071038000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have
debated in this and many other Bills the need to limit arbitrary
powers, and I, and many other hon. Members, find it strange that
notwithstanding their good intent their lordships have introduced a
proposal that does something that they most often rail against us for
doing. In many respects, it is a role-reversal; we are saying that the
clause pushes too far and that we cannot just ride roughshod over
subjects&#146; civil liberties.</div>
					<a name="07071038000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">The public want as much as
possible to be done to combat crime, and especially gun crime, but if
people understood the powers that would be given to an individual
police officer in these circumstances the vast majority would not find
it acceptable. I therefore ask the Committee to vote against clause
stand part.</div>
					<a name="07071038000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 78
introduces additional powers for the police to seal off areas to search
for firearms, but there is already sufficient legislation, as the right
hon. and learned Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham said. Section 47
of the Firearms Act 1968 gives the police powers to detain and search,
and a constable may enter any place to exercise those powers. Powers to
stop and search without reasonable suspicion within a specified area
are provided by section 60 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act
1994, but under strict and appropriate safeguards. ACPO has strongly
confirmed that it is fully satisfied with its powers in that respect,
and that it is concerned about the wide and unnecessary extension of
powers provided by the clause. Liberty has also expressed its concerns,
and agrees with our position on the complete lack of safeguards in the
provision, which shows that we do listen to
Liberty.</div>
					<a name="07071038000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under
the proposed power, any constable can decide to seal off an area with
no requirement to inform a senior officer, no indication of the extent
of the area and with no specified time limit. It is a disproportionate
provision, which could affect certain
communities.</div>

Police Constable John Henry who was shot in Luton in my constituency a
few weeks ago, and the work they are doing to bring communities
together? I am aware from the Minister&#146;s remarks that the
provisions could damage community relations in Luton, because they
would be wide open to complaints about abuse by the police should they
be enacted. That is a strong reason why the clause should be
removed.</div>

what she said about PC John Henry and the work that his family are
doing to try to reduce gun crime, and to get something out of that
tragedy by ensuring that such awful events do not take place. My hon.
Friend makes the important point that if we are not careful with
legislation, we damage community relations and contribute to disorder.
We must be careful. Although we want to tackle gun crime, we must
ensure that the legislation that we pass is proportionate.</div>
					<a name="07071038000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">Appropriate,
proportionate, intelligence-led policing such as that conducted by the
Metropolitan police through Operation Trident has proved to be
successful in tackling gun crime. Stigmatising certain communities by
cordoning off areas, which could happen under this clause, as my hon.
Friend pointed out, would not achieve that goal or help to develop
community cohesion. Our view is that the clause is both unnecessary and
potentially harmful. I ask the right hon. and learned Member for
Sleaford and North Hykeham to withdraw his amendments, and I ask hon.
Members to oppose the clause.</div>

							<a name="07071038000466"></a>Mr.
Browne:
						</b> These amendments, taken together, would require
affirmative resolution for the Secretary of State to be able to specify
an anti-fraud organisation, such as the Credit Industry Fraud Avoidance
Scheme, under clause 63. Clause 63 currently allows the Secretary of
State to specify by negative resolution an anti-fraud organisation to
which a public authority may disclose information. In the other place
there was some concern at the arrangements surrounding the Secretary of
State&#146;s ability to designate anti-fraud organisations, and what
the criteria for acceptability would be. As sensitive issues of
privacy, secrecy and security surround these data matching powers, and
the likelihood is that only a handful of organisations will be capable
of appropriately undertaking the task, the change from negative to
affirmative resolution will allow an appropriate level of parliamentary
scrutiny.</div>
					<a name="07071038000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">On Second
Reading in the House of Commons, the Government repeatedly indicated
that they would not wish to have a monopoly of one organisation
processing this data sharing and going forward with this initiative.
Although that is welcome, it should be within the remit of Parliament
to scrutinise and approve other organisations that the Secretary of
State may name. That is why I have tabled amendments  Nos. 12
and 11.</div>
					<a name="07071038000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07071038000467"></a>Mr.
Hogg:
						</b> I rise to support the amendments on the general
basis of parliamentary control. Wherever I see provisions for an order,
I like to see it subject to an affirmative resolution procedure.
Whenever I see that provisions relate to the affirmative resolution
procedure, I say that such measures are not amendable and that they are
therefore bad news. If we have to have such procedures at all, why can
we not have the super-affirmative procedure? That might be going too
far on this occasion, so I back the
amendments.</div>
					<a name="07071038000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07071038000468"></a>James
Brokenshire:
						</b> The hon. Member for Taunton made an
interesting point on the mechanism by which anti-fraud organisations
will be specified. The Minister will be aware that concerns were
expressed about data sharing when we debated chapter 1 of part 3 of the
Bill. It is therefore relevant to consider having a mechanism to ensure
that specified organisations are subject to a greater degree of
scrutiny. Certainly, the positive procedure would appear to be the
appropriate way to provide an element of control. I therefore look
forward to the Minister&#146;s
response.</div>
					<a name="07071038000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07071038000469"></a>Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> The provisions were scrutinised by the Delegated
Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee, which found that the negative
procedure for the specification of anti-fraud organisations represented
an</div>
					<a name="07071038000391"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;appropriate level of
parliamentary scrutiny&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07071038000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">As far as I am aware, the order-making
powers in the Bill conform to that Committee&#146;s
report.</div>
					<a name="07071038000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall resist the amendments, but I should say something about clause 63
to explain why. Clause 63 provides a new legal gateway for those public
authorities that need 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column294" />Column number: 294</div>it to allow them to disclose information to a specified anti-fraud
organisation for the purpose of preventing fraud. The gateway is
necessary because fraudsters do not limit their criminal activities to
either the public or private sector; rather, they are opportunists who
seek to exploit any weaknesses that they can. Enabling public sector
organisations to share information in a clearly-defined and secure
way&#151;namely, through a specified anti-fraud
organisation&#151;will allow the private and public sector to work
together to prevent fraud and associated
losses.</div>
					<a name="07071038000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendments
would change the order-making power for specifying an anti-fraud
organisation from negative to affirmative resolution. The data-sharing
provisions in clauses 63 to 66 were scrutinised by the Delegated Powers
and Regulatory Reform Committee. It found that the negative resolution
for the specification of the anti-fraud organisation or organisations
represented
the</div>
					<a name="07071038000392"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;appropriate level of
parliamentary scrutiny&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07071038000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the Government seek to specify such
bodies, we will ensure that any anti-fraud organisation that
facilitates sharing between public authorities under clause 63 has
appropriate safeguards, not least so that it complies with the relevant
data protection and human rights
legislation.</div>
					<a name="07071038000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
addition, Government new clause 11 will introduce a requirement on the
Secretary of State to produce a code of practice. Public authorities
sharing information through a specified anti-fraud organisation will
have to have regard to the code when using their powers. The
specification process will in part depend on whether a potential
specified anti-fraud organisation operates in compliance with the code.
In short, specified anti-fraud organisations will have to prove that
they are capable of sharing and protecting information in an
appropriate manner.</div>
					<a name="07071038000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">In those circumstances, I
question the need for the specification of anti-fraud organisations to
be subject to affirmative resolution in both Houses of Parliament. That
would be an unnecessary degree of parliamentary oversight&#151;that
view is shared by the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee.
I therefore ask the hon. Member for Taunton to withdraw the
amendment.</div>

					<a name="07071038000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new clause
was suggested by Liberty, so perhaps the Minister will be sympathetic
to it as he now quotes that organisation approvingly in his favour. It
is designed to ensure that data from the national identity register and
the children&#146;s index cannot be used in data matching exercises
under the Bill. Our concern is that allowing data from those sources to
be used will lead to data mining. It is difficult to see the
justification in arguing that that type of information is needed to
detect fraud. On that basis, I put forward the new clause for the
Committee&#146;s
consideration.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07071038000505"></a>James
Brokenshire:
						</b> As the hon. Gentleman has explained, this
provision is intended to prevent data mining. The Minister was keen to
correct me as soon as I used the words data mining, saying that that
was not the intention of the Bill and that it was about data matching
rather than data mining. In the context of the remarks of the hon.
Member for Taunton and the Minister&#146;s clear desire to ensure
that there is no confusion between mining and matching, I look forward
with interest to the Minister&#146;s comments on the new
clause.</div>
					<a name="07071038000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07071038000506"></a>Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> I shall ask, at the end of my remarks, for the
hon. Member for Taunton to ask leave to withdraw the motion. He has
tabled an amendment that would prevent the use of information from the
national identity register and ContactPoint in either the data sharing
provided for in clause 63 or the data-matching exercises provided for
in schedule 7.</div>
					<a name="07071038000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
should like to make a general point about ContactPoint and the national
identity register in relation to the data sharing and data matching
provisions enabled by the Bill. In neither case will the public
authorities responsible for the database or register be compelled to
disclose information from them for the purpose of the prevention and
detection of fraud. Therefore, the owners of the data&#151;the Home
Secretary in respect of the national identity register and the
Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families for
ContactPoint&#151;will retain absolute control over whether they
choose to disclose or
not.</div>
					<a name="07071038000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">The national
identity register will hold identity information relating to everyone
who is issued with an ID card. It is intended eventually to include
everyone who is aged 16 and over and resident in the UK. As my noble
and learned friend Baroness Scotland explained in the other place, the
national identity register will 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column305" />Column number: 305</div>comprise identity information such as name, address, date of birth and
nationality. Although it will include photographs and biometric
information, such as fingerprints, it will not comprise every single
piece of personal data held by Government. That means that it will not
contain criminal, medical or tax
records.</div>
					<a name="07071038000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
possible that, through an order under section 20 of the Identity Cards
Act 2006, information specified in an order and contained in the
national identity register could be supplied to the Audit Commission or
to a specified public authority, but only for purposes also set out in
the order. It should be noted, however, that any order made under
section 20 will be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure,
requiring debate and agreement by both Houses of Parliament. Given the
rigorous procedures that are already built into the 2006 Act, I can see
no reason why we should include in the Bill a prohibition against ever
using data from the national identity register. In the
Government&#146;s view, it would be short-sighted not even to
contemplate the possibility that the national identity register might
help in the prevention and detection of fraud in future, particularly
given that one of the express statutory purposes of that register is
the prevention and detection of
crime.</div>
					<a name="07071038000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">ContactPoint
will be a national online directory that will be available in local
authorities in England by the end of 2008. It will consist of basic
demographic data relating to children and the contact details of those
who provide specialist services to them. ContactPoint has been designed
to facilitate the provision of care and services to children in a
co-ordinated way. Its purpose is expressly linked to the duties on
local authorities and their partners to co-operate in improving the
well-being of children and to safeguard and promote their welfare. The
database will be subject to restricted access, confined to those who
need it in connection with their work with children.</div>
					<a name="07071038000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Children
Act 2004 gives the Secretary of State power to make regulations
governing the disclosure of data to and from ContactPoint. Those
regulations have been laid before Parliament and are subject to the
affirmative resolution procedure. It is difficult to see how the data
contained in ContactPoint would be relevant to the specific task of
assisting in the prevention and detection of fraud. So even if the
Department for Children, Schools and Families took the decision that
data from ContactPoint should be included in data-matching exercises,
the Audit Commission would still need to decide if that was
appropriate. As things stand, the answer would be no. We cannot
envisage circumstances in which ContactPoint would wish to become a
member of a specified anti-fraud organisation under clause 63.
Nevertheless, the Government think that it is unnecessary and perhaps
would be unwise now to rule out once and for all the possibility of
using ContactPoint data in the future for preventing or detecting
fraud. I also made that point in respect of the national identity
register.</div>
					<a name="07071038000403"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.45
am</div>
					<a name="07071038000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">As with the
Identity Cards Act, important policy considerations have been carefully
balanced in the Children Act, resulting in the decision to give the
Secretary of State the task of making regulations, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column306" />Column number: 306</div>subject to the approval of Parliament, which set out the circumstances
in which information from contact points may be disclosed. The
Government would be loath to fetter or undermine in the Serious Crime
Bill the way in which the provisions of the Children Act
operate.</div>
					<a name="07071038000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">I remind the
Committee that, following a Government amendment in the other place,
the Audit Commission will not be able to undertake data matching in
order to profile the propensity of individual adults or children to
commit offences in future. The point was made by a number of Opposition
peers, and the Bill has been changed in order to take into account
their worries. That cannot, therefore, be held out as a reason for
preventing the Audit Commission from accessing contact points or the
national identity register. For those reasons, I would ask the hon.
Member for Taunton to withdraw his amendment. It might be necessary in
future to use the data, but there is nothing compulsory about it and it
would have to be done with the agreement of the appropriate Secretaries
of State.</div>

							<a name="07071038000507"></a>Mr.
Hogg:
						</b> I hope that you will allow me a couple of minutes,
Mr. Benton, to talk about the particulars that will be
recorded on the national identity register. I do not want to go far
outside the scope of the debate, but perhaps you will allow me three
sentences that might do that. I have always been surprised that we have
not been prepared to consider a DNA database. Having worked in the
criminal law for many years, and been in the Home Office when DNA first
came on stream, I have always thought that a national database for DNA
would be the single most effective instrument for the prevention and
detection of crime. While I recognise that there are considerable civil
liberties issues to address, all parties should consider a DNA national
database. We need to debate that; it would be much more effective than
the identity card.</div>

certain protections and assurances by virtue of this and other new
clauses that we that we would like to add to the Bill. New clause 5
imposes a requirement for serious crime prevention orders to be
recorded on a central register and for any order made to vary or
discharge such orders also to be recorded on that register. We believe
that that would be sensible, given the wide-ranging powers that the
Government seek to take in relation to the Bill.</div>
					<a name="07071038000269"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Committee will be aware of
the reservations that have been expressed by various hon. Members about
the serious crime prevention orders. We need to ensure that a clear
record is kept of how many of these orders are issued, given that only
around 30 of them are expected to be allowed each year. We also need to
monitor closely who is receiving the orders and what restrictions and
terms are being imposed as a
consequence.</div>
					<a name="07071038000270"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I have
said, concerns have been expressed about the practicalities of what
will happen if the orders are passed into law. Effective measures need
to be in place to ensure that the Bill is not applied in a way that
might subvert the criminal justice system. The Minister clearly said
that the Bill is intended to be about protection, not prosecution. In
other words, serious crime prevention orders are not intended to be an
alternative prosecution system. In that context there needs to be a
process to record and therefore to review how many orders are being
given and on what terms. The best way to do that is to ensure that the
orders are recorded in one place and so are readily available for that
review and examination. On that basis I hope that the Committee will be
minded to consider new clause 5
favourably.</div>

						</b> May I thank the hon. Member for Hornchurch and his

will need to be a central record of appropriate information in relation
to their use, especially for co-ordination between different branches
of law enforcement and the different applicant authorities. In order

							<a name="07071038000524"></a>James
Brokenshire:
						</b> I beg to move, That the clause be read a
Second time.</div>
					<a name="07071038000279"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the
light of the Minister&#146;s helpful comments on new clause 5, I hope
that he will be as favourable to new clause 6, which relates to the
review of serious crime prevention orders. The new clause would provide
for an annual review of the orders. It is important that the mechanism
exists to ensure that the orders are used proportionately and to
provide reassurance that they will not become some sort of automatic
substitution mechanism to bring prosecutions before the court in a
different manner.</div>
					<a name="07071038000280"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister said that only a small number of orders&#151;about
30&#151;are expected each year. The new clause would allow the annual
review of the number of orders to be independent. We have heard some
significant, passionate concerns about what serious crime prevention
orders will mean in the context of the criminal justice system. If the
orders are to exist, they must be used in a way that promotes
co-ordination between all law enforcement agencies, to provide the
protection that the Minister said he intends to be part and parcel of
the measures.</div>
					<a name="07071038000281"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
important to have a 12-monthly review, so that we can regularly examine
the operation of the orders. It is easy in the Committee to look at the
drafting of the Bill and say that the orders will be applied in a
particular way. We are concerned about their practical operation and
application, however. To provide reassurance as these matters proceed,
it is therefore important to have such protection and to ensure that an
independent reviewer is able to conduct analysis of the operation of
the serious crime prevention orders, with regard to the desirability of
minimising their use except where they are necessary to protect the
public by preventing, restricting or disrupting involvement in serious
crime in circumstances where prosecutions cannot be pursued. The
Minister has said that that is the intention of the serious crime
prevention orders. If that is the case, what can be wrong with an
independent mechanism to ensure that that is what happens in practice?
I hope that the Minister will consider the new clause favourably and,
perhaps,
kindly.</div>
					<a name="07071038000282"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07071038000525"></a>Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> I advise the hon. Gentleman not to get too carried
away. The powers under the Bill will be exercised by the High Court. To
say that it needs an independent reviewer to review its actions is
inappropriate. I am more than confident in the ability of our senior
judiciary to act appropriately. I also think that the amendment is
unnecessary.</div>
				
					<a name="07071038000404"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12
noon</div>
					<a name="07071038000283"></a><div class="hs_Para">The purpose
of such a reviewer, presumably, would be to ensure that the orders were
being used in a way that was compatible with overriding imperatives,
such as the European convention on human rights. I have full confidence
that the High Court would always seek to act in such a way, and if the
subject felt that it had not, there is already a perfectly suitable
process for review of the decision: appeal to the Court of Appeal,
followed by the House of Lords.</div>
					<a name="07071038000284"></a><div class="hs_Para">In addition,
we have stated clearly several times that the orders will not be used
as an alternative to prosecution&#151;a suggestion alluded to in new
clause 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column310" />Column number: 310</div>6(2). To underline that commitment, I point out that in no way can it be
argued that the orders will be easy to obtain. Earlier in our
deliberations, we went through, at some length, the various tests that
are necessary before the High Court can make someone the subject of a
serious crime prevention order. That is just as it should be, and it
will mean that law enforcement bodies cannot use the orders as an easy
alternative to prosecution. I ask the Committee not to support the
creation of an expensive review process that would achieve nothing that
the Bill and the existing judicial processes do not already
achieve.</div>
					<a name="07071038000285"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although I do
not support the notion of an expensive review of the orders that would
achieve nothing that is not already provided for, we might consider
before Report whether there is a way of combining the recording of
information, which I have said that we will do, with some sort of
reports deriving from that. I am not committing to doing that, but I am
happy to consider doing so and to offer a commitment to return to this
issue on
Report.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07071038000526"></a>James
Brokenshire:
						</b> I hear what the Minister says, but I think
that, in many ways, he has missed the point. The new clause is not
about questioning whether the judiciary would act appropriately or
inappropriately; they will interpret the Bill as it is stated. The
point is that there is some element of doubt about how the Bill could
be interpreted, which means that they could go off in a different
direction&#151;hence the extensive debates that we have had on
various aspects of the serious crime prevention orders.</div>
					<a name="07071038000287"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister also talked about
the ease with which the orders will be obtained. We have had
considerable debate on the burden and standard of proof that will be
applied in relation to the orders, on whether there will be one test,
and on where on the sliding scale such cases will be. That is clearly a
matter for judicial interpretation and judgment, but it could be that
the characteristics of the orders are slightly different from the way
that they are expressed in the Bill. That is how the law emerges and
develops. It has nothing to do with the appropriateness of the
judiciary&#146;s actions&#151;they would be doing their job and
interpreting the statute before us.</div>
					<a name="07071038000288"></a><div class="hs_Para">The point is that an
independent review would ensure that the expressions of general intent
were applied, and that we would proceed with that safeguard if it was
possible to obtain a criminal prosecution. Any movement towards using
the serious crime prevention orders in a way that detracts from the
criminal justice process should be clearly understood and reported to
Parliament as part of the review process proposed in new clause 6. On
that basis, I am not satisfied by what the Minister has said and I
would therefore like to test the Committee&#146;s opinion of new
clause 6.</div>

					<a name="07071038000308"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clause 7 is a further protection that we seek regarding the operation
of serious crime prevention orders. Under it, part 1 of the Bill, once
enacted, would subject to annual renewal by order. This is a
wide-ranging provision that could be quite significant, given the
restrictions on the orders that may be placed. That may or may not be
appropriate, but if this power is to be taken, there should be an
obligation on Parliament to consider the operation of such orders, for
the reasons that I gave in relation to new clauses 5 and 6.</div>
					<a name="07071038000309"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not intend to repeat what
I said about new clauses 5 and 6. However, new clause 7 would give a
great deal of assurance regarding the various concerns expressed in the
other place, outside the House and in this Committee. It would also
give a positive role to Parliament in applying a robust examination of
the operation of these orders, and provide an element of scrutiny of
the manner in which serious crime prevention orders are being
undertaken. One would have thought that that might find favour with the
Prime Minister, given his views on strengthening the role of Parliament
and on the functions of the Executive.</div>
					<a name="07071038000310"></a><div class="hs_Para">I urge the Committee to
consider new clause 7 carefully. If the concerns expressed in this
place and elsewhere regarding the manner in which the serious crime
prevention orders operate prove to be the stronger argument, it would
provide an additional protection and a mechanism for ensuring that
changes can be made if
required.</div>

points that the hon. Member for Hornchurch 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column312" />Column number: 312</div>and his hon. Friends have made. There is clearly a difference of view on
this new clause, and I do not want to repeat the arguments that I made
regarding the last new clause&#151;arguments that the hon. Gentleman
found so unpersuasive, although many of the same points could indeed be
made. Processes are in place regarding the operation of the judiciary,
and although the hon. Gentleman does not agree, they provide the
safeguard that he is seeking. Our view is that these orders will help
law enforcement and prevent harm caused to communities by serious
criminals. We believe that the safeguards, both legislative and
procedural, provided by these orders are quite considerable. It is not
appropriate to keep asking Parliament to reaffirm the House&#146;s
commitment to preventing, through the measures in the Bill, the harm
caused by serious crime. I therefore ask the Committee to resist the
new clause if the hon. Gentleman presses it to a

might go much further and tread on the remit of the criminal justice

							<a name="07071038000558"></a>Mr.
Hogg:
						</b> This is the last occasion that I rise to my feet in
this debate. Therefore, may I begin by thanking you, Mr.
Benton, for the way that you have chaired this Committee, and may I,
through you, thank Mr. Bercow, who has also been a very good
Chairman of this Committee? I also thank the Public Bill Office for the
assistance that I have received. As you will have seen, Mr.
Benton, I have drafted a huge number of amendments. The fact that they
were in order and comprehensible owes a great deal to the Public Bill
Office, to which I am very grateful.</div>
					<a name="07071038000334"></a><div class="hs_Para">I thank the two Ministers
present&#151;and the former Minister with responsibility for such
matters, the hon. Member for Bradford, South (Mr.
Sutcliffe)&#151;for the courteous way in which they have responded.
They know that there is a lot of this Bill that I do not agree with, in
particular part 1. I shall be voting against it on Third Reading for
that reason, whatever my right hon. and hon. Friends do. May I also
thank my hon. Friends? It is always a pleasure to work with colleagues.
We do not always agree, but I always enjoy working with my hon.
Friends.</div>
					<a name="07071038000335"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having said
all that, I shall come to new clause 10. I am bound to say that I am
about to make the most boring speech that you have probably heard in
this Committee, Mr. Benton. The only thing that I would say
in its defence is that it will be brief, but dull it is&#151;dull and
technical.</div>
					<a name="07071038000336"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would
like to make some preliminary points as I approach the task of
addressing new clause 10. First, I do not expect the Minister to accept
what I have drafted, nor indeed do I intend to put the new clause or
the amendment to the vote. My purpose is simply to point out that we
have put into legislation measures capable of causing injustice, and to
point out that the fact that the injustice is being done to those who
are proven criminals in no sense prevents it from being an injustice.
One can do injustice to criminals, and we need to keep that well in
mind. The problem, of course, is that one often closes one&#146;s
mind to that injustice, because the people involved are proven
criminals.</div>
					<a name="07071038000337"></a><div class="hs_Para">My purpose
in moving the new clause is to interest the Home Office&#151;or is it
now the Ministry of Justice?&#151;in what I believe to be an
injustice, and also perhaps to get the Law Commission, in time, to
examine this matter. My interest in this issue was stimulated by a
professional case that I was involved with just a few weeks ago. I do
not expect members of this Committee to be familiar with the relevant 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column314" />Column number: 314</div>legislation. I make no complaint about that&#151;nor was I, until I
became involved in that case.</div>
					<a name="07071038000338"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will briefly tell the
Committee the facts of the case, which are necessary for the
understanding of the new clause. I was involved in the case on behalf
of a police officer who, rather surprisingly, was allowed to work
part-time as an estate agent. I am bound to say that I find that quite
remarkable. He did so with the authority of the Metropolitan police
commission. He was working two days a week as a detective and the rest
of the time he was an estate agent&#151;very rum indeed. He was an
estate agent who owned a lot of property, in respect of which he
received a great deal of rent, most of it in cash. So this was a very
surprising situation indeed.</div>
					<a name="07071038000339"></a><div class="hs_Para">In any event, he was convicted,
on his own plea, of mortgage frauds, in respect of which he had gained
some &#163;70,000. The offences were committed over about 12 months,
there were six relevant counts, and the conviction was on a plea of
guilty. My client was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of about
three years. I emphasise that the term of imprisonment was the
punishment. It should be distinguished in kind from confiscation, which
is intended to be not punishment but the removal of ill-gotten gains.
It is important to keep it in mind that confiscation is not intended to
be an additional
penalty.</div>
				
					<a name="07071038000405"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.15
pm</div>
					<a name="07071038000340"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to focus
on the confiscation proceedings, which are the subject of the new
clause. The net worth of the officer after conviction was about
&#163;500,000, once account had been taken of his debts, particularly
mortgage debts; because of the Proceeds of Crime  Act 2002, it
is very likely that although his benefit from the fraud was
&#163;70,000, he will be ordered to forfeit all his net worth. In
other words, following a conviction for an offence in which he obtained
&#163;70,000, the probability is that he will lose all his net worth
of &#163;500,000. The confiscation proceedings have not yet been
dealt with, but that is the likely outcome. That is the result of the
legislation, which is very complex.</div>
					<a name="07071038000341"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are lots of ifs, buts and
provisos, but for simplicity and brevity I will touch on just a few
bits of the relevant legislation, the 2002 Act, which was modelled on
the preceding drug trafficking legislation. Incidentally, I think the
criteria used ought to be different but in many respects they are the
same.</div>
					<a name="07071038000342"></a><div class="hs_Para">A court must
make a confiscation order when a person is convicted of an offence and
the court is satisfied that the defendant has a criminal lifestyle.
That is the effect of section 6 of the 2002 Act. To start with, the
court has to determine the benefit that the defendant has gained from
his criminal lifestyle and a process is embarked upon. It means, in
effect, that the value of all the benefits that the defendant has
received over a period of six years is to be deemed as benefit except
to the extent that he can show that he has obtained them honestly. One
takes an overall figure of the total benefit that he has received
during the relevant six-year period, discounts those that he can show
he has come by honestly, and the benefit that is left is regarded as
the relevant amount. If the defendant has net assets that are the same
or less than the benefits, he will be deemed to forfeit the
lot.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column315" />Column number: 315</div>
					<a name="07071038000343"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are two reasons to fear
the injustice. First, one asks rhetorically what is a criminal
lifestyle, a definition of which is to be found in section 75 of the
2002 Act. It is not the only criterion, but it includes the following:
if in one set of proceedings the defendant was convicted of three or
more offences from which he has benefited or, alternatively or
additionally, if over a relevant six years he has been convicted on at
least two separate occasions of an offence from which he has benefited.
If either of those two situations applies, he is deemed to have had a
criminal lifestyle and the confiscation procedure grinds into
operation.</div>
					<a name="07071038000344"></a><div class="hs_Para">The court
will then examine the defendant&#146;s financial dealings over the
previous six years and he will be deemed to have benefited from all the
revenue and benefits that he has received over that period except those
that he can show he came by legitimately. If his net worth is the same
or less than the deemed benefit, the entire net worth will be
forfeited.</div>
					<a name="07071038000345"></a><div class="hs_Para">The injustice
arises in the following respects. First, the presumptions arise on a
very inadequate basis. In my client&#146;s case, they arose from the
fact that on a plea of guilty he was convicted of more than three
offences committed over a l2-month period. That was sufficient to
establish a criminal lifestyle. His gain from those offences was valued
at about &#163;70,000. However, because of the deeming provisions of
the 2002 Act, the value of the benefits, assessed over a six-year
period, was over &#163;1 million, which he could not immediately
explain. Because the net worth of the benefits is some &#163;500,000,
he is liable to lose the lot. It is not right that the presumption
should come into play on such a fragile basis. Three offences over a
12-month period should not give rise to a rebuttable presumption that
his income over six years was gained from illegal activity, nor, in
such circumstances, should the court be able to oblige him to forfeit a
sum that is substantially in excess of the proven gain from the
offences for which he was convicted. Also, as a matter of natural
justice, the process should not be triggered by a conviction for three
or more offences on one indictment, when the defendant in question has
no previous conviction that would have put him on notice as to the risk
of confiscation. My new clause takes express notice of
that.</div>
					<a name="07071038000346"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those of us who
are on pay-as-you-earn&#151;all of us here are&#151;or who are in
receipt of regular dividend income, or who have to account to the
Revenue for the value added tax on all fees received, as I do as a
part-time barrister, have no great difficulty in establishing the
sources of our income and we have relevant documents to prove it.
However, we will see that another potential cause of injustice arises
if we put ourselves in the position of someone in the cash economy. The
cash economy can involve income either on a large or a small scale;
that person could be a plumber&#151;that might be on a large scale
these days, but historically speaking it has been fairly
modest&#151;or it could be someone like my client, who was receiving
enormous sums of money in rent from tenants. Within the cash economy,
it is quite difficult to prove sources of income comprehensively and
satisfactorily to the court, with the burden of proof resting on the
defendant. Therefore, while I suspect that my client&#146;s sources
of income were in many respects lawful, he will be hard pushed to show
that they are so. As a result, he 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column316" />Column number: 316</div>will find that the court confiscates much more than it should, as a
consequence of the legislation that we have put in
place.</div>
					<a name="07071038000347"></a><div class="hs_Para">I acknowledge
that my client is a proven criminal; I do not doubt that for a moment.
He pleaded guilty and there may be other crimes to his name, for all I
know. I also accept that he was not prepared to pay tax that he ought
to have paid, and that is another factor that no doubt comes into play.
However, I have the strong impression that, because of the way we have
framed the legislation, and in particular because we have used the
model of the Drug Trafficking Act 1994 to catch many other offences,
including mortgage fraud, we will require people to pay much more by
way of confiscation than is proper, and certainly much more than the
benefit that they have received from their unlawful
activity.</div>
					<a name="07071038000348"></a><div class="hs_Para">I return to
my original point, that confiscation is not intended to be an
additional penalty; it is intended only to remove ill-gotten gains.
That is in part to protect the public, and also because it offends the
public that criminals should retain their ill-gotten gains. We are at
risk of doing much more than removing those gains, however. The purpose
of the new clause and the amendment is to highlight that point, and to
try to get some sensible argument and discussion of whether we have
gone too far. In other words, it is to stimulate debate. I would be
quite content if it has that effect. I am not seeking actually to
change the law on this occasion and I shall not, for these purposes, be
pressing the new
clause.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07071038000559"></a>James
Brokenshire:
						</b> I rise briefly to thank and to pay tribute to
the work of my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Sleaford
and North Hykeham, in relation not only to the new clause, but to the
other amendments that he has brought forward during the Committee
debates, and to his contributions in support of the arguments that we
have advanced. He has made an interesting, well-considered point that
was well argued and well explained, as one would have expected based on
his contributions throughout. He raises an interesting point, designed,
as he says, to provoke debate. He has certainly done that today in
highlighting this issue and moving this new clause. We shall see how
the matter progresses, and I shall note with interest the
Minister&#146;s response to his detailed legal arguments and the way
in which he set them out.</div>
					<a name="07071038000350"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07071038000560"></a>Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> I start by thanking the right hon. and learned
Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham for the measured way in which he
put forward his new clause, and for the important issues that he
raised.</div>
					<a name="07071038000351"></a><div class="hs_Para">The point
about trying to stimulate debate on some of the issues is important.
From what I have seen, both in power and in opposition in various
guises on councils, one might stimulate debate and a year or two or
three later, lo and behold, somebody somewhere takes notice. Victory is
not immediate, but it does sometimes arrive.</div>
					<a name="07071038000352"></a><div class="hs_Para">In its four
years of operation, the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 has resulted in the
recovery of a considerable amount of criminal wealth. A record
&#163;125 million was recovered in the past financial year. That
represents a substantial year-on-year increase and a fivefold increase 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column317" />Column number: 317</div>over the previous five years. That is a significant success, but we do
not want to rest on our laurels. We want to double the annual recovery
to &#163;250 million by 2010. Confiscation following criminal
conviction is a core part of our efforts to deprive criminals of their
ill-gotten gains. The new clause, as the right hon. and learned
Gentleman points out, seeks to dilute the provisions that provide
important tools to ensure that that occurs.</div>
					<a name="07071038000353"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under the
2002 Act, a court assumes that a defendant who has a criminal lifestyle
funds his entire wealth by crime. Consequently, the value of the
defendant&#146;s assets is available to be reckoned into a
confiscation order. The alternative is for only the direct gain from
the offence of which the defendant was convicted to be available for
confiscation. As the right hon. and learned Gentleman pointed out,
criminal lifestyle is defined in several different ways. Some
defendants are found guilty of specific offences, such as people
trafficking and money laundering. Other criteria, based on the number
and pattern of prosecutions, tend to show that a defendant is a career
criminal.</div>
					<a name="07071038000354"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new
clause would amend the qualifying criteria. It provides that an offence
needs to have occurred over three years rather than six months. It
would also alter the test for deciding whether a person has engaged in
conduct that forms part of a course of criminal activity defined in
section 75(3)(a) of the 2002 Act. First, the conviction of three or
more other offences would have to have occurred prior to the
proceedings on which a confiscation order was
considered.</div>
					<a name="07071038000355"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07071038000561"></a>Mr.
Hogg:
						</b> May I just explain the reason for that? If the
Minister looks at the mandatory penalties for burglars, he will find
that there has to be a prior conviction that puts the burglar on notice
before the mandatory offence comes into play. That is the sort of
thinking that has informed the amendment.</div>
					<a name="07071038000356"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07071038000562"></a>Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> I thank the right hon. and learned Gentleman for
his further helpful clarification of his point.</div>
					<a name="07071038000357"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, at least one of the
offences would have to have been committed in the period between 24
March 2003 and the date on which the offence giving rise to the
confiscation order was committed. There is also an existing safeguard
in that the criminal lifestyle test is met only if, in addition to
meeting the tests that I have set out, the defendant has benefited to a
certain monetary value. The new clause seeks to raise the threshold
from &#163;5,000 to &#163;20,000.</div>
					<a name="07071038000358"></a><div class="hs_Para">Experience of the operation of
the 2002 Act is that although the criminal lifestyle provisions have
been in force for four years, there has been no opposition to their
operation. Similar provisions operated in previous confiscation
legislation. The operation of the provisions has not, to our knowledge,
been challenged in the
courts.</div>
					<a name="07071038000359"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am convinced
that the tests set out are already high enough, and that only a career
criminal could qualify as having a criminal lifestyle. It is also
significant that even if a defendant was deemed to have such a
lifestyle, he would have the opportunity to show the court evidence
that his assets and property were not the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column318" />Column number: 318</div>proceeds of crime. They would then not be subject to confiscation.
Furthermore, the courts have discretion on whether to include the value
of assets if there is a serious risk of
injustice.</div>
					<a name="07071038000406"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.30
pm</div>
					<a name="07071038000360"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
draw the attention of the right hon. and learned Gentleman and the
Committee to section 10(6) of the 2002 Act, which specifically states
that the court can ignore the value of assets if it believes that not
doing so could result in a serious injustice. It is also significant
that the courts are bound by the Human Rights Act to dispose of their
duties in a way that complies with the defendant&#146;s rights under
the European convention of human rights. Again, I am unaware of any
human rights challenges having been brought under that
provision.</div>
					<a name="07071038000361"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
benefit figure of &#163;5,000 is significant enough to catch career
criminals. I am confident that the concept of the criminal lifestyle
and the operation of those provisions in court are not draconian.
However, I am grateful to the right hon. and learned Gentleman for the
new clause, as it causes us to think again and to justify the
legislation continually. He said that he would not press the new
clause, but I am grateful to him for giving me the opportunity to reply
to the debate.</div>
					<a name="07071038000362"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07071038000563"></a>Mr.
Hogg:
						</b> I am grateful to the Minister for his reply. I would
be grateful if it caused his officials to ponder&#151;and perhaps to
take account of the views of the judges.</div>
					<a name="07071038000363"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall make two points. First,
on career criminals, I do not think the Minister is right. In the end,
it comes down to definitions. In my client&#146;s case, the offences
covered 12 months or thereabouts, and although there were a number of
counts there was only one indictment. I would be inclined not to regard
a person who committed offences over a 12-month period as a career
criminal. I would take a different view if we were dealing with a man
who had committed offences over two, three or four years. That would be
different, but my case dealt with a range of offences, quite narrow in
compass, within a certain time frame. One needs to consider whether the
provision catches people who are not career criminals. That is my
view.</div>
					<a name="07071038000364"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly&#151;it
is a small point about section 10(6) of the 2002 Act&#151;there is a
settled authority on the matter. The courts are not entitled to
disregard the process, or indeed the sums, simply on the basis that is
unfair. Once they have embarked upon the process, it has to grind
through. They cannot simply say that the overall effect is unfair and
not do anything.</div>
					<a name="07071038000365"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that we will give further thought to the matter. I recognise that
people like my client are not the immediate source of compassion or
sympathy. We are dealing with proven criminals. However, injustice can
be done even to proven criminals and it is the business of this House
to try not to do so. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
motion.</div>

Coaker:
						</b> May I take the opportunity to thank you,
Mr. Benton, and your co-Chairman, Mr. Bercow, for
conducting our proceedings in a way that has shown Parliament in a good
light? The debate has been important and of generally a high quality.
Although this is an area in which people feel passionately and
strongly, the debate has been conducted in a reasonable manner. You,
Mr. Benton, and your co-Chair have helped in that.</div>
					<a name="07071038000373"></a><div class="hs_Para">May I take the opportunity to
thank all the officers in the House, and the Clerk in particular? Given
the speed with which we race through the amendments, it is astonishing
that anyone can lay it out in way that keeps us in order. Therefore,
may I thank all the officers in their different guises who have
contributed to the Committee?</div>
					<a name="07071038000374"></a><div class="hs_Para">May I also thank my own
officials? A number of them have helped me enormously and I would like
to place on the record my thanks to all of them and to the outside
organisations that have contributed to our
deliberations.</div>
					<a name="07071038000375"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would
also like to thank members of the Committee, including the Whip, the
Lord Commissioner of Her Majesty's Treasury, my hon. Friend the Member
for Tynemouth; the Under-Secretary of State for Justice, my hon. Friend
the Member for Liverpool, Garston, who came late to the Bill but whose
mastery of part 2 was something for us all to hear; the Under-Secretary
of State for Culture, Media and Sport, my hon. Friend the Member for
Bradford, South (Mr. Sutcliffe), who was on the Committee
before; and all my hon. Friends for staying the course and being a part
of this Committee.</div>
					<a name="07071038000376"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
also thank the hon. Members for Taunton and for North Cornwall for
their contributions, the hon. Member for Hornchurch for his
constructive and thoughtful contributions to the debate, and the hon.
Member for Arundel and South Downs (Nick Herbert) before that. As I
said at the start, although there were obvious disagreements between us
all, the hon. Member for Hornchurch expressed his opinions in a
forthright and forceful way, with both conviction and passion. He is a
great credit to his party.</div>
					<a name="07071038000377"></a><div class="hs_Para">It would be wrong of me to
conclude without thanking the right hon. and learned Member for
Sleaford and North Hykeham, who has helped me to develop a knowledge of
the law that I never would have thought possible. I understand the term
is pupil barrister. The pupil part may be right, but I am not so sure
about the barrister. He has shown how important parliamentary scrutiny
is to a Bill. A good level of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column320" />Column number: 320</div>scrutiny from both the Opposition and the Government leads to an
improved Bill.</div>

that is left for me to say is that I have enjoyed the experience
immensely and would like to thank everyone whom I have not thanked. It
is a bit like being at a wedding and worrying that someone has been
left out. Therefore, if I have left anyone out, may I thank them as
well?</div>

Brokenshire:
						</b> May I thank you, Mr. Benton, for
your chairmanship of the Committee? Will you also pass on my thanks to
Mr. Bercow? You have both chaired the sittings in a
well-judged, even-handed and good-humoured way. May I also pass on my
thanks to the Clerk, and the Clerks in the Public Bill Office for
dealing with the range of amendments that we have had before us, and
the Hansard Reporters for taking down all of the technical and case
details and legalistic
arguments.</div>
					<a name="07071038000380"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also
thank the police and the Doorkeepers for maintaining our safety and
security during our deliberations, and the Under-Secretary of State for
the Home Department, the hon. Member for Gedling, his colleagues and
the Bill team and other officials for the manner in which they
responded to our inquiries and questions. We might not have got all our
desired responses in relation to the Bill, but I wish to record my
thanks for the manner in which they responded to the points that we
raised.</div>
					<a name="07071038000381"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have made
some progress on the Bill, although not as much as we would have liked.
Considerable uncertainties remain, particularly about the scope, ambit
and likely impact of serious crime prevention orders. The Minister has
frequently said that they are not intended to apply where prosecution
could be brought, but that remains to be tested. We are concerned,
because some of the safeguards that we wished to include were not taken
forward. Issues of data sharing and data matching remain to be
considered. In the context of the Privy Council review on terrorism, we
need to examine carefully the Government&#146;s deletion of the
provisions on intercept evidence. Similarly, we will reflect on the
discussions on gun crime that took place in this morning&#146;s
sitting.</div>
					<a name="07071038000382"></a><div class="hs_Para">I thank my
right hon. and hon. Friends for their learned, informed and considered
contributions, which have added to the Committee. They have raised a
number of important issues, on which I am sure that the Government will
reflect as the Bill continues its progress through the House. I thank
my Whip, the hon. Member for Reigate, in his absence for his helpful
support and assistance and for the cheerful manner of his response to
certain points about the work of Whips that have been made in the
Committee.</div>
					<a name="07071038000383"></a><div class="hs_Para">This has
been a thoughtful Committee and a number of serious, relevant points
have been made. I trust that the Minister will reflect on our
deliberations and table amendments to address those matters when the
Bill returns to the Floor of the House. We shall await developments
with interest, in anticipation of a positive response that will address
the points that have been highlighted during the Committee&#146;s
deliberations. Ultimately, we need to ensure that the public are
protected effectively from serious criminals who are intent on harming
them, their livelihoods and their way of
life.</div>
