							<b class="B">Mr.
David Laws</b> (Yeovil) (LD): Good morning to you,
Mr. Bercow, and to the rest of the Committee. In your case,
welcome back to the
Chair.</div>
					<a name="08022014000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">At the end of
the last sitting, as you indicated, Mr. Bercow, we came on
to an important part of the Bill dealing with the information that must
be provided to local authorities by a variety of organisations, with 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column474" />Column number: 474</div>some of the information to be provided within local authorities from one
department to another. The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and
Littlehampton raised some legitimate concerns regarding the
Bill&#146;s rather sweeping powers to require information to be
passed over. I shall be surprised if we do not return to some of those
specific matters, not only in the course of our discussions this
morning, but in another
place.</div>
					<a name="08022014000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman was kind enough to indicate that he supports amendment No.
170, tabled by me and my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, West,
which would have the effect of requiring the information passed by
institutions in respect of their pupils or students to a local
authority to be</div>
					<a name="08022014000367"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;relevant to assessing their
educational and support needs.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08022014000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">The fact that the amendment is necessary
highlights the sweeping nature of the powers that the clause appears to
attempt to take. It allows an institution to pass over information of a
broad nature about young
people&#151;<i class="I">[</i>
						<i class="I">Interruption.</i>
						<i class="I">]</i> I am happy to give
way to the Minister if he wishes to correct anything that I have
said.</div>
					<a name="08022014000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause is
widely framed, and when one considers the type of information that
educational institutions often collect and the difficult nature of
their job in dealing with some young people, there is a fear that some
of the information passed over may not be appropriate in the light of
the powers in the
Bill.</div>
					<a name="08022014000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022014000441"></a>The
Minister for Schools and Learners (Jim Knight):
						</b> The hon.
Gentleman says that the powers are sweeping. To help him and the rest
of the Committee, I point out that subsection (3)(a) and (b) specifies
which information would be transferred automatically. Any other
information beyond that basic level would be transferred only with
consent.</div>
					<a name="08022014000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022014000442"></a>Mr.
Laws:
						</b> The Minister is right that questions of consent are
involved. I do not want to return to the debate we had in our last
sitting and the points raised by the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and
Littlehampton, but he rightly asked whether young people and their
parents would be in a position to exercise the right to opt out;
whether they would be aware of all the information kept; and whether
they would be notified in a reliable way before the information changed
hands.</div>
					<a name="08022014000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022014000443"></a>Jim
Knight:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman used the phrase &#147;opt
out&#148;. I will assist the Committee by pointing to subsection (4)
which sets out the position
if</div>
					<a name="08022014000032"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a parent of the pupil
or student concerned...has instructed the responsible person not
to provide
information&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08022014000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022014000444"></a>Mr.
Laws:
						</b> Yes, as the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and
Littlehampton said from a sedentary position, that is opting out. It is
not opting in, which is the thrust of the Conservative amendments. The
amendments tabled by the hon. Gentleman would have a different effect
from ours, although they deal with the same concerns. He has drawn
attention to the fact that the end of subsection (4) is rather vague on
how those responsibilities will be carried out. It states that the
information held by the institution about a pupil or student can be
handed over to the local authority unless the pupil or the parent of a
pupil below the age 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column475" />Column number: 475</div>of 16 has instructed the responsible person not to provide such
information. As I understand it, that leaves open the questions of how
young people or their parents might find out that that information will
be passed over, precisely what checks and information would have to be
available to them first, and whether they would have a right to correct
the information and see all of it.</div>
					<a name="08022014000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those are legitimate concerns,
because there might be cases involving, for example, child abuse where
very sensitive information is kept by schools. I can think of cases in
my constituency where imparting such information not only to an outside
body, but sometimes to the parent in a case where the child has given
the information in confidence, might be an extremely sensitive matter,
and the Bill as it stands does not clarify what the checks and balances
will be to enable that opt-out to be exercised in
practice.</div>
					<a name="08022014000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022014000445"></a>Jim
Knight:
						</b> I apologise. The hon. Gentleman is right that the
Bill, as currently written, reads as if there would be an opt-out, but
it has to be read in conjunction with the data protection legislation,
which requires active consent for that sort of information to be passed
on.</div>
					<a name="08022014000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022014000446"></a>Mr.
Laws:
						</b> I am grateful to the Minister for that
clarification. No doubt, he will set out the position as the Government
see it when he responds to the amendments. We certainly want to ensure
that those checks and balances are effective. We want to know how that
process will operate and whether data held that might be inaccurate
could be corrected, as the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and
Littlehampton suggested.</div>
					<a name="08022014000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">We certainly want to know what
objections the Minister has to amendment No. 170, which would attach to
the end of subsection (3)(c) the proviso that the information that is
handed over should be</div>
					<a name="08022014000368"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;relevant to assessing educational
and support needs.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08022014000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
the amendment was accepted, subsection (3)(c) would still be fairly
widely framed, but it would be narrower than in its present form, which
would effectively allow any information held by the school to be handed
over.</div>
					<a name="08022014000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">I put it to the
Minister that although the bulk of the information held by educational
institutions about their pupils and students is likely to be relevant
to their education and training needs, it is also quite possible that
there might be some sensitive information held that pupils, parents and
others might not want passed over. I hope to hear what the Minister
will do to ensure that the information that is handed over is relevant
only to educational and support needs, rather than being
open-ended.</div>
					<a name="08022014000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">My second
point relates to amendment No. 171, which I wish to mention in passing.
There is a slight difference between the thrust of the amendments
tabled by the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton and
amendments Nos. 170 and 171 taken together. My understanding is that
the Conservatives&#146; approach is essentially that there should be
opt-ins, that people should have the ability to correct information
that is inaccurate, and that there should be consent to information
being passed over. Our 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column476" />Column number: 476</div>approach is that the information that is passed over must be relevant to
educational and support needs, but when we come to amendment No. 171 we
will consider whether there needs to be consent to the information
being passed over, or whether there is some information that local
authorities, in the exercise of their responsibilities, should have
access to if it is relevant to the educational and support needs that
they are seeking to maintain. We will come to that point when debating
amendment No.
171.</div>
					<a name="08022014000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022014000447"></a>Jim
Knight:
						</b> I, too, am delighted to be back, refreshed after a
week&#146;s sojourn. I hope that the Committee will be sharp and
businesslike&#151;both of which are adjectives that describe your
chairmanship, Mr. Bercow, which we continue to
enjoy.</div>
					<a name="08022014000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will address
the issues that the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton
raised when we last met and those that were just raised by the hon.
Member for Yeovil. I will also explain more widely how the Connexions
service works in practice and why that work is so vital to our shared
aim of assisting young people to engage in appropriate education and
training. I hope that setting that out for the Committee now will
enable us to avoid going over these issues in such detail when debating
later clauses. I apologise for speaking at some length, Mr.
Bercow, but I assure you that this is an attempt to save
time&#151;perhaps &#147;invest to save&#148; would be a good
phrase.</div>
					<a name="08022014000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">To be able to
provide young people with support that is timely and appropriate to
their needs, local authorities and Connexions need first to know who
the young people are, how to contact them, and what education and
training they are engaged in and where. It is also helpful to know what
their needs and interests are so that they can be provided with
appropriate, personalised advice and guidance. That will inform the
planning of
provision.</div>
					<a name="08022014000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">When a
young person drops out and a provider has not been able to prevent it
or re-engage them, the provider will let Connexions know, as set out
in  clause 13. Guidance professionals will get in touch with
the young person immediately and help them to find an alternative place
and resolve any problems. That is key to the considerable work that is
being done across the country to drive up participation, to deliver the
September guarantee and to reduce the number of young people not in
education, employment or training. To achieve that, Connexions and
local authorities need a high-quality, accurate system that tracks
young people
effectively.</div>
					<a name="08022014000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Green Paper &#147;Raising Expectations: staying in education and
training post-16&#148; said that we would build on the system that
Connexions currently uses to gather that information&#151;the client
caseload information system, which I will refer to as the CCIS. It uses
information from a range of sources, including learning providers and
other public bodies. Connexions personal advisers record information
from their one-to-one contact with young people. I assure the Committee
that none of that infringes on young people&#146;s rights to privacy.
I will elaborate on that point
later.</div>
					<a name="08022014000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I mentioned
and got to eventually in my third intervention on the hon. Member for
Yeovil, young people have the right under the Data Protection  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column477" />Column number: 477</div>Act 1998, rather than the Bill, to know if their information is going to
be passed on. They can request a copy of it and can request that it be
corrected if they think that it is wrong. They can prevent their school
or college from passing on certain information about them. Connexions
obtains their consent before passing on their information to other
bodies. Young people can consent to the information being passed on to
some bodies and not to others. The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and
Littlehampton is right that that is the active consent to which I
referred in the oral evidence session on 29 January. It is fair to say
that it is not clear on reading the Bill where the act of consent comes
in, because it is provided for by other
legislation.</div>
					<a name="08022014000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="08022014000448"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Nick Gibb</b> (Bognor Regis and Littlehampton) (Con): This is
the crux of clause 14 and subsequent clauses. The explanatory note to
clause 16 states that its purpose
is</div>
					<a name="08022014000369"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to allow public
bodies to provide information to local education authorities where
other statutory provisions would prevent their doing
so.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08022014000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">My vague
recollection from my period as a law student is that later statutes
take priority over earlier ones. Clause 14(4) is very clear that it
requires a student himself to instruct the institution when he does not
wish information to be supplied. That implies that that provision,
rather than other legislation such as the Data Protection Act, will be
the law in relation to this precise transfer of information. Will the
Minister give chapter and verse on the sections in the Data Protection
Act that he believes will take priority over this later
statute?</div>
				
					<a name="08022014000407"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.45
am</div>
					<a name="08022014000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022014000449"></a>Jim
Knight:
						</b> I shall come back with chapter and verse in the
fullness of time. I am sure that I will be able to do that fairly
soon.</div>
					<a name="08022014000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">Returning
to clauses 14 and 57, I would like to be clear that information sharing
has been in place for Connexions since the Learning and Skills Act 2000
was passed. It is not new. None of the measures is new, but they are
necessary because of the new arrangements between Connexions and local
authorities. Learning providers already provide information to
Connexions so that it can track young people&#146;s participation and
offer support that is appropriate and timely. As local authorities take
responsibility for providing the Connexions service, they will need
information sharing to continue so that the effectiveness of the
service is not jeopardised. These clauses are similar to existing
arrangements and are covered by the Data Protection
Act.</div>
					<a name="08022014000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 14(4) does
not require consent for sensitive information to be passed on, but the
agencies must give a very strong public interest justification for it
being passed on. Consent will not necessarily be required where there
is a statutory power for the disclosure to be made, but parents and
pupils will be made fully aware of the right to opt out in the fair
processing notice that is issued annually. There are clearly some quite
complicated issues about data protection, and I will come back to the
hon. Gentleman on whether one piece of legislation supersedes the
other.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column478" />Column number: 478</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022014000450"></a>Mr.
Laws:
						</b> Will the Minister clarify two points? First, will
the educational institutions involved have to give information of that
type about past pupils and students, or are we talking about present
pupils and students only? Secondly, how will consent be achieved in
practice within educational settings? Who will seek it, what will the
opt-out mechanisms be and how will the information be supplied to
individuals? He has given us a formal ministerial description, but I
would like something that feels a bit more human and

						</b> I will clarify the point if I have to, but my
reading of the clause is that it refers to part 1 and therefore relates
to pupils who are going through the process. There may be other
measures about being able to track the destinations of pupils, but they
do not relate to this
matter.</div>
					<a name="08022014000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was talking
about the similarity between the measures in the Bill and other
existing arrangements. The measures are covered by the Data Protection
Act. I will write to the Committee about the detailed legal advice on
superseding legislation. That will explain the matter more clearly than
any comment that I can summon up from my collective wisdom here and
now.</div>
					<a name="08022014000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">On active
consent, when Connexions passes on information that it holds on young
people, such as the information that is given through one-to-one
contact, it asks for the young person&#146;s consent before passing
it on. Therefore, a very active consent procedure is already going
on.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022014000455"></a>Jim
Knight:
						</b> Certainly. I have been saying that all we are
doing is repeating current law and current practice. Now, when
Connexions passes on information that is held on young people, such as
information that a young person may have given through one-to-one
contact with a personal adviser, it always asks for the young
person&#146;s consent before passing it on. For example, in the
course of a conversation about a young person&#146;s treatment for an
addiction, the personal adviser might ask whether they mind if that
information is passed on to another body, such as a health body. The
young person has the opportunity to say at that point whether they are
happy to give that
consent.</div>
					<a name="08022014000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">I can confirm
that schools can only pass on information about existing pupils, if
that helps to bring absolute clarity for the hon. Member for
Yeovil.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022014000456"></a>Mr.
Gibb:
						</b> On the point that the clause is merely extrapolating
existing powers relating to the Connexions service, the Bill extends
far more widely than simply giving careers advice to young people. It
covers all 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column479" />Column number: 479</div>young people aged 16 or 17, requiring them to remain
in education or training until they are 18, on pain of criminal
sanctions. That is the difference between the Bill and the legislation
applying to the Connexions service, which is a narrow service provider
of a limited range of services. The clause represents a huge difference
in scale. I do not think that it is sufficient for the Minister to say
that the much wider power and duty in the Bill is simply a continuation
of the same provisions. I am
worried&#151;</div>

write to the Committee on the basic crux of his argument regarding
consent.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022014000459"></a>Jim
Knight:
						</b> On the hon. Gentleman&#146;s first point on the
scale of the criminal consequence, in substance, we are talking about
the passing of personal information from one body to another. That is a
sensitive matter, regardless of the consequence. It is important that
we protect sensitive information now and in the future, regardless of
the criminal consequence attached to part 1 and the duty to
participate.</div>
					<a name="08022014000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
respect of what I said about writing a response on the topic of
consent, the only reassurance that I can give the hon. Gentleman now is
that the Data Protection Act was passed in 1998, and the governing
legislation that we are replacing is the Learning and Skills Act 2000,
so the governing legislation was already passed after the Data
Protection Act. On that basis I do not envisage any legal problem with
the provisions of the Bill. If I need to correct what I have said, as
ever, I will write to the Committee to inform hon.
Members.</div>
					<a name="08022014000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">To try to
move on, Mr. Bercow: the fact that the provisions are
similar to existing arrangements means that a young person can already
request a copy of personal information held about them by their school,
college or other provider, and that they could put the same request to
Connexions or the local authority whenever they wish. If a young person
believes that the information held on them is inaccurate, they can
write to the organisation to set out what they believe is wrong with it
and what should be done to correct it. If the necessary changes are not
made, the young person can ultimately take the organisation to court,
but they can also ask the Information Commissioner to assess whether
the processing of their personal data has been carried out in
compliance with the provisions of the Act. Amendments Nos. 16 and 19
are therefore unnecessary. I assure the Committee that the sharing of
information specified in the Bill is subject to the Data Protection
Act, and that there is no need for the safeguards to be repeated
explicitly here to make it
so.</div>

							<a name="08022014000460"></a>Mr.

unnecessary?</div>

						</b> The provision repeats the safeguards already laid
out in the Learning and Skills Act 2000. They are to differentiate the
basic relevant information described in subsection (3) and the broader
information, as described by the hon. Member for Yeovil. A difference
needs to be set out in
law.</div>
					<a name="08022014000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under the
Learning and Skills Act 2000, learning providers pass on young
people&#146;s basic identification information to Connexions
providers, including their name, address, date of birth, and the name
and address of a parent, as set out in subsection (3). They and their
parents are informed, normally by way of a letter, that that
information will be passed on, and about the uses to which it might be
put. The young person, or their parent if they are under the age of 16,
has the right to stop any further information about them being passed
on, and the Bill allows those arrangements to continue when the
responsibility for Connexions passes to local
authorities.</div>

be useful to be clear that there is that sharp distinction between what

applies, what is the purpose of subsection (4), which requires written
instruction from the student not to supply it, and, in the absence of

Laws:
						</b> On how many young people is the clause likely to
impact? Does the Minister envisage a large-scale data transfer in the

cases?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022014000479"></a>Jim
Knight:
						</b> Every young person will be affected by the clause,
because when someone reaches the age of 13, information is passed from
the school or institution to Connexions so that it can offer advice as
they move on to make choices at 14. Subsequently, as and when they have
contact with Connexions, their record will develop. That further
information could include the courses that they have studied, their
grades, their attendance and changes of address. That gives Connexions
softer intelligence on each young person, enabling it to tailor the
support on
offer.</div>
					<a name="08022014000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
170, which was tabled by the hon. Member for Yeovil, would ensure that
information is passed on only if it is relevant to an assessment of the
young person&#146;s educational and support needs. I can reassure the
Committee that that is already the case. The first word of clauses 14
and 57 is &#147;Relevant&#148;. That will continue to be the case
regardless of whether the information is passed on to Connexions or to
the local authority. The law already regulates the circumstances under
which information can be passed on. The Data Protection Act, the Human
Rights Act 1998 and a common law of confidence all ensure that the
sharing of personal information without consent takes place only when
necessary and proportionate. For example, in this case, it is relevant
to the local authority&#146;s duties under part 1 to promote
participation or to provide the Connexions service. Amendment No. 170
is therefore
unnecessary.</div>

						</b> I dare say it may well be relevant if those sorts
of things have happened. That information would be extremely relevant
in respect of some clauses that we will discuss on public bodies
passing information to Connexions and vice versa. The hon. Gentleman
has tabled an amendment to exclude health authorities and primary care
trusts from passing on information. It is exactly that sort of scenario
in which someone has mental health needs where we want a facility in
law, so that that information can be passed on and the relevant support
provided. In respect of mental health, the information would be held on
a school&#146;s pupil leave annual school census
database&#151;PLASC&#151;but it would not be passed on by the
school, because it passes that information up to the Department, and
from there, the PLASC data will go down to local authorities and

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022014000484"></a>Mr.
Laws:
						</b> These are quite sweeping powers on the scope of
information, and the need for an opt-out or an opt-in may relate to the
size of the transfer. I think the Minister is saying that the transfer
could affect quite a large number of young people whose permission
would be sought.</div>
					<a name="08022014000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022014000485"></a>Jim
Knight:
						</b> The basic information requirement affects every
pupil. The duty to provide the name and address of the pupil or
student, and the name and address of a parent of a pupil or student is
set out in subsections 3(a) and (b). Subsequent information, such as
that in respect of the DPA and whether there is an opt-in or an opt-out
depends on the circumstances. In most cases, much of that information
will be passed on, because parents will not withhold their consent, as
they value the support generated from the Connexions services and
others.</div>
					<a name="08022014000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me try to
make some progress by returning to amendments Nos. 17, 18 and 97, which
deal with consent. The Data Protection Act 1998 already requires public
bodies, including schools, colleges and training providers, to inform
an individual if personal data relating to him or her is disclosed. In
practice, that means, for example, that the school will actively
approach the young person, or their parent, to inform them about the
purposes of data processing, such as the type of information and the
bodies with whom data may be shared and why. The school would need to
repeat that annually, and every year, it should send some kind of
notice home to parents setting out how the data will be
used.</div>
					<a name="08022014000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">This requirement
exists even where consent for the sharing of information is not
required as a matter of law. The interests of the young person, and any
consequences for them of information sharing, must be the paramount
consideration. Adding a specific requirement for young people to give
their written consent every time their school or college passed
information to the local authority or its Connexions service would
greatly increase bureaucracy and add complexity to the system. More
importantly, it would reduce the ability of the Connexions service to
provide timely and appropriate support to young people in finding and
accessing appropriate courses.</div>
					<a name="08022014000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">In cases where young people did
not consent to their basic identification information being passed on,
the local authority and Connexions would not be able to track young
people or know when someone had dropped out of education or training.
That means that they might not be able to provide that person with any
support, let alone timely support. The sooner the Connexions service
contacts someone who needs support, the better the chances that that
will be effective in getting them back into learning.</div>
					<a name="08022014000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">The additional requirement
would be particularly burdensome on the young people themselves. It
would effectively bar some of the most vulnerable young people, such as
young people with special educational needs, those suffering from drug
or alcohol abuse or those with chaotic lifestyles, from receiving
support 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column484" />Column number: 484</div>until they had formally consented in writing. That is not practicable or
desirable. Young people do&#151;and this will continue&#151;have
the option of refusing consent for additional information, which is
information above their basic identification information, to be shared
with the local authority. I hope that what I have said reassures hon.
Members that the young person and/or their parents will be fully aware
of whom this information would be shared with and why, and of their
right to stop it happening.</div>
					<a name="08022014000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">While there are a number of
support services that seek to reach out and support young people, the
Connexions service is the only one that has responsibility for
supporting all young people between 13 and 19. That is one of its
strengths. None of the other partner agencies has been tasked with
tracking all young people, and most other systems would only record
information on those young people with whom they are working.
Connexions is required to know about everyone in its area. It is the
information provided by schools and colleges that forms the basis for
the support that it provides, and enables it to identify young people
who may need additional help.</div>
					<a name="08022014000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">I can reassure the hon. Members
for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton and for Yeovil that, in line with
data protection principles, only information relevant to the provision
of the Connexions service would be shared under the clause. This is
likely to include gender and ethnicity, whether the young person is
receiving support through SEN school action or school action plus, and
which year group they are in. For those in their final year of
compulsory education, it would include whether they had an offer to
return to school for the sixth form. That allows the Connexions service
to target support on those who are not planning to stay on at school
and to help them obtain a suitable place elsewhere.</div>
					<a name="08022014000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">The information shared is
unlikely to include more personal information such as whether the young
person had been in trouble at school or had problems at home. Given
that protection and the other safeguards in the process, I do not think
there is a risk that young people will be deterred from raising
academic or personal problems with school
staff.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022014000491"></a>Jim

						</b> The scale is not significantly different. Parts 1
and 2 cover all young people. The Data Protection Act protections
require institutions to let young people and their parents know that
the information that is shared will be used for part 1 purposes, so it
could be used to identify the fact that they are not fulfilling their
duty to participate. The point of sharing the information, in relation
to both parts, is to enable Connexions to support young
people.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022014000492"></a>Mr.
Gibb:
						</b> Yes, but there is a difference in scale. The
Minister is justifying those sweeping information-sharing powers as
though they were a minor thing that simply provided services to a
student. They are not to do only that; they enforce a duty in part 1.
There is a huge difference of scale, so he cannot use that argument to
justify the powers in clause
14.</div>

							<a name="08022014000493"></a>Jim
Knight:
						</b> But the CCIS&#151;and I have been very clear
with officials&#151;will not be used for some kind of trawling
exercise to enforce the duty. It will provide support to help young
people fulfil their duty as in part 1, but it is not meant to assist
the local authority in carrying out any kind of enforcement. The hon.
Gentleman describes the measures as sweeping powers, but as I have made
perfectly clear, they are set out in the Learning and Skills Act
2000.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022014000495"></a>Jim
Knight:
						</b> Clause 14 sets out replacement clauses for the
2000 Act. With regard to trawling exercises and enforcement, we are
absolutely clear that that does not apply. I have already told the hon.
Gentleman clearly that the clause relates to the support that
Connexions provides to enable people to fulfil their duty, rather than
to any kind of
enforcement.</div>
					<a name="08022014000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
believe that the nature of the information that will enable Connexions
to fulfil its duty of support to all young people means that it is
proportionate to have an opt-out approach to consent. We take a
slightly different stance on the information that is held by Connexions
and may be passed to other agencies. That information includes the
basic information and any other information passed on by schools and
other learning providers, but it also includes information gathered by
Connexions in the course of its interactions with a young person. That
latter category of data held by Connexions can be
sensitive.</div>
					<a name="08022014000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
some cases, because of an individual&#146;s needs, the Connexions
service may want to pass specific information to another professional
working in a specific area, such as a social worker or a health
professional. That would be done on a case-by-case basis and with the
active consent of the young person. The young person can agree to
information being passed to one professional but not to another. The
provisions strike the right balance between enabling the local
authority to fulfil its duty of promoting participation by providing
the Connexions service and tracking young people effectively, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column486" />Column number: 486</div>and respecting young people&#146;s right to prevent certain
information about them from being shared. That balance that has been
proved to work over the past eight years, as these provisions replace
measures, as I have repeatedly said, in the Learning and Skills Act
2000 in a largely unaltered
form.</div>

Gibb:
						</b> The Minister has just read out a phrase or
sub-clause of a sentence in his brief saying that the
information-sharing provision has been included to promote the duty to
participate. If this is simply about providing information for the
Connexions service, I cannot understand why there are two different
clauses&#151;clause 14 relating to part 1, and clause 57 relating to
support services&#151;saying the same thing:. Why have two identical
clauses in different parts of  the

Knight:
						</b> We have two clauses: one in relation to local
authorities and one in relation to Connexions. That is because of the
new arrangements between local authorities and Connexions, as the
Connexions service is something that local authorities can provide
themselves or contract out. The scale is not significantly different
from now. There is a new purpose, which is why we have separate
clauses, but the powers are not new. They enable local authorities to
identify young people, but clause 57 already allows that. Clause 14 is
important, because it makes the new purpose clear with regard to the
role of local authorities. They cannot perform their part 1 duties if
they do not provide support through, for example, Connexions. It is
absolutely fundamental that we have these provisions in place. They can
promote participation, but they are not meant to enforce
it.</div>

institutions, and the local authorities themselves have well
established procedures. It would be well known what information is
helpful in providing the service. I have set out some of that,
including the courses they provide and so on. In the end, the people
operating the Connexions services locally or the local authority could
make a request for certain information to be passed on and then the
consent procedures would kick
in.</div>

it is finally&#151;on the subject of the capacity of the CCIS system

system&#146;s capabilities for supporting the raising of the
participation age&#151;RPA&#151;and while it is always possible to
make improvements, I am satisfied that the specification will do the
job. Kieran Gordon, who gave evidence to the Committee, offered a very
helpful description of how the system works in practice. In addition,
he said:</div>
					<a name="08022014000373"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It
is interesting that tracking has improved markedly during the life of
Connexions. The percentage of young people who are

people.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;[Official Report, Education and

proposed directions to local authorities provided for in clause 55,
local authorities will have to comply with the national specification
for CCIS, to ensure vital information flows and availability is
safeguarded. CCIS will, of course, need some adaptation to cater for
100 per cent. participation, and that is a key consideration for the
RPA implementation work to follow in the next five years<i class="I"> </i>I hope,

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022014000500"></a>Mr.
Gibb:
						</b> I have to say that I am very unhappy with the
Minister&#146;s attempts to justify the provisions. He is extending
limited powers that applied to Connexions&#151;an advisory service to
help young people with advice on careers and future
training&#151;much more widely to promote participation. He makes a
distinction between promoting participation and enforcing it. But the
Bill makes no such distinction. Clause 14(2)
says:</div>
					<a name="08022014000374"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A local
education authority may request information under subsection (1) only
for the purpose of enabling or assisting it to exercise its functions
under this
Part.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08022014000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">Its
functions under that part, which includes every clause that we have
debated, relate not only to promoting participation but to enforcing
it. The Minister is not correct to say that this is solely about
promoting participation and trying to enable the local authority to
provide a tailored service to an individual, as it is also about
enforcing participation to ensure that young people are attending. That
is what part 1 is about. I am also unclear, despite extensive
interventions on the Minister by the hon. Member for Yeovil and myself,
about the purpose of clause 14(4), which states that sensitive
information in subsection (3)(c) about which we are concerned must not
be provided if the young
person</div>
					<a name="08022014000375"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;has instructed
the responsible person not to provide information of that
kind&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08022014000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">If there is no
written note from the young person saying that the information should
not be provided, according to the Bill, the educational institution can
provide it.</div>
					<a name="08022014000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister said that the Data Protection Act provisions required active
consent from the pupil before that information can be provided, but on
probing, he fell back on the explanation that it required written
instructions from the pupil that the information should not be
provided. Those things do not stack up, and he has been unable
to tell the Committee chapter and verse which provisions in the Data
Protection Act require active consent from the pupil. I think that he
is playing fast and loose with the provisions, although I hate to be so
argumentative in making my
point.</div>

we will return to this matter on Report. I have asked the Minister
quite explicitly, if I were an educational institution and had a
request from a local authority to provide sensitive educational
information, whether I would be required to obtain consent from the
pupil. His answer was no: there had to be written instructions from the
pupil, and the institution would not have to seek that consent. That
concern underlies the amendment, and that is why I will press it to a
Division.</div>

							<a name="08022014000503"></a>Jim

						</b> Just to clarify my point that these powers are to
be used for support rather than enforcement, the powers in clause 18 on
guidance make it extremely clear that that will be the case. There are
further measures in clause 39(5)(a) and (b), which set that out in a
little more detail. We will come on to those
provisions.</div>

of legislation that we do not scrutinise and which has no real power
over primary legislation, as a safeguard, particularly as the Committee
has not seen a draft of that guidance. I remain unconvinced and very
unhappy about the Minister&#146;s response. As a consequence, I will
press the amendment to a

hope that we will make more rapid progress once we have dealt with this
extremely important
clause.</div>
					<a name="08022014000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">Perhaps I
should start by saying what we would be happy to see in the clause,
rather than raise further problems with it. Given the principles behind
the Bill, we would be happy to see a situation in which basic
information relating to pupils&#146; names, addresses and so forth,
together with core educational information, are transferred to a local
authority to help it discharge its responsibilities under the
legislation.</div>
					<a name="08022014000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have
concerns about the passing over of very sensitive information. I have
cited some examples from my constituency where schools often hold
extremely sensitive information about young people that they have
gained not because of their strict educational responsibilities, but
during course of contact between children and particular teachers.
Subsection (3)(c) will allow that information to be passed to a local
authority unless an individual has instructed the responsible person in
the educational institution not to do
so.</div>
					<a name="08022014000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">When pressed, the
Minister thought that he was giving me reassurance, but he actually
causing me further concern about the types of case that I was already
concerned about. For example, he said that a case in which information
was held on a school database concerning a young person who had been,
or claimed to have been, sexually abused by a parent, and had developed
mental health or other problems, could be passed over as a result of
the provisions in the clause. That is a very sensitive
matter.</div>
					<a name="08022014000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our basic
position is that, provided the information is clearly relevant to
educational and social support, without any controversy, it would be
reasonable for it to be passed over; although some of the opt-out,
opt-in issues raised by the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column489" />Column number: 489</div>Littlehampton remain. However, if the information is much more
sensitive, particularly in circumstances where establishing its
importance to the local authority in discharging its responsibilities
is more controversial, we would want a failsafe mechanism to protect
the transfer of that information, and to ensure that explicit
permission had to be sought and given; rather than the open-ended
provision at the end of subsection (4) that states that an individual
who does not wish the information to be passed over must give an
instruction for it not to
be.</div>
					<a name="08022014000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="08022014000506"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
John Hayes</b> (South Holland and The Deepings) (Con): The
nature of the information is likely to be sensitive, given that
Connexions will be its repository. We have heard both at this stage of
the Committee and in the evidence sessions that the Connexions database
is at the fulcrum of the matter. As the hon. Gentleman knows,
Connexions holds immensely sensitive information about a large number
of young people. Surely that exacerbates his
fears?</div>
					<a name="08022014000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022014000507"></a>Mr.
Laws:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman is quite right that, inevitably,
local authorities and schools may consider a lot of sensitive
information relevant to the question of establishing a young
person&#146;s support needs. When pressed on those matters, the
Minister told us a number of things. He said that the data transfer
could affect a large proportion, or even all, of the cohort. We accept
that a smaller proportion will be affected in relation to the transfer
of very sensitive information, but none of us really knows quite how
small that will be. He said that the information will be required to be
passed over by the education establishment while the pupil or student
is on the roll and not afterwards, which also raises concerns. If the
information has to be passed over at that time rather than afterwards,
it creates more of a presumption that more data will be
transferred.</div>
					<a name="08022014000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
example, a young person post-16 may not comply with the duty in the
Bill to be in education or training, and a local authority might get
involved at that stage. It might start to think: why is this person not
complying with the provisions of the Bill? What are their support
needs? What can we find out about them that will help us to understand
their needs and ensure that we put that support in place? If the
presumption is that accessing such information, which is often held by
the education establishment, must be done while the pupil or student is
at that establishment, there is a greater risk that the local authority
would expect the school to provide as much information as possible that
might be relevant in future to assessing those support needs. I fear
that quite a lot of information of a sensitive nature might transfer
from the schools to the local authorities during that
process.</div>
					<a name="08022014000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">How will the
approval work, and how will it be given? A small number of people with
high needs will have a Connexions adviser, and they may have a
conversation of the type that the Minister cited, leading to the
question of whether the young person would be happy for information
about their drug abuse to be passed on as a result of that
conversation. However, we could be talking about a much larger number
of young people.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column490" />Column number: 490</div>
					<a name="08022014000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was trying to elicit from the
Minister a flavour of how he thinks that permission will be given in
practice. Could a teacher or head teacher come to a class in the final
year at school, or whichever year is relevant, and say, &#147;We are
going to download all these boring data to the local authority to help
with your future education needs. Let me know if there is a problem
with that, and now over to the maths test&#148;? Or perhaps it could
take place in assembly. Perhaps I am being too cynical and simplistic,
but it is unclear on a human scale how the permission will be
stored.</div>

					<a name="08022014000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is
directly relevant to what the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and
Littlehampton seeks to do, which is to firm up the provision so that it
is not left to people to have specifically to opt out when they realise
that the data are sensitive. However, if the data are sensitive, people
will have to opt in with some type of agreement. The more that the
Government want to make subsection (3)(c) open-ended, so that lots of
potentially sensitive data can be transferred, the more it is necessary
to have something stronger than the current opt-out, which might not
turn out to be as effective as the Minister
says.</div>

							<a name="08022014000508"></a>Jim
Knight:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman is clearly concerned about
sensitive information. He is right to be so. We are all concerned about
that. We are very clear that sensitive information about child abuse,
for example, will not be routinely shared. It may be shared with a
personal adviser in school to support the young person, but a teacher
or case worker would have to seek the young person&#146;s consent for
that unless there were safeguarding considerations, in which case the
safeguarding legislation would come into play. The hon. Gentleman must
also bear in mind that there will be a build-up of information from the
age of 13 when the initial record is created in CCIS. That is then
subject to the annual notice under the Data Protection Act, which I set
out in my speaking
note.</div>
					<a name="08022014000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022014000509"></a>Mr.
Laws:
						</b> I am still confused about how the provision will
operate. Let us take the case of a young person who has allegedly been
sexually abused by a parent. That information would be held on some
kind of database within a school. The abuse would clearly have a big
impact on the young person, which could mean that they often truanted
from school or that they had mental health or other problems. If the
school was aware of the young person&#146;s duty to be in education
and training post-16 and it was aware of the young person&#146;s
problems as a consequence of those allegations, would it not, under
this part of the Bill, feel some obligation to pass that information
over? Is that not precisely the type of information that needs
cast-iron protection to ensure that there is not an opt-out, but an
opt-in? The very fact that the Minister said, in response to my
question, that he would regard such information as very relevant to a
young person&#146;s potential future support and educational needs
indicates that it is the kind of information that could flow over as a
consequence of the provisions.</div>
					<a name="08022014000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">I put it to
the Minister that, at the moment, there are no adequate protections in
the measure for some of the data transfer that is envisaged. He
indicated that he did not have a fundamental problem with the contents
of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column491" />Column number: 491</div>amendment No. 170, which simply seeks to tag to the end of subsection
(3)(c) the provision that the information should relate to education
and support needs. I admit that even that is a little vague because
support needs could be widely defined, but at least there would be a
little more clarity about the need to make a strong connection between
the information passed over and its relevance to education and support
needs. At the moment, the subsection is very
open-ended.</div>

as the Minister has already indicated in response to questions. For it
to be that open-ended, with only the protection at the end of
subsection (4) that the information will be passed over unless the
person proactively sets out an instruction that it should not be, does
not seem to be an adequate protection nor is it a realistic one in the
circumstances. Although we understand the need for some of that data to
be passed over, and we would want a lot of straightforward data to be
passed over in a non-bureaucratic way, we are obliged to be sympathetic
to the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and
Littlehampton. We feel that there needs to be some protection from

							<b class="B">Mr.
Charles Walker</b> (Broxbourne) (Con): On a point of order,
Mr. Bercow. The official record of proceedings on Thursday 7
February shows me as not attending. However, I took part in two
Divisions on that day, so could the record be amended to show that I
did indeed attend that
sitting?</div>

order.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022014000543"></a>Mr.
Laws:
						</b> I beg to move amendment No. 171, in clause 14, page
7, line 37, leave out subsection
(4).</div>
					<a name="08022014000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will try not to
detain the Committee too long on the amendment, nor shall I contradict
the position that I set out in the previous debate, but I want to raise
a parallel concern about the way in which the Government are framing
their policies in relation to the transfer of information, because as
well as running the risk of quite sensitive information being passed
over without proper checks, the provisions in subsection (4) allow
parents and pupils to opt out of passing some quite basic educational
information to the local
authority.</div>
					<a name="08022014000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
probing amendment is designed to find out why the Government have
decided to insert that provision and whether it is simply a
manifestation of the fact that subsection (3)(c) is so sweeping in the
powers that it could give that protection of this type is necessary. It
is designed to tempt the Minister into indicating that there may be a
distinction between information that is purely educational&#151;most
of us would regard it as sensible for there to be a right to pass over
such information&#151;and more sensitive information that might
require an opt-in.</div>
					<a name="08022014000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
its response to the Bill&#151;a clause-by-clause briefing&#151;the
Local Government Association suggests in relation to the subsection
that</div>
					<a name="08022014000377"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;This
appears to suggest that if parents and/or young people are unwilling to
provide information,
we&#148;&#151;</div>
					<a name="08022014000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">the local
authorities&#151;</div>
					<a name="08022014000378"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;will
not necessarily be able to arrange for the most helpful support to that
young person&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08022014000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
briefing goes on to
state:</div>
					<a name="08022014000379"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;There
may be other legal reasons for this, but it does seem potentially
unhelpful if we are pursuing the principle that the local authority has
a duty to promote participation and support the young person in so
doing.&#148;</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column493" />Column number: 493</div>
					<a name="08022014000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">Previous debates have shown that
we do not support the elements of compulsion and criminalisation in the
Bill. However, if those duties are to be included in the Bill and if
the local authority is to be charged with ensuring that the young
person is in an education and training setting, is it sensible for
young people and parents who do not want to comply with the measures to
have an opt-out from all educational information, other than the
minimal information contained in clause 14(3)(a) and (b)? Surely basic
educational information should be able to pass without that hindrance
and my probing amendment is designed to elicit a response from the
Government on that
point.</div>
					<a name="08022014000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022014000544"></a>Jim
Knight:
						</b> As the hon. Gentleman has set out, the amendment
would remove the right of the young person, or if they are under 16
their parent, to prevent additional information&#151;apart from the
young person&#146;s name, address, date of birth and the name and
address of their parents&#151;that might be in the learning
provider&#146;s possession from being passed on to the local
authority. On the face of it, that is a remarkably illiberal amendment,
but I accept that it is a probing one and that it does not necessarily
reflect the liberal values that the hon. Gentleman has
displayed.</div>
					<a name="08022014000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022014000545"></a>Mr.
Laws:
						</b> I cannot let the Minister get away with that. Does
he understand that there is a basic difference between raw educational
data and the type of sensitive information that we are discussing, on
which my party has certainly taken a very liberal
line?</div>
					<a name="08022014000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022014000546"></a>Jim
Knight:
						</b> Of course there are distinctions. We make a
straightforward distinction between basic information that is not at
all sensitive&#151;name and address or date of birth&#151;and other
information, whether about education or the more sensitive sorts of
information to which the hon. Gentleman referred. The whole point of
the subsection about which he is concerned is to distinguish between
basic and other information, whether that is in relation to education
and training experience or other personal information, in respect of
the person&#146;s needs.</div>
					<a name="08022014000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="08022014000547"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Oliver Heald</b> (North-East Hertfordshire) (Con): Let us
suppose that the individual concerned is a violent person who has been
found carrying weapons in a school. Would that person be able to say,
&#147;Well, you can&#146;t pass that information on&#148;? If
that is so, it is difficult to see how the local education authority
could make a proper risk assessment of that individual and where they
might be deployed in the education system.
</div>
					<a name="08022014000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022014000548"></a>Jim
Knight:
						</b> In that context, without information, the LEA
would not be able to pass on the data, but in that sort of scenario one
would expect the enforcement agencies to be called by the police, who
would have their own records. If there were an overriding, strong
public interest justification for sharing information&#151;whatever
it might be&#151;that would come into play. It is difficult to
comment on the exact scenario that the hon. Gentleman describes,
whereby a number of different agencies would be engaged and would be
collecting their own data on individuals and an individual case. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column494" />Column number: 494</div>They would not be solely reliant in terms of support, as we might be, on
an agency&#146;s being able to share information, but it should be on
the basis of
consent.</div>
					<a name="08022014000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me
address the amendment in more detail. Clause 14 sets out the
requirements on learning providers to pass on information, as we have
discussed, and replaces section 117 of the Learning and Skills 
Act 2000. In practice, as I said earlier, schools write to parents of
all pupils approaching the age of 13 when they are in year 8 to let
them know that information about their children will be shared with the
Connexions service. That core information covers the young
person&#146;s name and address and the name and address of a parent.
Schools will also pass on additional information about the young person
unless they, or their parent if they are under 16, request that it is
not passed on. The information could include the courses that the young
person has studied, their grades, attendance or a change of
address.</div>
					<a name="08022014000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">Parents are
provided with a form to sign and return to the school if they do not
want the additional information to be passed on to Connexions, in which
case it would not be. In practice, few currently opt out&#151;less
than 10 per cent. In practice, if Connexions did not obtain the
additional information from the school but had other contact on a
one-to-one basis through a personal adviser, it might acquire the
information from the young person through that
route.</div>
					<a name="08022014000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 14 sets
out similar arrangements to those already provided for. It enables
learning providers to pass on information to the local authority so
that it can fulfil its new responsibilities for delivering Connexions
and promoting participation. As happens at present, clause 14 will give
young people, or their parents if they are under 16, the right to
prevent learning providers from passing on their additional information
to the local authority. I hope that in the light of my reasoning the
hon. Member for Yeovil will withdraw his
amendment.</div>
					<a name="08022014000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022014000549"></a>Mr.
Laws:
						</b> I shall withdraw my amendment, but that is not
because I am persuaded. I tabled the amendment simply to highlight the
fact that the Government need protection in subsection (4) that creates
some impediments to the rational transfer of data, because in other
parts of the clause and the Bill excessive powers are granted to allow
the transfer of data that we would seek to protect. I hope that we will
be able to return to that issue later in our proceedings. On that
basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div>

Gibb:

clause 57, page 30, line 37, at
end insert</div>
					<a name="08022029000006"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#145;to the
extent that fulfilling such duty conforms to Article 8 of the European
Convention on Human Rights.&#146;.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column495" />Column number: 495</div>
					<a name="08022014000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause is another
data-sharing provision, which we touched on when we debated amendment
No. 97. Clause 57 is drafted similarly to clause 14, but it relates to
data being shared with the local authority to enable it to supply
support services to young people, rather than to promote participation.
However, the principle of the information that an educational
institution holds being shared with the local authority is  the
same.</div>
					<a name="08022014000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
would ensure that the data-sharing powers are consistent with the
European convention on human rights by incorporating article 8 into the
clause and requiring it to be consistent with that article, which deals
with the right to respect for private and family life. It
states:</div>
					<a name="08022014000380"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Everyone
has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and
his correspondence...There shall be no interference by a public
authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in
accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the
interests of national security, public safety or the economic
well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for
the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights
and freedoms of
others.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08022014000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
human rights aspect of the Bill, particularly in relation to
information-sharing provisions, has been raised by the hon. Member for
Hendon (Mr. Dismore), who chairs the Joint Committee on
Human Rights. The right protected by article 8 is a qualified right
that can be interfered with, as the Government have done, if that
interference has its basis in law, is done to secure a permissible aim
set out in the relevant article and is necessary in a democratic
society. Interference must fulfil a pressing social need, pursue a
legitimate aim and be proportionate to the aims pursued. That is a key
aspect. The hon. Gentleman&#146;s concerns about the human rights
implications of the Bill were raised in a letter of 20 December, in
which he
states:</div>
					<a name="08022014000381"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Bill contains information supply and sharing provisions in Parts 1 to 4
which raise potential human rights issues, notably the right to respect
for private and family life. The Government has referred to some, but
not all, of the information supply and sharing provisions in the human
rights section of the Explanatory Notes. In particular, whilst the
Explanatory Notes state generally that the provisions in Chapter 2 of
Part 1 pursue the aim of economic well-being, the Government does not
explain specifically, in relation to each of the disclosure provisions,
how each provision is both necessary and proportionate to the
achievement of that
aim.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08022014000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Gentleman
specifically
asks:</div>
					<a name="08022014000382"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In
relation to each and every information supply and sharing
provision...what legitimate aim is sought to be protected...are the
provisions necessary to achieve the aim and...are the measures
proportionate to that
aim?&#148;</div>
					<a name="08022014000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">He goes on to
ask:</div>
					<a name="08022014000383"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In
relation to each and every information supply and sharing provision,
what specific safeguards will be in place to ensure their compatibility
with article 8
ECHR&#148;?</div>
					<a name="08022014000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">Thus, the question
is: what is the legitimate aim?</div>
					<a name="08022014000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister responded in
another
letter:</div>
					<a name="08022014000384"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Economic
well-being of the country: the information collected will be used for
improving the participation and general attainment in education and
training of young people by providing appropriate support to individual
young people...thereby ensuring a more skilled
workforce.&#148;</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column496" />Column number: 496</div>
					<a name="08022014000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">That, then, is the Minister&#146;s
explanation of the legitimate aim of the powers, which, on the face of
it, could infringe the human rights convention. On the issue of whether
the measure is proportionate, his response
is:</div>
					<a name="08022014000385"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Only by
the provision of this information&#151;name, address, date of birth
and other information relevant to Connexions services&#151;by schools
and colleges can the full group of young people be identified in
respect of whom LAs have the duty in clause 54 to make Connexions
support services available. This enables Connexions services to provide
appropriate
IAG&#148;&#151;</div>
					<a name="08022014000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">information,

most benefit them.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08022014000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
important passage there is the one about the information being relevant
to Connexions services. Clause 57(2) states that the information
requested must be relevant to the provision of services. However, the
information supplied can be
any</div>

					<a name="08022014000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is
nothing in the definition of relevant information that requires it to
be confined to the purpose of providing Connexions services. Even if
the provisions did confine the information to that purpose, the power
would still be very wide, involving supplying details of the academic
and personal problems of a student at school or college. I believe that
that would be disproportionate to the

						</b> I support my hon. Friend&#146;s general point,
but if the information was about safety&#151;the safety of other
pupils&#151;such as the fact that the student had regularly carried a
knife and was perhaps the local gang leader, or had inappropriately
touched other students, or something of that sort, surely it might be
quite important for risk
assessment.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022014000552"></a>Mr.
Gibb:
						</b> My hon. Friend is right, and nothing in the
amendment would prevent that information from being given, because an
exception to the qualified right to respect for private and family life
is the prevention of crime. That is one of the exceptions to that
sacrosanct right. All the amendment would do is make the Bill conform
to article 8 as qualified and as subject to those exceptions. My hon.
Friend raises an important point, but I hope that I have convinced him
that the information could be supplied if the amendment were accepted.
I await the Minister&#146;s response to those important points about
human
rights.</div>
					<a name="08022014000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022014000553"></a>Jim
Knight:
						</b> It is important for the Committee to note that, on
the front of the Bill, we have made a statement under section 19(1)(a)
of the Human Rights Act 1998 that the Education and Skills Bill is
compatible with convention rights. Clearly, the amendment tests that,
and it is perfectly right that it should do so, but I want to be clear
from the outset that we think that the measure is compatible with the
convention.</div>
					<a name="08022014000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">Article
8, as the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton said, provides
for the right to respect for private and family life and that is an
important right. I assure him that we have looked closely at the duty
in the clause to provide information against that article. I am
grateful to him for quoting at length annexe A of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column497" />Column number: 497</div>my letter responding to my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon, because it
saves me having to do so. On behalf of the Joint Committee on Human
Rights, my hon. Friend asked me to set out the aims that we sought to
protect and to confirm that, in my view, the provisions were necessary
and proportionate. I did that in the letter of 14
January.</div>
					<a name="08022014000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">The aims of
the clause and of other information-sharing clauses that we are
discussing are strongly linked to the economic well-being of the
individual and of the country, as the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and
Littlehampton has explained. The information that is collected will be
used to increase participation in education and training by providing
appropriate support to individual young people, as provided for by
clause 54. That is the context in which clause 57 should be understood.
Support services will be provided by local education authorities, which
will thereby ensure a more skilled work force, as well as benefits for
the individual and
society.</div>
					<a name="08022014000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
necessary for educational institutions such as schools and colleges to
provide basic information on individual young people to those involved
in the provision of support&#151;in other words, to Connexions.
Without that, Connexions would not have basic information about its
core client group and would be unable to provide young people with
information, advice and guidance tailored to their needs. We know that
receiving appropriate information, advice and guidance is essential to
achieving the aim of increasing participation and that it meets a
pressing social need. Our witnesses reinforced that message, even if we
were not already convinced of its
importance.</div>
					<a name="08022014000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is only
by the provision of basic information by educational institutions, as
set out in the clause&#151;name, date of birth, address, and name and
address of parent&#151;that Connexions service providers can identify
the full group of young people to whom local authorities have a duty to
provide support under clause 54. Information other than that basic
information must not be released to Connexions when pupils or students
over 16 or the parents of under-16s have instructed the institution not
to release it, as we have discussed at
length.</div>
					<a name="08022014000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">In all cases,
whether we are dealing with the basic information or the further
information, I stress that it must be relevant to the provision of the
Connexions service and it may be provided only to a person involved in
the provision of the Connexions service. The passing on of the
information is under the control of a &#147;responsible
person&#148;, as defined in subsection (5); for example, in a school,
that would be the governing body. Those provisions, together with the
ability of parents and young people to withdraw their consent for the
passing on of all but the basic information, are very important
safeguards.</div>
					<a name="08022014000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
addition, the Data Protection Act will govern how Connexions service
providers can use the information that they obtain under the clause,
including how they acquire, store and dispose of it. Any unlawful
disclosure or use of the information will be subject to the offences
and associated penalties under the Data Protection Act. We will discuss
amendments that deal with offences in relation to data sharing
later.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column498" />Column number: 498</div>
					<a name="08022014000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I have said, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State was content to
sign the necessary statement under section 19 of the Human Rights Act
1998. We are satisfied that the information flow is justified by our
aim of improving participation in education and training, and that the
provision of information is no more than is necessary to achieve that
aim. My conclusion is that the amendment would not add anything to what
is already provided in the Human Rights Act. On the basis that it is
superfluous, and that we do not think that superfluity in legislation
is a good thing, I invite the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and
Littlehampton to withdraw the
amendment.</div>
					<a name="08022014000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022014000554"></a>Mr.
Gibb:
						</b> If superfluity were excluded from legislation passed
by this House, Bills would be significantly shorter. However, I say to
the Minister that to say that the statement on the front of the Bill is
evidence that it complies with the Human Rights Act is rather odd. He
could not exactly write a statement on the front of the Bill that in
his view its provisions are incompatible with the European convention
on human rights, so of course he is going to say that it is compatible.
We have yet to hear from the hon. Member for Hendon whether the Joint
Committee on Human Rights believes that the Bill is consistent with the
European convention on human rights and the Human Rights Act. The
Minister confirmed in his response to the debate that the protection
available to the pupil or student is provided by an opt-out rather than
by active consent, just as he said in evidence to the Committee a few
weeks ago.</div>

hope that the Joint Committee will examine our proceedings,
particularly our sittings today and immediately before the recess,
before coming to a conclusion about whether the Bill is compatible with
the Human Rights Act and the European convention. It would be better to
incorporate the amendment into the Bill, because when interpreting it
the courts would have an explicit provision to ensure compliance with
article 8. However, the purpose of the amendment was to air the
subject, and I see no need to press it to a Division. I beg to ask

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022014000557"></a>Mr.
Gibb:
						</b> Clause 15 gives the Secretary of State the power to
supply social security information to a local education authority about
a young person. It is clear that that information comprises simply the
name and address of the young person, or that of the parents, held by
the Department for Work and Pensions. The amendment would ensure that
the Secretary of State supplied data to the LEA only if both parties
regarded the provision of such information to be proportionate to the
aims of the LEA as defined in the Bill.</div>
					<a name="08022014000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">In a letter
to the Joint Committee on Human Rights, the Minister gave as his reason
for that provision the fact that young people tended to move around
frequently. He said that from the age of 16 young people become a lot
more mobile and that such information&#151;the social security
data&#151;is what enables local authorities to keep track of them.
However, the Bill gives no guarantee that a young person&#146;s
private information will be shared only when that proportionate needs
test is met.</div>
					<a name="08022014000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
drafted, the Bill says that the Secretary of State can provide any
information that the local authority would find useful in carrying out
the functions placed upon it. However, such information might well be
transferred even when the young person in question was not frequently
changing address, as the Secretary of State said should be the case, or
if there was no other pressing need. If the Minister is comfortable
that the power will be used only in a proportionate way, he should have
no problem in accepting the amendments.</div>
					<a name="08022014000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022014000558"></a>Jim
Knight:
						</b> The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton
proposes to include in the clause a specific test of proportionality. I
suggest that such amendments are not necessary to ensure that
consideration is given to the proportionality of supply of
information.</div>
					<a name="08022014000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Secretary of State and the local authority must both act in a way that
is compatible with the European convention on human rights, according
to which any interference with the right to respect and family life
must be necessary and no more than is necessary to achieve the desired
aim. That requires a public body to ensure, before putting in place
arrangements to release information that potentially infringes that
right, that the information released is no more than is necessary for
the purposes it will serve&#151;that it is proportionate. That is why
the powers in these clauses restrict the information that may be shared
and what purposes it can serve. In clause 15, the purpose is to enable
or assist local authorities to fulfil their duties to promote
participation and identify young people not participating. In clause
61, the purpose is the provision of Connexions services.</div>
					<a name="08022014000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">The aim of
increasing participation in education and training justifies the supply
of information provided for in the clauses, but every public body must
satisfy itself that the extent of the information that it releases to
local authorities under the provisions is proportionate to those
benefits. Local authorities must also be satisfied 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column500" />Column number: 500</div>that their requests for information are proportionate. The information
that will be provided under the clauses is an essential source of basic
identification information that will serve to populate the Connexions
database. Together with other sources, it will be fundamental to
Connexions&#146;s ability to track young people effectively and to
provide them with appropriate and timely
support.</div>
					<a name="08022014000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman referred again to the letter I sent to the Joint
Committee on Human Rights&#151;I am grateful to him for, as ever,
assiduously doing his homework. The letter sets out our analysis and
justification of the information-sharing provisions in the Bill. Local
authorities are taking on new functions of promoting participation and
identifying young people who are not participating so, clearly, the
information sharing needs to continue so as not to jeopardise the
effectiveness of the Connexions service. In the light of that
reasoning, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the
amendment.</div>

						</b> It is good to come back to our labours after a
brief respite from scrutinising the Bill with the assiduity and
diligence that the House demands and which our constituents deserve, is
it not?</div>
					<a name="08022014000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">The debate
this morning focused on the Opposition&#146;s sensitivity to the
storage and use of data. The Minister repeatedly assured us that the
information is solely for advising young people through the Connexions
service but, when pressed by my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis
and Littlehampton, he was forced to admit that the information is
actually about local authorities fulfilling their duties under the Bill
and, of course, those duties specifically include the promotion of
participation. Given that enforcement is the end of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column501" />Column number: 501</div>the process, the Minister will understand that we continue to have
doubts. That is why we have tabled the amendments, which we will
discuss at some length, I
hope.</div>
					<a name="08022014000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">It would
probably be helpful if I said a few words about the explanatory notes
on clause 15, because they make clear why we feel that the amendments
are important. The notes state:</div>
					<a name="08022014000388"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The Secretary of State,
under <i class="I">clause 15</i>, may supply social security information to
enable a local education authority to fulfil its functions under this
Part&#148;,</div>
					<a name="08022014000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">as we have heard.
They
continue:</div>
					<a name="08022014000389"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
clause sets out under what circumstances further disclosure of this
information is permissible, under what circumstances it is an offence
and the penalty that may be
imposed&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08022014000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">Indeed, the
explanatory notes to clause 61, which is relevant to this group of
amendments, say that the powers under the Bill enable the</div>
					<a name="08022014000390"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Secretary of State to supply
information to a local...authority or other person for the
purposes of the provision of Connexions services for young people.
Specifically, it gives the Secretary of State the power to supply
social security information in relation to young people. In order to
identify young persons, it may be necessary to use information held by
the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (for example, as supplied
to JobCentre Plus by a young person claiming benefits). In this way,
Connexions services can maintain accurate and comprehensive
records&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08022014000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">The point is
that that can be done without the young person&#146;s explicit
consent. Amendment No. 22 would provide that the information should be
supplied only</div>
					<a name="08022014000391"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;if the
person to whom the information relates has given written consent that
such information can be
supplied&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08022014000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
104 says much the same, and amendment No. 105 would provide that the
young person concerned should have</div>
					<a name="08022014000392"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the right to examine any relevant
information requested by a local authority or other person before that
information is provided by the Secretary of State to the authority or
other
person.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08022014000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
the purpose of the supply of information is entirely to provide advice
and guidance to assist the business of promoting participation, it
seems irrefutable that permission should form part of the process. If
someone wished to receive advice, they would be happy for information
to be passed between the agencies that might be best placed to offer
it. On that basis, I expect the Minister to find the amendments highly
seductive. They build upon the sentiment that he has expressed that the
provision is about helping people, taking them with us, encouraging
them and providing them with all the guidance they need.</div>
					<a name="08022014000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">All the amendments would ensure
that personally sensitive information could be disclosed only with an
individual&#146;s consent. That is especially important given recent
history&#151;the Committee will not need reminding of it, but I shall
do so none the less. The Government have had a pretty poor track
record. I do not blame the Minister, although I have no doubt that he
accepts collective responsibility for the failures and the
Government&#146;s very sorry record on handling data. My wife
received a letter saying that her own personal data had been spread far
and wide without permission or due cause. You can imagine the shock
waves that went through the Hayes household as a result, Mr.
Bercow.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column502" />Column number: 502</div>
					<a name="08022014000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">In that
context, it is not unreasonable for parliamentarians to have doubts
about the storage and transmission of sensitive data. As the hon.
Member for Yeovil made clear earlier, that data may be very sensitive.
I intervened on him to point out that Connexions deals not only with
advice and guidance on careers, but with a number of other aspects of
support for young people, including advice on drugs, sexual health and
other highly personal matters. Given that the Connexions database is to
lie at the heart of the process, hon. Members will understand that our
concerns and doubts are exaggerated by the fact that we know that many
young people currently dealing with Connexions are doing so because
they have some kind of challenge or problem. The purpose of the
amendment is clear, and its attractiveness to the Government should be
plain.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022014000563"></a>Mr.
Heald:
						</b> Does my hon. Friend envisage that the individual
concerned would be able to ask for reassurances about how information
would be treated in its transfer from the Secretary of State to a local
authority? For example, would it be possible for the individual to say,
&#147;Look, I don&#146;t want this just to be stuck in the Royal
Mail on a disc,&#148; or, &#147;I don&#146;t want it to be
couriered round London on the back of a motorbike.&#148;? Does he
feel that we should ask for assurances that the information will be
safe?</div>

							<a name="08022014000564"></a>Mr.
Hayes:
						</b> Or, indeed, left in the back of a car on a laptop
computer, only to be stolen. My hon. Friend&#146;s points are
reasonable. How information is stored and the security measures and
protocols that are put in place are critical. The more involvement and
empowerment we can offer individuals as a means of providing the
necessary checks and balances that my hon. Friend suggests, the
better.</div>

					<a name="08022014000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I said, the amendments are clear; their attractiveness to the
Government is plain, and I believe that they are extremely helpful.
Given the tone and tenor of today&#146;s debate so far&#151;my hon.
Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, who is well known
in this House and increasingly in this Committee for his generosity,
even temper and measured approach to all that he does, became at some
point if not alarmed then certainly gravely concerned&#151;I think
that the Minister had better accept these amendments as a way of
re-establishing the measured mood that my hon. Friend normally
exemplifies.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022014000565"></a>Mr.
Heald:
						</b> May I make just one point? It is one thing for this
type of information to be transferred from the Secretary of State to
the local authority if somebody has gone missing and if it is an
individual case where it is necessary for, say, the Connexions service
to have information about where someone is. I would not be so concerned
personally about an individual exercise of that sort. However, if what
is being proposed is that all the information for all the young people
in the age group concerned will just be sent en bloc to local
authorities right around the country, without any event that triggers
that transfer such as a person not being able to be found or whatever,
I would be concerned.</div>
					<a name="08022014000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">Can the Minister give some
assurance that the exercise will concentrate on individuals, that the
information transferred will be the information relating 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column503" />Column number: 503</div>to an individual, and that this process will not
just involve mass transfers of information between Government
Departments? While he is at it, can he also assure us about the
security of the method of transfer? I ask that because, as my hon.
Friend the Member for South Holland and The Deepings said, there have
recently been some examples of very shoddy
security.</div>

							<a name="08022014000566"></a>Jim
Knight:
						</b> It is obviously a delight for the Committee to
listen again to the dulcet tones and poetry of the hon. Member for
South Holland and The Deepings after such a long interlude, and we were
all sad to hear of the loss of Mrs. Hayes&#146;s
data.</div>
					<a name="08022014000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">Provision
in clause 61 empowers Government Departments to pass information about
a young person to the Connexions service in order to support young
people to participate. Amendment No. 105 would mean that the young
person would have the right to examine that information before it was
released. As I have explained in relation to previous amendments, young
people already have rights of access to personal data held about them
under the Data Protection Act 1998, and they can make a request under
the Act for a copy of any personal information held by any
organisation. They could make this same request of Jobcentre Plus and
the Connexions provider before or after any information had been
passed.</div>
					<a name="08022014000265"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me address
the question about data transfers that the hon. Members for South
Holland and The Deepings and for North-East Hertfordshire have raised.
In practice, the social security information that is shared is that of
16 and 17-year-olds and it takes place locally between the local
Jobcentre Plus and the local Connexions service. It is shared on an
individual basis, when a 16 or 17-year-old turns up at the local
Connexions or Jobcentre Plus offices. It is a requirement if someone is
in receipt of jobseeker&#146;s allowance that they are registered
with Connexions. Effectively, the individual must have a form stamped
by Connexions that says that they have been registered with the
service; that is a mechanism by which that transfer of information
takes place, via the individual themselves. There is also a national
feed on young people aged 18 and 19 on a consent basis.</div>
					<a name="08022014000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">That information is uploaded on
to the national Connexions customer information system website, which
is managed by the Department for Children, Schools and Families, and
the data are then separated into individual area files and distributed
via the website to local Connexions services. The website is, of
course, secure and not open to public access. Only named individuals
with appropriate access rights within the Connexions service are able
to access data for their own area. All CCIS databases conform to the
requirements of the Data Protection Act. I hope that that gives hon.
Members all the information that they need on data
transfer.</div>
					<a name="08022014000267"></a><div class="hs_Para">Turning
to the matter of obtaining young people&#146;s consent before
disclosing information, as I said in response to previous amendments
and just now, it is a condition of 16 and 17-year-olds claiming certain
benefits that they are in contact with Connexions, so that we can be
sure they are getting the help and support that they need. On the vast
majority of occasions, the young person is happy to register
voluntarily with Connexions, so personal information does not need to
be passed without their consent. Where a young person is reluctant 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column504" />Column number: 504</div>to register, it is necessary that Jobcentre Plus has the power in the
clause to pass to Connexions these young people&#146;s name, address
and date of birth without obtaining consent. This enables Connexions
personal advisors to contact the young person to ensure that they have
access to appropriate support. That will be increasingly important as
we move towards full
participation.</div>
					<a name="08022014000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">Eighteen
to 19-year-olds do not have to be in contact with Connexions in order
to claim certain benefits. It is none the less vital that Connexions
learns about them from Jobcentre Plus as soon as they claim, as they
will invariably not be in employment, education or training. We will
have the best chance of re-engaging them if Connexions is in a position
to provide them with appropriate support without delay. Although in
practice the vast majority of 18 and 19-year-old claimants, like other
young people, view the service provided by Connexions positively and
give consent, there are a few young people&#151;often those most
disaffected&#151;who may be more resistant. The power provided by the
clause means that Connexions can identify and inform them again of the
type of support available.</div>
					<a name="08022014000269"></a><div class="hs_Para">Accepting the amendments would
add bureaucracy and complexity to the system, and could delay or
prevent Connexions from intervening to support young people. For the
Connexions service to work effectively, it needs accurate and
up-to-date information on who young people are, what they are doing and
how to contact them. The information that Jobcentre Plus provides is
particularly valuable because young people become much more mobile from
the age of 16 and are therefore more difficult to track. In essence, we
can intervene much earlier if we have early information transfer rather
than having to go through a process of obtaining consent in every
case.</div>
					<a name="08022014000270"></a><div class="hs_Para">Returning to the
point made about the Data Protection Act, in my view, the protection is
adequate and we do not need to add to the legislation, either by
explicitly requiring consent or by inserting other forms of protection
in the Bill. I hope that, in light of my reasoning, the hon. Member for
South Holland and The Deepings, who is a reasonable man, will withdraw
his
amendments.</div>
					<a name="08022014000271"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022014000567"></a>Mr.
Hayes:
						</b> I do not buy the Minister&#146;s argument because
the essence of his case was that when someone claims jobseeker&#146;s
allowance, there is an automatic process by which they are referred to
Connexions, which is about trying to marry them with appropriate
opportunities. However, they are making an application for
jobseeker&#146;s allowance: by their own choice, of their own will,
they are beginning a process which is, understandably, about both
receiving a benefit and attempting to get a job, with the advice that
goes with that.</div>
					<a name="08022014000272"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
anxiety about the provisions in the Bill is that the duties in the Bill
on local authorities are not solely about providing advice and
guidance; they are about promoting and, indeed, ensuring participation.
The process is therefore very different, and it is not entirely
reasonable to apply the same logic to such a very different process.
The measure is not necessarily about the voluntary acceptance of
advice; it is about the promotion of a duty to participate. To that
end, I think that the protection&#151;the check and balance, as I
described it&#151;of asking for people&#146;s permission to share
information about them is entirely
reasonable.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column505" />Column number: 505</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022014000568"></a>Jim
Knight:
						</b> I will have one more go at persuading the hon.
Gentleman. Does he accept that, by definition, someone who is claiming
benefits is not in education, employment or training and that it is
desirable for them to be so? If he does, he will acknowledge that it is
desirable to ensure that we have taken every opportunity to give them
the support that they need. Therefore, a simple transfer of
information, so that we can intervene as early as possible to give them
support and to get them off benefits and into reasonable training, with
or without work, is good. The provisions are therefore
proportionate.</div>
					<a name="08022014000274"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022014000569"></a>Mr.
Hayes:
						</b> I start from the assumption that increasing
participation is good. We have established that in our deliberations
thus far. We have found common ground because we think that it is good
for young people to be trained, guided and advised, to encourage them
to increase their employability. There is no doubt about that, but the
issue that has created disagreement throughout the Committee is
compulsion. The reason why there is sensitivity this morning about
information is the relationship between information and
compulsion&#151;the way in which the information might be used. That
sensitivity has permeated the discussions about amendments this
morning.</div>
					<a name="08022014000275"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022014000570"></a>Jim
Knight:
						</b> I shall have another go. We will make it clear
that the CCIS is to be used for support, not for
enforcement.</div>
					<a name="08022014000276"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022014000571"></a>Mr.
Hayes:
						</b> That is what the Minister said when he intervened
on my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton half an
hour ago. The Minister described the clarity of the guidance that he
will offer. However, the amendment would introduce an extra protection
to the Bill, and given that he has told us that the vast majority of
young people would readily agree to the information being shared
because it would be in their interests, and so, given that he is
dealing only with a few&#151;those were his words&#151;young people
who might be recalcitrant, he is effectively saying that he would
resist the amendment, which would check the excessive use of
information and power that it might engender, for the sake of a handful
of young people who would not agree to have the information shared
anyway.</div>
					<a name="08022014000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">Participation
is best ensured by the encouragement, willingness and commitment of
young people to engage&#151;to be part of a process. A critical part
of that process is advice and guidance, and part of advice and guidance
is sharing information properly. Of course, we believe all that, but we
are not sure that a degree of commitment is not assisted by an
amendment suggesting that if one does not want the information shared,
it will not be, and that if one does, one has to give written
permission.</div>
					<a name="08022014000278"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is
not such a big deal; it is not an alarming change to the
Government&#146;s proposals. It is a modest, sensible and cautious
change that the Government might be wise to accept. Unless the Minister
can offer to me more than he did to my hon. Friend the Member for
Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, which was a fairly woolly pledge of
guidance, we shall press amendment No. 22 to a vote, as a means of
illustrating that sovereignty in such matters lies with young people,
and that their rights must be protected.</div>

tones or poetry in this set of amendments, Mr. Bercow. Very
briefly, clause 61 effectively replicates the provisions of clause 15,

					<a name="08022014000302"></a><div class="hs_Para">The purpose

will return to this when we consider part 2 of the Bill, which deals
with the transfer to local authorities of responsibility for the
Connexions service, but it is important that we say that this transfer
is planned to take place. As local authorities start planning how to
deliver Connexions services, we encourage them to look for the best
potential providers, including those in the voluntary and community
sector and in the private sector.</div>
					<a name="08022014000307"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some
organisations have a splendid track record with particular groups of
vulnerable young people&#151;several members of the Committee have
been particularly concerned about that&#151;and it is important we
use their expertise in delivering Connexions services. Many existing
Connexions partnerships were doing a good job, so we wanted authorities
to be able to make arrangements with the existing partnership, if they
concluded, in accordance with their procurement rules, that that was
best for the area. I therefore do not want to do anything to prevent
those arrangements from continuing. In addition, they are an important
part of freedoms and flexibilities the centre&#151;the
Government&#151;have promised to local government. It is vital that
Connexions, whether delivered directly by a local authority or under
contractual arrangements by other providers, can provide the right
support quickly to young people. If the information that may be
disclosed under these clauses could be passed directly only to local
authorities, it would almost certainly lead to delays in the provision
of that support in most local authority areas. I hope that that is
straightforward enough for the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and
Littlehampton in explaining what the purpose is behind this
clause.</div>

party, perhaps one of the organisations that we took evidence from,

							<a name="08022014000591"></a>Jim

						</b> No, I do not think that it is anyone who purports
to be. It would have to be someone where it is relevant. We have
discussed the notions of people&#146;s responsibilities under the
European convention on human rights and the Human Rights Act 1998 and
the various responsibilities on public bodies as they pass data to be
satisfied that it is proportionate and relevant. Therefore it would not
be an organisation that &#147;purports&#148; to be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column508" />Column number: 508</div>but one that is genuinely involved in the provision of the service. In
respect of the word and the specific question from the hon. Member for

them to be involved. I hope that that reassures the hon. Member for

						</b> I am grateful. The Minister has hastily brought back
his argument from the brink by adding that assurance that there should
be some form of contract. As my hon. Friend the Member for North-East
Hertfordshire so wisely pointed out, that word &#147;involved&#148;
would enable any person who purported to be helping young people to
have access to this very sensitive information. There is a tendency in
all Governments to give themselves the benefit of the doubt in the
wording of extensive provisions relating to powers for Government and
local authority bodies. It would have been better if the provision had
been worded more tightly to confine it to those that had a contract
with the local authority in the provision of services in pursuance of
clause 54.</div>

to an extent defined and refined the meaning of &#147;other person
involved&#148;. On the basis that the matter has been aired and we
have some helpful words from the Minister on the record, I beg to ask

							<a name="08022014000595"></a>Mr.
Gibb:
						</b> Clause 16 is the most terrifying of all the
data-sharing clauses in the Bill. It is made more terrifying still by
the words in the explanatory notes. The clause says that any of the
state organisations listed in subsection (2) can supply information
that they hold on a 16 or 17-year-old to the local authority 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column509" />Column number: 509</div>to help the authority fulfil the duties that the Bill imposes on it. The
organisations are a local authority, the Learning and Skills Council
for England, a primary care trust, a strategic health authority, a
chief officer of police, a local probation board, and a youth offending
team. Information could therefore include a person&#146;s health
records, their criminal records, their involvement with the youth
offending team and details of how such programmes are
working.</div>
					<a name="08022014000321"></a><div class="hs_Para">One might
think that there were rules and regulations to prevent certain aspects
of a person&#146;s health records from being disclosed, but we then
have the chilling words on page 10 of the explanatory notes, which
state:</div>
					<a name="08022014000396"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Clause
16 sets out which other public bodies may share information about a
young person with a local education authority in order for it to fulfil
its duty. The purpose of the clause is to allow public bodies to
provide information to local education authorities where other
statutory provisions would prevent their doing
so.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08022014000322"></a><div class="hs_Para">All the sections in
all the Acts over the years that were designed to safeguard the
confidentiality of sensitive personal information held by GPs,
hospitals, the probation service and the police will therefore be
rendered worthless for 16 and 17-year-olds as a result of this one
clause in the Bill.</div>
					<a name="08022014000323"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
we have debated, the provisions in clause 16, together with all the
other information-sharing provisions, have attracted the interest of
the Joint Committee on Human Rights. The Committee is looking at the
Bill and is concerned about whether such provisions are consistent with
the right to respect for private and family life.</div>
					<a name="08022014000324"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister responded at
length to those concerns, but on whether the measures in clause 16 are
proportionate to the Government&#146;s aims, he
said:</div>
					<a name="08022014000397"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
information that public bodies hold is crucial to ensuring that the
data in the database used by Connexions is accurate. Not having this
information leaves a risk that the support offered is not the most
appropriate for a young person; some agencies may have dealings with a
particular young person but would be unable to share that information
with the Connexions
service.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08022014000325"></a><div class="hs_Para">The implication
is that the data are simply being used by Connexions to help advise
young people. If that were the case, it would still be disproportionate
and would, at the very least, necessitate the young person&#146;s
consenting to information about his health or involvement with the
police being supplied. Clause 16 is not, however, just about the
Connexions service; that would be the case if were debating clause 61.
Clause 16 relates to</div>
					<a name="08022014000398"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;enabling or assisting the
authority to exercise its functions under this
Part&#148;&#151;</div>
					<a name="08022014000326"></a><div class="hs_Para">that is,
its duty to promote participation. That is far wider than the duties in
clause 54.</div>
					<a name="08022014000327"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister says:</div>
					<a name="08022014000399"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;some
agencies may have dealings with a particular young person but would be
unable to share that information with the Connexions
service.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08022014000328"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I said, we
are not talking just about the Connexions service. However, some of the
agencies that have dealings with a young person should not be able to
share information with Connexions or, indeed, with the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column510" />Column number: 510</div>local authority or other agencies. Health records and details of
involvement with the police should be sacrosanct. We await the Joint
Committee&#146;s report, but I have serious concerns about the
Bill&#146;s data-sharing provisions in general and clause 16 in
particular. I am alarmed by the cavalier response in the
Minister&#146;s letter to the hon. Member for
Hendon.</div>
					<a name="08022014000329"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
Nos. 23 and 24 introduced into clause 16 the requirement that the
information requested is proportionate to the Government&#146;s aims,
and amendment No. 13 introduces a similar provision into clause 62.
Article 8 of the European convention on human rights protects the
rights to private and family life, and that is a qualified right, as we
debated on the previous clause. The Government can breach that right,
provided that the breach has a basis in law and is done to secure one
of the permissible aims set out in paragraph 2 of article 8. According
to that paragraph, a breach may be made for reasons of</div>
					<a name="08022014000400"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;national security, public safety
or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of
disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the
protection of the rights and freedoms of
others.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08022014000330"></a><div class="hs_Para">The other
condition is that a breach is</div>
					<a name="08022014000401"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;necessary in a democratic
society&#148;,</div>
					<a name="08022014000331"></a><div class="hs_Para">which means
that it must fulfil a pressing social need and must be proportionate to
the Government&#146;s aims, and that is the consideration that the
amendments would introduce into the Bill. They introduce a requirement
that a breach of article 8 must be made for wider social aims and be
proportionate to those aims.</div>
					<a name="08022014000332"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is interesting that the
Government have included that requirement in clause 35 on parenting
orders. Clause 35(8) says:</div>
					<a name="08022014000402"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The second condition is
that any interference with family life which is likely to result from
the attendance of the parent at a residential course is proportionate
in all the
circumstances.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08022014000333"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is a
clear reference to the human rights legislation for a lesser breach of
human rights&#151;attending a residential course&#151;than that
contained in the sharing of sensitive personal
information.</div>
					<a name="08022014000416"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.45
pm</div>
					<a name="08022014000334"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
said that that provision was superfluous in relation to these clauses.
Is it not, therefore, superfluous in relation to clause 35? Perhaps the
drafters of the legislation in chapter 4 have a more profound
understanding of the importance of human rights and the right to a
private and family life than the drafters of this part of the Bill, who
take a less sanguine view of the importance of these
matters.</div>
					<a name="08022014000335"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022014000596"></a>Mr.
Laws:
						</b> I am not sure I would say that I am terrified by the
clause because it takes an awful lot to terrorise and terrify a Liberal
Democrat. However, I am extremely worried about the contents of what is
a sweeping clause, as the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and
Littlehampton explained. I am very attracted to the amendments that he
has tabled. If we do not receive a satisfactory response from the
Minister, I hope that he will press the amendment to a
Division.</div>
					<a name="08022014000336"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause gives open-ended powers to a wide range of authorities that go
well beyond the education sector and will allow the release of
information to a local authority or to persons or bodies that have
responsibilities 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column511" />Column number: 511</div>under the Bill. This matter takes us back to some of
our earlier concerns about the type of data that are likely to pass
backwards and forwards as a consequence of trying to support young
people in education and training and in meeting the obligations imposed
by the Bill. I do not want to anticipate the questions that I will have
for the Minister when debating amendment No. 60, which deals with the
bodies that have a responsibility for health matters. I think that
there is a need for more adequate protection against the abuse of these
powers than is in the
clause.</div>
					<a name="08022014000337"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
would like the Minister to clarify two points. Will he indicate which
of these powers are currently available for young people below the age
of 16? In other words, are there powers such as these for under-16s who
are not in education or training&#151;they may be persistently absent
or truanting&#151;so that information from such bodies can be
accessed in order that educational establishments can exercise their
existing
responsibilities?</div>
					<a name="08022014000338"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
a specific point, is information held by employees of the organisations
that are listed in the clause that is held not in their workplaces but
at home addresses covered by the data protections that the Minister
indicated earlier? There have been cases in my constituency where very
specific and sensitive allegations have been made about young people,
often in relation to child protection issues, and data have been held
in a home setting by employees of organisations such as those listed.
Will the data protections that the Minister referred earlier relate to
such data?</div>
					<a name="08022014000339"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
the Minister will respond to the wise words of the hon. Member for
Bognor Regis and Littlehampton and his cautionary note and that, by the
end of the Minister&#146;s speech, we will be less terrified, or in
my case less moderately worried, about the contents of the clause. If
not, it may be necessary for the hon. Gentleman to press the amendment
to a
Division.</div>

							<a name="08022014000597"></a>Jim
Knight:
						</b> As with the other provisions that we have
discussed under this chapter, local authorities will use the
information that they receive from other public bodies to help them
identify young people who are not participating. It will be used to
identify the most appropriate support for those young people so that
they can be helped back into learning as soon as possible. As we have
discussed, the sharing of information is critical to the effective
provision of services to young people and it enables coherent services
to be delivered. The amendments propose specific references, in clauses
16 and 62, to the need for the supply of information by public bodies
to be proportionate to the purpose for which it is requested. As we
discussed with the amendments to clauses 15 and 61, article 8 of the
European convention on human rights requires that information can be
supplied only as far as is necessary and proportionate to the purposes
that it will serve, which are to enable or assist local authorities to
fulfil their duties to promote participation and identify young people
not participating and to provide the Connexions
service&#151;&#151;</div>

paragraph.</div>
					<a name="08022014000343"></a><div class="hs_Para">My letter to
the Joint Committee on Human Rights details our consideration of the
aims and proportionality 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column512" />Column number: 512</div>of the provisions. Public bodies such as those listed in clauses 16 and
62 may be providing services to a young person that would be relevant
to the support that young person is receiving from the Connexions
service. Disclosure of information would take place only if it was
proportionate to the aim of increasing participation in education and
training.</div>
					<a name="08022014000344"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022014000600"></a>Mr.
Hayes:
						</b> There we have it. Having spent two hours telling us
that the only purpose, or at least the only serious purpose, for
collecting and sharing this information was to provide advice and
guidance through the Connexions service, the Minister then reads a
pre-prepared note, which I presume he wrote last night, which says that
the purpose of collecting and sharing this information is to promote,
and indeed enforce, participation. So it is not reasonable to suggest
that this is entirely about efficacy; this is about enforcement and
thus the tone of the amendments proposed by my hon.
Friend&#151;</div>

was</div>
					<a name="08022014000403"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;which are to enable
or assist local authorities to fulfil their duties to promote
participation and identify young people not
participating&#148;</div>
					<a name="08022014000347"></a><div class="hs_Para">so that
they can be provided with a Connexions service. That is not so that
something can be enforced against them but because the purpose of this
whole part concerns the local authority&#146;s duty to support young
people to fulfil their duties to
participate.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022014000603"></a>Mr.

						</b> The Minister is stretching the credulity of the
Committee to its very limits. Is he really saying that identification
of non-participants is purely to give them advice and could never be
used to ensure that non-participants do participate in line with the
statutory responsibilities and powers of local
authorities?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022014000604"></a>Jim
Knight:
						</b> I can tell the hon. Gentleman that the purposes of
identifying young people who are not participating is to provide them
with support. The personal adviser would make contact with the young
person, discuss their support needs and seek to broker those support
needs for them. Subsequently, at some point down the track, there may
be a conversation that takes place because that person refuses that
support, but that is not because of the initial transfer of data. The
initial transfer of data was in order to inform their support
needs.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022014000605"></a>Mr.
Laws:
						</b> Is the Minister saying, for example, that the
provision relating to the police could not be used to ask the police to
give information that would help the local authority to pursue an
individual who is not complying with their responsibilities under the
Bill and pursue that person, potentially through an enforcement route,
for not being in the education and training
sectors?</div>

							<a name="08022014000606"></a>Jim
Knight:
						</b> In that we are going to issue guidance to say this
should be used for support rather than enforcement, the purpose of the
police and other criminal justice-related bodies being listed here is
in order for that support to understand the circumstances of that young
person. If they are involved with a youth offending team, that
information is extremely relevant for people in understanding what they
are dealing with and the support that is
needed.</div>

confirming that a local authority would never go to the police, in
relation to a young person who was not complying with the
responsibility to be in education or training and who had perhaps
disappeared from their home address, to ask them to identify where that
individual might be or whether they were in contact with some part of
the existing police organisation in order to help the local authority
to track them down and take enforcement action against
them?</div>

guidance that we will set out how this measure should be used. In the

if I am wrong, but my understanding is that guidance cannot overrule
the provisions of primary legislation. If primary legislation gives
local authorities the power to request the information&#151;it says
explicitly in the Bill 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column514" />Column number: 514</div>that that is for the purpose of part 1, that is clauses 1 to

the reality in which this measure works. I cannot foresee that some

cost of chasing around trying to enforce things left, right and centre.
The reality is that the whole enforcement issue, which we have debated
