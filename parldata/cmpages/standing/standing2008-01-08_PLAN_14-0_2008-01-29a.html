						<b class="B">
							<a name="08013068000473"></a>The
Minister for Local Government (John Healey):
						</b> Welcome back,
Mr. Illsley. I am glad to see that you are in rude
health.</div>
					<a name="08013068000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
was setting out the way in which an obligation is formally registered
as a land charge. It serves as a permanent restriction on the land,
whereby that planning obligation will transfer to any successor in
title who owns that land. The amendment would remove the need for a
person to be interested in land in order to conclude a planning
obligation with the local authority. Therefore, the planning
obligation, which hon. Members are concerned about, would not attach to
particular land in the way that it currently does under section 106 of
the Town and Country Planning Act
1990.</div>
					<a name="08013068000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
began my remarks by saying that I have some sympathy with the proposal
and recognise that this concern has been raised by practitioners. I
recognise that under section 106, a developer who is seeking to acquire
an interest in land through a compulsory purchase order cannot enter
into a planning obligation, while at the same time the existence of a
planning obligation may be an important factor in deciding whether a
local planning authority grants that planning permission in the first
place.</div>
					<a name="08013068000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
practice, the way through that problem is generally that the developer
negotiates the terms of the section 106 obligation before acquiring the
land and submits in draft for the approval of a local planning
authority. The planning authority then comes to a preliminary view on
the application and indicates whether it is minded to approve the
application, subject to a prior completion of a planning obligation.
Assuming that it is minded to grant consent, the applicant then goes
about securing an interest in the land, which can take the form of a
legal option to purchase the land, subject to the planning permission
being granted. Often, in such circumstances, those three elements are
brought together and concluded simultaneously.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column522" />Column number: 522</div>
					<a name="08013068000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although
that process can be cumbersome, the alternative approach that would be
put in place by the amendment, not just for major infrastructure
projects under the infrastructure planning commission but much more
widely under the Town and Country Planning Act system, would cause more
problems than it would solve. The mechanism of a planning obligation
relies on a charge being placed on the land, which makes the terms of
the obligation enforceable against subsequent owners of it. That works
because any prospective purchaser gets notice of the planning
obligation before buying the land and is fully aware of the burdens or
responsibilities that come with it. At the same time, the purchaser
gets the benefit of the planning permission issued in relation to the
planning
obligation.</div>
					<a name="08013068000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
contrast to that, the amendment would allow persons to enter into
planning obligations even when they do not own an interest in the land
in question. It would therefore be impossible to place a land charge on
the land. That would make enforcement increasingly problematic,
particularly if there was a change of ownership. A planning obligation
in those circumstances would be more like a personal contract that is
enforceable against the original parties but would not be passed on to
subsequent land
owners.</div>
					<a name="08013068000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although
I accept that the procedures that are necessary under the existing
section 106 terms can be rather awkward, the answer is not to alter
fundamentally the nature of a planning obligation from a covenant
attached to the land to a contract that is more personal in nature. I
hope that I have given the hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst
sufficient reassurance and that he will withdraw the
amendment.</div>

Healey:
						</b> These two amendments are technical amendments for
the purposes of what might be termed integrating new categories of
blight within the general blight provisions of the Town and Country
Planning Act. A national policy statement which identifies a location
as either suitable or potentially suitable for a big infrastructure
project may, of course, create blight at that location, reducing land
values and making it harder to sell the land. Blight may also result
from an application being made for an order granting
development consent, which authorises the compulsory acquisition of the
land through the IPC. This clause is therefore intended to
enable people in those circumstances to gain access to the normal
provisions set out in statute in the Town and Country Planning Act.
Those are provisions whereby people whose land is blighted can obtain
compensation. The amendments make a couple of changes that are needed
to make that work properly.</div>
					<a name="08013068000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
445 gives the Secretary of State the power to acquire land when a valid
blight notice is served as a result of a national policy statement.
Having the power in practice means that the Secretary of State is
obliged to purchase the land when a valid blight notice is served.
Without the amendment, there would be no one to whom the owners of the
land could sell their land. Amendment No. 446 is another technical
amendment which identifies the appropriate enactment. Essentially it
ensures that people would get the compensation to which they should be
entitled for any loss in the value of their property due to blight. It
allows us to define the appropriate enactment for compensation in the
case of national policy statements and nationally significant
infrastructure projects. Both amendments are important. They
ensure that we get the framework right. I commend them to the
Committee.</div>

					<a name="08013068000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope to be
able to give the hon. Member for North Cornwall some
reassurance on our ongoing commitment to consultation with the public.
The amendments would change the proposed amendment of the Planning and
Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 under the clause so that statements of
community involvement remain subject to public examination. How best we
carry out public examination is the key to this issue. In practice,
examination is done by the Planning
Inspectorate.</div>
					<a name="08013068000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
first reason for wishing to remove the public examination of statements
of community involvement is that the process is very costly and
time-consuming for local authorities. That is not the main reason, but
it is a reason. They should be getting on with genuine engagement with
the community and not preparing for legalistic hearings or written
representations with the Planning Inspectorate, which local authorities
tell us they are invariably doing at the moment. The process also takes
up a great deal of inspectorate resources. Most importantly, the
Planning Inspectorate is not the best organisation to assess community
engagement.</div>
					<a name="08013068000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">Officials
are in discussion with the Audit Commission to see how the proposed
comprehensive area assessment process will assess engagement overall. I
think that that might be a better way forward. We want to see community
engagement joined up across the local authority to reduce duplication
and make matters easier for the public to understand. A joined-up
strategy for this 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column525" />Column number: 525</div>matter would be sensible, rather than having
different compartments. Having a separate public examination for
planning matters is something of a hindrance. With that reassurance, I
hope that the hon. Member for North Cornwall will withdraw the
amendment.</div>

fit to contact members of the Committee with its concerns. No doubt
there are many others, representing many people across the country, who
feel that there are shortcomings in the consultation procedure. The
Minister has set out ways in which he feels that the process can be
made more effective but remain meaningful. With those assurances and on
the basis that that is delivered, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the

local people and local authorities spend a great deal of time
developing a local development plan&#151;amendments have been tabled
to try to streamline that system, because the Government&#146;s Act
has not delivered the development plans with the speed that they
wanted&#151;which then collides with an infrastructure project, to
which they have rooted objections, the local development framework will
not necessarily fit nicely into the national policy statement. I hope
that the Government have thought that through. We have tabled the
amendment so that they can share their thoughts with us on which would
win: local communities or the
Government?</div>

							<a name="08013068000485"></a>Mr.
Dhanda:
						</b> I hope that everyone can be a winner. I do not
think that the hon. Member for Beckenham&#146;s amendment is
draconian; it asks some fair questions about how everything fits
together, and I will attempt to make that clearer in the next few
minutes.</div>
					<a name="08013068000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
proposes to amend the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 to give
precedence in the town and country planning system to national policy
statements over all other planning documents or guidance. That is why
the hon. Lady was suggesting that it was perhaps draconian, but that is
what it does.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column526" />Column number: 526</div>
					<a name="08013068000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">Were the
intention of the amendment to facilitate the progress of renewable
projects through the town and country planning system, which it is
not&#151;although, reading through it, it could have been&#151;I
would have had some sympathy for the outcome. But I consider that the
amendment would be inappropriate and
unnecessary.</div>
					<a name="08013068000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under
the town and country planning system, there is already a statutory
requirement for regional planning bodies and local planning authorities
to have regard to national policies and guidance when preparing their
local development plans. Therefore, under the Bill, once a national
policy statement is published it should be fully reflected in relevant
development plans, regional spatial strategies and local development
frameworks.</div>
					<a name="08013068000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under
the town and country planning system, planning authorities decide on
applications in accordance with the development plan, unless material
considerations dictate otherwise. That means that the relevant national
policy statement would influence local authority decisions below the
threshold for the IPC, if it contained policy that applied to
infrastructure generally, and not solely to nationally significant
developments. Decisions by the relevant authority on any non-nationally
significant infrastructure projects would be made in accordance with
the development plan, which would need to reflect national policy,
including the relevant national policy
statement.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08013068000486"></a>Mrs.
Lait:
						</b> I perceive a circular argument here. Given
that it will take some time for national policy
statements to be put in place and that part of the purpose of the Bill
is to speed up the local development framework process, if a local
authority area is affected by a big infrastructure project, as foreseen
under the national policy statements, will it have to assume that it
will have an infrastructure project without knowing, or will it have to
start going through it again? Would an infrastructure project not be
regarded as significant enough for the LDF to be redrawn, given that a
lot of the amendments would make minor changes to the LDF, so that the
whole process would not have to open again? I hope that the Minister
sees why I am saying that it is a slightly circular argument, and it
would be useful if we could break the
circle.</div>

							<a name="08013068000487"></a>Mr.

						</b> It is important to get across that local
development plans need to consider everything in the
national policy statement&#151;I hope that I am
getting that across to the hon. Member for Beckenham. Perhaps her
perspective is that the two must be in conflict with each other. From
my experience of local development plans, they are not some kind of
one-hit wonder, but evolve over time, and it is really important that
they evolve with consideration.</div>
					<a name="08013068000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Lady
has been quite specific about the possibility of a nationally
significant infrastructure project within a locality and how the two
fit together. I agree with her that it is important for that to be
taken into consideration, and I am sure that local authorities will
want to do so as part of their local development plans. In short,
existing arrangements will ensure that national policy statements are
taken into account when deciding relevant planning applications. I hope
that that is of help to the hon. Lady and that she will withdraw her
amendment.</div>

importance of flood defence and the need to take it into account in
future planning. On major projects and locally, we are at considerable
risk from flooding, as we have seen this summer and again more
recently, and much of the problem has been caused because the drainage
system has not been able to cope sufficiently. Although Committee
members will take it as read that sufficient precautions should be
taken in all future plans to ensure that our drainage systems are
adequate, given the importance of the perceived threat from flooding,
it would be useful and sensible for the Bill to include

largely by my hon. Friend the Minister for Local Government, who works
hard on the issue of flooding. At the same time, policy is evolving
around the Pitt review. Clause 147 is important, not least because of
its reference to a planning policy statement on climate change.

							<b class="B">Alun
Michael</b> (Cardiff, South and Penarth)
(Lab/Co-op): My hon. Friend the
Minister&#146;s application amendments are to a clause that deals
primarily with the determination of planning applications by officers.
The Government amendments also refer to the determination of such
applications by members of the council.</div>
					<a name="08013068000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon.
Friend rightly said that sometimes those issues will be controversial.
For that reason, I should be grateful if he would spell out the
responsibilities of councillors for communication in respect of
planning issues of this sort and others. Does he agree with me that an
important part of the role of the local councillor is communication
with local people? On the one hand, he must listen to local views and,
on the other, he must explain to people what is involved in an
application. That is important because there is often serious
misunderstanding about what is involved in a particular application,
particularly of the sort to which he has just referred, which has
already been a matter of some
controversy.</div>
					<a name="08013068000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">There was
an application in my constituency last summer for a facility to help in
the training of adults 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column529" />Column number: 529</div>with learning difficulties so that they could live
independently in the community. Some local residents thought that it
was going to house dangerous offenders. Terminology was misinterpreted,
as were details of the design. I am sure that you would appreciate,
Mr. Illsley, as any councillor or Member of Parliament
would, how febrile the atmosphere can become around what initially
looks to be a totally innocuous application or one in which the
controversy has already been dealt
with.</div>
				
					<a name="08013068000439"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.30
pm</div>
					<a name="08013068000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
approve of the emphasis that is placed by the Department on
pre-application consultation by the developer, but that is not a
universal panacea. In circumstances such as those that I have referred
to, no amount of emphasis on pre-application work would take away the
need for clarification and communication. A local councillor should be
engaged in that, even if he or she is a member of the planning
committee or in some cases the chair of it, as in the example that I
have referred to. Of course they need to be professional. We need to
avoid the impression of bias or prejudice, but in my experience, most
councillors understand that and are very professional and objective.
Indeed, recent research for the Department suggests that there is no
major problem in that
area.</div>
					<a name="08013068000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">What is worrying
is that local councillors, especially those who are members of the
planning committee, are being inhibited in carrying out their
democratic duties as elected representatives by advice that is
excessively restrictive and sometimes almost paranoid in nature. It
seems that some officers feel that the silent councillor is the only
type that they want to have around when it comes to planning issues. As
anybody who is involved in democratic processes in any political party
knows, a silent councillor is a dead councillor in political terms,
just as a silent Member of Parliament is a dead Member of
Parliament.</div>
					<a name="08013068000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will
my hon. Friend assure me that it is the Government&#146;s intention
that public opinion be a material factor in the planning process? Will
he assure me that the Government believe that councillors are under a
duty to engage with this process in a professional and responsible
manner, rather than by pretending to be Trappist monks? In the
light of that, will he look at the publications that sometimes appear
to be over-restrictive and over-cautious and at the advice that has
been given to some councillors by some council officials? I do not
pretend that that happens universally, but it is a serious
issue.</div>
					<a name="08013068000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have looked at what is in many ways a very good document, called
&#147;Constructive Talk&#148;. It has been drawn up by a series of
organisations with the encouragement of the Department and it quotes
Government advice. It
says:</div>
					<a name="08013068000433"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Government
advice is that Councillors should involve themselves in discussions
with developers, constituents and others about planning cases, provided
they observe the advice set out in Positive
Engagement&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08013068000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">&#147;Positive
Engagement&#148; is, again, not simply a partnership document,
although it bears the signature of a Minister, Baroness Andrews, as
well as that of Sir Sandy Bruce-Lockhart of the Local Government
Association, among others. It gives some really useful advice, but also
among the &#147;dos&#148; it states:</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column530" />Column number: 530</div>
					<a name="08013068000434"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Hold discussions before
a planning application is made, not after it has been submitted to the
authority&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08013068000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is a counsel of perfection. It is unrealistic to think that that can
happen in all circumstances. It may be right to try to do that as
frequently as possible, but there are many circumstances in which
issues emerge only after the application has been
made.</div>
					<a name="08013068000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">People
will rightly turn to their local councillor and expect them to listen
to their views and represent them. That does not mean that the
councillor will necessarily swing into the camp of being a campaigner
for or against something. It is that professionalism that is important.
That advice, which in my view appears to go a little too far, is as
nothing compared with the draconian advice to shut up and do nothing
that is being given to some councillors and that is making many
councillors feel that they are under a legal obligation not to carry
out their democratic duties. I am sure that is not the
Government&#146;s intention, and I hope that the Minister can say
something positive in response that will make that
clear.</div>
					<a name="08013068000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08013068000498"></a>Mrs.
Lait:
						</b> Does the right hon. Gentleman think that this stems
from the Standards Board advice about conflict of interest of
councillors and does he think that advice is
correct?</div>
					<a name="08013068000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08013068000499"></a>Alun
Michael:
						</b> It goes a little bit too far. As with
many aspects of proprieties&#151;perhaps I should
mention that I am a member of the Committee on Standards in Public
Life&#151;the principles of public life are principles of propriety,
whereas the public expect good decisions, good service and action from
their elected representatives. Of course, that activity on behalf of
constituents should be done with propriety at all times. Sometimes we
lose sight of quality while we are dealing with proprieties. I do not
diminish in any sense the importance of doing things properly,
correctly, without bias, objectively and all the rest. That is
massively important, but so is doing things well and being seen to
listen to the views of constituents. It is a question of getting the
balance right.</div>
					<a name="08013068000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">Observing the
proprieties and being careful not to give the impression of bias in
what we do is as important for a councillor as it is for Member of
Parliament, but so is the quality of the decision making, which means
being fully informed, among other things, of the public views on an
application. The visible representation of the interests of
constituents is also important for the good reputation of democracy as
well as the good reputation of the individual councillor. That should
not be removed if that individual is a member of, or even the chair of,
the planning committee. I have been the chair of a planning committee
myself and I know that, in that role, one must be very careful about
the words one uses. I do not think it should prevent anyone from
engaging with the people they represent.</div>
					<a name="08013068000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">Sometimes the advice of
officers can be too careful, so can that of officials in Government
Departments. Having had ministerial responsibility for planning, I can
say that from personal experience. That was in relation to Wales but
the point is the same. Abrogating the responsibility to listen to all
the arguments and to balance them in coming to the best possible
judgment is the right way forward: pretending that one can close off
all communications and that that is somehow safe is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column531" />Column number: 531</div>not. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will be
able to endorse this as the balanced way of dealing with the
responsibilities of councillors in relation to planning
matters.</div>
					<a name="08013068000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08013068000500"></a>Robert
Neill:
						</b> I very much agree with the right hon.
Gentleman. I hope that the Government will take on
board the point that this is not the first time that we have raised
this issue. There was quite a lengthy discussion during the Committee
stage of the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Bill.
The same points were made and they were generally accepted. It
certainly seems to most of us who have had experience of local
government and who have seen how it operates now that an excessive
restriction is placed upon members. Partly that is a result of the
perverse workings of some of the case-law decisions in relation to the
doctrine of predetermination. That has become something of a
stranglehold rather than a guarantee of probity in many respects. It
also stems from a gold-plating of cautiousness that is applied to the
advice that comes pretty much at all
levels.</div>
					<a name="08013068000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="08013068000501"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Richard Benyon</b> (Newbury) (Con): Does my hon. Friend also
agree that we are rather archaic in how we inform
members of the public about planning applications? For example, we
still require local authorities to inform on issues relating to listed
buildings through the local paper. We are led to believe that a
declining number of people read local papers, but there is no
requirement in law to put such information on the council website, for
example. My local authority would save &#163;65,000 a year if it was
allowed by law to modernise the way it imparts information to local
people on these important matters. That equates to about &#163;10
million for councils across the
country.</div>
					<a name="08013068000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08013068000502"></a>Robert
Neill:
						</b> My hon. Friend makes a useful point. Most local
authorities voluntarily publicise planning applications on their
website; the London borough of Bromley certainly does so and, as time
goes on, it must be the sensible way to proceed. However, that segment
of the population&#151; perhaps the more elderly people&#151;who
may not have access to the internet must be taken into consideration.
There is a balance to be struck and there may be more practical ways of
achieving our objective without increasing the considerable costs that
sometimes
arise.</div>
					<a name="08013068000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
right hon. Gentleman made a significant point about the importance of
planning decisions to many people and communities. In many localities,
planning issues are one of the key matters; they are as important as
anything else, especially in view of how local authority boundaries are
drawn. There may not be any other major issue in a ward, but planning
issues may arise. If the existence of an application in effect gags
local councillors from expressing views&#151;by keeping a sensible
balance and speaking with care&#151;on what is probably the most
important issue for their residents, it will have the perverse effect
of bringing local democracy into disrepute.</div>
					<a name="08013068000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">One example, which is not from
my constituency, was in a local authority ward where the big issue was
the potential development of a golf course. It was privately owned but
it was the main open space, the green lungs for people who lived in the
area.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column532" />Column number: 532</div>
					<a name="08013068000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">When elections
come round, planning is one of the key things that people want to know
about. Even between elections they ask, &#147;Where do our
councillors stand on this issue?&#148; It is pretty perverse if
councillors are told, &#147;If you tell your residents where you
stand, you can&#146;t say anything if you serve on the planning
committee because you might be seen to have predetermined the
issue.&#148; With respect to the people who drew up those rules, the
average man and woman in the street would say, &#147;That is absolute
nonsense. It stands democracy on its head.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08013068000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">The issues
were raised at some length by members from both sides of the Committee
in previous discussions in planning and local government Bills. The
Minister&#146;s predecessor, the current Minister for the
Environment, was sympathetic to a number of their concerns and there
was hope that the Government would look at them, but there is nothing
in this Bill that deals with those issues. However, I hope that the
Government will not lose sight of them because there is a general
groundswell on this important matter. We all want to strengthen local
government and local democracy and to remove a huge chunk of the work
on issues that affect people and to impose what, to the voter, are
artificial constraints that damage, without very good reason, the
institution that we seek to nurture.</div>
					<a name="08013068000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
the Minister listened carefully to what the right hon. Gentleman said
from his very great experience and that he accepts that we are not
making a partisan point. We want to find a constructive way forward
that would enable local councillors to exercise their democratic right
in a way that is consistent with their difficult role in planning
matters.</div>

						</b> I want to add my support to the comments made by
the right hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth. He is absolutely
right to raise the issue, which is of huge concern to
elected Members involved in the process but mystifying to those who
want to contact their local councillor to discuss matters. When I was a
councillor those rules were not in effect, but I know it is a source of
frustration to colleagues. I was fortunate in being able to say what I
wanted to. However, I do not know whether I should admit the fact that
I always managed to avoid planning training, so I did not have to go on
the development control committee at the
time.</div>

I was elected as a Member of Parliament, I have noticed the number of
times that people now come to their MP to express opinions. We have to
say, &#147;It is possible for me to write a letter but, to be honest
with you, the experts who are trained in planning are your local
members&#148;. Great investment has been made to ensure that elected
members of local authorities have the skills to consider these matters
appropriately, and it is utterly ludicrous that they cannot perform
their role as local ward members in addition. It cannot be beyond the
wit of those revisiting the issue to come up with a solution that meets
the need for fair decision making, but also reflects that important
part of the role of local authority
members.</div>
					<a name="08013068000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">I certainly
add my views to those of hon. Members who have already spoken. As the

						</b> This has been a useful debate. My right
hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth
has taken an interest in such matters for a number of years. In fact,
when he was a Minister, he had to help me with the odd planning
application or two I recall. The frank answer to his question is: yes,
public opinion is a material factor. It is important for local
government and local councillors to be involved in local consultation.
It is important to all politicians that we listen. The LGA is also very
helpful in producing guidance, and I am happy to point hon. Members in
that direction so that they can see some of the guidance that it has
produced in that
area.</div>
					<a name="08013068000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">Like
the hon. Member for North Cornwall, when I was a councillor, I too
steered clear of the planning committee. Little did I know that a few

way it goes
sometimes.</div>
					<a name="08013068000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">Briefly, on
the subject of websites, a lot can be done to use them, as well as
local newspapers, to get the message across. I am conscious also that
the clause is about local member review bodies. I, and other Labour
Members are keen on the idea of local members having greater
involvement. I dare say that we will come to that wider debate when we
come to the Opposition amendments tabled on the

						</b> The amendments deal with minor
corrections and changes to help improve the drafting of the Bill.
Proposed new section 75B enables the Secretary of State to make
regulations about the determination of a planning application under
proposed new section 75A(1)(b); that is, those applications that are
specified as reviewable by a local planning authority or local member
review body after an initial determination by an officer of the
authority.</div>
					<a name="08013068000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 453 is a technical one. Any determination of a planning application
by an officer acting under arrangements made under proposed new section
75A(1)(b) or a local planning authority, a committee or sub-committee
acting by virtue of section 75A(6) will be a determination of the
application under part 3 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column534" />Column number: 534</div>of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990. That part will apply to the
determination in the absence of provisions to the contrary. I will keep
my remaining comments very brief because we can then move on to the
substantial debate that I know hon. Members of other parties want to
have on the clause. It follows that proposed new section 75B(2) is not
quite right in assuming that part 3 needs to be applied. We believe
that the right approach is to take a power to modify or disapply part
3. That is the purpose of the
amendment.</div>

Nos. 463 and 473 will make corresponding changes in clauses 151 and

							<a name="08013068000510"></a>Robert
Neill:
						</b> This group of amendments relates to
the operation of member review bodies. We are
interested in fleshing out how this process will work. The amendment
looks draconian, but it is intended to probe how the process will
happen. We start from the proposition that we are broadly in favour of
anything that tends to pass down powers and decision making to a more
local level, so I do not have an issue with the principle of the
clause. However, if we are going to make it work and if it is to be
viable, a number of questions remain to be answered. At the risk of
sounding like the devil&#146;s advocate, I think that it is as well
that we probe the arrangements a little
now.</div>
					<a name="08013068000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is significant that the Local Government Association supports the idea
of member review boards for minor applications. We will have to be
careful about what the thresholds are. It used the slightly guarded
phrase that the
boards</div>
					<a name="08013068000435"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;could provide a
welcome opportunity for councillors to have the final
say.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08013068000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">As with many people
in local government, it wants a bit more detail about how that would
work in practice. </div>
					<a name="08013068000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the other side of the coin, there are people with legitimate
professional concerns about how we can guarantee the clear independence
of councillors from their officers and ensure that such a system
operates effectively without there being any breach of natural justice
for applicants. We must ensure that we deal with that not only in
domestic law, but under article 6 of the European convention on
human rights. We are 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column535" />Column number: 535</div>concerned about how that could be done effectively. Some detail has been
set out, but much more will be
required.</div>
					<a name="08013068000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">When we
discuss later amendments, we will postulate an idea for how to get over
the practical problems of getting a viable pool of
members to hear the applications. We must consider how many
applications any local authority will hear. For some local authorities,
it could be quite a lot. Should the board contain people who would
ordinarily be on the planning committee or is there to be a
distinction? It looks as if we will have two parallel systems. Will
there be applications that are dealt with by officers that are referred
to the planning committee in the ordinary way? Will there be a separate
review board for decisions that are to be made by officers? Will it be
like the planning committee with the same people, but wearing different
hats an hour later? Will there be a similar training regime? Should we
use people who are not members of the planning committee because they
could be thought to be too close to the officers with whom they work on
a regular basis? That is the other side of the
coin.</div>

Rogerson:
						</b> I am very pleased that the
hon. Gentleman has tabled the amendment so that we can have this
discussion. I see that he has proposed that members from a neighbouring
authority should be involved. A number of authorities have raised
concerns about the relationship between officers and the members of the
authority. The proposal of bringing in members might, therefore, be
helpful. Has he considered the possibility of seeking officer advice
from the neighbouring authority as opposed to members, so that the
democratic accountability remains with members who were elected to that
body, but the advice comes from
outside?</div>

							<a name="08013068000512"></a>Robert

						</b> I am grateful to the hon.
Gentleman for that thought. I am open-minded on that issue. We would
have to see what the implications would be in terms of the costs of an
officer&#146;s time being hired out to another authority. We tabled
the amendments in a genuinely open-minded way. Perhaps something like
that could be looked at. Many local authorities face the problem of a
shortage of good, experienced planning officers. They are quite a
scarce resource. In a number of authorities, planning departments are
already thinking about ways in which they could operate to use their
expertise. That might be something that we could look
at.</div>

							<a name="08013068000513"></a>Mr.
Benyon:
						</b> We had a debate last week about the difficulty of
bringing together more Select Committees in the House to look at the
responsibilities that have been given to them by Government. The same
problem exists in local authorities. Those of us who have been
councillors know how difficult it is, even in a pool of 50 or 60
councillors in a unitary authority such as mine, to draw together
people who have the necessary training at a certain time and day to
look at a particular problem in a professional way. A lot of them have
jobs and other responsibilities at the same time. It would be good to
tease out from the Government what would be the frequency of these
member review board meetings, what they would be doing and what they
would require&#151;not only in terms of members, but in the quantity
of work they would be undertaking.</div>

							<a name="08013068000514"></a>Robert
Neill:
						</b> My hon. Friend makes a valid
point. We need to do more work on that before the Bill completes its
progress. That is a further issue that needs to be considered. It links
in to our earlier discussion about the issue of predetermination and
the scope that there is for local councillors to express views. If, for
example, one were to adopt the view that ward councillors, or those who
have expressed an interest in an application, are to be excluded, the
pool of available members who could serve on the review body will
pretty rapidly be reduced. If the planning committee was also excluded,
who else would be
left?</div>
					<a name="08013068000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are also the practical points that my hon. Friend the Member for
Newbury made about whether members will be available at convenient
times. One can see a lot of difficulties that could arise in practice.
That is why we suggest in amendment No. 428 that it should be possible
to bring in members from a neighbouring authority. We are flexible as
to how the class of that authority should be defined. It could be
another district in the same area or an adjacent borough in London.
Again, there are swings and roundabouts on that issue. We are putting
it up for discussion to see the ways in which it could be done. Some
might say that, in a two-tier authority, members could be taken from a
different tier. There are all manner of
permutations.</div>
					<a name="08013068000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
need to think the matter through if we are to end up with a potentially
useful and enhancing role for local councillors. That role will set a
significant precedent so we must get it right. With respect to the
Minister, that is why I was a little disappointed in the reply that he
gave to the points made by the right hon. Member for Cardiff, South and
Penarth. The Minister went into some detail about the issue of
predetermination and related matters, but it would have been better to
have heard a little more about where the Government see themselves
going on that issue. I would be troubled if his brevity was intended
for anything other than to make good progress in the Committee. I hope
that it was not hinting at any rowing back from the willingness that
the current Minister for the Environment showed when he was dealing
with planning
matters.</div>

							<b class="B">Chris
Mole</b> (Ipswich) (Lab): Perhaps I might briefly
add some useful observations in the context of what
the hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst has just said.
Predetermination is less of an issue than the public&#146;s
perception of independence. There are precedents relating to local
authority councillors undertaking appeal-type work in fields such as
school admissions, although 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column537" />Column number: 537</div>I think that has now been moved completely away from councillors.
However, in other areas such as school transport, where local authority
councillors usually have their appeal work administered by the local
authority&#146;s legal wing, some separation, a Chinese wall perhaps,
is provided between the planning service and the councillors making
those decisions.</div>
					<a name="08013068000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">When
a member of the public gets the letter telling them what the process
will be, however independent that process is, I fear that when they see
the council&#146;s logo on the top of the paper they will not
distinguish between what one bit and another bit will do, and we will
be wrestling with that reaction, perhaps until the end of
time.</div>
					<a name="08013068000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08013068000518"></a>Robert
Neill:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman is absolutely
right and his point is valuable and useful. The idea of different
departments and Chinese walls is well worth looking at in practicality.
I suspect that he is right about the scepticism that will remain, but
we will just have to contend with it. When I was first elected to
Havering council, I remember that it was suggested to me by someone who
probably did not vote for me that I only did it because all councillors
did not pay rates&#151;as they were then called. There have always
been some extraordinary misconceptions about local government, which
one just has to struggle with as cheerfully as one
can&#151;<i class="I">[</i>
						<i class="I">Interruption.</i>
						<i class="I">]</i>
						<i class="I"> </i>I did not
realise that the Under-Secretary of State for Transport had not

					<a name="08013068000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand the point, which
is helpful, and the Minister might be able to assist us a little more
in fleshing out how we can make the process work if we are to go down
that
route.</div>

							<a name="08013068000519"></a>Dan
Rogerson:
						</b> To comment on the discussion that has just been
led by the hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst, I think that the
proposal is interesting and that it can offer something significant
with regard to democratic accountability. Although I know that some
people have concerns about the prospects and think that everyone feels
that the Planning Inspectorate is fair and does an excellent
job, and that it is independent and seen to be independent, that might
be only from the applicants&#146; point of view and not from the
point of view of residents in a local area. One often hears
people&#146;s dissatisfaction that a decision has been taken by
someone who is not elected locally, so people will welcome greater
provision to return to that principle. Clearly, there will be issues
around how the proposal will work, but it is useful that we are having
that discussion under clause
150.</div>
					<a name="08013068000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 407
relates to the issue of costs and would ensure that the burden for an
appeal did not fall on the local authority. The Minister will say that
if the Government pass a measure to increase the powers or
responsibilities of a local authority they will ensure that money goes
with it so that the local authority does not have to find it from
elsewhere. However, when the Minister&#146;s party was in opposition
they probably said that the previous Government passed things down
without giving the local authority the resources to carry them out.
That is a tendency that people in local government would identify, so
if we are to give them 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column538" />Column number: 538</div>extra responsibilities it is important to ensure that provision is made
for the local authority to recover the costs involved, as there will be
such costs. The prospect of local member review panels is a good one
but much examination of the details will be needed, which has yet to
come.</div>

							<a name="08013068000520"></a>Mr.

						</b> The hon. Member for Ipswich made a helpful point
and he was absolutely right: these bodies have form in local
government. The big question is how many and how often the member
review boards will be required. As a local councillor, I sat on housing
benefit review boards and we used to play Chinese walls with the
revenue department when it gave evidence on which we had to make a
judgment.</div>
					<a name="08013068000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Ipswich referred to school admissions, when people take
evidence in a quasi-judicial way and make a decision. I want to press
the Minister on the frequency of the boards, which
will have to consider growing developments and increasingly complicated
planning applications, especially in a constituency such as mine in the
south-east of England. The whole system will grind to a halt because of
the demands on councillors&#146; and officials&#146; time in
processing them. I am at heart a localist; I want decisions to be taken
locally and in that respect I welcome some aspects of the proposal, but
the practicalities of what the Government are proposing cause us and a
large number of councillors great concern.</div>

							<a name="08013068000521"></a>Mr.
Dhanda:
						</b> Before considering the purpose, effect and
desirability of the amendment, it might be helpful for me to say a few
words about the clause and where it is heading.</div>
					<a name="08013068000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 150
introduces in a new section 75A of the Town and Country Planning Act
1990 a requirement for local planning authorities to make arrangements
for certain planning cases to be determined by officers of the
authority. Examples of the types of development we have in mind are
small-scale things such as householder developments, new shop fronts,
small change-of-use proposals, advertisements and works on protected
trees. Proposed new section 75A(4) provides for the Secretary of State,
by regulation, to specify the types of planning application which,
having been determined by an officer in the first instance, would be
eligible for review only by a local member review
body.</div>
					<a name="08013068000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
those delegated applications, a proposed new section 75C establishes
the right of review of the officer&#146;s decision by the local
planning authority through a local member review body. Proposed new
section 78ZA removes the right of appeal to the Secretary of State
under section 78 of the Town and Country Planning Act
1990.</div>
					<a name="08013068000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 422 tabled by the hon. Members for Bromley and Chislehurst and for
Beckenham would remove proposed new section 75C, and thus the provision
for a review of a local authority officer&#146;s decision on a
planning application by a local member review body. Amendment No. 423
would remove proposed new section 193C of clause 151, and thus
provision for review of an officer&#146;s decision on an application
for a certificate of lawful use of development by a local member review
body. Either way we look at it, the amendment would, in effect, wreck
what we are trying to do. We believe that the intention behind the
amendments is to retain the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column539" />Column number: 539</div>right of appeal to the Secretary of State for such
planning decisions. However, to make them fully effective, further
consequential amendments would be required to clauses 150 and
151.</div>
					<a name="08013068000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
regard the establishment of local member review bodies to review
decisions on minor applications taken in the first instance by officers
of the authority as a real merit, as does Sir Simon Milton of the Local
Government Association, as the hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst
mentioned. The measure will determine local matters at the most local
level. It is probably the same in Newbury as it is in Gloucester as it
is in London; we all know many councillors who lobby us and say,
&#147;We could be doing more at a local level.&#148; I think that
this is an area where they could be doing
more.</div>

							<a name="08013068000522"></a>Robert
Neill:
						</b> I hope the Minister gathered that
we are not wedded to any particular form of wording; these are probing
amendments. I take his point regarding the support of the
LGA.</div>
					<a name="08013068000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">During
discussions on the matters the Minister has been referring to, have his
advisers in either the Department or the LGA been able to give an idea
of the quantity of applications that might be dealt with? Sir Simon
Milton was mentioned; he is the leader of a London borough. It would be
interesting to know if there is any idea of how many such applications
a London borough or a district council might reasonably expect to deal
with, to establish the scale, as a number of Members are concerned
about
that.</div>
					<a name="08013068000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08013068000523"></a>Mr.
Dhanda:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman has taken the
words out of my mouth. I was just coming to that
point.</div>
					<a name="08013068000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I said, the measure is about determining local issues at a local level,
in line with the Government&#146;s commitment to devolving
responsibility wherever we can. At present, minor planning appeals are
dealt with by the Planning Inspectorate on behalf of the Secretary of
State. The existing appeal system is not equipped to handle the
increasing volume of appeals&#151;currently 22,000 per year, of which
about 8,000 are minor appeals. We are talking about 22 cases a year in
each locality, although that is obviously an approximation. If those
cases could be dealt with by local member review bodies, users would
benefit from a much quicker and simpler process, and local authority
planning committees and the inspectorate would have more time to focus
on the major cases, as we heard from the inspectorate when its
representatives gave evidence to us in Committee what seems like many
weeks
ago.</div>
					<a name="08013068000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">Concerns
have been expressed that it would not be possible to ensure an
independent review process if the same authority was responsible for
decision and for review; but it is not unprecedented for a local
council to review its own decisions, as my hon. Friend the Member for
Ipswich and others have said. Examples include the review of decisions
on applications in respect of homelessness and school exclusions.
Officers involved in making the original decision would not be involved
in the review
process.</div>
					<a name="08013068000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Newbury mentioned members of a planning committee. It would
be possible for members of a planning committee to be members of the
local member review body, as long as they had not 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column540" />Column number: 540</div>been involved in any way in the original decision. The local member
review body would draw its advice from elsewhere&#151;for example,
from planning officers of a partner authority, as has been suggested by
Opposition Members, from external consultants, or from the
body&#146;s own legal services
department.</div>
					<a name="08013068000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">Any
member of a review body with a personal interest in a case, would be
required to declare their interest and, if necessary, to withdraw from
the decision process, as we would expect. That is not dissimilar to the
existing planning process. Local review bodies formed through
partnership with other authorities would also help to ensure
impartiality, as a proportion of board members would have no local
interest&#151;something Sir Simon Milton told us in the evidence
session a few weeks ago. The LGA is very attracted to that
idea.</div>
				
					<a name="08013068000442"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.15
pm</div>
					<a name="08013068000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
addition, in clause 152, we have provided for appeal to the courts for
anyone aggrieved by the decision of a local member review body. We are
working with local government and planning professionals to develop the
details of the scheme which will be subject to consultation. We still
have all of that ahead of us, assuming that the clauses are successful
and make it into the Bill. We have accepted advice from local
government that local member review bodies are likely to work best when
set up jointly by local authorities, acting in partnership. The hon.
Member for Bromley and Chislehurst will be familiar with that from his
days on the London Assembly. Section 101 of the Local Government Act
1972 already provides for that,
too.</div>
					<a name="08013068000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">Turning
to amendment No. 407, proposed new section 75C enables the Secretary of
State to make provision by way of regulations for reviews of planning
decisions carried out by local member review bodies. Proposed new
section 75C(4) sets out some specific matters for which the regulations
may include provision. Amendment No. 407 would enable the regulations
on reviews carried out by local member review bodies, which the
Secretary of State can make under proposed new section 75C, to include
provision for the fee payable to a local planning authority for a
review of an officer&#146;s decision by the local member review
body.</div>
					<a name="08013068000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Committee may be aware that clause 162 provides a power to enable a fee
to be introduced for appeals. We will come to that in the fullness of
time. That fee will be payable by the applicant to the Planning
Inspectorate. We therefore propose that a local member review body
would be able to charge a fee for reviews as well to be consistent.
However, section 303 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 already
provides the necessary power for that, so the amendment is not
necessary.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08013068000524"></a>Robert
Neill:
						</b> Will the Minister help me with an issue that has
been raised by people in local government? Will there be a tariff for
the fees or will the local authority have discretion as to what fees it
sets within Wednesbury reasonableness principles? Will local
authorities be able to recoup the whole cost of their appeals process
or just a
portion?</div>
					<a name="08013068000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08013068000525"></a>Mr.
Dhanda:
						</b> That is still a matter for regulation and
discussion. It is something on which we need to
consult. I cannot give the hon. Gentleman a definitive answer, I am
afraid.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column541" />Column number: 541</div>
					<a name="08013068000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
428 would enable reviews of planning decisions carried out under
proposed new section 75C by a local member review body to be conducted
by a panel of elected members drawn from other planning authorities,
wider than just the local area. Local authorities already have the
power under the Local Government Act 1972 to set up committees for the
discharge of their functions, including joint authority committees. We
have signalled that we would be happy for local authorities to
establish those bodies on a joint basis should they wish to do so. The
amendment is not, although I accept that it was tabled as a probing
amendment. In conclusion, we are working with local government and
planning professionals to develop the details of the local member
review body scheme, which will be the subject of consultation and in
which we see great merit. I therefore hope that hon. Members will not
press their amendments further.</div>

						</b> I am grateful to the Minister for his response. It
has been a worthwhile discussion on what is seen as an innovation. I
note what he says and I am not at all unsympathetic, as I understand
where he is coming from. However, if ever there was a classic case of
the devil being in the detail, this is probably it, so it is important
that we get as much indication of the Government&#146;s thinking and
as much clarity as possible. I appreciate that much of the detail will
appear in regulations, but I hope that the Minister can update us on
progress on some of those issues on Report. On that basis, I will not
press the
amendment.</div>

shall respond to what the Minister said with regard to fees, because he
said that the matter was up for discussion. I hope that he will take
this as a contribution to that discussion and an acceptance of the
principle that the local authority is already seeking to provide all
sorts of good, efficient front-line services that have a big effect on
the local community. When someone triggers an appeal, the
principle that they should make a significant
contribution, if not cover the cost, ought to be taken on board. I hope
that we will come up with a solution as those discussions continue that
allows the process to contribute to local democracy and democratic
accountability without imposing an extra financial burden on the local
authority.</div>

						</b> As currently drafted, section
78ZA does not allow an appeal to the Secretary of State where the local
authority or local member review body has determined a planning
application following non-determination by an officer. There would be
no form of appeal: the matter would be dealt with in the first instance
by the local member review body and that would be it, so that needs to
be amended. We believe that when a local member review body has taken
the first decision on an application, rather than reviewing an
officer&#146;s decision, the right of appeal to the Secretary of
State should be retained because there will no alternative opportunity
for scrutiny of the original decision.</div>
					<a name="08013068000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">An example of
such a circumstance is the local member review body stepping in and
making the decision because officers were late in determining it. The
purpose of Government amendment No. 455 is therefore to enable an
applicant to appeal to the Secretary of State when a local member
review body has taken the first decision on a
planning application. Government amendment No. 456 is consequential to
amendment No. 455. Government amendment No. 466 has the same purpose as
Government amendment No. 455 in relation to lawful developments and
appeals, as does Government amendment No. 476 in relation to listed
building application
appeals.</div>

							<b class="B">Mr.
David Curry</b> (Skipton and Ripon) (Con): Will regard also be
given to any special habitat features of the building? I have a listed
barn which is supposed to be one of the best 17th-century barns in
Essex. It would have been dead easy to get the council to give me
permission to put six houses there, but I restored it and I had to go
to great lengths to preserve two rare species of bats
that lived in the barn. I am proud to have done 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column545" />Column number: 545</div>so; the bats and I are great friends, and the muck
they drop on the floor makes extremely good horticultural dressing for
my vegetable garden. It is an entirely recycled system, which is
helping to save the
planet.</div>

making a contribution. I will have to check what happens if the habitat
is part of the listed status, and I will clarify the position in
writing to him. I shall be interested to know the answer,
too.</div>

it.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08013068000540"></a>Mrs.
Lait:
						</b> The amendments are different sides of the
same coin. There is a desire to tidy up some of the
applications under an article 4 direction. I understand 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column546" />Column number: 546</div>that the Government are particularly concerned to affect the house in
single ownership, which is why we tabled amendment No 415. However, we
are also concerned about the case in East Sussex that was drawn to our
attention during the evidence session in a written submission from Tim
Driver. I had nothing to do with it, and it does not affect where I
live or the county council; it is coincidental that the case was in
East Sussex. It was an interesting one, involving a family argument
about a caravan site, and I am sure that the Minister is well aware of
it.</div>
					<a name="08013068000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our concern
is that at present, article 4 directions apply to more than just the
small house owner. They apply in the agricultural sector, forestry,
industrial development, minerals, drainage works, aviation, schools,
colleges and hospitals. If the right to compensation is withdrawn
should a local planning authority decide to change its mind, it affects
not just the house builder but a much wider audience.</div>
					<a name="08013068000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">The National
Farmers Union has been very active in setting out for us the case as it
affects farmers. On the one hand, the Government are trying to be more
permissive and to make it easier for people to develop under permitted
rights. On the other, the blanket application of this clause will have
a negative impact on the areas that I have already set out, because it
will make it much more difficult for farmers in other areas to develop
their business without knowing that they are within their rights for
permitted development. A local planning authority could change its mind
and, given the pressure that farmers are under at the moment to
diversify, they will find that there is no right to
compensation.</div>
					<a name="08013068000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
want to get a feel from the Government as to whether they have any
sympathy at all for the plight of people who could be affected by this
change in permitted development. I readily admit that if there is some
sympathy and the Government are prepared to look at the matter further,
I will not press the amendment. The wording may need to be changed, but
we should like to hear the Minister&#146;s view on the principle
here.</div>
					<a name="08013068000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="08013068000541"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Elfyn Llwyd</b> (Meirionnydd Nant Conwy) (PC): I note that the
Bill includes the usual section 19 reference to human rights
compatibility. Is it right for such a clause to be stand part of the
Bill? If my reading is correct, planning permission could have been
validly given at some point by the necessary authority. It could then
be withdrawn, albeit with 12 months&#146; notice, and no compensation
would be paid for the diminution in the business and/or the loss of
that facility. I am not sure whether that is contrary to the Human
Rights Act as I understand it.</div>
					<a name="08013068000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">In any event, as a matter of
good common sense, if someone loses an asset through no fault of their
own, but as a direct result of an administrative action by an
authority, surely basic understanding of administrative law leads one
to think that there has to be a right to compensation. Otherwise,
people could be ruined overnight through no fault of their own. This is
rather serious. Unless I have misread the clause, it appears to be an
extremely serious
proposal.</div>
					<a name="08013068000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08013068000542"></a>Mr.
Dhanda:
						</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his
question. I believe that he has misread the clause,
and I will try to explain why. I may wish to return
to the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column547" />Column number: 547</div>hon. Lady for a little more information about the
nature of article 4 and the impact that she feels it is having on the
farming community, what type of article 4 she means, and whether such a
thing could in any case happen as of now. The clause does not do away
with the existing article 4, but it gives other powers to local
authorities, which I will try to
explain.</div>
					<a name="08013068000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause amends the right to compensation so as to enable changes to be
made to restrict permitted development without incurring liability for
compensation. I will give some examples of that in a moment. Existing
legislation provides that local planning authorities are liable to pay
compensation for 12 months after permitted development rights are
withdrawn. Hon. Members can probably understand where that has come
from.</div>
					<a name="08013068000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will give an example. If Westminster city council did not want the
residents of every house on a given street to convert their front lawns
into driveways, it could implement article 4, saying that it is against
the rules for anyone to do so. Residents locally could say that they
were planning to do that, and they would have 12 months to apply for
compensation.</div>
					<a name="08013068000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
changes that we are making to the clause will make it possible for
local authorities to say, &#147;Actually, in 12 months&#146; time,
we will implement this change, so if you really want to concrete over
your front drive, you have 12 months to do it. Therefore, you will not
get compensation.&#148; In many cases, so local government has told
us, people who had no intention of concreting over their front drives
applied for the compensation, saying that they had planned to do so.
That is the bare bones of the intention behind the
provision.</div>
					<a name="08013068000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08013068000543"></a>Mr.
Llwyd:
						</b> That is obviously a case where everyone would be in
sympathy with the Government in making the change. I
am asking whether the clause extends more broadly to larger permitted
developments. Farmers are often allowed to put up large byres or to
convert a grain store for further business use, whatever it might be. A
substantial body of permitted development is allowed under the Town and
Country Planning Act 1990 for people engaged in full-time agriculture.
Would the provision affect them in some
way?</div>
					<a name="08013068000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
do not think that anyone would argue with the example that the Minister
gave, but the concern of the NFU and others would be whether existing
permitted developments were to be denied without compensation. Let us
say that I, as a farmer, put up a grain store, which I am entitled to
do under permitted development. I start my business and 12
months&#146; hence, I find that I am not allowed to pull it down.
That is my reading of the provision. I hope that I am wrong, but
clearly the question of compensation ought to be
considered.</div>
					<a name="08013068000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08013068000544"></a>Mr.
Dhanda:
						</b> I can reassure the hon. Gentleman that the Bill
has been human rights-proofed and checked. I am happy to come back to
him in a few moments, when I will spell out a little more what the
clause does and does not do, but for now I want to make some
progress.</div>
					<a name="08013068000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">Existing
legislation provides that local planning authorities are liable to pay
compensation for 12 months after permitted development rights are
withdrawn. That might occur when a planning application to carry out
what had been permitted development is either turned down or granted
subject to conditions. A local planning 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column548" />Column number: 548</div>authority might require planning applications for loft extensions, for
example, in order to protect the appearance of an area. The legislation
applies whether the change is made by a planning authority withdrawing
rights locally, or by Government changes to national permitted
development
rights.</div>
				
					<a name="08013068000444"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.45
pm</div>
					<a name="08013068000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause is part of the Government&#146;s general policy to give
greater flexibility to local planning authorities to tailor permitted
development rights more closely to local circumstances, within a
generally more permissive regime. That will allow local authorities to
protect specific areas from unsuitable development. The clause will
provide an alternative procedure that allows restrictive charges to be
made without compensation being payable. I hope that I have answered
the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
point.</div>
					<a name="08013068000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
there are any developments that will no longer be permitted for
compensation terms, there will still be 12 months for those
developments to be fulfilled. To ensure that people whose permitted
development rights have been removed do not incur abortive expenditure,
the clause requires that at least 12 month&#146;s notice is given of
the change. The 12-month notice period should ensure that such costs
are avoided, so that people will be no worse off than under the
existing
scheme.</div>
					<a name="08013068000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 415 would limit the alternative compensation arrangement to changes
relating to householder development only. However, the purpose of the
clause is to deliver greater flexibility to amend permitted development
rights generally. That will allow local authorities greater freedom to
do what is necessary to protect particular areas by means of what are
known as article 4
directions.</div>
					<a name="08013068000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause is necessary to protect particular areas, given the
Government&#146;s intention to provide a generally more permissive
national framework. I have also explained that, given the 12
month&#146;s notice required before a change comes into effect,
developers will not lose out. Under the new mechanism, they will have
12 months to carry out the
work.</div>
					<a name="08013068000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
existing system will remain in place in parallel. However, we want to
ensure that restrictions are made only when necessary and that people
who might be affected have a chance to make their views known. I hope
that that is of relevance to the hon. Gentleman. We intend to
strengthen the procedures of article 4 directions. In the future, local
authorities will be required to consult those people who are likely to
be affected by a direction. Representations will have to be taken into
account before an article 4 direction can be made. Similarly, any
proposed Government restrictions will be subject to public
consultation.</div>
					<a name="08013068000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 535 would remove any right to compensation for restrictions made to
permitted development rights that relate to caravan sites. I have
already explained that, in general, we want to make it easier for
permitted development rights to be withdrawn where necessary. However,
I believe that those who enjoy such rights deserve some protection
where that might happen. The Government approach that would ensure a
12-month period of notice before rights are removed or a 12-month right
to compensation being payable is fair across the board. I see no reason
to single out any form of permitted development&#151;whether caravans
or something else&#151;to be subject to different
treatment.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column549" />Column number: 549</div>
					<a name="08013068000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">With regard
to proposals that affect other types of development&#151;for example,
farms&#151;I understand what the hon. Gentleman is saying, but I can
already name rights that have been withdrawn under the old system where
compensation had to be paid for 12 months. Under the new alternative,
there will be 12 months to carry out that work, unlike under the
existing system. The hon. Gentleman still looks somewhat perplexed; I
am quite happy to hear anything more that he has to
say.</div>
					<a name="08013068000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08013068000545"></a>Mr.
Llwyd:
						</b> The Minister is doing his best to assist us, but I
am still not fully au fait with what he is saying.
Let us say that there is permitted use of some
agricultural land for a certain period each year for touring caravans
and camping. That would add considerably to the value of the holding.
It is also in accordance with what we are all trying to
encourage&#151;diversification and so on. If the Minister is
suggesting that we could say, &#147;Well, in 12 months&#146; time,
you won&#146;t be allowed to site anything on that land, but
we&#146;ll only pay 12 months&#146; compensation&#148;, that does
not seem to be much of a bargain from the farmer&#146;s point of view
if, for example, that holding had depended on that summer income for
its viability for the past 10 or more years. I understand most of what
the Minister says, but I do not think that 12 months&#146;
compensation is an adequate basis for that type of example. Such a
system could make the difference between a small holding being viable
and having to sell up, move to a town and give up farming
altogether.</div>
					<a name="08013068000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08013068000546"></a>Mr.
Dhanda:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman and I may be at something of a
crossed line here. I am talking not about 12 months of compensation,
but about a specific development and having 12 months within which to
build that development&#151;a slightly different set of circumstances
from what the hon. Gentleman is talking about.</div>
					<a name="08013068000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">Local authorities can already
use article 4 to tell a farmer, for example, &#147;This is not
allowed on your land.&#148; However, we are talking about
development, so that if the farmer wishes to have a development on his
land, it is not a case of taking anything away from him, but of saying
to him and to people across a wider area, &#147;This is what we
intend to do; this is what we intend to prohibit; you have 12 months in
which to do it.&#148; In the past, there would have been a case of
compensation if a farmer had said, &#147;Well actually, it was my
plan to do that here on this site, but you have invoked article 4, so I
therefore cannot do it anymore.&#148;</div>

							<a name="08013068000547"></a>Mr.
Benyon:
						</b> I declare an interest as a farmer. If the Minister
remembers back a few years, the buzz word in Government was
&#147;rural proofing&#148; and every aspect of
Government policy had to be rural-proofed.
<i class="I">[Interruption.]</i> Indeed. The right hon. Member for Cardiff, South
and Penarth was responsible for that. Has the Minister run this past
his colleagues in DEFRA? Certain local authorities are itching to grab
hold of the whole general development order process, to stop farmers
from expanding their businesses in just the way that the hon. Member
for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy was describing. I fear that, in some areas,
one of which is not far from my constituency, the local authority would
stifle the development of businesses in precisely the opposite
direction to that in which the Minister&#146;s colleagues in
DEFRA are taking it.</div>

Dhanda:
						</b> I am going to bring my comments to a conclusion,
because I think that we have had a useful debate, but I hope that I
have been able to allay hon. Members&#146; fears, as article 4
directions are already in existence. As I have said, the local
authorities can say that a certain kind of development will be
prohibited and then local people&#151;whether farmers or other
residents&#151;can say, &#147;I want compensation because I had
planned to do that.&#148; This measure gives another option to local
authorities, whereby they can say, &#147;We wish to prohibit this
kind of development, but if you wish to go ahead with it, you have 12
months to do so.&#148; That is probably a fair position to be
in.</div>

						</b> I must apologise to the Committee, because in my
eagerness to be brief, I was not clear, so I am grateful to the hon.
Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy and my hon. Friend the Member for
Newbury for giving graphic examples that clarify the situation. I am
still unconvinced by the Minister&#146;s argument. In essence, he is
making it easier for local authorities to take away a permitted right,
so the proposal is permissive for local authorities, but it is
absolutely not permissive for those people who are predicating a
business plan, which may last for more than a year, on permitted
development rights that they have and have taken for granted that they
would have. I accept what he says about local authorities being able to
take permitted rights away, but they have to pay compensation. The
proposal limits that compensation. I will read what the Minister said
carefully, but my gut feeling is that I will not be happy and that we
may well have to return to
this.</div>

already exists, but under the new interpretation and given 12-month

discussion.</div>

its hands on those rights. We can consult till the cows come home, but
if that local authority is determined to extinguish those rights, the
Government are giving them that ability, however hard they insist on
consultation. I do not wish to prolong the debate any further, unless

Dhanda:
						</b> This clause will enable a local planning authority
to make a minor change to a planning permission that relates to land in
its area where it is satisfied that the change is not a material one.
This provision is necessary because, when developers seek to implement
their permissions, they can often find that minor changes to their
original proposals are necessary. Such issues are particularly common
for complex, large-scale developments that take long periods to be
built.</div>
					<a name="08013068000270"></a><div class="hs_Para">Examples
might include slightly moving the entrance to an office or providing a
new fire escape, because of changes to building regulations that have
occurred during the development process. In the past, such minor
changes were dealt with locally, with planning authorities making a
judgment about whether they were so minor that they could be allowed
without any formal procedure. We are taking advantage of and
introducing such a formal procedure under the clause.</div>
					<a name="08013068000271"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, case
law has thrown into doubt whether such an approach, which existed in
the past, is lawful and acceptable. That has led to widespread
uncertainty for both planning authorities and developers, and a
generally more cautious approach has led to even minor and
insignificant changes requiring a new full planning application. All we
seek to do is to reintroduce a little practical flexibility into the
system.</div>
					<a name="08013068000272"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08013068000555"></a>Mr.
Curry:
						</b> How many times could a developer come
back for a minor modification in the course of a
development? I know of circumstances in my constituency where planning
permission has been granted and then a series of small incremental
changes have been made that end up changing the shape of the
development significantly. Local residents, having perhaps acquiesced
to or been willing to accept an original planning permission, have
ended up with something radically different from what they had
consented to in the first place. They had no opportunity to intervene
in the mean time. How many times can that happen and how much does it
add up
to?</div>

							<a name="08013068000556"></a>Mr.
Dhanda:
						</b> The right hon. Gentleman makes an interesting
point. No two developments are the same, and when I say
&#147;minor&#148; I mean it. That is part of the reason that I gave
a couple of specific examples, such as fire escapes due to changes to
building regulations. Such really minor matters have resulted in big
planning applications being lost entirely. I hear what the right hon.
Gentleman says, but it is a bit like asking me how long a piece of
string is, because no two developments are the
same.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08013068000557"></a>Mr.
Curry:
						</b> My point was about a series of changes
being applied for in respect of a single development,
which have the cumulative effect of changing significantly the nature
of the development. Is that dealt with in the clause, or could
developers use salami
tactics?</div>
					<a name="08013068000275"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08013068000558"></a>Mr.
Dhanda:
						</b> I assure the right hon. Gentleman that the clause
is not about changes to a development that result in
a material change. It is about very minor changes. I hope that that
reassures him. I also ask members of the Committee to remember that a
similar provision has existed in Scotland for about a quarter of a
century and has worked well.</div>
					<a name="08013068000276"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government amendments will provide further clarity as to how the power
will work. Amendments Nos. 477 and 478 are technical drafting changes
that I trust will be totally uncontentious. Government amendment No.
479 makes a number of changes to the clause, first by inserting
proposed new subsection (4) to proposed new section 96A, requiring that
the power in the clause can be exercised only by a person with an
interest in the land or someone acting on their behalf. I note that
Opposition Members&#146; amendment No. 30 is intended to achieve a
similar outcome, so I hope that that will allay their
concerns.</div>
					<a name="08013068000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
the amendment will add proposed new subsection (5) to proposed new
section 96A, so that an application to make a non-material
change&#151;I emphasise that point again&#151;must be in the form
and manner prescribed. It is intended that, as with other
planning-related applications, the standard application form will be
used. Thirdly, proposed new subsection (6) will allow us to prescribe
how such an application should be publicised and who should be
consulted as part of the process.</div>
					<a name="08013068000278"></a><div class="hs_Para">Fourthly, there are amendments
to section 5(3) and schedule 1 to the 1990 Act,
providing that a local authority can make a change under the provision
only if it is the local planning authority for the planning permission
in question. Opposition amendment No. 31 is intended to achieve a
similar outcome, so perhaps we are aligned in our thinking. Finally,
section 69 of the 1990 Act will be amended to require that a request
for a non-material change be recorded on the planning register. I hope
that we can agree that those are sensible changes to a sensible
provision, and that Opposition Members will not press amendments Nos.
30 and
31.</div>

Neill:
						</b> The Minister has shortened what I need to say. He
is right that we have the same objective. Lest anyone
should wonder why the matter is of significance, there are situations
such as that of the Thames Gateway involving urban development
corporations, national parks and so on, which not be the local planning
authority. I 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column553" />Column number: 553</div>am grateful to the Minister for having dealt with such issues. Some of
our amendments were drafted similarly, with objectives that I accept
have been achieved by the Government
amendments.</div>
					<a name="08013068000280"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 35 is slightly different and harks back to the concern expressed by
my right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon. In the first two
proposed new subsections, the starting proposition was that any changes
should not be material. However, the concern is that a number of
changes can have a significant cumulative effect. Proposed new
subsection 96A(3) worries me, because read together with the other
provisions it suggests that new conditions can be imposed or
old ones removed or altered if they are not material. I am trying to
think of circumstances in which they would not be material. If they
were not material, why were they imposed in the first place? That is
the part that seems odd and tautologous. I am worried about the risk of
what are asserted to be non-material conditions being changed, as it is
difficult to think of a non-material condition. I would be grateful if
the Minister could help us on that.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08013068000560"></a>Mr.
Dhanda:
						</b> I have given an example on a couple of occasions
about fire doors. It is a good example. There could be a development
that is working but then a new set of building regulations is
introduced. We cannot have a set of circumstances in which the entire
process must begin again with the planning application. That has
happened; I have an example of it that I am happy to share with the
hon. Gentleman, but I do not want to bore him.</div>
					<a name="08013068000282"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Gentleman mentioned
amendment No. 35, which would remove the ability to make non-material
changes by removing or altering existing conditions or imposing new
ones. It would prevent a local planning authority from making minor
changes to an existing planning condition, unless there was a further
formal planning condition. We would not want to go through such a
process. However, were it accepted that the kind of non-material
changes to a planning permission that I have outlined should be
allowed, the planning authority would be best placed to decide what is
material or not. There seems little reason to impose a restriction that
would prevent a minor change to a planning condition. While it is
accepted that section 73 of the 1990 Act provides an existing mechanism
to vary a condition, an alternative route to making minor changes
should be allowed. On the record, I want to reinforce the point that we
are talking about really minor changes.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08013068000561"></a>Robert
Neill:
						</b> I am grateful to the Minister for
reinforcing that point. I understand his point about minor variations
to conditions, and the ability to amend a condition, but I am still
interested to think of circumstances in which it would be appropriate
to remove a condition completely or to impose a wholly new one. I
understand and see the good sense in changing a condition for the
reasons that he has explained. However, I am concerned that we do not
open up the flood gates, beyond that which he would wish to see, by
allowing the complete removal of a condition or the imposition of a
wholly new one. Is the process to be circumscribed to allow an old
condition 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column554" />Column number: 554</div>to be removed but a similar one to be imposed, so that the package of
conditions remains the same? That might make sense. Were a condition
removed entirely, one might ask why it was there in the first place if
it was sufficiently immaterial to be removed. That is a different
matter from the Minister&#146;s valid point about making a minor
amendment to a remaining condition.</div>

local authorities who have worked with developers to get some of the
important developments up and running have brought the matter to our
attention. They have had difficulties, and in the past have done this
in an informal and ad hoc way. The clause is necessary to remove that

Michael:
						</b> It is indeed. Mr. Illsley, you will
find the volume entertaining and illuminating. It is evidence of the
rich, national treasury that we have in our wild variety of ancient and
precious trees and of the need for reform of the tree preservation
order system. In recent times, some nationally important trees have
been lost such as T&#146;yr Ash oak, which was the largest oak by
volume in Wales with a girth of more than 6 m. It was estimated to be
about 375 years old. A large limb fell from the crown. The owner became
concerned about the risk of further collapse and arranged for it to be
felled. It was not protected by a tree preservation order. A good deal
of campaigning took place to protect the tree because it was seen as a
significant loss to the local community, members of which wanted an
investigation into alternatives, such as whether
retention was possible. Unfortunately&#151;although it might have had
reasons&#151;the Brecon Beacons national park authority would not put
a preservation order on the tree, despite an independent arboricultural
consultant&#146;s report that the tree could be managed to reduce the
risk to acceptable levels. The tree has now been felled and lost for
ever.</div>
					<a name="08013068000299"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
given that some trees throughout the country with little wider value
are protected by tree preservation orders, I hope that the Minister
will be willing to accept the amendments and new clauses. He is a
reasonable and caring man so I am sure that he will listen to my
suggestions or table his own amendments. There is always a belief, in
any Ministry, that it can draft provisions slightly better than a Back
Bencher can. I leave open the possibility of the Minister introducing,
on Report, amendments that would have the same final impact.</div>
					<a name="08013068000300"></a><div class="hs_Para">I thank the
Woodland Trust, the Tree Council and Charles Mynors, a barrister with
considerable experience and the author of an authoritative book on

with tree preservation orders is that they can be used in various ways.
Some councillors use them rarely, and only to protect the most valuable
trees, whereas others use them as a device to protect trees of little
value, as with a recent order in Dorset to protect 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column557" />Column number: 557</div>an unremarkable front-garden tree in an ordinary
suburban street. Some use them more cynically as a device to prevent
development. There was a recent order in Essex on a back-garden cherry
tree that happened to be at the entrance to a proposed housing scheme.
Trees are sometimes protected by reference to groups or to areas of
land, which means that the group may contain an individual tree of
little amenity value. For example, in Liverpool, there are several area
orders, each covering a large housing estate.</div>
					<a name="08013068000302"></a><div class="hs_Para">Against that
background, it is not surprising that there are unauthorised works on
trees in a wide variety of circumstances. An unprincipled developer may
fell a beautiful specimen tree to unlock a development site, or a
householder may lop a branch off an unremarkable back-garden tree
because it is shedding leaves, which block the gutter. Between those
two examples, there is a whole range of situations, varying as to the
number of trees involved and the amenity value of each. The
extent of the works carried out varies between felling and pruning, and
the culpability of those responsible varies accordingly.</div>
					<a name="08013068000303"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments would replace the two current offences with a single
offence. When dealing with offences, the courts always have the power,
and, indeed, the duty, to tailor the sentence to fit the circumstances
of the case. In an either-way offence&#151;one that is triable in the
Crown court or before a magistrate; the parties have the option of
going to either forum&#151;a minor breach will usually attract a
trivial fine from a magistrate. If either party is silly enough to go
to Crown court, the eventual penalty will be significantly larger.
Major breaches result in larger fines in the Crown court, and any
significant element of development gain may be taken into account. That
is reflected in practice.</div>
					<a name="08013068000304"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is
similar legislation relating to listed buildings, with a single offence
of unauthorised works that is triable either way, and the maximum
penalty may be imposed . There have been more than 100 convictions
since the existing penalties were introduced in 1991. Of those cases,
16 were tried in the Crown court, with only two resulting in a fine of
more than &#163;20,000. The remaining 85 cases were heard by
magistrates. That suggests that the creation of a single offence would
not result in trivial offences being at risk of excessive punishment,
which has, until now, been the reasoning behind the refusal to move
from two offences to one. Indeed, if anything, the penalties are too
low to put off determined offenders.</div>
					<a name="08013068000305"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a
wholly artificial distinction between major offences&#151;those that
result in the death of the tree or seem likely to do so&#151;and
minor offences. For the former, there is an unlimited maximum fine. For
the latter, the maximum is only &#163;20,000. That leads to a
somewhat arid debate on which category properly applies. That is
particularly unprofitable when works are carried out on more than one
tree, with some in each category. Sometimes, authorities choose not to
prosecute the more serious offence because they cannot be sure that the
tree will die, but they do not prosecute the minor offence, either,
because the maximum penalty is perceived to be small.</div>
					<a name="08013068000306"></a><div class="hs_Para">Turning to
the proposed dangerous works exemption, there is an exemption in
section 198(6) of the 1990 Act, which means that consent is not
required, first, for works to trees that are dying, dead or dangerous
and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column558" />Column number: 558</div>secondly, so far as is necessary, for the prevention of nuisance. The
first exemption is significantly wider than the corresponding exemption
in Scotland, which exempts only works that are necessary to prevent a
danger. Similar provisions apply when obtaining a felling licence under
the Forestry Act 1991. In their 1994 review of tree preservation order
legislation, the Government proposed to limit the dangerous trees
exemption so that in future it would allow only the minimum works
necessary to remove the cause of the danger. If only part of a tree was
dangerous, only that part could be removed. My proposal would enable
the Government to honour that commitment. I am aware that it was a
previous Conservative Government who made it and failed to deliver on
it, but I am sure that Ministers would agree that it was a reasonable
one at the time. It is just a pity that it was not
delivered.</div>
					<a name="08013068000307"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Bill simply repeals section 198(6) of the 1990 Act. The replacement
provisions will enable the Secretary of State or Welsh Ministers to
make regulations to cover almost anything, but which do not relate
specifically to situations that are currently exempt. The proposed
provision makes it plain that works to alleviate a danger are always
exempt from the need for consent. It also makes it clear that the
exemption cannot, and must not, be misused or abused, and it justifies
the carrying-out of the minimum works immediately
necessary&#151;again, that is exactly in line with listed buildings
legislation, where the corresponding exemption was tightened up in 1986
with precisely the same aim as my
amendments.</div>
					<a name="08013068000308"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
second part of the exemption in section 198(6) of the 1990 Act, for
works to abate a nuisance, was considered in the Court of Appeal, in
the case Perrin <i class="I">v. </i>Northampton, just before Christmas. The scope
of that exemption is now very uncertain. The right way to deal with
that dilemma is to remove that exemption altogether, which would be a
matter for regulations that would be made in due course. It would also
be prudent to lose the &#147;dead or dying&#148; exemption
altogether&#151;again, as in Scotland&#151;but that, too, would be
a matter for the regulations. If a tree is dead or dying, and if it is
dangerous, works could be carried out without consent&#151;because of
the danger, not because it is dead or dying. Otherwise, there is no
logic in the exemption. For all those reasons, it would be sensible to
have the &#147;danger&#148; exemption tightly drafted in primary
legislation, rather than leave it to the
regulations.</div>
					<a name="08013068000309"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new
clauses propose a register of trees which, following discussions, I
have tried to make as simple as possible. It is not a requirement, and
the responsibility would not be placed on the
shoulders of a specific body. In the past, we have considered giving
responsibility for such a register to English Heritage or equivalent
bodies in Wales, or other alternatives such as the Countryside Agency
or Natural England. I do not think that it is necessary for us to take
such decisions. Indeed, an agency outside Government, or a voluntary
organisation, may be the most appropriate body to draw up the register,
which Ministers would then recognise. That would be the best of both
worlds.</div>
					<a name="08013068000310"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments would provide flexibility&#151;they give the Government
the capacity to recognise the importance of those trees, some of which
are visited by thousands of people every year and are a part of our
very valuable heritage&#151;without creating a
bureaucracy, so to speak, or placing additional burdens, particularly
financial ones on Government agencies. It is envisaged 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column559" />Column number: 559</div>that works to register trees would simply be notified to the planning
authority, as applies to non-TPO trees, in conservation areas. That
pattern already exists, and it works perfectly well, as those of us
with experience of conservation know. The new procedure would actually
lead to a lighter
touch.</div>
					<a name="08013068000311"></a><div class="hs_Para">Planning
authorities use tree preservation orders in a wide variety of
situations, so no consistent standard applies nationally. That should
be compared with measures to protect historic buildings, which are
listed by the Secretary of State or Welsh Ministers on the advice of
English Heritage or Cadw on the basis of nationally applied standards.
The production of a simple, straightforward and nationally supervised
register that lists only the most valuable trees&#151;it is therefore
not a big bureaucratic list&#151;would allow the protection of those
particularly valuable trees and introduce a mark of excellence for
trees of national importance, as opposed to those selected by local
authorities merely because they are quite nice. There would be no
question of trees being designated on the basis of groups in certain
areas.</div>
					<a name="08013068000312"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
unless there is a guarantee that the dead or dying exemption is
removed, planning authorities often decline to make tree preservation
orders on veteran or ancient trees, as their removal might not require
consent. While a register could be produced and maintained on a
non-statutory basis, as is the case with the register of historic parks
and gardens in Wales, a statutory register, as used in England, would
have more weight, for example, as a material consideration in
determining planning applications. I believe that the protection of our
most precious trees, as illustrated in that book, and a recognition of
the risk to them, as illustrated in the case that I mentioned and in
other cases, would be a considerable step forward in recognising an
important part of our national heritage, and I commend the amendment
and the new clauses to the
Committee.</div>
					<a name="08013068000313"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08013068000569"></a>Mrs.
Lait:
						</b> I congratulate the right hon. Gentleman on tabling
the amendments and new clauses, and I join him in
hoping that the Government will accept them, particularly the new
clauses. I congratulate the Woodland Trust, both on its initiative and
on the work that it is already doing to seek out the ancient trees that
it believes should be registered. I have never come across an
organisation so open to being the registering body.</div>
					<a name="08013068000314"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the
Government do not accept the new clauses, I hope that they accept the
argument and introduce with their own proposals. I understand in
principle why the Government want to move tree preservation orders into
a regulatory system, but I am concerned that it is a centralising
measure. Equally, as one travels around the country, one is aware that
different local authorities operate wide and varying standards on which
trees should be covered by tree preservation orders. However, I am
concerned by about the scope of the new regulatory structure and the
trees that it would cover, so I hope that the Government will assure us
that it will not be drawn as broadly as possible, otherwise we will
find unremarkable trees listed with preservation orders when there is
absolutely no need to do
so.</div>
					<a name="08013068000315"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
also wish to know whether the Government think that all trees in town
parks should be listed, remarkable or not. Anyone who has lived
anywhere near a sycamore knows precisely how many small sycamores
spring up each year and the sheer work that goes into ensuring 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column560" />Column number: 560</div>that they do not grow any more. Having said that,
those few that grow to full height are magnificent specimens, so one
has to be reasonable-minded about how to approach the regulation of
trees.</div>
					<a name="08013068000316"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08013068000570"></a>Mr.
Llwyd:
						</b> I once dealt with a tree
preservation order on some sycamore trees, and I recall that a sycamore
tree is treated as a weed, not a
tree.</div>
					<a name="08013068000317"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08013068000571"></a>Mrs.
Lait:
						</b> As someone who contends with the
problem on an annual basis, I agree that they are weeds. However, a
full-grown sycamore is a magnificent tree, and one would not wish such
a tree in a key setting to be omitted from the listing. Given that
sycamores grow as weeds, however, there are times when one would not
wish to make an
order.</div>
				
					<a name="08013068000318"></a><div class="hs_Para">Inadvertently,
as so often happens with regulation, a completely inappropriate class
of use comes in. That is my concern with the transfer of tree
preservation orders, which are decided locally, to a national system of
regulations.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08013068000572"></a>Mr.
Curry:
						</b> I am sympathetic to what the right hon. Gentleman
describes, but I should like a couple of reassurances that, when an
organisation wishes to restore, for example, an
historic garden, the tree preservation order will not prevent it from
restoring the garden to what it looked like, for example, in the 18th
century. In my constituency, near the village of Grewelthorpe, there is
a site called Hackfall, where the ground descends to the River Ure. In
the 18th century, it was a famous garden&#151;so famous that
Catherine the Great had a dinner service with scenes from Hackfall
printed on it. It is now hopelessly overgrown, but I think that the
Woodland Trust is now the owner, and the land is gradually being
restored.</div>
					<a name="08013068000320"></a><div class="hs_Para">Perhaps even
more famous is Fountains abbey, including the magnificent Studley Royal
water garden, which hon. Members from Leeds will know about. The garden
was laid out by John Aislabie, who was Chancellor of the Exchequer and
made a packet from the South Sea bubble, which just goes to show that
ill-gotten gains can be put to uses that benefit generations to come.
The National Trust has restored magnificently that old 18th century
water garden, which was a huge task.</div>
					<a name="08013068000321"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to be
certain that, if organisations seek to restore historic gardens, for
example, and that necessitates the removal of plants, vegetation and
trees that have subsequently grown up when the garden was neglected or
simply became overgrown, nothing that is proposed will stand in the way
of the re-creation of those magnificent areas. One of the greatest
cultural achievements of this country is its
gardens.</div>
					<a name="08013068000322"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08013068000573"></a>Mr.
Dhanda:
						</b> I congratulate my right hon. Friend the
Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth and the Woodland Trust on the
work that they have collectively put into the amendments and the new
clauses. Under the present tree preservation order system, a maximum
fine of &#163;20,000 may be imposed when protected trees are felled
or otherwise destroyed without consent. A lower fine of up to
&#163;2,500 is payable for other contraventions
of the system, such as the failure to obtain the local planning
authority&#146;s consent before pruning a tree.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column561" />Column number: 561</div>
					<a name="08013068000323"></a><div class="hs_Para">We need to
take a closer look at my right hon. Friend&#146;s amendments Nos. 439
and 440, because we believe that the two-tier approach is the most
proportionate way forward. It is right that Parliament should recognise
that some offences are demonstrably graver than others and reflect that
in our legislation. A fine of &#163;2,500 is not insignificant; it is
the equivalent of level 4 on the standard scale that we have talked so
much about over the past few weeks.</div>
					<a name="08013068000324"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some say that
&#163;2,500 is nothing to an unscrupulous developer who is keen to
maximise the value of a site, but let us remember that we are talking
about only the unauthorised pruning of trees. The unauthorised cutting
down of trees is subject to a maximum fine of &#163;20,000&#151;so,
too, is any excessive pruning that is so badly executed that it
effectively destroys the tree as an amenity worth preserving. Case law
has made that clear, too.</div>
					<a name="08013068000325"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments would have a further purpose. Under amendment No. 439,
anyone accused of unauthorised tree works would have a defence if they
could show that the works were urgently necessary on grounds of health
or safety and limited to the minimum needed under the circumstances. I
hope I can persuade my right hon. Friend that these matters are best
considered not in primary legislation, but in regulations, and I hope
he will continue to liaise and work with our officials and with the
Woodland Trust.</div>
					<a name="08013068000326"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill
includes the power to introduce regulations, including a power to make
prohibited works subject to exceptions, which is something the
amendments mention. I assure my right hon. Friend that we will
carefully consider the objectives of his amendments when preparing and
consulting on those regulations. Most people would agree that exempt
works to protected trees, in the interests of health or safety, should
not be open-ended; they should be limited to what is needed to deal
with the problem. We will give careful thought to all this and consult
widely on the detail to ensure that we get the wording right.</div>
					<a name="08013068000327"></a><div class="hs_Para">Turning to
new clause 16, together with amendments Nos. 441 and 442, under the
current system, trees that are situated in conservation areas have a
form of blanket protection. Before carrying out felling or pruning
works to such trees, one must first give the local planning authority
six weeks&#146; notice, thus giving it the opportunity to consider
whether the trees merit a tree preservation order. Local planning
authorities receive, on average, 120 such notices each year, resulting
in an average of only three new tree preservation orders per
authority.</div>
					<a name="08013068000328"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments would extend the six week notification system to all trees
in England and Wales, whether on private or public land. On the face of
it, therefore, subject to whatever exceptions were included in the
regulations, the felling or pruning of all trees would become subject
to local authority control. However, we do not believe that the current
system is failing. The last comprehensive review of the system
concluded that it had stood the test of time and that its basic
framework should be retained.</div>
					<a name="08013068000329"></a><div class="hs_Para">The extension
of a blanket control for trees on the scale provided for in new clause
16 would impose significant new burdens on local authorities. The 120
or so notices received under the current system would end up increasing
very significantly indeed; yet under the current system, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column562" />Column number: 562</div>only one in 40 notices results in a tree preservation order. I
appreciate that the new clause would allow exceptions to the rule,
which would be set out in regulations, and that those exceptions might
reduce the number of trees subject to blanket protection. However, it
is important that we do not extend the controls, and thus new
restrictions on landowners, without first being satisfied that they are
necessary.</div>
					<a name="08013068000330"></a><div class="hs_Para">Turning
to new clause 15, in our view a good framework for protecting special
trees is already provided under the tree preservation order system, the
felling licence system and our system for safeguarding sites of special
scientific interest. Before embracing an additional statutory
designation, we would have to be satisfied that current statutory
systems were deficient. We are not convinced that they are deficient.
Existing sites of special scientific interest include many of the most
important concentrations of veteran trees and ancient woodlands, such
as the New forest, Sherwood forest and Windsor great park. Criteria
have also been developed that enable the designation of such sites of
special scientific interest solely on the basis of a concentrated
veteran tree
population.</div>
					<a name="08013068000331"></a><div class="hs_Para">Turning
to the tree preservation order system, I am conscious that there are
those who say that it is ill equipped to protect some of the most
outstanding veteran trees. I hope that I can reassure my right hon.
Friend. First, when considering whether to make preservation orders,
local authorities have a wide discretion. In my Department&#146;s
view a tree&#146;s historical or cultural importance may be
sufficient to justify making a tree preservation order. Many veteran
trees are important for their historical or cultural
associations.</div>
					<a name="08013068000332"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
it is said that special trees may not be protected by tree preservation
orders unless they are at risk. Let us be clear: the legislation states
that an order may be made where it appears expedient in the interest of
the amenity. There is no reference to trees having to be at risk. If it
is helpful to my right hon. Friend, we will look again at our guidance
on the issue to clarify that
point.</div>
					<a name="08013068000333"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
it is said that veteran trees are compromised because, under the
current legislation, consent is not needed to carry out works to trees
that are dead or dying or have become dangerous. That is a valid
concern. At present, the exemption is in the 1990 Act, so we have had
limited opportunity to reform it, but the Bill provides us with the
opportunity to do so. Our favoured approach is to move the exemption to
regulations, and the Bill makes provision for us to do
so.</div>
					<a name="08013068000334"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again,
I assure my right hon. Friend that we will look critically at the
exemption when we develop the regulations, with a view to ensuring that
adequate provision is made for the protection of veteran trees.
Therefore, a national register, which of itself would provide no
additional protection, is not necessary. I applaud the work of the
Woodland Trust and others in taking forward their ancient tree hunt,
which seeks to identify veteran trees around the UK, and in securing
the long-term protection of such trees. However, in our view, that is
best pursued with local authorities and others who already have the
statutory powers to take
action.</div>
					<a name="08013068000335"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
therefore hope that my right hon. Friend will withdraw his amendments,
taking on board my comments in the spirit that they are intended. Let
us engage further with 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column563" />Column number: 563</div>the Woodland Trust and others who have an interest
in these issues, to ensure that we get the regulations absolutely
right.</div>

Rogerson:
						</b> The amendments arose from a discussion with the
Town and Country Planning Association regarding the issue of appeals
being conducted through submissions by writing, rather than by an
inquiry or hearing. I share its concern. That tendency is an unhappy
one because it does not allow for the sort of cross-examination that we
have discussed under previous amendments tabled by the hon. Member for
Bromley and Chislehurst. Perhaps it is more efficient for the Planning
Inspectorate to deal with written evidence, but it does not necessarily
mean that it is the best way of getting appellants&#146; views
across. I wanted to see whether the Minister is prepared to accept the
point and to justify widening the use of representation by advisers as
the basis for an appeal, as opposed to the more conventional methods
through a local inquiry or a
hearing.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08013068000583"></a>Robert
Neill:
						</b> I broadly support the thrust of the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s observations. The current cope
under certain circumstances for agreement to be made and for further
appeals to be dealt with through written representations is adequate.
We do not wish to move further than that because generally we think
that it is an option that should be available to the parties. As we
have stressed throughout the Committee, when developments deeply affect
people&#146;s livelihoods, their communities and sometimes their
homes, the right to put their own case in their own way and to
cross-examine and make representations should not be lightly removed.
We do not think that the justification is
made.</div>
					<a name="08013068000363"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08013068000584"></a>Mr.
Dhanda:
						</b> The effect of the clause is to ensure that the
Planning Inspectorate will use its delegated powers to determine the
appropriate procedure for each case on behalf of the Secretary of
State. The current system 
allows the principal parties to select the
procedure. However, in appeals appellants often choose a hearing for
cases that could just as appropriately be determined via the written
representations method or an inquiry for cases that could be considered
at a
hearing.</div>
					<a name="08013068000364"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
example, an appellant might insist on an inquiry or a hearing for an
application relating to a boundary wall or a dormer roof extension when
the vast majority of such cases do not raise complex policy issues and
can be effectively dealt with by written representations instead. We
want to ensure that the procedure used is proportionate to the
complexity of the subject matter, hence this clause. Cases that do not
need an oral hearing could be fairly and effectively handled by
means of written representations with no loss of quality or equity to
the process and the decision. The outcome will depend on how convincing
the inspector finds the planning merits, not the method of their
representation.</div>
					<a name="08013068000365"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
160 would enable the Planning Inspectorate, acting on behalf of the
Secretary of State, to apply published criteria which Ministers have
approved to determine the most appropriate appeals procedure. The
criteria would be consulted on and regularly reviewed. They would
ensure that any case that is complex, controversial, and thus would
benefit from a hearing or an inquiry, would be dealt with in that way.
They would also ensure that people in vulnerable groups were given a
fair opportunity to put their case, which might mean that a hearing or
inquiry would be appropriate even when it would not normally be
justified by the complexity of the
case.</div>
					<a name="08013068000366"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
measure in its entirety, with the option of determination by written
representations, is crucial to the delivery of a more proportionate and
efficient system. We estimate that it would yield cost savings of
around &#163;2 million a year to the Planning Inspectorate and
&#163;700,000 a year to local authorities. Applicants and appellants
would benefit from a reduction in the time taken to determine their
cases. I therefore propose that the amendments should be
rejected.</div>

							<a name="08013068000585"></a>Dan
Rogerson:
						</b> I am grateful to the Minister for his
clarification. It is important to get it on the record that there is a
hierarchy of forms of appeal. In coming to a decision as to which one
would be appropriate, regard will be given to the complexity and
importance of the issue. Hearings and inquiries would be very much the
norm for complex and important cases. I am somewhat
reassured. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div>

					<a name="08013080000008"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#145;Except for an appeal

shall be brief. It is unjust to expect applicants to pay the local
authority a fee when they are making the appeal only because the local
authority failed to take a decision in the first place. It is a
non-determination scenario and it is not equitable to expect the
applicants to fork out on that basis. The amendment is designed to deal
with that situation.</div>

							<a name="08013068000587"></a>Mr.
Dhanda:
						</b> I sympathise with what I perceive to be the
underlying sentiment of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s argument: that
people should not have to pay for an appeal because a local authority
fails to act. Although the Government cannot accept the amendment, our
intention is to transfer part of the cost of running the appeals
service, from the general taxpayer to those who might benefit. That
principle is applicable, whatever the reason for an appeal or its
eventual outcome.</div>

Neill:
						</b> I am sorry, but I cannot accept
the Minister&#146;s reasoning. To my mind it is thoroughly unjust,
whatever the reason, to expect an applicant to bear the cost of an
appeal that they did not bring about. If the local authority fails to
act, it is the local authority and the public purse that should bear
the burden.</div>

							<a name="08013068000589"></a>Mr.
Dhanda:
						</b> If there is evidence that a
local authority has acted unreasonably, which I think is the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s point, and it has done so in a non-determination
case, the applicant can seek an award of costs from the Planning
Inspectorate. The Planning Inspectorate intends to adopt a rigorous
approach to such cases, to ensure that appellants are not unfairly
penalised. I therefore believe that we can meet the objectives of the
amendment and propose that it is rejected. At the same time, however,
the principle of the clause is
important.</div>

							<a name="08013068000590"></a>Mr.
Llwyd:
						</b> I thank the Minister for giving
way, I know that the hour is rather late. Not so long
ago&#151;probably 10 or 12 years ago&#151;the then Government
introduced a measure that would allow the applicant in a successful
planning appeal to recover his or her costs in full, emulating what the
courts understand as &#147;costs follow the event&#148;. In one of
the first awards of that kind in north Wales, I was responsible for
acting for the appellant&#151;I am not bragging, but pointing out
that this measure winds the whole thing back. A person might now appeal
against an action by the local authority, which might not be an
unreasonable action but an action that is found to be invalid by the
appeal tribunal. If the appellant then wins the appeal on ordinary
grounds, without any unreasonable action by the other side, that
appellant will have to bear his or her own costs. I am left dumbfounded
by that idea, to be
honest.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08013068000591"></a>Mr.
Dhanda:
						</b> I think that I have made clear
the circumstances in which an applicant could get their money back, but
at the same time the system must be sustainable to deal with the number
of appeals currently in the system. The appellant has something to gain
if they have paid to have their appeal and are successful. I appreciate
that we have had a consensual afternoon, but we might have to agree to
disagree on this particular issue.</div>

Neill:
						</b> We will consider what has been said. I
am still very unhappy, as is the hon. Member for
Meirionnydd Nant Conwy. I am not seeking to get through the whole
afternoon without a Division for the sake of it; we are close to
pressing the amendment to a Division because we are unhappy with the
principle of the proposal. When an applicant does not have any control
over whether the planning authority determines or not, they should not
have to run the risk of forking out for an appeal, in the hope that
they can then claim the costs back. That is wrong, and unless there is
further movement we will pursue the matter further on Report. I beg to
ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div>
