<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I have a short announcement to make about the effect of next Monday's bank holiday on the tabling of amendments. To be unstarred for the sitting next Tuesday 4 May, amendments will have to have been tabled by the rising of the House or the rising of the Committee, if later, this Thursday 29 April. 
<H4><center>Clause 25 </center></H4>
<H4><center>Charges in respect of passengers without proper documents </center></H4>
<P>
Amendment proposed [22 April]: No. 211, in page 1, to leave out lines 20 and 21 and insert the words-- 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(5) for the purposes of this section-- 
<P>
(a) a document is what it purports to be unless its falsity is reasonably apparent, and 
<P>
(b) in deciding whether the falsity of a document is reasonably apparent it shall be assumed that the person making the appropriate judgment is not an immigration officer."
<P>
</UL></FONT>--(Mr. Clappison.)
<P>

<P>
Question again proposed, That the amendment be made. 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind the Committee that with this we are considering Government amendment No. 476. 
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department (Mr. Mike O'Brien):</B> Carriers are encouraged by the immigration service to perform simple but careful checks of a passenger's documentation. To help them avoid charges, the immigration service provides training and awareness in forgery detection and fraudulent use of passports, when requested by carriers. In addition, carriers have access to the 24-hour helpline and the published passport and visa guide. 
<P>
Most carriers accept that by working closely with the immigration service and by taking advantage of free training they can achieve the combined objectives of minimising their potential liability for charges and reducing the number of inadequately documented passengers travelling here. The training is conducted by immigration officers. It enables the carriers to understand the UK's documentary requirement for travel here, to acquire basic forgery detection skills and to identify inadequately documented passengers at source. 
<P>
The training includes free published guidance on passports and visas and other general administration of our carriers liability legislation. It includes regularly updated visa information cards showing who needs a visa to come here; videos made in conjunction with the International Air Transport Association on the subject of inadequately documented passengers, a 24-hour helpline and the ability, as appropriate, to make reference to the nearest British mission. There are at present 10 locations where carriers can refer to airline liaison officers. 
<P>
The immigration service does not expect carriers' check-in staff to demonstrate the same detection skills as immigration officers. The test applied is clearly set out in published guidance which explains that: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The Immigration Service would consider a falsity as reasonably apparent, 'if it were of a standard which a trained representative of the carrying company, examining it carefully but briefly and without the use of technological aids, could reasonably be expected to detect.' A 'trained representative' could be expected to have a level of basic knowledge of how to identify false documents but not to be expert nor to have the resources for a highly detailed examination."
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is open to carriers to make representations to the immigration service if they believe that a forgery is not reasonably apparent. The incidence of forged or fraudulently used documents giving rise to charges is relatively low. For example, in 1998 only 3,136 of the 22,874 inadequately documented passengers who arrived in the United Kingdom held forged documents. Charges were pursued in only 809 cases and 138 were subsequently waived following representations. 
<P>
The immigration service will continue to work closely with carriers to raise their level of awareness and to help them avoid charges. Many carriers, particularly the larger ones, generally undertake their own in-house training. As I have mentioned, we have never expected carrier staff to have the forgery detection skills of immigration officers, so the amendment is unnecessary. I invite the Committee to reject it. 
<P>
On the Government amendment, the essence of clause 25 is that carriers must ensure that the documentation produced satisfactorily establishes a person's identity and nationality. Subsection (5) deals with the falsity of documentation produced. It does not, however, deal specifically with the situation where genuine documentation is presented by an imposter. Amendment No. 476 seeks to clarify clause 25 and make clear the carrier's responsibility for ensuring that a document relates to the person presenting it. Although establishing such responsibility, the amendment also provides the defence that a charge will not be pursued unless it is reasonably apparent that the document, although genuine, related to another person. 
<P>
On that basis, I hope that the hon. Member for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison) will withdraw his amendment, which is unnecessary, and that the Committee will support the Government amendment. 
<P>
<B>Mr. James Clappison </B>(Hertsmere): This has been a useful debate, which clarifies the standard expected of airline staff at check-in gates. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment. 
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. 
<P>
Amendment made: No. 476, in page 18, line 21, at end insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"; and 
<P>
(b) is to be regarded as relating to the person producing it unless it is reasonably apparent that it relates to another person.".--[Mr. Mike O'Brien.]
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 212, in, page 18, line 43, at end add-- 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(11) The Secretary of State must appoint a person to monitor the complexity and effectiveness of visas and stamps required in passports. 
<P>
(12) The monitor must make an annual report on the discharge of his functions to the Secretary of State.".
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This is another amendment intended to elicit some clarification from the Minister on the complexity of visas. The Minister would agree that it is in everybody's interest for visas and stamps to be as straightforward and easy to comprehend as possible while still being effective and fulfilling their purpose. British Airways said that it would be useful to have a used stamp put on a visa when the passenger arrives in the United Kingdom. In future, staff would know when a visa had been used. I look forward to hearing the Minister's views on that. 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The amendment seeks to place a statutory obligation on the Secretary of State to create a formal mechanism to monitor and review the complexity of passport and visa endorsements. The immigration service already provides extensive training and written guidance to carriers in those matters. It also operates a 24-hour telephone helpline for carriers, and where genuine confusion has arisen, the immigration service normally waive the charge. 
<P>
However, we understand the concerns of some carriers, particularly British Airways, that some of our visa and passport endorsements can appear complex to check-in staff. I recently met representatives of British Airways to discuss that and other isssues. 
<P>
In the light of that discussion, we agreed to set up a working party to examine the scope for simplifying all the procedures and ensuring that carriers are more easily able to identify visa and passport endorsements. The work can be complex and difficult because it involves not only an understanding of our visa and passport endorsements, but ensuring that other documentation is dealt with appropriately. That work will be taken forward as part of a wider review of the use of technological developments in immigration control. 
<P>
Setting up the working party to examine the issues is the right way to proceed, rather than embarking on the cumbersome statutory machinery in the amendment. In the light of my assurance that we are working with British Airways to deal with the issues, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> That was a short but useful debate. I emphasise again that it is in everyone's interest for visas to be as easy to understand as possible. I note that the Minister agreed with that, so on that happy note, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment. 
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Richard Allan </B>(Sheffield, Hallam): I beg to move amendment No. 456, in page 18, line 43, at end add-- 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(11) A person who obtains leave to enter or remain as a refugee or whose removal the Secretary of State accepts would be contrary to the Human Rights Act 1998 shall not be a person to whom this section shall apply.".
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We tabled the amendment in order to clarify the meaning of this de facto, if not de jure, provision. 
<P>
It would be helpful to have in the Bill a clear exemption for people who are subsequently given leave to enter and leave to remain because of their status as refugees. There is also the new dimension of the Human Rights Act 1998: the Bill enables people to stay here on human rights grounds--which may not have existed previously--because, for example, they have a valid fear of death or torture in their home country. Various provisions may allow them to argure for staying here on those grounds, rather than the more traditional reasons. I hope that the Minister will say that is done anyway in respect of carriers, but we feel as a matter of principle that it would be useful to state it in the Bill because, in common with a theme running through Committee debates, we feel strongly that United Kingdom immigration and asylum law must not only respect the spirit of the 1951 United Nations convention on refugees, but be seen to do so. It must also make it clear to carriers in this case that they are not expected to put a barrier in the way of people who subsequently may be recognised as refugees, and that there is no incentive for carriers not to allow people to progress their claims effectively. We think that it would be much more helpful to make that explicit in the Bill rather than leave it to a Home Office discretion to disallow the fines on a person who subsequently is given refugee status.

<P>

<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The amendment is defective, but perhaps I should speak about its intent rather than its wording because I shall not be able to accept it anyway. 
<P>
Early in our marathon sitting on 20 and 21 April, we debated at length a similar amendment--No. 210--which the hon. Member for Hertsmere tabled. I explained at the time that the existing policy arose from undertakings given by Ministers in the previous Government during the passage of the original carriers liability legislation that charges would be refunded where a person was granted refugee status. The policy is set out clearly in guidance to carriers published by the immigration service and it is the guidance that the Government follow, so carriers are aware of it. 
<P>
The Government support those previous undertakings. It remains our firm intention to continue to apply existing policy, reflecting our commitment to honouring our obligations under the 1951 convention when refugees reach the UK. The existing policy has operated successfully and, it appears, effectively for more than a decade and we do not wish to interfere with it. In the past two years, the immigration service has refunded £750,000 to carriers in respect of inadequately documented passengers who were subsequently granted refugee status. 
<P>
The Government will consider whether there is a need to place the existing policy within some statutory framework, in either a statutory instrument or in the Bill. In doing that, we shall consider the position of those to whom we provide protection under articles 2 and 3 of the European convention on human rights, which equates 1033 1034 
<P>
with the grant of refugee status. But difficult issues arise here in that ECHR criteria may not be present on entry to the UK, but might manifest themselves later. This poses the question whether carriers liability should then be waived because ECHR grounds were not apparent at the time. 
<P>
It could also be argued that some people who eventually get refugee status do not claim for a while. We have always accepted that such people are included in the policy as it currently operates. We need to examine whether it is desirable or possible to put the provision into a statutory framework in an efficiennt and sensible way that allows flexibility. I do not want to upset something that has worked reasonably well for some time unless it is desirable to do so and would make things better in terms of application. On that basis and taking into account the earlier debate in which those matters were explored in detail, I hope that the hon. Gentleman accepts that we intend to pursue the policy. We are examining issues raised by the ECHR and whether statutory provisions would be of assistance. I am not in a position to say whether we intend to introduce provisions on Report, as we wish to scrutinise the issues in more detail. I understand the point made by the hon. Gentleman, but I do not want to upset things that are currently working reasonably well. 
<H4><center>10.45 am </center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> That was a useful, constructive response. The Minister mentioned £750,000 as the amount refunded to inadequately documented passengers over the past two years--a figure which indicates the scale of the problem. Certainly, many who work with refugees have found that inadequate documentation may result from the fact that they cannot properly access state organisations in their own countries. Therefore, those people may well require other methods of getting hold of documentation, which leads to problems when they arrive in the United Kingdom. 
<P>
I am happy with the Minister's response on how the Government intend to proceed with regard to maintaining the existing policy on refunding and possibly moving towards the statutory basis suggested in the amendment. So constructive was that response that it would be churlish to press my amendment further. I therefore beg leave to withdraw the amendment. 
<P>
Amendment by leave, withdrawn. 
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I have one brief point. The Minister may wish to correct me, as I may well be wrong. I take his nodding as an indication as a sign that he will be helpful. 
<P>
We have devoted much of our debate to the law on carriers liability. Clause 25 is a substantial re-enactment of the Immigration (Carriers' Liability) Act 1987. 
<P>
The Immigration Law Practitioners Association have got hold of the idea that the main change that clause 25 makes to existing provisions is the exclusion of taxis from the list of vehicles that can render the owner or operator liable to a fine under subsection (8). 
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> Looking at the clause, a small taxi would be excluded, but a minibus taxi with more than eight passengers would be included. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Small taxis are excluded from the existing carriers, liability regime, which means that a taxi driver who brings an inadequately documented passenger into the country is not liable. Will the Minister confirm that? 
<P>
How does such a provision fit with the new form of carriers liability? As we discovered in one of our debates last week, a taxi will be a vehicle for the purposes of the new carriers liability. A taxi driver will be subject to carriers liability if he brings a clandestine entrant into the country. 
<P>
Would a taxi driver who goes to the continent to fill up with diesel--which is expensive here--or for another reason, and who took on board a fare-paying passenger and openly brought him back to the country without checking his documents or anything else not be liable under the carriers liability measure? However, if that passenger did not hail that taxi, and did not seek to pay the driver, but hid in the boot, the taxi driver would be liable under the new carriers liability measure for not checking his vehicle for concealed entrants. Will the Minister confirm that? 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> We are adding buses and coaches to the scheme. In view of that, we decided to define buses and coaches and ensure that we do not catch taxis. Therefore, taxis are not covered by clause 25, nor are cars. Instead, those vehicles are caught by a civil penalty if they carry clandestines. We have no problem with inadequately documented passengers in taxis; that has not as yet raised its ugly head as an issue for us. On that basis, we took the view that it was not necessary to extend the provisions to taxis. 
<P>
ILPA appears to think that we have a brief for assisting taxi drivers to carry clandestines, but I can assure the hon. Gentleman that that is not the intention of the clause. Any taxi drivers considering taking up business in clandestines would be well advised not to do so because we certainly intend to crack down on them. I suspect that taxi drivers do not intend to get involved. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The Minister has not quite addressed my point. He talks about taxi drivers getting involved in the clandestines business but passengers would be defined as clandestines under the Bill only if they concealed themselves. If they did not conceal themselves and paid the fare or the taxi driver, out of the goodness of his heart, simply gave them a lift, there would be no liability on the taxi driver. He would be liable only if the person were hidden in the back of the taxi or in the boot and he had not checked. If that same person did not bother to conceal himself or to hide in the boot, but simply asked for a lift, the taxi driver would not be liable. I do not know whether the Minister shares my sense of curiosity about this, but that appears to be the case. 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The Government are satisfied that the clause as currently drafted fulfils our need to ensure that effective immigration controls are met. The person who is not being carried clandestinely in a taxi and who is therefore the subject of ordinary checks by the carriers,  1035 1036 the ferry companies and so on is already covered by the legislation. We do not feel that we need to extend it. It deals with those who are carried clandestinely. Although the hon. Gentleman appears to believe that there is an element of curiosity here, given that the carriers are already covered for openly carried passengers and that his main concern seems to be with those who are not carried clandestinely, he need not worry about this. 
<P>
Our procedures adequately cover all the circumstances that are likely to arise. We are satisfied that the clause deals with the issues that we want it to. The provisions that previously related to the carriage of passengers with inadequate documentation on ships, aircraft and trains are now extended to road vehicles which travel here by ship or aircraft. Bus and coach operators have the same responsibilities as other carriers in ensuring that their passengers travelling to the UK are properly documented. They are well placed to carry out the necessary checks and we think that it is reasonable for them to do so. 
<P>
Question put and agreed to. 
<P>
Clause 25, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill. 
<H4><center>Clause 26 </center></H4>
<H4><center>Visas for transit passengers </center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I beg to move Amendment No. 48, in page 19, line 2, leave out "or territory". 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following Government amendments: No. 49, No. 66, No. 67, No. 53, No. 54, No. 56, and No. 601. 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> These are tidying amendments that do not alter the effect of the clauses or the schedule to which they refer. The aim of amendment No. 56 is simply to provide a general definition in clause 135 for the Bill as a whole to the effect that references to "country" are to be read as including "territory". Amendments Nos. 48, 49, 66, 67, 53, 54 and 601 then change usages of the phrase "country or territory" in clause 26, 49 and 50 and schedule 4 to "country". The net effect of clauses 26, 49 and 50 and schedule 4 is unchanged. I invite the Committee to accept the amendments which are intended to improve the drafting of the Bill. Reference to "territory" as well as "country" is necessary so as to pick up any territories which the United Kingdom has not yet recognised as states. 
<P>
Amendment: agreed to. 
<P>
Amendment made: No. 49, in page 19, line 8, leave out "or territory".--[Mr. Mike O'Brien.]

<P>

<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 213, in page 19, line 16, at end add-- 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(e) may provide that persons holding either a permit to reside in or a visa to enter a state of the European Union shall be exempted from the requirement imposed by the order".
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment was recommended by British Airways, which is concerned about the effects of transit visas on its competitive position in relation to other European airlines. It does not dispute the need for transit visas; indeed, it takes a responsible attitude towards all such matters. However, it is anxious that no unintended consequences in the form of benefits should accrue to other European hubs such as Brussels, where it believes controls are dealt with more flexibly to the significant benefit of transfer traffic at those airports. Perhaps the Minister will be able to tell us that this is another matter that the Government are taking into account. 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The Government have had discussions with British Airways and we propose to continue to work with it and other airlines in our group on how we can better ensure that airlines can carry out their work efficiently without compromising immigration controls. Amendment No. 213 would provide a specific exemption from the requirement to obtain a direct airside transit visa for holders of residence permits or entry visas issued by European Union member states. It would be in addition to the general power to provide for exemptions from DATV requirement contained in subsection (3)(c). 
<P>
Given that the Secretary of State already has the power to provide exemptions, the amendment is unnecessary. The Government have no objection in principle to a system of exemptions from DATV requirements for certain categories of person, but we would have to be certain that any such system would not reopen the opportunity for transit abuse or weaken immigration controls. That is precisely the problem that led to the imposition of DATV regimes in the first place. 
<P>
Our main concern is the security of any residence permit. Any document that provides exemption from an immigration requirement immediately becomes a target for counterfeiters and forgers for use by illegal entrants. We therefore have to be certain that any document providing exemption from DATV requirements is difficult to forge. That is unfortunately not always the case with many of the residence permits currently issued by EU member states. 
<P>
The amendment also provides that holders of EU visas should also be exempt from the requirement to obtain a DATV. Under the existing transit without visa concession, possession of a valid onward visa means that a visa national transiting the UK does not need to obtain a visa. However, the abuse of this concession led to the introduction of DATV regimes in the first place and there is no reason to believe that an exemption for holders of EU visas would not have the same effect. In view of our concern about the impact on immigration control, I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment. 
<P>
As I say, we are in discussions with British Airways. We want to ensure that we get the right balance so that it and its fellow carriers can carry out their work effectively and profitably without undermining our immigration controls in the process. I am sure that that is a view with which the hon. Gentleman could concur. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I do concur with that sentiment. We share the belief in the need for strong immigration controls here. The competitive position of BA and 1037 1038 
<P>
British airports is worth bearing in mind at the same time. We have made our point and this has been a useful debate. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment. 
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. 
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill. 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The purpose of clause 26 is to give the Secretary of State the power to issue direct airside transit visas for nationals of certain countries or holders of specified documents. The clause currently forms part of the Immigration (Carriers' Liability) Act 1987, which is to be repealed and replaced by clauses 25 and 26. I hope that the Committee will support the clause. 
<P>
Question put and agreed to. 
<P>
Clause 26, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill. 
<H4><center>Clause 27 </center></H4>
<H4><center>Power to detain vehicles etc. in connection with charges under section 25  </center></H4>
<P>
<H5>11 am </H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 50, in page 19, line 23, at end insert-- 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"( ) If a transporter is detained under subsection (1) it may continue to be detained pending payment of any connected expenses.".
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take Government amendments Nos. 59 and 60. 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The effect of Government amendment No. 50 is to extend the scope for detention of a transporter, in connection with carrier's liability charges under clause 25, to include detention 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"pending payment of any connected expenses".
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This means pending payment of expenses incurred by the Government in connection with detention of the transporter. There will be such expenses. There will be a contract with one or more organisations to take away and store any vehicle or other transporter in connection with carriers liability charges, which will fall to be paid by the owner or other person responsible for the detained transporter. It would be inappropriate if a transporter were to be released before those charges were paid by that person. Amendment No. 50 ensures that the Secretary of State has powers to ensure that this does not happen. 
<P>
Schedule 1 provides for the sale of transporters under clause 23 or 27 and requires the permission of the court to be obtained before a transporter can be sold. 
<P>
Amendment Nos. 59 and 60 allow the court to give leave to sell a transporter where there is proof that the person liable for the charge or penalty has failed to pay any connected expenses arising out of the detention of the transporter, even where they may have paid the relevant penalty or charge. 
<P>
As hon. Members will be aware, the person liable for the penalty or charge will have an opportunity to remedy the situation before it gets to that point, either by paying the charge or penalty or by offering some other form of security against it. However, if we reach the stage where no payment has been made and, in addition, costs have been incurred in relation to the detention and storage of the transporter, there must be a mechanism whereby the Secretary of State can apply to the court for sale, not only to collect the penalty or charge, but also to recoup costs incurred in the detention and storage of the transporter. 
<P>
I therefore invite the Committee to accept the amendment. 
<P>
Amendment agreed to. 
<P>
Amendment made: No. 51, in page 19, line 42, leave out "detention and".--[Mr. O'Brien.] 
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill. 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I ask the Committee to support clause 27. The majority of carriers work closely with the immigration service to meet obligations under existing carriers liability legislation, but there have been difficulties regarding non-payment of some charges. It is important to reinforce current legislation to ensure full carrier compliance. Clause 27 achieves that by providing a new power to allow the immigration service to detain transporters to recover unpaid charges. However, we envisage using the power only when other attempts to recover debt have failed. 
<P>
Question put and agreed to. 
<P>
Clause 27, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill. 
<H4><center>Schedule 1 </center></H4>
<H4><center>Detention and Sale of Transporters </center></H4>
<P>
Amendments made: No. 59, in page 86, line 7, after "is", insert "or was". 
<P>
No. 60, in page 86, line 8, after "it", insert "or any connected expenses".--[Mr. O'Brien.] 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 61, in page 86, line 30, leave out "specified" and insert "prescribed". 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take Government amendments Nos. 62 to 65. 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Schedule 1 deals with the sale of transporters under clause 23 or 27. It sets out the criteria to be met before the court agrees a sale, places certain requirements on the Secretary of State--such as the need to obtain best price--and sets out how the proceeds from any sale are to be distributed. 
<P>
For the purposes of schedule 1 we want to make one statutory instrument. As currently drafted, we would have to make two as paragraph (2) refers to regulations and paragraph (5) to orders. To remove that anomaly, we are introducing the amendments. The effect of amendment No. 61 is to allow the Secretary of State to prescribe by regulations how the proceeds from the sale of a transporter are applied, while amendments Nos. 62 and 63 allow the Secretary of State to prescribe by regulations the priority in which such proceeds of any sale can be paid. Presently an order is required. Amendment No. 64 removes a definition of "specified", as in specified by order, as it is no longer required. A definition of "prescribed" can be found in clause 135. Amendment No. 65 is purely consequential. I invite the Committee to accept the amendments. 
<P>
Amendment agreed to. 
<P>
Amendments made: No. 62, in page 86, line 31, leave out "specified rules" and insert "such provision". 
<P>
No. 63, in page 86, line 31, after "payments", insert "as may be prescribed". 
<P>
No. 64, in page 86, leave out line 32.

No. 65, in page 86, line 33, leave out "order" and insert "regulations".--[Mr. Mike O'Brien.]

<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 215, in page 20, line 6, at end insert "or a county court". 
<P>
The amendment relates to the interpretation part of the Bill and, more specifically, to the interpretation of "court". The clause makes it clear that in England and Wales it means the High Court. Thus a person who goes to court to seek the release of a transporter must go to the High Court. We have been over that ground in earlier debates, which gave the Minister food for thought. I would add only that it must be well within the capabilities of a judge in the county or magistrates courts to determine what sort of issues will arise under this part of the Bill. I ask the Minister to reflect further on that and write to me with the results of his reflections, which would be the best way forward.

<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I have some sympathy with the points made by the hon. Member for Hertsmere and we are examining a means of dealing with them on Report. I will write to the hon. Gentleman before Report and let him know the outcome of our deliberations. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Under those circumstances, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment. 
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. 
<P>
Amendment made: No. 52, in page 20, line 19, at end insert-- 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"'hirer', in relation to a vehicle, means any person who has hired the vehicle from another person;".
<P>
</UL></FONT>--[Mr. Mike O'Brien]
<P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 216, in page 20 leave out lines 41 to 44 and insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"'train' means a train engaged on an international service as defined by section 13(6) of the Channel Tunnel Act 1987".
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This deals with an important point. The interpretation part of the Bill specifically excludes a shuttle train from the meaning of "train". Other trains are liable under the carriers liability regime, but not shuttle trains. 
<P>
Several organisations that gave evidence to the Committee commented on that matter, including the British Chamber of Shipping and the Passenger Shipping Association. It is not surprising that the ferry companies view the problem from their point of view and noticed a hole in the provisions for carriers' liability regarding shuttle trains. 
<P>
Will the Minister provide more information on the problem? I do not wish to be too disputatious but the Minister has told us throughout the Committee's proceedings that he is doing his utmost to prevent clandestine entrants from coming into the country. Every time we queried the fairness of the provisions on carriers liability for lorry drivers, we were told that they were necessary for maximum deterrence--to prevent people from getting into the country and being a burden on the taxpayer. 
<P>
We are therefore a little surprised by what appears to be a gaping hole as regards shuttle trains, especially the Eurostar service from Paris to London. Can the Minister say whether there is carriers' liability on the Eurostar service from Paris to London which would be defined as a shuttle train under clause 28? A written answer that I have received from the Minister since our debates on the matter underlines the concern felt about it. The Minister told us about the 8,000 people who gained clandestine entry to this country as illegal entrants in lorries. Apparently last year 2,820 people travelled here on the Eurostar service--or perhaps some other service--and claimed asylum at Waterloo station. That is almost 3,000 people, and they are still coming. In January and February this year, 535 applications for asylum were made at Waterloo station. If that continues, there will be more than 3, 000 applicants at Waterloo station this year, most of them presumably ariving on the Eurostar. 
<P>
The Government are aware of that because they stated in last summer's White Paper that they were discussing the matter urgently with the French Government. Since then nothing seems to have happened. Will the Minister tell us what the Government intend to do, because it sits oddly with everything else that they have told us, and with the regime being set up for lorry drivers and their liability, that a gaping hole has been left as regards people travelling on Eurostar from Paris to London. We take immigration control seriously: that is a gaping hole in immigration control and it is up to the Government to tell us what they are doing about it. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> If there is a gaping hole, it is one that the previous Government created and thought they ought to continue with. The hon. Gentleman was a Minister in that Government; it is a matter for him that he critises them. 
<P>
Amendment No. 216 is somewhat different. The Paris to London service is not a shuttle train; the Paris to London route and Eurostar are caught by clause 25. Paris to London trains are affected by the Bill, but there are difficulties with collating charges from the French Eurostar service, as the hon. Gentleman will know. 
<P>
The amendment would extend the definition of a train for the purposes of clause 25 to include all trains engaged in international service, in line with the definition of a train in section 13(6) of the Channel Tunnel Act 1987. 1041 1042 The amendment would remove the exclusion of shuttle trains from clause 25, and is unacceptable for the following reason: shuttle trains as defined by section 19 of the 1987 Act are excluded by virtue of our operating juxtapositioned controls in France. Persons travelling to the United Kingdom via the shuttle pass through UK immigration controls while in France; it would therefore be inappropriate for us to impose a carriers liability charge because passengers will already have been seen by an immigration officer. The hon. Gentleman has raised some points that perhaps can be dealt with in another context, but shuttle passengers will have been seen by an immigration officer during the journey--as the hon. Gentleman will know if he has travelled on that service. Therefore, his amendment would not have the desired effect. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I am prepared to accept that the amendment is defective, but the Minister knows what I am getting at. Will he confirm that no charges were levied in respect of the 2,820 people who made their way to this country last year? That seemed to be the drift of what he said. 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The juxtaposed control operates to ensure that controls are practised on both sides of the channel. We and the French operate controls on either side. No charges were imposed for those people. The problem is that French law makes it unlawful for employees or agents of SNCF to check passenger travel documents; the difficulties in French law are being discussed with our colleagues. However, the French authorities have been most helpful and co-operative in imposing juxtaposed controls themselves. 
<P>
DICCILEC officers at the Paris end operate a certain degree of control. That has been enormously helpful and has benefited the operation of immigration controls. If the hon. Gentleman travels to anywhere via Paris on Eurostar, he may find that the checking of documents by DICCILEC is from time to time more robust than elsewhere. So the French authorities do afford us some assistance, but we can always do better, and we are discussing with them ways of improving the standard of our controls. For French legal reasons these matters are not straightforward and simple. However, the co-operation of the French authorities assists substantially in reducing the scale of the problem that the hon. Gentleman identified. 
<H4><center>11.15 am </center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I do not wish to be too disputatious but I confess to being a little more concerned now than at the outset because at least I thought then that the Government were considering the matter urgently but perhaps were not getting anywhere. We seem to have reached a position where the Minister is happy with what is happening and satisfied with the amount of co-operation. I am sure that co-operation has been forthcoming and I am delighted by that, but the problem is not diminishing. The number of applicants is increasing: according to figures given to me by the House of Commons Library, there were 260 applications for asylum at Waterloo station in January and 280 in February. If they continue at that rate, even more people than last year will enter by that route. 
<P>
I invite the Minister to consider the matter from the viewpoint of lorry drivers. They will be expected to pay a penalty of £2,000 per clandestine entrant for failing to check their vehicles or if they are unable to avail themselves of a defence, yet thousands of people are coming into the country each year and not paying a penny in charges. There seems to be one law for the big and mighty and another for the little lorry driver. 
<P>
The Minister has lectured us heavily about the public interest--his defence to every question about procedural fairness and the fairness of principles has been that we must stop these people getting into the country--yet thousands are coming in by this other means and the Government state that they are satisfied with the co-operation of the French authorities. We were told last July that urgent discussions were taking place, but nothing has yet happened; all we seem to hear about are more and more discussions. It is all most unsatisfactory. 
<P>
I accept that the amendment may be defective. However, the point I am making will not go away: It needs to be dealt with in the public interest because it will be a cause for grievance among lorry drivers who will compare the treatment meted out to them with the way that other entrants are treated. I may wish to come back to the matter later in the Bill's proceedings, but so as to make progress, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment. 
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. 
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> Clause 28 defines many of the terms in part II of the Bill. Some are new to us, others come from legislation. An example in this helpful series of definitions is "small ship" which is defined as 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"a ship which has a gross tonnage of less than 500 tonnes"
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and derives from section 25(7) of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1971. I therefore hope that the Committee supports the clause. 
<P>
Question put and agreed to. 
<P>
Clause 28, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill. 
<H4><center>Clause 29 </center></H4>
<H4><center>Bail hearings for detained persons </center></H4>
<P>
<B> Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 637, in page 21, line 10, leave out from "Act" to end of line 12. 
<P>
We move on to a completely new subject: the question of bail for those who are subject to immigration detention. Sadly, every year, substantial numbers of people are held in detention for various reasons. That is sad, but detention is required for firm immigration control. There is no disagreement between the parties on that issue. 
<P>
Under clause 29 and subsequent clauses, bail references are to take place in a magistrates court. Should someone be detained under the Immigration Act 1971 or under section 7(4) of the Asylum and Immigration Appeals Act 1993, a bail reference to the courts must be arranged.

<P>

<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The hon. Gentleman appears to be about to make a lengthy speech. I should therefore assist him by saying that amendment No. 637 is acceptable. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> That is a step forward. I hope that other amendments will be equally acceptable. 
<P>
Amendment No. 637 deals with cases in which the Home Secretary decides to make a deportation order. However, the Minister has apprehended our arguments and I am pleased that he has seen sense. We thought it strange that such a provision should appear in the Bill, but we are glad that the Minister has put the matter right. As the Minister has accepted the amendment, I need say nothing further or seek leave to do anything. 
<P>
Amendment agreed to. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to amendment No. 231, in page 21, line 17, after "(1)", insert-- 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"() has been recommended for deportation by a court following a criminal conviction".
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I hope to have the same success with this amendment as I did with amendment No. 637. As has already been mentioned, someone who is subject to deportation is included among those who will have a bail reference arranged under the Bill. As the Minister accepted amendment No. 637, the force of amendment No. 231 is lessened. No doubt, the Minister is mindful of the course that he is taking and will confirm that that is so. 
<P>
Amendment No. 231 focuses on a person who is subject to deportation after a court recommendation for deportation. We shall hear about such people in due course, but we thought it inappropriate that such people should have a bail reference under the scheme in clause 29, when they have an opportunity to seek bail under other provisions in criminal law. 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I have instinctive sympathy for the hon. Gentleman's proposition. I shall examine how such a concept may be appropriately included in an amendment at a later stage, possibly on Report. 
<P>
The aim of the provisions is to ensure that we bring reason and order to the operation of the detention process. In many ways, that system operates well. However, there is a gap as a judicial review of detention decisions is required. In addressing that, we are anxious not to create a situation in which people convicted of a serious criminal offence can claim immigration status--on asylum or other grounds--at the end of their sentence, with a view to getting released in the United Kingdom. 
<P>
Therefore, we intend to consider how the amendment may be incorporated into the Bill at a later stage, or at least give a clear indication that we propose to operate in such a way. I am not in a position to agree to the amendment, but I accept that we need to give further consideration to such matters, and hope to write to the hon. Gentleman in due course. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I am grateful for the Minister's courteous, helpful response and for his offer to write to me. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I commend the Government amendments to the Committee. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I rise to speak to the Government amendments and to those standing in my name--Nos. 623 and 624. 
<P>
The Government amendments answer the query raised by the Law Society of Scotland. Under the clause a date is specified by which a hearing has to be held-- 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"no earlier than the fifth"
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
day. However, the Law Society of Scotland pointed out that in Scotland, that would place immigration detainees in a worse position than criminals who are always brought before the court on the next lawful day for their bail hearing under the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995. Concern was expressed that setting a date before which one could not have a hearing would have been regressive in Scottish terms. The Government amendments set a date later than which one cannot hold a hearing, which would deal with the circumstances in Scotland. 
<P>
Reflecting on amendments Nos. 623 and 624, it occurred to me that they might have merit south of the border too. There is often immigration detention of people who are not necessarily accused of a criminal offence. It happens when immigration officials deem that someone might abscond or that they fulfill some other criteria for detention. It is a special case when people who have not been accused of any crime are deprived of their liberty, sometimes on grounds that they would want to challenge. 
<P>
In those circumstances, there is a case for allowing an early hearing to decide whether such people can be released on bail. The Scottish legal system is able to provide hearings for those detained under criminal law on the next lawful working day, so the amendments that deal with the Scottish circumstances might have wider merit. The Government amendment sets a limit of eight days for holding a hearing to decide whether someone held as an immigration detainee should be released, but why cannot we provide the same efficiency and effectiveness as the Scottish system and provide bail hearings on the next lawful day after detention? 
<P>
In setting an eight-day limit, I hope that the Minister is mindful of the particular circumstances that affect immigration detainees, which should encourage earlier hearings whenever possible. Will he confirm that he intends to hold hearings as quickly as possible--if not on the next day, within two or three days--rather than shunt them up to the back end of the upper limit that he is setting in law? 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The Government's aim is to start to introduce routine bail hearings, so that people being detained know that they will, after a period of time, appear before the magistrates court to put their views on why they should be released. The court should consider whether individuals' circumstances justify release and, if they do not, whether conditions should be imposed. 
<P>
<H5>11.30 am </H5>
</P>
<P>
In practice, most people are detained only for a short period--perhaps a day or two--and then released. Initially, identity is the main issue, and detainees may be detained only while their identity is being established to some satisfaction. They will then be released. 
<P>
When we initially consulted on routine bail hearings, it was interesting that organisations such as the Refugee Council, and others, suggested 28 days as the point at which such hearings should first take place. The Government took the view that that was far too long and that seven or eight days would be more appropriate. We did not opt for a shorter period because, as I said, most detainees were not held for very long. If it was necessary to hold them for more than a week, we felt that it was right to bring the individuals before the court. 
<P>
The Scottish system works differently in many ways from the English system. Very few detainees are held under immigration powers in Scotland, and the Scottish system does not have many of the pressures and constraints of the English system. The immigration service is able, because there are so few cases, to deal with them more quickly in Scotland. It often takes longer to interview, process, establish identity and deal with cases in England. However, our aim is to develop a system that deals adequately and appropriately with all individual's circumstances. The Scottish and English systems are different so it is right that the provisions for dealing with them are different. 
<P>
The hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Allan) asked whether bail hearings should be held within a period less than the maximum. The answer is yes, that is indeed the case. It may be appropriate, because of the working hours of the English and Welsh courts, to hold hearings earlier than within the normal seven-day period. The Bill will eventually allow a level of flexibility so we will be able to decide to hold earlier hearings, but it will not normally be our intention to do so. Many people will be released after a few days and will not be detained so there is no need to bring them before a court so quickly. 
<P>
I hope that the hon. Member for Hallam will accept that we do not need a provision for hearings in 24 hours. That may well be achievable in Scotland, but obliging courts--of whatever sort--to sit on a Sunday in England and Wales may not be as easy, in terms of convincing magistrates, as the hon. Gentleman envisages. I hope that he will not press the amendment to a Division. 
<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> On a point of order, Mrs. Roe. The group comprised some amendments standing in my name. They were probing amendments and I have heard the Minister's explanation of the issues that they raised in respect of timing. Is it in order for me to leave matters as they are now?

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 527, in page 21, line 32, after "detained", insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"and again every twenty-eight days thereafter.".

<P>
No. 529, in page 21, line 41, leave out from "reference" to end of line 42 and insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"within three days of receiving the reference.".
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> This is an important group of amendments dealing with the issue of repeat appearances before a court. Amendment No. 526 establishes the principle of further references to court rather than simply a second reference to the court as in the Bill. Amendment No. 527 specifies that there should be a further hearing every 28 days after the initial hearing. Amendments No. 528 and 529 are consequential amendments. 
<P>
The idea behind the amendments is to try to establish a principle that people held in detention for long periods should have regular reviews. That is a matter of particular concern to us because we are aware of a significant number of people held in detention for as long as six months, a year and even longer. Some are subsequently given refugee status, and although I understand that the law has been processed in due fashion, there seems to be a natural injustice. A person arrives here and is subsequently recognised to have a lawful claim to refugee status, yet in the interim is deprived of his liberty for a year or 18 months. 
<P>

<P>
Although we welcome the introduction of a statutory bail hearing within eight days and a review hearing, we are concerned that if a person overcomes those two hurdles, he will not be reviewed at a later date because the system will be deemed to have done its job. We are worried that people may not be well represented at the original hearing and the second hearing for whatever reason. They are newly arrived in the country for the first hearing and will certainly not have been here that long by the time of the second, so they may not have got their representation sorted out effectively. 
<P>
Later they may encounter good advisers who can give them better advice about how to approach the bail hearing. They may come into contact with a support group. There are active support groups around Campsfield house in Oxford, which are keen to offer people the stability they need for the immigration service to feel confident that they can be released from detention. All those factors may change. Our intention is to ensure that there is a statutory method for the detention to be reviewed in order for any of those new factors to be brought into play. 
<P>
Without this provision, there is a risk that the initial and second hearings having been dealt with, there will be a feeling that no further review needs to be made in any kind of formal way. If the Government have admirably accepted the principle that the appropriate way to review a detention hearing is through the formal court mechanism--as proposed here--and the formality of a bail hearing, the principle should be applied to later reviews. 
<P>
If the Minister intends that there should be an administrative review but not a court review, that may be contrary to the fact that the more formal process of a bail hearing has been accepted for the initial and second hearings. I hope that the Minister can tell us how the Government intend to proceed with this category of long-term detainees who are of concern to us and, I hope, to the Government. I hope that he can tell us that there will be an open review of their detention and some opportunity for them to seek bail at a later date. 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Clause 29 gives effect to the undertaking we gave in last year's White Paper to introduce a more extensive judicial element into the immigration detention process. There will be a routine hearing after a week and, unless the person concerned is granted bail or otherwise released, a second routine hearing after roughly a month. The amendments would require further routine bail hearings at monthly intervals thereafter until bail was finally granted or the person was released or removed. 
<P>
The Government believe that it is right for the first hearing to take place as quickly as is practicable in the circumstances. I have already discussed those circumstances so I will not rehearse them again. I accept that a week is a long time, but a number of things need to be done then. We feel it right that there should be an opportunity for a second full hearing of the individual's circumstances. However, to continue to have hearings after that would appear to be only for the purpose of producing the person in court to rehearse what has already been decided. It would almost bring the way that the process operates and the previous decision of the court into disrepute. 
<P>
We accept that when the individual's circumstances change--the hon. Member for Hallam, as a lawyer, will be aware of how the Bail Act 1976 operates--the individual may wish to ask for a new bail hearing on the basis of that change. To recap, there is an initial full hearing after about a week followed by a second full hearing, at which point the court has made a clear decision. In criminal cases, remand prisoners used to be produced every month which was a pointless exercise if they were not making a bail application, and the day out was sometimes an inconvenience. 
<P>
If there has been a change of circumstances, a detainee may say, "I wish to go back to court to make a bail application because whereas before I did not have a surety, I can now provide one," or "Whereas before I did not have a satisfactory address to go to, I can now provide one and I can also now produce some documentation about my identity." If there is a change of circumstances after the second hearing, which the detainee believes affects his case, he can then activate an application for bail. 
<P>
If the detainee has an appeal pending, the application will be heard by an adjudicator; if he does not have an appeal pending, the application will be to a magistrate under the rules that will be made under clause 36. He does not require a further routine bail hearing to bring him before the court. Equally, in the absence of any change in his circumstances, it will serve no purpose to bring him to court again and again as proposed by the amendments. On the basis that we propose to allow the lawyers who act on behalf of a detainee to make an application on the grounds that there has been a change of circumstances to reactivate the issue of bail at an appropriate time thereafter, I ask the hon. Gentleman not to press the amendment. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> That was useful in establishing that a person's circumstances can change quite dramatically in six months and there may be reason to review the situation. I am pleased that there is an opening for that to be done. A Kosovan, for example, currently in detention may have been held for some time. If his family arrived in this country, that would clearly be a major change of circumstances requiring a review of his detention. Circumstances can change in many other ways, such as as a result of new people arriving in the country, developments in the country of origin or progress in their appeals, where this further review will be required. 
<P>
The spirit of the amendment was to have routine review. Although the Minister says that it may just be routine and of little merit, there is some merit in it as a matter of principle when someone is held under administrative detention rather than because he or she committed a crime or, as in the case of a remand prisoner, has a Crown Prosecution Service case which is simply waiting to be presented to a court. There are different circumstances for immigration detainees and there is a matter of principle which suggests that a regular review, although a burden, is necessary in a liberal and free society. 
<P>
I should like to revisit this issue later in discussion with colleagues. 
<P>
I will not press the amendment to a vote. However, this is an issue of principle which requires revisiting before consideration of the Bill is complete. I therefore beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> We come to an important subject, the principles on which magistrates operate the bail system. Many of those who gave evidence to the Committee commented on this. 
<P>
Many who are currently in detention under the existing measure have a right to apply for bail to an adjudicator within the framework of the immigration system. Indeed, according to the handbook on immigration, nationality and refugee law, 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"almost all people detained under Immigration Act powers have the right to apply for bail, usually to an adjudicator or tribunal of the independent appellate authority".
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Obviously, the adjudicator or the tribunal of the independent appellate authority are used to dealing with immigration matters and immigration law. Under clause 29, bail references will be handled by magistrates courts. However, the clauses give no guidance to magistrates on the basis on which they are to exercise their judgments in cases involving detainees, references. 
<P>
The Bill is silent on how magistrates are to adjudicate on bail references. The Minister has adverted to the criminal jurisdiction of magistrates courts in bail applications in which a person is being held on remand before his charges come to court for trial. In such cases, the principles that magistrates must examine in determining bail applications are well known and are set out in the Bail Act 1976. Magistrates courts and all those who appear before them are familiar with those principles. 
<P>
By and large, the provisions of the 1976 Act have worked well and have needed only a little fine tuning. There is a presumption in favour of bail, but if certain specified grounds are made out, the magistrates need not grant bail. For example, the magistrates do not grant bail if they fear that the person concerned will commit an offence on bail. 
<P>
The Bill contains nothing akin to the criteria in the Bail Act 1976. There is nothing to give the magistrates guidance. However, the Bail Act is a piece of criminal legislation, so it would be inappropriate to import it into the Bill. The Bill is a different kettle of fish: people in immigration detention are not going to be charged with a criminal offence. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> The hon. Gentleman's comment reveals a common fallacy. Very often, people who are detained have committed offences against the immigration rules. Therefore, they are offenders; indeed, some of them may also have committed criminal offences. There is a perception that detainees are, in some way, innocent. Some of them may well be; others may not. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I hate to disagree with the Minister, but he is completely wrong; he has got the wrong end of the stick. 
<P>
The Minister knows from experience that everyone who is held on remand in prison on criminal charges is the subject of a criminal charge. That is not the case with people who are held in immigration detention. The Minister is right to say that some of those people are criminal offenders; I am not claiming that there should be a perception of innocence in such cases. However, those people are held in detention not on that basis, but on a completely different basis. 
<P>
As some people in immigration detention are not alleged to have committed any offences--the Minister must agree about that--it would be wrong to use the Bail Act criteria, which are designed to deal with people who have committed criminal offences. The Minister will be getting into deep and unpleasant waters if he pursues that line. I therefore suggest that he stops pursuing that line at once and considers how the matter will be dealt with and how magistrates are to be given guidance. 
<P>
I draw the Minister's attention to amendments Nos. 235 and 236, the latter being substantive. Those amendments contain our thoughts on what the criteria 1051 1052 may be. Those criteria are not intended as a counsel of perfection, but they would give the magistrates some guidance. Amendment No. 236 would insert into clause 29: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The court must not grant bail if it appears to the court that there are grounds for believing that the person, if released on bail, (a) would not comply with conditions, in particular a condition requiring him to attend before an immigration officer or 
<P>
(b) would commit an offence while on bail."
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Paragraph (a) would include someone who is apt to disappear and does not turn up; and paragraph (b) would deal with the cases to which the Minister has already adverted, in which there is a risk of people committing offences on bail. Of course, there are such people in immigration detention and we must cater for them. However, we must also cater for other people in immigration detention. We are asking how magistrates are to do their job. 
<P>
I do not know whether the Minister read amendment No. 648 before making his comments, but it makes them look even more inappropriate than they were already, as it raises the important matter of the Government's attitude towards detained people who are the subject of serious charges in other countries. If someone is in immigration detention and is the subject of serious charges--not under the United Kingdom's jurisdiction, but in another country--would not that be a reason for withholding bail? 
<P>
More guidance needs to be given to magistrates than that which appears in the Bill. Britain's magistrates are public-spirited people, but they are not adjudicators used to dealing with immigration law and immigration matters, nor are they members of the immigration tribunal. Therefore, they should be given guidance, as has been said by many of those who are interested in the Bill. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> The amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Hertsmere are helpful. Certainly, subsection (6) is a bold statement and it is hard to see how the detail can be written into it. In particular, the amendments would assist the magistrates with two matters which they will be considering. One of those matters is querying the grounds for the detention. As we have heard, those grounds might include the likelihood of a person absconding and the likelihood of a person breaking the immigration rules, perhaps because he or she has come in under false documentation or under other pretences which mean that he or she seems to be breaching the immigration rules. 
<P>
As the hon. Member for Hertsmere explained, it will be difficult to test those grounds on the criteria used to judge criminals who come before the magistrates court. Clear guidance must be provided, and amendment No. 236 helpfully sets out the guidance that might he used. The grounds on which a person is detained must be tested, as must an issue which is normally tested in a bail application involving the presumption in favour of release. Given that a person is detained under particular circumstances, what is the likelihood of a problem arising if that person is released back into the community while awaiting trial? 
<P>
That is how magistrates normally deal with such matters. However, it seems to be difficult to introduce into the Bill the process of assessing the risk of a problem if people are released. What drives us to say that a person must be kept in confinement, rather than go back to the community? Such judgments are different to those made for people held in detention centres. For example, there is a well-known support group of very respectable people, including the Bishop of Oxford, who support people who come to this country and offer them security. As a group of genuine concerned citizens they will offer people a home, and ensure that they are connected to their community and that they comply with conditions set by immigration officers. Those are the sort of proposals that are likely to come before a magistrates court. I find it hard to equate the circumstances of the Bishop of Oxford and his allies telling a court that a person for whom they feel great concern will comply with conditions, with the more ordinary circumstances of a criminal case where a decision on whether to grant bail must be made. The Minister needs to explain why there is only a simple bald statement in clause 29(6) to the effect that a case must proceed as if a person was on bail. The hon. Gentleman must also tell the Committee how he intends to implement the provision and say whether it will take account of the circumstances that amendment No. 236 would put in place. Can he also say whether the process would query both elements--the reasons for detention and the safety of release--even where the reasons for detention are deemed significant and serious enough to have justified detention originally? 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The hon. Member for Hertsmere and I obviously disagree about detainees, and to some extent about the basis on which they are held. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Will the Minister give way as I think that that is a deliberate misunderstanding? 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will bear with me for a moment. Detainees are sometimes persons who have offended against immigration laws. They may not be held especially for that reason, although it may be a relevant consideration in determining whether there is a fear of their absconding, which is the primary reason for detaining people. However, we must not get into a debate now about reasons for detention. 
<P>
The issue that the hon. Gentleman presented is slightly different, and one with which I have great sympathy, namely, the circumstances in which bail should be granted. He questioned how we would set out in the Bill the criteria for a decision by magistrates, and, in due course, by an adjudicator if there were an appeal. I have sympathy with his view that it would be better to set out in the Bill in greater detail how a magistrate should come to a decision. I looked at this amendment after the hon. Gentleman tabled it but, unfortunately, I have not had the opportunity fully to reflect on its implications, and especially on the wording. I suspect that he might want that to be different. I have sympathy with his proposition that we state more clearly in the Bill the precise criteria by which a magistrate--or an adjudicator in the case of routine hearings--would reach a decision. I will take away amendments Nos. 235 and 236 and reflect on them a little more. 
<P>
The group of amendments goes directly to an important issue that was the subject of much comment during the evidence sessions at the beginning of the Committee--the statutory presumption of bail. I have been looking at the evidence with a great deal of care, and have thought about whether the Government ought to reflect on the matter in more detail. We are examining more fully whether it might be possible to move to some extent. I therefore ask the Committee to give us some time to reflect on how a statutory presumption might work and on the practicalities of its operation in certain circumstances. There are difficulties, which is why we initially took the view that there would not be presumption. However, I have looked with great care at some of the evidence from the various refugee groups and others, and am persuaded that some, although not all, the difficulties can be overcome. If we were to move a certain way in due course, I would first need to examine whether there might be exceptions to that movement that would deal with some of the practical difficulties of the concept. 
<P>
<H5>12 noon </H5>
</P>
<P>
I am alerting members of the Committee to the way that the Government are looking at the issues because the group of amendments goes directly to the basis on which a decision will he made. It may be helpful for us to reflect on the way that the amendments from the hon. Member for Hertsmere would take us. On that basis, the hon. Gentleman may consider withdrawing his amendment. 
<P>
I have some concern about amendment No. 648. It is right and proper for a court to be able to consider, in making a decision, information about charges that may be outstanding in another country; indeed, it is a relevant factor in determining the question of bail. However, I do not think it right to constrain the discretion in the way proposed. Circumstances will differ greatly. Some countries may well put charges against persons seeking asylum in this country that we would not be comfortable with. They may, in terms of our laws, be completely unjustified and may reflect a political motive rather than a criminal reason, although they will be laid as criminal charges. So that issue must be handled with care. That is a relevant factor that ought to be taken into account, but the courts must be trusted to decide how to do that, and to decide the extent to which they allow it to weigh against the granting of bail. 
<P>
The hon. Member for Hertsmere had some convincing arguments about the other proposals on the exercise of the court's discretion being based on criteria set out in legislation. We are able now to provide greater consideration. No doubt in due course we shall be able to come back to the Committee--or, morely likely, to the House on Report--to discuss the issues at greater length.

<P>

<B>Mr. Neil Gerrard </B>(Walthamstow): As the Minister knows, a new clause tabled in my name which we shall come to later relates to this matter. 
<P>
The Minister has been extremely helpful in undertaking to look again at the bail provisions. As the hon. Member for Hertsmere said, currently many people are eligible for bail but it is often extremely difficult to obtain it, because there is no presumption in favour and because being granted bail depends to a great extent on being able to find suitable sureties. Asylum seekers, and people who are relatively new arrivals in the country, would find it extremely difficult to secure a surety. Even people who would probably be granted bail if there were a presumption in favour would face great difficulties. I said on Second Reading that we ought to look again at the issue of bail provisions to see how we could move towards presumption. So I welcome the Minister's comment. I hope that we can move in that direction and return to the issue on Report. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for his latter comments. However, I well understand that though some people in detention have committed criminal offences, whether against immigration law or general criminal law, others have not and it is inappropriate for them to be dealt with by bail provisions, which apply to those already alleged to have committed a criminal offence. 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Perhaps the disagreement between us is less than I originally thought. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I hope that that has cleared up any misunderstanding. 
<P>
The Minister also referred to a presumption in favour of bail but that does not appear in the amendments, which contain a prohibition on bail. My point was similar to that of the hon. Member for Hallam--that the Bill should provide some guidance for magistrates. They receive detailed advice on criminal cases under the the schedules of the Bail Act 1976, which specify how they should proceed, what factors they need to take into account and the reasons that they can adduce for deciding to withhold bail. It is all set out clearly for magistrates and it is only fair, in asking them to exercise their judgment on decisions that affect individuals, liberty in respect of immigration, to provide them with such guidance and criteria. 
<P>
Amendments Nos. 235 and 236 would impose a prohibition on bail in certain cases. We should not be granting bail to people who will either abscond and not comply with conditions or commit offences while on bail. That must be the case and I look forward to hearing the Minister's views. 
<P>
I heard what the Minister said about amendment No. 648 but I invite him to examine it more closely. He said that he was unsure whether some offences in this country would be dealt with as harshly in other countries. The amendment refers to detained people who are 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the subject of charges in another country for an offence which is . .  . an offence"
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
in this country, and is also 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"punishable with more than 10 years imprisonment"
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
in this country. We take that issue seriously. A let-out is provided in that the person can still be granted bail if he can show "exceptional circumstances". 
<P>
As I said, we must be careful before granting bail to people who are the subject of serious criminal charges in other countries and I invite the Minister to give his serious attention to the problem. He said that he would  1055 1056 write to me and I look forward to receiving his letter before Report because an element of public protection is involved. Some, though not all, detainees will fall into this category and the public must be protected from them. 
<P>
Taking into account charges and convictions faced by people in other jurisdictions is important and we shall return to the theme later. I acknowledge the Minister's offer to write to me and, to make progress, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment. 
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 519, in page 21, line 34, at end insert-- 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(6A) If it appears to the court that the detained person has been the victim of torture the court may require a report to be prepared concerning that detained person.".
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take amendment No. 641, in page 21, line 34, at end insert-- 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(6A) The court may require a report to be prepared about the physical or mental health of the person detained, and must take account of the conclusions of any such report which is prepared in deciding whether to grant bail".
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> We now come to a very important subject. The amendments deal with detainees who are also the victims of torture. Amendment No. 519 provides that where 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"it appears to the court that the detained person has been the victim of torture the court may require a report to be prepared".
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It does not require a court to do so but gives the court the power to require a report if it thinks fit. A report might well assist the courts and thereby help the detainee. It might tell the court more about the person and his or her family and might also help to point to an alternative other than continued detention. 
<P>
I hope that the Minister can respond favourably to this. I do not want to be partisan as this is an issue that the Government have considered in the past but it is very serious. It is sad for anyone to be held in detention but it is sometimes necessary. It is even more sad for a victim of torture to be held in detention. That too may be necessary in some cases but before we say that it is necessary we should do everything possible to see whether there are alternatives and ways in which it could be avoided. 
<P>
The Government have said that they are interested in the subject. 
<P>
They say in the White Paper that they recognise 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the need to exercise particular care in the consideration of mental and physical health when deciding to detain. Evidence of a history of torture should weigh strongly in favour of temporary admission or release whilst an individual's asylum claim is being considered."
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is fair enough as far as it goes but this needs to be a meaningful commitment. It would be made more meaningful if a report could be prepared. The issues need to be considered and addressed and the court needs to have the relevant information to enable it to do so. 
<P>
The amendment has the support of the Medical Foundation for the Care of Victims of Torture. We became familiar with its evidence earlier in our proceedings. In fact the whole Committee found its evidence interesting, helpful and moving. We heard about some of the experiences that people will have been through before coming to this country, and some of the torture that they may have suffered. I will not go through that again. It is all there in the evidence we received. I found it very moving. 
<P>
The Medical Foundation says: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"This amendment would provide an important safeguard in those circumstances and it would provide an opportunity for the detainee to access an independent clinician who could address both the history of torture and also assess in the light of that history the effects of detention upon the detainee."
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is important because that detention comes on top of whatever the detainee may have suffered as part of the persecution that led him to come to this country. We know that there are distinctions between those who make well-founded claims for asylum and those who do not. Among those with a well-founded claim for asylum will be torture victims. It may be some time before their claims can be determined and they may be held in detention. 
<P>
We should do whatever we can to give courts the power to get information on these people so that they can take a properly informed view and have access to all the relevant information. If there is an alternative the court should be able to take it and the court should get to know everything it can about that detained person in the course of deciding whether to grant him liberty. 
<P>
Obtaining reports is not unfamiliar. The magistrates who will exercise this jurisdiction do it every day of the week in their other criminal jurisdiction. They get reports about people and their family backgrounds and circumstances before they pass sentences on them. In the course of getting those reports they get information about alternatives to custody, community sentences and so forth. Magistrates are used to obtaining reports on people and this will be useful power to enable them to get the full picture. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I support the amendment. This is a critical area. Again we are dealing with guidance to magistrates. These are not the type of circumstances that they would normally have to consider when making a bail application. It should be considered because some of the detailed work on those held in detention carried out by organisations such as Amnesty International has shown that some people have suffered quite considerably. 
<P>
I am sure that the Government would want to defend their detention because it was lawful according to the criteria that they were applying but there are undoubtedly people who have suffered abroad who have been held in detention on arrival in this country. Often their story has only come out at a much later date. Sometimes that is because they do not have the appropriate support and sometimes it is because they are uncomfortable about talking out their stories. When there is clear evidence from clinicians that holding such people in detention 1057 1058 would add to their distress, it is important that magistrates take that into account in making their decisions, so as not to compound the problems that such people have experienced abroad. 
<P>
In the evidence-giving sessions, we heard from the Medical Foundation for the Care of Victims of Torture how difficult it can be to get the necessary resources to the right people so as to get reports prepared. The foundation is the number one organisation for doing such work in the United Kingdom. However, we heard important testimony that it often finds it difficult to make people available at short notice, especially outside London. 
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
I therefore hope that, in principle, the Minister will give a favourable response to allowing magistrates to give clear guidance, either in the Bill or in some other way, as suggested in the amendments. Magistrates should be instructed to watch out for certain things when deciding the bail applications for a particular category of people. 
<P>
I hope that the Minister will also consider the practical means by which that matter may be facilitated. We will consider how and when bail hearings are heard when we come to debate subsequent clauses. Where people are held and what access is given to them will be relevant if we are to enable magistrates to get those reports prepared within the necessary timetables. There may be some conflict between seeking a tight timetable for getting the hearing and making the reports available. 
<P>
I trust that the Minister will consider all such factors, and that, in principle, he will give a favourable response to torture being material consideration when bail hearings are held.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The hon. Members for Hertsmere and for Hallam have expressed concern about the victims of torture and the implications that detention may have for people who are genuine victims of torture. I share that concern and the considerable respect that has been expressed for the work carried out by the Medical Foundation for the Care of Victims of Torture. The foundation is highly respected by the Home Office generally and by the immigration service in particular, which lays particular weight on its reports. 
<P>
I have read a few of the foundation's reports when dealing with certain cases, and have found that they are not always conclusive. A phrase that commonly appears in the reports is that the medical evidence is "not inconsistent with" torture. That does not take us very far. However, on other occasions the foundation is much clearer that torture is likely to have taken place. 
<P>
When torture has taken place and is a relevant consideration for bail conditions, it is right for the magistrate to be aware of that. The Medical Foundation referred to the White Paper in its evidence, mentioning the Government's commitment that the evidence of a history of torture would weigh strongly in favour of temporary admission or temporary release. 
<P>
I confirm that commitment. Such a factor, as well as others, is relevant to the consideration of bail, and I anticipate that it will be fairly and properly applied by magistrates and others. 
<P>
However, I am not convinced that the Medical Foundation is right to push the amendment. That is a result of my experience as a lawyer dealing with people with mental or psychiatric difficulties in magistrates courts. In such cases, the courts can order reports to be made available. 
<P>
I raise that matter because it is relevant to the amendment. Sometimes evidence of a basic nature is put before the court, suggesting that a person has a psychiatric history. Sometimes magistrates ask that a report be prepared on that individual. In cases that I dealt with, that resulted in people who ought not to have been detained being detained for up to a month. As doctors were not available to prepare a report, such detentions were necessary. In some magistrates courts, such as Bow street, that led to doctors being available during the day to give an opinion on remand cases. Doctors can provide a quick assessment of psychiatric issues and advise magistrates on whether they need to take them into account in deciding bail applications. 
<P>
Where there is some evidence of torture, which might normally lead a magistrate to grant bail, he might under the amendment take the view that the court's best step would be to require a report and, while it was being prepared, the victim could continue to be detained. The hon. Member for Hallam pointed out earlier that experience of dealing with torture victims is not widespread and, as I said to the hon. Member for Hertsmere in the Chamber yesterday, we need to build capacity for dealing with victims of torture. At this stage we do not have the medical capacity to provide expert reports at short notice on complex and difficult issues. 
<P>
One of my concerns about the Medical Foundation is that its experience tends to be London-based, when there are victims of torture outside London today who do not have access to its expertise. The organisation has only limited capacity so even some people living in London do not gain access to its expertise. The Medical Foundation does not accept Home Office money. In future, the organisation may consider funding from the Department of Health and we are prepared to look into that, but it also has concerns about whether it is the appropriate organisation to be required, under the amendment, to prepare the report. 
<P>
The clauses do not specify who should prepare the report or how it should be funded. Should magistrates be able to require a report from a particular organisation or person? Those are technical issues which could he dealt with by an amendment on Report. However, I fear that though the Medical Foundation assumes that victims of torture could be helped, the way in which the courts work in practice could produce the opposite effect. 
<P>
A victim of torture could be brought before the court and prima facie evidence of torture could be put to the magistracy by the lawyer of the applicant for bail. At that stage the magistrate might be disposed to accept it and grant bail because no countervailing opinion was put by 1059 1060 the immigration service. However, the magistrate could, under the amendment, decide to require a report and remand the individual back into detention--to be produced perhaps some weeks later on another routine bail hearing. If the capacity to provide the report is not there, it could take weeks and the torture victim who might otherwise have been released could end up being detained. 
<P>
I am not convinced of the case for accepting the amendments, but I agree with the hon. Member for Hallam that it is an important issue. No one--neither he nor I--wants to detain genuine victims of torture. At the same time, however, we do not want to create a situation in which persons who are not victims of torture claim to be, which can happen. 
<P>
I will agree to meet with the foundation to discuss the issues and, perhaps, the practicalities of how the amendment might operate in practice. I am not convinced by it at the moment. I will write to the hon. Members for Hallam and for Hertsmere about how the discussions go. I will circulate copies of the letter to other members of the Committee because I think that they consider the matter important. I should, however, tell both hon. Members that I am not leaning towards accepting the amendment, but in the opposite direction--towards not accepting it. The Medical Foundation has not fully thought out the practicalities of what the amendment might deliver. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I am not as happy as I hoped to be. I hoped that the Minister would come at the issue with a slightly more open mind. He has made a mistake by considering it in terms of someone who comes from a magistrates court on a criminal charge. He seems to be remembering his experiences with people with psychiatric difficulties. 
<P>
We are not saying that those involved have necessarily committed an offence--that would result in someone with psychiatric problems coming before a magistrates court. The Minister should know that magistrates almost invariably obtain medical reports in such cases. Indeed, there is probably authority to the effect that they must obtain psychiatric or medical reports when they deal with someone who is ill. They must do so to find the right sentence for that person. 
<P>
We are talking about a different question altogether. We are talking not about sentences being passed on people, but about whether people can have their liberty after they have been held in immigration detention, There may be reasons why they should not have their liberty. We need, however, to think carefully about whether there is any way in which torture victims in particular can be given the chance of having their liberty on the basis of proper information about them and about alternatives to continuing to hold them in detention. 
<P>
The Minister said that the amendment might tempt magistrates into holding torture victims in custody when they might otherwise have released them. If that really is a concern, it could be cured by suggesting a different form for the amendment. I do not want to make things up as I go along, but such an amendment might say that a magistrate who was thinking of continuing to hold a person in detention--notwithstanding everything that he had heard--could obtain a report on the person as a fail safe or longstop. In that way, the magistrate could find out whether there was another way of dealing with that person, even if he had already decided on the basis of what he had heard up to that point that the person had to be held in detention. That would get round the problem that the Minister outlined. 
<P>
I hope that the Minister will think about that and go into his discussions with the Medical Foundation with more of an open mind than he has now. Magistrates will not have sufficient information about a victim of torture and will need more than the Government currently provide for. 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Getting the information is important. Obviously, a person who could obtain a report could simply put it before the court and it would be considered. Does not the hon. Gentleman agree, however, that one of the key issues on the amendment is whether a report of the right quality could be provided quickly? I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman is satisfied that that question can be answered. I am not satisfied at this point that the Medical Foundation or others could provide a report of sufficient quality quickly. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I am curious about the Minister's logic. Neither he nor I know the answer to that question. Such a report could, perhaps be prepared if everyone put their heads together. Reports can certainly be prepared quickly in courts. The Minister's point is more of a technical reason for not accepting the amendment. If it is possible to prepare a report and if the magistrates might otherwise think of keeping the person in detention, the Minister gave no insurmountable reason why a report should not be prepared. 
<P>
I am disappointed. We are talking about people being held in detention, which may aggravate the suffering that they have already gone through. I will briefly remind the Committee of what the Medical Foundation said 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Further detention puts torture survivors in circumstances of relative isolation, often exacerbated by their lack of English, thereby increasing the likelihood of their reliving and fixating upon past horrors, with few, if any, means of relief, increased anxiety and distress, and the possibility of self-harm and suicide."
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Those are serious considerations and we have to do the best that we can to avoid such an outcome. Asylum seekers may have to be held in detention, but they should not be until all other possibilities have been investigated. 
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
I did not argue the point controversially in my opening remarks, because I wanted the Minister to meet me halfway. I am not sure, however, that he is dealing with my argument in entirely the right frame of mind--he seems predisposed against it. I did not express any intention to press the amendment to a vote and I shall not do so. However, I am disappointed that the Minister has not come a little further towards my point of view and that he seems to be finding so many obstructive technical difficulties. 
<P>
I implore the Minister to go into his discussions with the Medical Foundation with a more open mind. I am grateful for his offer to write to me, but I shall expect his letter to contain a detailed exposition of his approach and better reasons for it than he has given so far. I may return to return to the matter on Report, as I regard it to be serious and important for torture victims and in principle. 
<P>
People come to this country with asylum claims that may or may not be well founded--many of them are not, but some are. Some of those people will have had terrible experiences in Kosovo or elsewhere and we should not make things any worse for them than they already are if we can possibly avoid doing so. The Government should do a little bit more than we have heard about so far, so I may return to the matter on Report. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment. 
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to consider the following amendments: No. 525, in page 22, line 5, leave out 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"as soon as is reasonably practicable"
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and insert "forthwith". 
<P>

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"as soon as is reasonably practicable"
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and insert "forthwith". 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The amendment was suggested by the Immigration Advisory Service. It would allow courts to take into account when determining applications failures to make bail references within the time limits. The other amendments were tabled by another hon. Member. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> Amendments Nos. 524 and 525 get to the heart of the relationship between the various time limits set out in the clause, to which the Committee may return in the wider clause stand part debate. The amendments propose a different wording to deal with what happens when time limits set out in subsections considered earlier are not met. We are trying to save words and to replace six with a single word, as we feel that "forthwith" has more power than 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> "as soon as is reasonably practicable",
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
which we believe to be a bit of a cop-out. 
<P>
Subsection (9) is something of a get-out-of-jail-free card for the Secretary of State to use when he or the system has failed to meet the clear statutory targets set out in subsections (4) and (5), which were debated earlier. It applies when subsections (4) and (5) have failed. To some extent that weakens their impact, because the Government are setting themselves up for failure or at least assuming that it will occur, and they have provided merely the weak phrase, 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"as soon as is reasonably practicable"
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
for when it does occur. 
<P>
That wording allows very little to happen when a detained person is liable for a bail hearing under the new and welcome provision but it does not occur within the eight-day limit set by the Home Secretary. The matter may be referred to the Secretary of State, who will take action, although it may be fairly weak. To have safeguards so watered down when dealing with deprivation of liberty is not helpful. We are trying to assist the Government by reducing the wordage of the Bill and suggesting a stronger wording than that which currently exists. 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I should like to make it clear to members of the Committee that we intend to reserve the timetable for referral that is set out in the Bill. However, we recognise that mistakes may occur. The purpose of subsection (9) is to allow such mistakes to be retrieved and corrected. The failure to notify the court that a routine bail hearing is required for a particular detainee has no bearing whatever on a person's suitability for bail. The delay would make him neither a better nor a worse candidate for bail. Indeed, some people might have sought, for all sorts of reasons, to create the circumstances in which a delay occurs. 
<P>
Amendment No. 241 would introduce extraneous and irrelevant issues into the consideration of bail. It would be an unnecessary complication. If the intention is to ensure that greater efforts are made to refer cases within the required period, the amendment would have no such effect. I have already assured the Committee that we intend to observe the requirements. I cannot do any more than that, and I do not, therefore, accept that the amendment is necessary or desirable. In an ideal world, subsections (9) and (10) would not be necessary, and I shall not be disappointed if those powers are never used. However, I have to be realistic and recognise that mistakes can occur--not necessarily because of somebody's deliberate action but because somebody has, for what they may regard as proper reasons, failed to do something that they ought to have done. The subsections are the safety net that will enable any failures to be put right. 
<P>
It is right that corrective action should be taken without delay, and the wording of the subsections requires the remedial action to be taken 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"as soon as is reasonably practicable."
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
 Amendments Nos. 525 and 524 would require action to be taken "forthwith", which I take to mean immediately. However, it may not be practicable to do that--for example, the discovery may be made in the middle of the night. The hon. Member for Sheffield, Haliam nods with enthusiasm at the prospect. While I have every sympathy with the amendments' objectives, we must recognise that the immediate correction of mistakes is not always possible. For example, it will not be possible for the court to deal with bail hearings in the absence of the detainee and his representative. They will have to be notified as to when and where the hearing is to take place. How could a court comply with the requirement if a referral was made out-of-hours or when there was no one present with the power to conduct the hearing? 
<P>

<P>
The requirement that mistakes should be corrected as soon as is reasonably practicable recognises the practicalities of everyday life and does not impose unrealistic limitations on the court system. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept those realities and withdraw the amendment. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I have listened to the Minister. Although I am not sure that I agree with everything that he said, in order that we may make progress I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment. 
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 480, in page 22, line 10, leave out "this Act, the court" and insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the Immigration Acts, the court or other appellate authority".
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> with this it will be convenient to discuss Government amendment No. 481. 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> It is intended that, where a detainee has an appeal outstanding, the court that is dealing with the appeal will conduct any routine bail hearings. As originally drafted, subsection (11) (a) relates only to appeals that are brought under the Bill. However, it is anticipated that certain rights of appeal under existing immigration legislation will remain after the Bill is enacted. Amendment No. 480 clarifies that subsection (11)(a) relates to appeals that are brought against any of the immigration Acts, including the Bill when it is enacted. Amendment No. 481 clarifies that the definition of the term "Commission" in subsection (12) and relates to the whole of part III of the Bill. 
<P>
Amendment agreed to. 
<P>
Amendment made: No 481, in page 22, line 18, at beginning insert "In this Part".--[Mr. O'Brien.] 
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill. 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> We remain satisfied that the power to challenge the legality of detention should continue to be by way of a writ of habeus corpus, or judicial review. However, the proposal for the provision of up to two routine bail hearings will introduce a greater judicial element into the detention process. It will ensure that the way in which immigration officers exercise their powers of detention is applied consistently. 
<P>
Routine bail hearings will be conducted either by magistrates or the relevant appellate authorities. The special immigration appeals commission will conduct all hearings in national security cases falling within the Special Immigration Appeals Commission Act 1997. The independent appellate authority will conduct all routine bail hearings in Scotland, and those in England, Wales and Northern Ireland in which the person has an appeal outstanding under the Bill or other immigration legislation. All other hearings will be conducted by magistrates courts. 
<P>
Clearly, adjudicators and the special immigration appeals commission are already familiar with the issues surrounding bail and immigration cases. Magistrates will be trained in those issues prior to this part of the Bill being implemented. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> We have had useful debates on various aspects of clause 29. The clause is welcome in principle, as many of us have been calling for routine bail hearings for some time. The debate on the clause has shown that more detail was needed regarding what those bail hearings mean and the criteria that would be applied. 
<P>
The debate on clause 29(6) was particularly useful. I am pleased that the Minister gave such a helpful response in indicating that he wants to go further in considering the criteria that magistrates will use. 
<P>
We still have a concern regarding the general provisions of clause 29. Can someone be released without surety if the magistrates have tested the validity of the original decision to detain? That is an area that we wish to see further explored. There should be a clear two-stage process, the first stage of which is the testing of the decision to detain. We hope to return later to the statutory basis for setting out criteria for detention. If someone's detention is found to be invalid or inappropriate after the original validity has been tested, they should be released without any surety or the normal requirements of bail, because they should not have been detained in the first place. The second stage of the test--subsection (6) is rather vague here--should be whether it is safe to release people even though they have been validly or appropriately detained. 
<P>
Both stages of the test need to be applied--it would not be appropriate to have a single test, whereby the court deems everyone who has been detained to have been validly detained. That will not test the second aspect; the court will simply consider whether the person can be safely released with some kind of recognisance or surety. 
<P>
The other important element concerns time limits. When the Minister spoke in response to an earlier amendment, I was rather moved by the idea of the Secretary of State opening his Red Box in the small hours, finding a report that someone had not had their bail hearing in time and having to get on the phone to organise a court hearing. Not only would that provide a strong incentive for hearings to be held in time, it would be an appropriate punishment for failure to keep to the time limits set out in clause 29. However, I recognise that there are issues of practicality involved. 
<P>
I hope that the Minister will be able to offer a further commitment that reports on routine bail hearings will be provided, with particular reference to whether the time limits have been met. I know that we can grill the Minister via parliamentary questions. However, as this aspect of immigration law deals with depriving people of their liberty, and the Minister has given a categorical commitment to try to meet the clear time limits that have been set, it would be helpful to have a more formal mechanism with which to demonstrate to the wider public whether those time limits were being met. That would be more helpful than relying on Opposition Members tabling parliamentary questions to try and keep an eye on whether the provisions of clause 29 are being effectively implemented as and when the Bill becomes law. 
<P>
I hope that the Minister will give some consideration as to how he will let parliamentarians and interested outside bodies know whether the provision is working. I hope that clause 29 will be helpfully clarified and that it will become a useful tool in the armoury of those seeking to defend civil liberties of those in this country who, for whatever reason, are deprived of such liberties.

<P>

<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> I can reassure the hon. Member for Hallam on some of the issues that he raised. It will be possible for someone to be released without a surety. It is intended that there will be a two-stage process, but not quite of the sort described by him or of the sort that some lawyers, I fear, have called for in their representations. 
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
At the first stage of the routine bail hearing, magistrates consider whether a person should continue to be detained. If, having heard any information put forward, their conclusion is that the person should not continue to be detained, that person is released without a surety and without conditions, other than compliance with the normal requirements of temporary release. 
<P>
At the second stage of the process, if the magistrates decide that a person should be detained, they will proceed to ask whether there are conditions beyond those of temporary release on which they might release the person, such as having to report to an immigration officer, issues of security, a surety and reporting daily to a police station. 
<P>
At the end of the consideration of appropriate conditions, magistrates might conclude that a person should not have conditional bail because conditions would be insufficient. They would then decide to continue to detain that person--that is the process. We do not envisage that the validity of the initial decision would be questioned by a magistrates court. Magistrates courts are not in an appropriate position to question the validity of such a decision, any more than they are in a position to question the judgment of a custody officer in the case of a criminal remand. 
<P>
I take the point of the hon. Member for Hertsmere that we must not confuse the two processes. In criminal remand processes, magistrates courts do not determine whether the custody officer made the right decision; they decide whether a person ought to continue to be detained. That is a slightly different question. I have spoken to lawyers who now understand that there is a distinction. We are saying to the courts that they are to examine the facts and decide whether they believe that people should continue to be detained. If they should not continue to be detained, they should be released. 
<P>
If someone wished to challenge the validity of the initial decision by an immigration officer, the appropriate way of doing that would be by judicial review. That process examines whether the administrative procedures and the way in which a decision was taken were appropriate. It will still be open to individuals, although we are not anxious to encourage judicial reviews. We are conscious that that process is different from considering whether bail should be granted. 
<P>
The hon. Member for Hallam also asked whether the time limits could be raised. He noted that parliamentary questions might not always be the most efficient way of getting things done, and asked whether I would consider a report. I am not prepared to agree to getting officials to draft and publish a report at this stage. 
<P>
The Immigration Law Practitioners Association, the immigration appeals advisory service and the Refugee Legal Centre are vocal and efficient organisations that are capable of bringing to the attention of certain hon. Members that the Government are not complying with what they promised or with commitments in legislation. I dare say that these organisations' lawyers would be quick to bring matters to the attention of the courts if the Government failed to comply with the law. The hon. Member for Hallam is not relying only on parliamentary questions: he can receive a vocal response from those able organisations. 
<P>
I turn to an issue that we discussed when we debated the amendments: how the clause relates to torture victims. The hon. Member for Hertsmere responded a little more churlishly than I expected to my comments. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Will the Minister give way on that point? 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Let the hon. Gentleman just hear what I have to say, and then I shall give way. 
<P>
I take the issue seriously; it is enormously important that we ensure that victims of torture are protected. I am happy to meet the Medical Foundation, and will do so as soon as possible to discuss the issues. I give serious consideration to the points that it raises. I do not have a closed mind on the issues, but there are some practical difficulties, which I have described. 
<P>
The Medical Foundation may well be able to give me some reassurances that it can provide reports quickly and satisfactorily, and I shall certainly give due weight to any representations that it makes to me in that regard. Perhaps it will be prepared to reconsider its view that it will not accept Home Office funding for such work. When I last spoke to the foundation, it was not prepared to accept money being channelled to it from the Home Office for such work, and that presents a problem for the operation of the provision. 
<P>
I will write to the hon. Member for Hertsmere about the issue. I do not think that anything practical differentiates us; I just think that the provision may not work as it is intended. I shall seek to persuade the Medical Foundation that if the court receives medical reports, they will obviously be considered as a relevant matter. Of course reports from the Medical Foundation would be considered by the court. The issue is whether the court's decision on bail should be delayed in order to receive a medical report--whether the magistrate should delay the decision. 
<P>
If the court were to refuse to grant bail, it would always be open to the person to get a medical report and either use the second routine bail hearing or make an application in the intervening period, using the issue of a report as a change of circumstances. So there are means of raising a medical report. As I have said, I am not unsympathetic to the point, but the technicalities need to be addressed by the Medical Foundation. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I hope that I was not being churlish. If there was a note of disappointment in my response to the Minister, it was because I deliberately opened the debate in a manner that enabled him to come some way towards me, but he said that he was predisposed against the Medical Foundation's point of view. If he is now saying that he is no longer predisposed in that way--if he is rowing back from that position--I will warmly welcome the fact that he will enter discussions with an open mind. 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The hon. Gentleman is trying to read things into what I said that I did not intend. I have said that I am concerned because of my practical experience of the operation of such reporting clauses in mental cases. I have been disturbed when people whom I believed ought not to be detained because of their psychiatric problems have been detained in order to get a medical report. I remember some cases in which people were detained for very long periods, yet reports were not forthcoming. I would be reluctant to see that happen in the case of torture victims. If I were satisfied that our court system could always operate at an optimum level and that our doctors were always able to provide reports quickly and on the day that they were required, I would be more easily convinced. However, my mind is not closed. If the Medical Foundation can show that it is a good thing, we will certainly consider its argument. 
<P>
I suspect, however, that that organisation has taken the doctor's angle rather than the lawyer's angle. From a lawyer's point of view, these matters do not always work as efficiently as doctors might hope--doctors do not always work as efficiently as their patients might hope. The practicalities worry me, but I shall listen carefully to what the Medical Foundation has to say on that and give due weight and proper consideration to any evidence and reassurances that it can provide. I cannot take it further than that. 
<P>
Question put and agreed to. 
<P>
Clause 29, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill. 
<H4><center>Clause 30 </center></H4>
<H4><center>Location of bail hearings </center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 482, in page 22, line 25, after "case" insert "or class of case". 
<P>
This is a drafting amendment which clarifies that the Secretary of State does not need to make a direction on the location of bail hearings in every case. Instead, he can direct that a particular type of case shall be heard in a specified place. For example, a direction might, as a result of this amendment, allow that all routine bail hearings for those detained at Tinsley House in detention centre should be held in a specific room. That will be of particular benefit in the administrative process.  
<P>
Amendment agreed to. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> We do not intend to move amendments Nos. 243 and 258, which are in the next group of amendments. 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 483, in page 22, line 33, at end insert-- 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"( ) A direction under subsection (1) has effect notwithstanding any other direction which may be given as to the place in which the court is to sit.".

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Member for Hertsmere for not moving the Opposition amendments. 
<P>
Amendment No. 483 is a drafting amendment which is designed to clarify that a direction given by the Secretary of State under clause 30 takes precedence over any other direction which may be given regarding places where the relevant court may sit. Thus, in relation to adjudicators, a direction could,in theory be made to the effect that bail hearings should be held in a detention centre, even though appeals cannot be heard there. 
<P>
Amendment No. 484 is also a drafting amendment and makes it clear that the Secretary of State requires the approval of the Lord Chancellor before issuing a direction under clause 30.

<P>

<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I am uncomfortable with this clause as a whole. I began by considering ways in which to amend it, such as removing detention centres and prisons as possible places to hold hearings, but I realised that the appropriate solution was not to have the clause at all and to leave the courts and other tribunals to make judgments on bail in the places where they currently operate. We feel that a hearing of such importance-particularly when someone's liberty is involved--should take place within the normal judicial framework. 
<P>
There is concern about the effectiveness of the bail hearings that are instituted in clause 29 and whose location is covered in clause 30. At one end of the spectrum, people say that they will be judicial rubber-stamping exercises for detentions; at the other end, people have far more faith in the Minister and believe that they will be a genuine step forward in civil liberties terms. I would probably place myself somewhere in the middle of the spectrum, as I am cynical about some aspects and more optimistic about others. 
<P>
The location of bail hearings is a crucial element. The idea that all those in Tinsley house or Campsfield could simply be wheeled out of their living accommodation and into a room within the premises so that a fairly perfunctory hearing could take place before they were sent back to their living accommodation is a cause of concern for those who are directly involved in these issues and for their legal advisers, such as the Immigration Law Practitioners--
