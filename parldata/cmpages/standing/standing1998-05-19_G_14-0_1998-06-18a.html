<B>The Minister for Competition and Consumer  Affairs </B>(Mr. Nigel Griffiths): On a point of order, Mrs. Roe. During this morning's debate, I said that I expected the best possible use to be made of  accommodation and resources by the Monopolies and  Mergers Commission and the Office of Fair Trading. I thought that it would be helpful to members of the  Committee to know that the leases expire on both Field  house and Chancery house in March 2000 in respect of the  Office of Fair Trading. The director general has decided to  co-locate the central London staff of the OFT in one  building, which is currently vacant and being refurbished.  It is expected that the move will take place in the autumn  of 1999. I do not want the Committee to be under  another impression. 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am sure that the Committee is most  grateful for that clarification.

<P>
</UL></FONT><B> Mr. Lansley:</B> I am grateful for the opportunity to speak  to this long list of amendments. I shall take the Committee  through each of them and explain what they would  achieve. As we discuss them, it will become obvious that  the amendments would be mutually exclusive in that if  amendment No. 183 were accepted, it would not follow  that I could move on logically to the other amendments.  However, if amendment No. 183 were not pressed to a  Division, it would be possible to move on to some of the  other amendments. 
<P>
Clause 54 introduces concurrent powers of sector  regulators. Amendment No. 183 is the radical amendment;  it is designed to remove those powers and to introduce a  debate on the appropriateness or otherwise of providing  concurrent powers to regulators. Amendments Nos. 210  and 211 should be considered together. They require the  Director of Fair Trading and the sector regulators to be  obliged to work together in pursuing the application of  the Bill's powers to the sector for which any given  regulator is responsible. 
<P>
Amendment No. 211 has two parts, the first of which  sets out that a regulator, in exercising concurrent powers  provided under the clause, would, under proposed  subsection (4), have an obligation to work not only with  the Director of Fair Trading, but with 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"any other regulator who may have jurisdiction in relation to that  matter" .<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
The director general, together with the regulator with  primary jurisdiction and any other regulator with  jurisdiction, will have an obligation under the Bill to  determine the manner in which they are to exercise their  functions. 
<P>
The second limb of amendment No. 211 concerns  circumstances in which a regulator leaving aside the  concurrent jurisdiction of the director general, but  considering the sector regulators themselves does not  have exclusive jurisdiction in relation to a certain matter,  or when that jurisdiction exercised by the regulator would  affect competition outside the scope of the jurisdiction  of that regulator. The regulator would then have to bring  together the director general and any other regulator who  was affected to any extent to make joint decisions  decisions for convenience being defined in this context by  clause 47, which, helpfully, we discussed earlier. Of  course, that would include the two main prohibitions,  enforcement penalties and so on. The purpose of that  amendment is to require joint working between the two  concurrent jurisdictions. 
<P>
There is a direct relationship between amendment No. 211 and amendments Nos. 212 to 216, which, it will  be observed, have essentially the same form, but apply to  schedule 10, which includes the detailed application of  the concurrent jurisdiction for sector regulators. For each  of the sector regulators governed by separate sectoral  statutes, the amendments provide for the regulator to  exercise functions in consultation with the director  general. 
<P>
Before I move on to a further set of amendments, it  may be helpful to explain why amendments Nos. 212 to  216 are desirable. At present, the sector statutes governing  the several regulators for whom concurrent jurisdiction is  proposed impose an artificial constraint on joint working  by the regulators with the director general. He and the  regulators may be required to consult informally as was  made clear in the other place. Lord Simon of Highbury,  the Government spokesman, talked about that and I shall  refer to it in a moment. 
<P>
What is unclear in the Bill is the extent to which the  two parties are able to determine the manner in which  they are to exercise their functions without constraint.  Under the current sector statutes, there appears to be a  number of obstacles to that. The obstacle to their working  as a team, rather than one or other of them exercising a primary jurisdiction, is what is known as the  first-past-the-post system. In effect, the first regulator to  act takes over the jurisdiction and cannot then share it  with, or pass it to, another regulator, or to the director  general. They are specifically unable to make decisions  together. 
<P>
Even given the fact that I am new to Committee  proceedings, it is still a novelty to be able to refer  specifically to proceedings in another place. As we are  now able to do so, it may be helpful to note that on three  occasions Lord Simon mentioned the desirability of  introducing an additional amendment to allow regulators  exercising concurrent jurisdiction to work together with  the director general.

<P>

<B>Mr. Peter Brooke (Cities of London and  Westminster):</B> I may well be anticipating what my hon.  Friend is about to say, but it is worth remarking that the  noble Lord Simon's observations were spread over a  four-month period. There was a substantial interval  between each occasion, which gave more than adequate  time for reflection. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I am grateful to my right hon. Friend;  that is exactly the point. I think that the first instance was  in February  
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> It was on 17 November. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> My right hon. Friend helps me. On that  occasion, Lord Simon, referring to the desirability of the  Bill enabling the regulator and the director general to  work together, said: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"It might well provide useful flexibility if it did."  [Official  Report, House of Lords, 17 November 1997; Vol. 583, c. 415.] <P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
At that early stage, Lord Simon was saying that such  flexibility would be useful. 
<P>
On Report on 23 February, Lord Simon referred to 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"a commitment I made during Committee on the issue of sensible  men talking to sensible men talking to sensible men"   <P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
I am sure that he was referring to sensible men and  sensible women  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"and finding a sensible way to work together... We have therefore  been considering the particular provisions...that require the regulator  and the director general to consult before either takes action; and  for one to be barred from taking action once the other has done so.  These seem to raise concerns about preventing the director general  and regulator from working together" . [Official Report, House of  Lords, 23 February 1998; Vol. 586, c. 462-463.] <P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
The Government understood then that there were  obstacles to the effective joint working that should take  place between the director general and the regulators.  Lord Simon promised to reflect seriously on the issue. 
<P>
On Third Reading, Lord Simon said: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"I accepted that there was a need to reflect further on the  provision in utility statutes that requires a regulator and the DGFT  to consult before either takes action... We shall continue to reflect  on that point."  [Official Report, House of Lords, 5 March 1998;  Vol. 586, c. 1355.] <P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
As my right hon. Friend said, the Government have had  about four months to consider that matter. It is now June  and the Government have not tabled amendments to  remove the obstacles that exist to joint working between  the two arms proposed in clause 54; therefore, their  operation might be constrained. 
<P>
The draft guidance issued by the Office of Fair Trading  shows how the difficulty might arise. It states that, where  a complaint 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"relates to issues falling within the concurrent jurisdiction of a  sectoral regulator, the complaint will usually be dealt with by that  regulator rather than the Office of Fair Trading."  <P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
In that sense, the director general has made it clear that  he is speaking of jurisdiction that precludes the activity  of the other regulators. They will be unable to work  together freely in their scrutiny of an issue clearly, if  one has acted, the other cannot do so. 
<P>
As a national competition authority, the Director  General of Fair Trading has a central role in the  development of competition law. The purpose of these  amendments is to put that role into prime position by  enabling the DGFT to work with sector regulators, rather  than surrendering jurisdiction. Whatever the respective  jurisdictions might be, the DGFT has a wider interest to  serve than those of the sectoral regulators. 
<P>
Amendment No. 217 is designed for a separate purpose.  The regulators are given powers under two sets of  statutory provisions the sector statutes and competition  legislation. To what extent will current legislation enable  the regulators to bypass the Bill and use information from  investigations that might have commenced under the  provisions of the Competition Act 1980? To what extent  will they be able to use powers under sector statutes to  secure remedies or action by the companies under their  jurisdiction? It is important to determine whether the  sector regulators, which have much wider responsibilities  than those in the Bill, can mesh their responsibilities under  different statutes so that they can use Competition Act  powers in the first instance and pursue long-term  objectives related to their regulatory rather than  competition functions. 
<P>
The purpose of amendment No. 217 is to make it clear  that, in so far as the regulators have concurrent  jurisdiction and can use Competition Act powers, they  should do so in relation to investigations that arise under  competition legislation. If they receive a complaint, or are  acting in relation to an infringement under either of the  prohibitions, in so far as they are doing so on Competition  Act grounds they should use Competition Act powers  rather than powers from two sets of statutes. 
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
Amendment No. 184 has a slightly different purpose  it probes the Government's view on the circumstances in which the regulator, which has a range of functions in  relation to an industry, no longer exercises a function in  relation to price control or price setting. That subject is  used as a proxy, to probe the Government's intentions and  to discover the point at which the regulator no longer has  a market-determining role in relation to the utility that  it regulates. 
<P>
After 2001, if the Director General of  Telecommunications is no longer setting a price control  limit, he may no longer be the regulator of market prices  and may therefore no longer be the right person to  exercise a regulatory and Competition Act role in  determining the character of the marketplace. He will  have a range of other responsibilities, but will no longer  be involved in pricing matters, so he may focus on such  matters as universal service obligations, the introduction  of innovation into the industry, the diversification of the  industry, the promotion of overseas investment into UK  telecommunications, the convergence of technologies and  the supply of telecommunications services to pensioners,  the disabled and so on. He may concentrate on consumer  benefits in a general sense, but not necessarily on a market  perception of how the industry should operate or directly  on prices and market share. If the Director General of  Telecommunications proposes working like that in 2001,  it will change more than subtly the status of that regulator  in trying to apply Competition Act powers as well. It does  not necessarily follow that the need for concurrency is  derived from the special status and special knowledge of  the market that the sector regulators bring to bear. 
<P>
Amendment No. 19 would prevent double jeopardy. It  is a straightforward proposal, which dovetails well with  some of the other amendments. It would ensure that an  undertaking is not investigated twice by different  regulators. If amendments Nos. 210 and 211 were  accepted, we could be reasonably sure that that would not  occur. In the absence of those two amendments, however,  it would be desirable to constrain the risk of double  jeopardy and of conflicting jurisdictions, as suggested in  amendment No. 19. 
<P>
I hope that the Committee will forgive me for the length  of my explanation, but it is a large group of amendments,  all of which have different perspectives. It begs the  question of the two principal issues raised by the clause,  and how the amendments would bite upon them. Is it  appropriate for such powers to be given to sector  regulators? If regulators are given such powers, how are  they to be applied consistently and fairly? 
<P>
The qualifications and concerns that the Opposition  express do not arise from hostility to the work of the  utility regulators. That would be perverse, as the statutes  under which the utility regulators work derive from  legislation made under a Conservative Administration,  and many of those regulators have succeeded in doing  precisely what the Conservative Administration wanted. I was at the Department of Trade and Industry in an  official capacity rather than a political one when the  Telecommunications Act 1984 came into force. The  telecommunications industry, as much as any other, shows  how the original intentions of securing competition and  consumer benefits in the marketplace were derived from  the 1984 legislation. 
<P>
The telecommunications industry is also an example of  why it may not be appropriate for regulators to have such  powers. The scope of the responsibilities of regulators  such as I described goes much wider than simply the  promotion of competition. In the early years, competition  certainly was at the heart of delivering consumer benefits  in telecommunications. However, a point will come it is  fast approaching when the regulator does not act,  through regulation, as the proxy for competition in  diminishing the market power and market share of the  dominant player in the market, but that is supplied  through the achievement of competition. 
<P>
To an extent that we have not yet seen from the  Government, several regulators are beginning to look  beyond the promotion of competition to a wider range  of public interests that they are trying to secure through  regulatory activity. For example, the water regulator  considers the environment, supply, viability of industries  and investment programmes and compliance with  legislation. Similarly, the gas regulator has interesting, but  sometimes conflicting, regulatory objectives. 
<P>
We might reasonably deduce that those objectives are  in a sense complementary, as they all provide benefit to  the public and are construed as part of the public interest.  In some circumstances for example, when setting prices  for dominant suppliers in the marketplace, such as  regulated utilities we may even deduce that the  consumer benefit is a direct result of the regulator's  activity. Nevertheless, there is an inherent tension among  regulators, which often compete not so much within their  own sector, but against other regulators to try to deliver  the maximum consumer benefit as fast as they can. They  may not necessarily look to the development of  competition in the long term. They may sometimes look  to the delivery of specific benefits in the short term to  justify their position as regulators under the statutes that  originally established them, and may compete one against  another. We therefore need to be careful and consider how  appropriate it is for regulators to use those two sets of  powers. The heart of amendment No. 184 is that the more  that regulators move towards achieving success and  establishing a competitive marketplace for their industry,  the more important it is that we move the industry towards  a conventional Competition Act regime. 
<P>
Even before the Government's present Bill was  presented, it was clear that one of the objectives for the  telecommunications industry was to move its pricing and  market from a separately regulated structure into the same  structure as any other industry. It should be a policy  objective not to have concurrent jurisdictions and separate  regulation for the utilities, but to have a competitive  marketplace for utilities in which they are subject to the  Competition Act regime administered by the Director  General of Fair Trading, in the same way as motor  vehicle, engineering and other industries are. The first  question is, is it, in that sense, appropriate and desirable?  In so far as it is provided, is it desirable in achieving the  Bill's objectives? 
<P>
It would be reasonable to assume that if the director  general were not required to have concurrent jurisdiction  with the sector regulators, he would be perfectly able to  work alongside the sector regulators if we were to  provide for that in the Bill and maintain responsibility  for the consistent implementation of the Bill's provisions.  The desire to achieve consistency with EC jurisdiction  and internal consistency and coherence in the application  of the legislation so as to give certainty to business has  been central to some of our debates. The Under-Secretary  must explain why the Government are seeking to move  directly away from that consistency, exposing themselves  to the considerable risk of that happening. 
<P>
The seven sector regulators, as well as the director  general, will each have concurrent jurisdictions,  sometimes operating separately and with inadequate  means of working together. That raises many problems.  We cannot be sure how those separate jurisdictions will  work. However, we can be sure that, just as we have seen  in other respects, the sector regulators are likely to  compete one with another. That may lead to turf wars,  because the jurisdictions are beginning to abut each other.  There are two reasons for that. 
<P>
The convergence of technologies and industry  structures is caused by the emergence of multi-utilities  companies that operate in two or three sectors, perhaps  more, that are subject to regulation. We know that a  dominant position in one market can give rise to abuse  in another, connected market. For example this example  does not relate to a specific company a company in one  part of the energy sector may have a dominant position  and may seek to use that dominant position to generate a  position in a connected market in a way that constitutes  an abuse.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. John Hayes </B>(South Holland and The Deepings):  My hon. Friend suggests that one possibility. His  argument is strengthened by the fact that that is already  occurring. Digital convergence is already leading to such  challenges, in business and legally. We are already out of  date, unless we take full account of what my hon. Friend  said. It is not a problem only for the future. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> My hon. Friend is right; the example that he gives relates to convergence within  telecommunications and broadcasting what I might call  communications convergence and illustrates my point.  The risk is that the present jurisdiction of a regulator such  as the Director General of Telecommunications may not  necessarily embrace the market that has to be examined  under the Competition Act regime. Other regulators  involved in broadcasting are not specified in the Bill, but  the competing jurisdictions of the Director General of Fair  Trading and the Director General of telecommunications  are likely to be instrumental. 
<P>
When examining a convergent communications and  broadcasting market, it will be difficult to determine  whether the Director General of Telecommunications or  the Director General of Fair Trading should lead. It would  be much simpler if everyone knew in advance that the  Director General of Fair Trading would lead in examining  Competition Act provisions, but that he would draw on the expertise of the Director General of  Telecommunications in relation to that activity. 
<P>
The Library research paper on the subject includes an  article by Thomas Sharpe QC published in The Times on  23 February 1998. In a specific reference to such  problems, he wrote of 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the certainty of inconsistency of treatment between regulators and  difficulties over which regulator should have jurisdiction in any  situation. These problems will get worse as technologies converge to  smudge sectors' borders, or where utilities diversify into unregulated  businesses, or where agreements involve two or more regulated  sectors or where a company is regulated by more than one  regulator" . <P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
There we have a whole range of circumstances, which  leads us to question how consistency will be achieved  among the several sector regulators, working alongside  the director general. 
<P>
The Under-Secretary may say that the tribunal will help  to generate consistency, because all decisions will be  appealable to the tribunal, but I fear that he will delude  himself if he believes that all the necessary precedents  will be established by the tribunal in a short time. It may  be a long time before that jurisprudence settles down,  particularly because EC jurisprudence is moving on at the  same time. The tribunal may not have the decisions before  it within a reasonable time scale to enable it to bring  together what might be the divergent decisions made by  different regulators. 
<P>
We must avoid inconsistency. The first and most  complete way to do that would be to vest jurisdiction  solely in the hands of the director general. Amendment  No. 183 would achieve that. In the absence of that, and  if there is a determination to proceed by joint working,  amendment Nos. 210 and 211 would require and permit  that. They would do so in a way that prevented the  director general of the sector from working on his own in  areas where his jurisdiction was not exclusive and  affected others. 
<P>
<H5>5 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
The further amendments would constrain sector  regulators so that they would not be able to use powers  under the Bill to impact on their regulatory functions or  to use regulatory powers for purposes for which they were  not intended. Overall, the amendments would  considerably improve the Bill and lead to the consistency  between directors general and regulators that would help  to give clarity to industry. 
<P>
I hope that the Minister will be able to respond fully. I also hope that he will tell us what progress the  Government have mad in satisfactorily overcoming some  of the obstacles to joint working between directors general  and the regulators. The problems are of considerable  concern to many in industry, so I hope that he will set out  how the Bill will overcome them more clearly than was  the case in the other place. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I congratulate my hon. Friend the  Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley) on the  spectacular clarity with which he moved the amendments.  Nobody could have failed to follow his arguments. His  clarity was the more admirable, because the amendments  are designed to introduce clarity into the Bill so that  everyone knows where they are. 
<P>
It was once said of Asquith that his well known lucidity  of style was a positive disadvantage when he had nothing  particular to say. I apologise to the hon. Member for  Eastleigh (Mr. Chidgey) for that remark about a former  Liberal leader. The virtue of the contribution made by my  hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire was  that he had something to say. 
<P>
Conservative Members wish to see joint concurrent  work operating well. I acknowledge that one of our  amendments, which was the hook on which we hung the  others, does not appear to achieve that end. None the less,  that is our aim and central to it are consistency, certainly  and workability in the arrangements. 
<P>
The Government paid considerable attention to these  issues during the Bill's passage through another place.  Lord Simon said that it was hoped to introduce rules to  ensure consistency, proper decision making and flexible  working arrangements that were originally thought of as  a non-binding contract. 
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire  cited the cases between 17 November and 5 March, and  Lord Simon's remarks on 17 November referred back to  an earlier debate in the House on 13 November. I cannot  tell whether Brooke's law is at work and whether one of  the headlights that has temporarily paralysed the  Government has a CBI marking. However, on three  occasions, Lord Simon's precise words were that the  Government had not been able to make up their mind and  any progress would be made in this House. Therefore,  there is a sense of returning to the battlements at Elsinore  in the manner to which I referred in an earlier debate. 
<P>
The great Proustian scholar Martin Turnell once  remarked that in the normal course of events two people  are required for a love affair, but in the case of Proust it  is doubtful whether even one is needed. Lord Simon  provided the continuity in the Government's debate on the  subject, but we await what the Minister has to say about  whether developments have taken place. 
<P>
The problem with the amendments was presented  clearly by my hon. Friend. As he rightly said, it is a case  of the first to the punch. Whoever deals first with the  matter whether one of the regulators or the Director  General of Fair Trading deprives the others of vires to  continue. I understand the argument about double  jeopardy and I realise that the Government may adopt it  in their response. However, it pales by comparison to the  need for a sensible working out of the best way to deal  with these matters. It is potentially hazardous for the  regulator to move in first. it may be clearer in the first  instance to the regulator than to the Office of Fair Trading  that a matter needs to be investigated; however, the Office  of Fair Trading and the vires of the Bill could thereby  be excluded. 
<P>
The second problem of relying on the regulators  I stress that I am not arguing against regulator  involvement; I am concerned about the effective working  of competition policy and the powers being afforded in  the Bill is the danger of using different terms of art in  different circumstances in different studies when we are  trying to establish a cohesive body of law. In simplistic  terms, the Bill's purpose is to protect competition,  whereas one of the central purposes of the regulators is to  promote it, which leads to the hazard of the potential  conflict of objectives. 
<P>
We may see the same degree of industry specificity as  was proposed in the new clause moved by Lord McNally  in another place, which related to The Times. We joined  our Liberal Democrat colleagues in rejecting it when it  was debated in this House. 
<P>
The regulators' decisions should be mutually  consistent, but there is a hazard that that will not happen  if the Bill is bypassed and if, in addressing competition  issues, the regulators are allowed to work to their own  powers rather than to the powers in the Bill. Nothing  equating to clause 60 can be found in the central statutes,  which is why I am concerned about inconsistencies. The  Minister may regard it as a compliment from this side of  the Committee that we are seeking to secure the  pre-eminence of the Bill in addressing each question in  the first instance. 
<P>
Let me provide a specific example. The abuse of  dominant power can arise through the capacity to regulate  yet it is patently an offence to the rules of the Bill. The  regulator currently has access to subjective criteria  different from those in clause 60, which runs the risk of  a misunderstanding therefrom. In short, I look forward to  hearing what the Minister has to say and I warmly  commend the manner in which my hon. Friend has set out  the Opposition's position. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Nigel Griffiths:</B> I hope now to set out why I  believe that the principle of concurrency is right. I want  to ensure that the concerns that have rightly been raised  by Opposition Members including double jeopardy,  potential inconsistency of application and the need for  proper co-ordination between the director general and the  regulators have been thought about and catered for. I then want to summarise the Government's position and  explain how it evolved over a long time and emerged as  the right approach. 
<P>
The principle of concurrent functions is right because  it will allow sector regulators to co-ordinate their use of  sector-specific regulation with the exercise of general  competition law functions. it will allow their sector  expertise to be brought to the application of the  prohibitions. 
<P>
The importance of concurrent functions for the future  of sector regulation was set out in the Government Green  Paper, "A Fair Deal for Consumers: Modernising the  Framework for Utility Regulation"  and the principle of  concurrent functions was established by the previous  Administration in utility statutes. I will speak about that  shortly. Their intention to extend concurrent functions to  their proposed Competition Bill was spelt out in the  explanatory document to the draft Bill that was published  in August 1996. Amendment No. 183, which seeks to  remove concurrent powers, is therefore unacceptable. 
<P>
Amendment No. 184 seeks to remove a regulator's  concurrent powers when the last of any price controls in  his or her sector expires. It, too, is unacceptable. It seems  to assume that the central function of sectoral regulation  is the imposition of price caps, so that when the need for  price caps falls away, so too will the case for sector  regulators to be involved in wider economic regulation or  competition issues. That is not the Government's view. 
<P>
The purpose of amendment No. 217 is to ensure that,  where a regulator can use concurrent powers under the  Bill in relation to any matter, he or she must do so, and  not use sector-specific powers such as enforcement of  licence conditions that may cover the same matter. That  approach is wholly unacceptable to the Government. 
<P>
Let me set out the Government's position.  Sector-specific regimes quite properly cover competition  matters and can rightly prescribe a more focused regime  than would be the case with the Bill's prohibition regime  alone. It is therefore right that the regulator should be able  to choose whichever regime he or she considers to be the  more appropriate route for pursuing a matter. 
<P>
The Office of Fair Trading and the regulators have  taken five key steps to ensure consistency of approach.  They have set up a joint working party to develop working  arrangements and to produce draft guidelines for  consultation. They have agreed on a single notification  point at the Office of Fair Trading. They have also agreed  to set up effective mechanisms to share information, for  example on complaints. That will prevent two directors  inadvertently addressing the same matter. They have  agreed to set out these arrangements in a draft  concurrency guideline that is being developed by the  working party. Equally importantly, they have committed  themselves to avoiding double jeopardy. 
<P>
I have some sympathy with the thinking behind  amendment No. 19, the purpose of which is to avoid the  double jeopardy that would result if different regulators  exercised concurrent functions under the Bill. 
<P>
Each utility statute already contains a provision that  states that before either regulator or the Director General  of Fair Trading first exercises concurrent functions in  relation to any matter 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"he shall consult the other Director; and neither Director shall  exercise in relation to any matter functions transferred by any of  these provisions if functions transferred by that provision have been  exercised on that matter by the other Director" .<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
So the utility statutes already go a long way to rule out  the double jeopardy that the amendment seeks to address.

<P>

<B>Mr. John Redwood (Wokingham):</B> rose  
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> I will give way to the hon. Gentleman.  I noticed that he came into the Committee Room at 5.6 pm, thus missing all of the excellent contribution from  his hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire  (Mr. Lansley) and half of the contribution from his right  hon. Friend the Member for Cities of London and  Westminster (Mr. Brooke). 
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> The Under-Secretary is right. I offer  apologies to you, Mrs. Roe, and to the Committee. I had  to respond to the minimum wage statement and field a  couple of interviews co-incidentally on DTI business  before I could attend the Committee this afternoon. I am  delighted to hear the Under-Secretary praise the  contribution of my hon. Friend the Member for South  Cambridgeshire. I am sure that I left the Front Bench in  good order under his guidance. 
<P>
I should like clarification on how long the Government  intend to have concurrent regulators. Is the  Under-Secretary aware that the previous Government had  plans to phase out several of the sector-specific regulators  when they adjudged that there was enough competition in  the market? Under those circumstances, they would have  fallen under general competition law and not under a  sector-specific regulator; the price control would have  gone and any licensing function would have reverted to  the Department. Is that no longer the Government's aim? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> The aim is that the concurrency  functions should remain and should operate for as long as  they are required. That is the purpose of the clause. It is  vital to avoid any duplication that might arise if the  Director General of Fair Trading or the regulators took  action independently under concurrent powers regarding  the same matter. As I said, there are already provisions  under the utility statutes to prevent the director general  and a regulator from taking such action. 
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
The right hon. Member for Wokingham suggested that  concurrent powers might lead to inconsistency. It is right  that the Committee should hear the Government's views  on that matter. I have stressed the importance of  consistency between the director general and the  regulators. In accordance with the governing principles in  clause 60, the director general, the regulators, the tribunal  and the court must avoid inconsistency with EC law on  articles 85 and 86. There is already a systematic body of  law, with which the regulators must ensure they do not  act inconsistently. 
<P>
Consistency in the application of the prohibitions by  regulators is built into the legislation from the outset. It  will be supported by a single set of procedural rules that  will be drawn up by the director general. There will also  be a process through which the director general and  sectoral regulators can work together to develop advice  and information about the application and enforcement of  the prohibitions. The tribunal will also have an important  role because all appeals from the director general's and  regulator's decisions will come before it. 
<P>
The previous Administration considered the matters  that I have outlined and the explanatory document that  accompanied their draft Bill in August 1996 stated: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The DTI remains of the view that the extension of concurrent  powers is the most appropriate way to ensure that companies in  regulated sectors are not faced with two separate competition  regimes, policed by different authorities, both applying to the same  agreements. Sectoral regulators also have the appropriate expertise  and ability to apply the prohibition in their areas. We intend,  therefore, that where regulators already have concurrent powers to  act under the Fair Trading Act and Competition Act, they should  now have concurrent powers to enforce and exempt from the new  prohibition in their areas."  </font></ul>
<P>
The concerns addressed in the amendments have been  fully answered and I urge my hon. Friends to reject them.  I hope that the Opposition see the force of the arguments  against them. 
<P>
</UL></FONT><B> Mr. Lansley:</B> I am grateful to my right hon. Friends  the Members for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Brooke) and for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood) for  their contributions to the debate. I am also grateful to the  Under-Secretary for the general manner of his response,  although there are some difficulties with its content. 
<P>
In another place, Lord Simon was ready to admit that  there were difficulties regarding the manner in which the  director general and the sector regulators were to be  constrained from working together by the regulators own  sector statutes. However, the Under-Secretary has not  been willing to pursue that matter. The Government have  admitted that there is a problem, but the hon. Gentleman  has not told the Committee how they propose to solve it.  It would have been better if he had done so. He came up  with a number of references to working groups, single  notification point, common reference points, joint  guidelines, single set of procedural rules and so on. We  are in a curious position we are about to debate a clause  which creates scope for inconsistency between seven  sector regulators and the director general, and consider the  difficulties that may ensue from the way in which eight  separate bodies follow the Competition Act regime, yet  the Under-Secretary claims that he has been a good boy  for ameliorating the mischief that he is about to cause  through clause 54. That argument does not work. 
<P>
Instead of resting on an argument for achieving  consistency administratively, the Under-Secretary should  explain why it was necessary to establish a different set  of concurrent jurisdictions for other regulators rather than  vesting that jurisdiction in the Director General of Fair  Trading. The Bill could allow the director general to apply  Competition Act powers to regulated sectors by working  with the sector regulators, without vesting jurisdiction in  those regulators. As my right hon. Friend the Member for Cities of London and Westminster said, the  Under-Secretary should not allow provisions to remain in  statute that allow one sector regulator, often the first to  note a potential anti-competitive activity or abuse of a  dominant position, to act and thus remove the vires of the  director general to act. If the director general acts, some  consistency is assured. 
<P>
The Under-Secretary did not respond well to the point  that my right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham  made in an intervention. Amendment No. 184  contemplates a time when telecommunications, like any  other industry, will be ready to take a fully competitive  place in the market. Nobody should look to a time when  motor vehicles are fully competitive under a Competition  Act regime that is administered by the Director General  of Fair Trading. The telecommunications industry has  similar characteristics to the motor vehicle industry; it has  a market, but persists with a separate regulator who has  concurrent jurisdiction. That regulator will search for  ways to interfere with the market. 
<P>
The Under-Secretary was wrong to claim that, by  tabling amendment No. 184, we perceived the sector  regulator's activities as being confined to setting price  controls. I hope that it was clear from the way in which I  introduced the amendments that we understand that sector  regulators have a range of other powers as well as price  control powers. In specific utilities, the other powers and  objections conflict with the price setting objective. In  those circumstances, we must ask about the way in which  concurrent jurisdiction will be applied by sector regulators  rather than the director general. 
<P>
It does not automatically follow that sector regulators,  who pursue other objectives, will perceive the primacy of  competition and not try to achieve a specific objective of  their regulatory powers by using Competition Act powers. 
<P>
In Committee, we labour with the problem of trying to  bring the powers into utility regulators' ambit when the  Government have not completed a utilities review. We  cannot anticipate where inconsistencies will emerge in the  energy sector or the extent to which energy sector  regulators will be brought together. 
<P>
At least the multi-utility inconsistencies will be tackled  by a reform of the utilities regulatory system. However, I  fear that the problems of competing and conflicting  objectives will be exacerbated by the review. Far from  stressing the primacy of competition and the objective of  a competitive market, the Government will probably  present a proverbial Christmas tree of objectives, with a  little bauble for this and a bauble for that, put a little star  on the top and call it a utilities review. The net  consequence of the Bill, if unamended, will be that the  utility regulators will be presented not only with a choice  of objectives, but with a choice of mechanisms through  which to pursue them. 
<P>
The Under-Secretary made some play of the fact that  concurrent jurisdiction was contemplated in the draft Bill  published in August 1996. He neglected to make it clear  that that draft Bill applied only to an article 85-style  prohibition. He also neglected to make it clear that the  previous Administration did not proceed directly to  introduce such legislation in the following session. If they  had, they would have been compelled to take account of  some of the representations made pursuant to that draft  Bill. 
<P>
There have been some interesting albeit conflicting  messages from within regulated industries about the  concurrent powers offered to regulators. For example,  some of the telecommunications companies with a smaller  market share are keen on concurrent powers for the  regulators. That is interesting; in a sense, I can understand  that. They want to maximise the power of the regulator,  because at present the regulator is seeking to diminish the  market power of British Telecommunications plc in the  industry, which will open up market opportunities for the  smaller companies. 
<P>
However, there are two traps in that line of argument.  The first is to equate the role of a sector regulator in  proactively diminishing the market power of particular  operator which is a legitimate objective for sectoral  regulation with the role of a Competition Act regime,  which is to identify specific anti-competitive practices or  abuses of a dominant position. That is an entirely separate  function; the two roles are not the same. British Telecom,  or any operator with a large market share, may well being  a dominant position, but as we have heard in previous  debates, enjoying a dominant position does not equal  abusing that dominant position. The sector regulator may  be seeking to reduce that dominant position under one set  of powers, but that does not mean that the regulator ought  to be equipped to use Competition Act powers artificially  to diminish that dominant position even when a dominant  operator is not abusing its position. 
<P>
The second trap is that when some of those companies  come to be bigger players in the marketplace, and there is  a more nearly perfect market or a more normal market, I  should perhaps say in telecommunications, they may  well find that they want interference by the regulator to  be diminished. That returns us to the point made by my  right hon. Friend the Member for Woking, which is that  we should reach a point where the sector regulator loses  jurisdiction, and the Director of Fair Trading assumes  the powers. 
<P>
I am sorry to have detained the Committee, but as the  Under-Secretary did not sufficiently cover all of those  points, it is important to put them on record. I shall not  press the amendments to a Division, not least because  there are many different ways to tackle the problem, and  they are set out in different amendments. 
<P>
The Government have so far failed to explain how they  will satisfactorily tackle the problems in the Bill. We  leave them to reflect further on those questions. They have  had several months to do that already. Perhaps before the  Bill completes its passage through this House, they will  find satisfactory amendments to remedy the deficiencies  in clause 54. On that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw  the amendment. 
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the  Bill.

<P>

<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I have one question to ask the  Under-Secretary that would not have been appropriate  under our discussion of the amendments. As I understand  it, the Government asked the regulators to consult on  cross-sectoral regulation. In such circumstances, no one  may have overriding power. If such a study is occurring,  should not the Office of Fair Trading join it, providing  the glue to pull the exercise together, given that it has the  relevant powers? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Nigel Griffiths:</B> I shall get back to the right hon.  Gentleman on that point. 
<P>
Question put and agreed to. 
<P>
Clause 54 ordered to stand part of the Bill. 
<H4><center>Schedule 10 </center></H4>
<H4><center>Regulators </center></H4>
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths: I beg to move amendment No. 196, in  page 77, line 32, after `above' insert `</B>("a general  matter" )'. 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take  the following: Government amendments Nos. 197 to 199. 
<P>
Amendment No. 122, in page 77, line 48, at end  insert  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(3B) For the purposes of subsection (3), a commercial activity  shall be deemed to be connected with telecommunications if it  consists in the provision of any technical service which is essential  to, or inseparable from, a telecommunications service by means of  which access to digital television services may be controlled.'.<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
Government amendments Nos. 200 and 207. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> Amendments Nos. 196 to 207 are  technical amendments to the Telecommunications Act  1984. They complete a set of amendments that the  Government concede in the Lords. Amendments Nos.  196 and 197 will provide clarification. The Bill provides  that the Director General of Telecommunications, when  exercising concurrent functions under the Bill, may have  regard to the subject matter of his Telecommunications  Act duties, where the Director General of Fair Trading  can do so. Amendments Nos. 196 and 197 will ensure  that that does not cast doubt on the ability to look at  the subject matter of statutory duties where they are  already disapplied from other functions under the  Telecommunications Act 1984. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> Amendment No. 196 is another bizarre  piece of drafting. Paragraph 2(4) of the schedule states: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The Director may nevertheless, when exercising any  Competition Act function, have regard to any matter in respect of  which a duty is imposed by subsection (1) or (2) above," .<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
I think that we can all understand that. However, if  amendment No. 196 is agreed to, paragraph 2(4) will read: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The Director may nevertheless, when exercising any  Competition Act function, have regard to any matter in respect of  which a duty is imposed by subsection (1) or (2) above ("a general  matter" )" <P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
Will the Under-Secretary explain how that will elucidate  or improve the meaning of that part of the schedule? Does  he really want us to insert the phrase "a general matter"   after the comma? that might be little more intelligible, but  it is still rather odd English. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> Let me go over the other amendments,  by which time I hope that I can satisfy the right hon.  Gentleman and the Committee. That matter might then  become clear, for obvious reasons. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I am certain that our interest in the  Under-Secretary's reply is such that my hon. Friends  would be willing to join my right hon. Friend the Member  for Wokingham in a debate on the concept of "general  matter" , which has a certain physical significance, if that  would afford further time to the Under-Secretary's  advisers. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> I am grateful, as always, to the right  hon. and gracious Gentleman. 
<P>
Amendments Nos. 198 and 199 will make minor textual  changes to make it clear that paragraph 2(5) refers to the  amendments in paragraphs 2(6) to 2(8) as well as those  in paragraph 2(5). 
<P>
Amendments Nos. 200 and 207 are consequential on  the repeal of section 10 of the Competition Act 1980.  They remove references to that Act from section 95 of the  Telecommunications Act 1984. 
<P>
I understand that the Opposition will speak to  amendment No. 122. When I have heard what the  Opposition have to say about amendment No. 122, I shall  respond to that and to the comments that have been made  about amendments Nos. 196 and 197. 
<P>
<B>Mr. David Chidgey (Eastleigh):</B> As the  Under-Secretary mentioned, I want to speak to  amendment No. 122, which will provide an opportunity  to focus on what some might consider a minor point, but  which is actually an important one, concerning the current  powers of the Director General of Telecommunications in  relation to digital television. 
<P>
Most hon. Members would probably agree that  broadcasting is our most dynamic market sector. In a  matter of weeks digital television will be launched in the  United Kingdom through satellite. Digital cable trials are  under way and terrestrial services will be launched in the  autumn. However, digital television is not just a matter of  television programmes. 
<P>
Television set top boxes will certainly receive  television, and that is not all that they will do. However,  in future they will be able to combine that function with  the use of a personal computer and access to the internet.  Trials are already available and demonstrations can be  seen. No doubt a great deal of money secures one of the  first available pieces of relevant equipment. The future is  almost with us now, with the possibility of using the  television with a personal computer to access the internet,  using the same delivery system and receiver. 
<P>
All that will mean that broadcasting in the traditional  sense is moving ever closer to the world of  telecommunications and computing. Communication,  entertainment and information will be linked in a new  sense. Services and transactions of enormous importance  will be channelled into the home through just one  gateway. It is vital that those services can take off and  be properly exploited, that consumers at home can obtain  untrammelled access to the services that the combination  of the relevant media will offer, and that those who want  to enter the market offering services in that context can  do so. 
<P>
That is important for two reasons. The first is that the  combined services offer a major business and economic  opportunity for the United Kingdom. In the United States  last year the emerging new sector of broadcasting,  computing and telecommunications accounted for half of  all national growth, and revenue from those sectors in the  United Kingdom was in the region of 50 billion. The  second reason concerns the right of individuals to a full  choice of services. It is important that digital provision  should offer a wide range of channels, from various  suppliers and owners. The assurance that information is  not rationed, and is equally available to all, is  enormously important. 
<P>
Such a state of affairs might be endangered by anything  that risked making the receiver, and the conditional access  systems that controlled payment for services, into  monopoly gateways to our homes. The dangers of  anti-competitive agreements this is the nub of the  amendment or anti-competitive conduct in the  telecommunications market, are already recognised, and  have been debated at an earlier stage of the Bill. 
<P>
The importance of access to people's television sets has  been acknowledged by the European Commission and the  United Kingdom Government. The Director General of  Telecommunications already has powers to ensure fair,  reasonable and non-discriminatory access for television  service providers to so-called conditional access systems,  such as smart card systems that permit charging for  certain programmes. That is well established. 
<P>
The present arrangements are good as far as they go. The powers of the Director General of  Telecommunications are less clear for functions and  software that fall outside the definitions of television and  conditional access. How television receivers will work in  the future and what can be received through them will  depend on the software inside them, particularly, in the  early days, inside set top boxes. The specification and  control of that software therefore becomes important.  Access to digital television services will depend on it. 
<P>
It would be wrong if any one set of closed, proprietary  standards dominated the market and delivered control of  the services available to audiences to one dominant  player. The Bill does not make it clear that the Director  General of Telecommunications has powers to consider  that aspect of the provision of digital television services.  However, it is clear that he should. He must have the  powers to guard against anti-competitive behaviour by the  owners and operators of access technology. Closed,  proprietary specifications for any component of the  broadcasting system will militate against the public  interest. 
<P>
The Government need to extend Oftel's existing powers  to cover related software in relevant delivery systems and  receivers. Amendment No. 122 would ensure that the new  set top boxes work together and are inter-operable, and  ensure consumer choice in what is received, no matter  who made the box. It would open up the United Kingdom  to the benefits of convergence to which I referred earlier. 
<P>
The technology is complicated, but the arguments are  not. The House, as well as the Committee, has expressed  the intention that there should be appropriate regulation  of such burgeoning new services. However, the Director  General of Telecommunications risks being outflanked if  he cannot look across the picture as a whole. I hope that  the Minister will show some sign that the Government  have taken on board such issues and problems. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> I recognise the concerns behind  amendment No. 122, but the Government do not consider  that the scope of Oftel's concurrent powers needs to be  amplified in that way. The regulatory controls in telecoms  licence conditions covering the provision of conditional  access services are currently being extended. They will  apply not only to broadcast digital television services, but  to non-broadcast and non-television broadcast digital  services. We believe that this framework, together with  the definition of a telecommunication service in the  Telecommunications Act 1984, covers fully the concerns  motivating the amendment. Indeed, it can deal with  concerns in a more targeted, pro-active way than would  be the case with the powers in the Competition Bill. 
<P>
The aim of the conditional access framework enforced  by Oftel is to ensure that broadcasters can provide their  services through another operator's access system and that  the use of that system is made available on a fair,  reasonable and non-discriminatory basis. To that end,  providers of the access services, when designing their  systems, are required to co-operate with those entitled to  use the systems. That includes being required to provide  sufficient information. The provision applies before  access services are actually being offered on a commercial  basis, which is to ensure that there can be no  discrimination from the moment that access services are  first offered commercially. 
<P>
The Government are clear that issues such as getting  information and co-operation relating to the application  programming interface API and the ability to  broadcast suitably verified applications, which provide  local interactivity when processed in the customer's  receiver, are intended to be, and are in fact, within the  scope of the regime. Those issues, among others, are  inseparably connected with the provision of the  telecommunication services comprising conditional access  on a fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory basis. They  are therefore within the purview of the conditional access  regime and Oftel's jurisdiction by virtue of the existing  provisions of section 4 of the Telecommunications Act. 
<P>
I come now to amendments Nos. 196 and 197. I understand how the right hon. Member for Wokingham  had problems with full stops and commas. The full stop  in the amendment to line 32 does not add a full stop to  the Bill: it is a full stop to signify the end of the  amendment. The Bill as drafted has a comma after  "above" ; "a general matter"  in brackets, will follow  "above"  and will therefore be followed by a comma, not  a full stop. 
<P>
If the amendment to line 32 is accepted, the "line 33"   referred to in amendment No. 197 becomes line 34. The  two full stops in amendment No. 197 include the full stop  that will be in the Bill. The final full stop will not be in  the Bill, but it is on the amendment paper. That full stop  moves from line 33 to line 36. I can understand how the  confusion arose. I assure the Committee that the drafting  is fine as it stands.

<P>

<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> The Under-Secretary has convinced  everyone that it is not. Perhaps I can now read what the  Bill would say with his amendment; I might then be able  to help him with a more normal way of expressing it that  would achieve the same effect. If his two amendments  were moved and agreed to, the schedule would read: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The Director may nevertheless, when exercising any  Competition Act function, have regard to any matter in respect of  which a duty is imposed by subsection (1) or (2) above ("a general  matter" ), if it is a matter to which the Director General of Fair  Trading could have regard when exercising that function; but that is  not to be taken as implying that, in relation to any of the matters  mentioned in subsection (3) or (3A) above, regard may not be had  to any general matter." <P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
Even the Under-Secretary will agree that that is not  terribly clear drafting. 
<P>
Why does he not return to the drawing board and insert  the word "general"  before "matter"  in line 31, obviating  the need for his rather complicated clause in brackets and  various types of punctuation? Why does he not split  another sentence off, saying rather simply that 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"in relation to matters mentioned in subsection (3) or (3A) above,  regard may be had to any general matter" ? <P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
That would be much clearer than the drafting that he  proposes. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> I accept what the right hon. Gentleman  says about the complexities of that; it would not be the  first time that there was some confusion in Bills presented  by this Government or previous Governments. However,  I can perhaps help him. To insert the word "general"  in  the reference to "any matter"  would be tautological. To  help members of the Committee and people reading the  Bill, I should explain that "subsection (1) or (2) above"   refers to a general matter in that respect. That reference is  there to assist and would be there anyway. If we inserted  "general"  in the line above, we would do so unnecessarily,  as we were going to have the explanation anyway. It  would probably move the words in line 33 to line 34 and  cause problems with the double full stop, which, as  amended on line 36, would become line 37. I wanted to  give such a clear explanation to avoid that. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I regularly attend the plain English  awards under the auspices of Miss Chrissie Maher, and I  have every intention of sending her the transcript of the  debate. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> And I thought amendment No. 122 was  highly complex, technical and difficult to understand!  Having heard the Under-Secretary's explanation of his  punctuation in the earlier amendment, I am beginning to  wonder whether I got that right. 
<P>
Amendment No. 122 raises a complex and technical  issue; consequently the Under-Secretary's reply was  equally complex and technical. I am sure that he will  understand that I should like to study his reply more  closely when I have the opportunity. Perhaps, if I feel the  need, I shall return to the matter at a later stage.

<P>
Schedule 10, as amended, agreed to. 
<H4><center>Clause 55 </center></H4>
<H4><center>General restrictions on disclosure of information </center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 187, in  page 28, line 33, after `brought', insert `by the Director,  or with his consent'. 
<P>
Clause 55(1) provides the safeguard that information  obtained under the powers in part I of the Bill is not to  be disclosed. Subsection (2) provides for consent for  disclosure to be given. In short, subsection (1) would not  allow disclosure, but subsection (2) would allow it in  certain circumstances. Subsection (3) disapplies the  safeguard of subsection (1) of not being able to disclose  information. In the circumstances in which subsection (3)  applies, it exposes individuals or companies to the risk of  disclosure, but without the statutory safeguard that is in  subsection (1). My first proposition is that subsection (3)  should be used sparingly. 
<P>
Amendment No. 187 would amend subsection (3)(b),  which permits disclosure with a view to civil proceedings  being taken. The amendment would limit the civil  proceedings to which that disapplication applies to civil  proceedings brought by the director general or with his  consent. The intention is not to frustrate civil proceedings  brought by other parties or cases for which the director  general has not given his consent, but to remove the risk  that parties other than the director general would be able  to institute or use civil proceedings to facilitate disclosure  of information gained under the Bill as distinct from the  laws of disclosure that usually apply. 
<P>
I am working on the proposition that if, under  subsection (3), disclosure is not permitted to those who  bring civil proceedings other than in cases instituted by  the director general or instituted with his consent, they  would none the less be able to pursue their civil  proceedings using the normal powers of disclosure. It is  slightly tricky, because I am not a lawyer, but I am trying  to find my way through the rules and circumstances that  would normally apply in civil proceedings. 
<P>
The essence of the matter is that that should be done  sparingly, and only when the director general brings civil  proceedings, or when he gives consent. It is a matter for  the director general when that consent should be applied.  I hope that the Under-Secretary will accept that the  amendment is intended to be helpful and constructive. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> Clause 55(3)(b) gives the director  general the power to disclose the information that he has  obtained under the Bill with a view to, or in connection  with, civil proceedings being brought for infringement of  the prohibitions. The director general's consent to such  proceedings is not required, and nor should it be. It is  entirely a matter for those with an interest in the breach  of the prohibitions to decide whether to bring proceedings. 
<P>
However, I must point out that the Bill provides a  power to disclose for such proceedings not a duty or a  right. The director general will decide in each case how  to exercise his discretion to disclose information. To the  extent that the amendment was designed to achieve that  aim it is unnecessary. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> The Under-Secretary may be combining  two things that should not be combined. The amendment  would not require the director general to consent to civil  proceedings. However, when he gave his consent, that  would disapply what would otherwise be the proper  safeguard in subsection (1) that relates to disclosure. The  Under-Secretary seemed to suggest that consent meant  consent to civil proceedings; parties could proceed with  civil proceedings, but they would not necessarily be able  to rely on the disclosure of information from the director  general in pursuance of those proceedings. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> I think that I said that the Bill already  provides a power to disclose for such proceedings, but  that it does not provide an obligation, duty or right to  disclose. The director general will decide in each case  how to exercise his discretion. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> We are confusing two different things.  The Under-Secretary is saying that giving the director  general discretion as to whether to disclose is as good  as bringing it under the safeguard in subsection (1).  That is a statutory safeguard, not the offer of discretion  to the director general. The statutory safeguard is  disapplied only in the specific circumstances set out in  subsection (2). 
<P>
The amendment is designed to give persons affected  the same statutory safeguard except where the civil  proceedings are brought by the director general or with  his consent. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> The amendment would allow  disclosures in relation to civil proceedings only where the  proceedings have been brought by the director general or  with his consent. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> That is right. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> That fundamental suggestion is  unacceptable to the Government. The director general's  consent to such proceedings should not be required; it  should be a matter for those with an interest in the breach  of the prohibition to decide whether to bring proceedings. 
<P>
If the amendment were accepted, proceedings would  have to be brought by the director general or with his  consent. The hon. Gentleman may wish to build in some  sort of safeguard for businesses that may be affected, but  the director general's consent should not be required.  Whether the director general gives or does not give his  consent and the proceedings are advanced, he could  decide to use his discretion to disclose information. His  ability and integrity will allow that decision to be taken.  For that reason, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will  withdraw the amendment.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for  responding constructively, but I am not sure that I accept  everything he said. I understand his point about consent.  The amendment was not designed to constrain civil  proceedings, merely those for which the director general  gives consent. The giving of consent would relate to the  disapplying of the safeguard for disclosure. However, if  the Minister shows in his response that he is willing to  think further about the problem, I beg to ask leave to  withdraw the amendment. 
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. 
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the  Bill. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I have just one point to raise. Clause 55(1) states that no information is to be disclosed 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"during the lifetime of an individual or while that business continues  to be carried on" . <P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
Will the Minister elaborate? The phrase 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"while that business continues to be carried on"  <P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
can contemplate an exceptional length of time. My right  hon. Friend the Member for Cities of London and  Westminster may have constituents whose businesses  have carried on for hundreds of years. I am reminded of  the Whitechapel bell foundry, which is outside my right  hon. Friend's constituency, but is one of the United  Kingdom's most longstanding businesses. I am not a  campanologist but I recollect that it goes back to the 14th century or even earlier. 
<P>
<H5>6 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
Is that length of time contemplated by that phrase? Is  the phraseology necessary or would a different  phraseology serve the purpose? Is it intended to be for  ever? I am reminded that the Lord Chancellor is  contemplating perpetuities. In that context, will the  Minister tell us whether the provision is intended to be in  perpetuity or is a time limit envisaged? I understand that  125 years is contemplated with reference to perpetuity.  What real time limit occurs? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes a valid  point. I am advised that the phrase to which he referred  does mean a long time. Neither he nor I are lawyers. If  we were writing the Bill, we would probably put "a long  time"  in it, but we would face the wrath of the lawyers  who may be paid by the word. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I cannot provide my hon. Friend the  Member for South Cambridgeshire with information  about the oldest business in my constituency, but I can  tell him the most specialised business identified at a  seminar in the London School of Economics some 30 or  40 years ago it was a four-person business devoted to  the provision of aperients for parrots. The fact that four  people were needed to provide such aperients suggests  that being a parrot is not a wholly agreeable experience. 
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

Clause 55 ordered to stand part of the Bill. 
<H4><center>Schedule 11 </center></H4>
<H4><center>Interpretation of Section 55 </center></H4>

<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 40 in  page 92, line 38, at end insert

</UL></FONT> 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take Government  amendment No. 42. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> The two amendments are  straightforward. They simply correct omissions from  schedule 11, which lists persons to whom and functions  for which information obtained under the Bill may be  disclosed. Amendment No. 42 adds to schedule 11  reference to the Independent Television Commission and  amendment No. 40 adds reference to the Broadcasting Act  1996, which contains the relevant functions of the ITC. I invite the Committee to agree to the amendments. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I have one question, albeit slightly  tangential to the amendments. A list is being contemplated  and the Government are adding further designated persons  for the purposes of the schedule. I notice that elsewhere  in the list reference is made to both the Competition  Commission and the Monopolies and Mergers  Commission. I had understood that we were legislating to  substitute the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. with  the Competition Commission, which will have different  functions. That both should exist at the same time is  inherently improbable under the Bill. I wondered why the  reference to the MMC persists. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> I wonder whether the reference persists  because including the Independent Television  Commission at the end of line 4 will push paragraph (p)  down to line 19. If the Monopolies and Mergers  Commission were at some stage to be removed, paragraph  (p) would be banged back up to line 18, leaving the  schedule consistent and making all the subsequent  amendments which we shall come on to discuss easier to  follow. If the hon. Gentleman will allow me, perhaps I  can clarify that point later. 
<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> I beg to move amendment 41, in page  92, line 47, at end insert

<H4><center>Interpretation </center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the  Bill. 
<P>
<B>Dr. Stephen Ladyman </B>(South Thanet): Briefly, will  my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary take this opportunity  to clarify the word "legible" , which is used in the clause  and in several other clauses? The Bill will, on occasion,  deal with computerised information which may be  encrypted. Encrypted information could be provided in a  legible form which would still be impossible to  understand. To avoid confusion, it may be helpful if my  hon. Friend puts on record that "legible"  should be taken  as also meaning decrypted and in plain English. 
<P>
<B> Mr. Redwood:</B> I have a different point, but the  Under-Secretary may want to answer both points at the  same time. I notice that the clause contains a definition of  premises. It states: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"`premises' does not include domestic premises unless...they are  also used in connection with the affairs of an undertaking" . <P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
We are happy with that provision; the Under-Secretary  dealt with that in answer to our fears about powers of  breaking and entering. The clause goes on to say that it  does not include domestic premises unless 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"documents relating to the affairs of an undertaking are kept there."  <P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
Does that require amendment in light of the  Under-Secretary's promise that the premises of junior  employees and former employees would not be entered  unless they were used directly in connection with the  affairs of the business in question? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> I shall tackle the questions in order. My  hon. Friend the Member for South Thanet (Dr. Ladyman)  raised an important matter. "Legible"  should mean  readable and it should mean understandable too. 
<P>
I turn to the point made by the right hon. Member for  Wokingham. Earlier, I set out what is meant by domestic  premises and I expect the Bill to adhere to that  interpretation. Any discrepancies will be regularised on  Third Reading and on Report. 
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 221, in  page 32, line 2, after `to' insert ` (a)" . 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take  Government amendment No. 222. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> The Bill is drafted to confer direct rights  of action for people to take in the UK courts in respect of  breach of prohibitions. We believe that such rights have  an important part to play in the enforcement of the  prohibitions. We want to ensure that our courts will have  third party rights of action for breach of the domestic  prohibitions, as those prohibitions evolve in the context  of articles 85 and 86. Our amendments confirm that. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hayes:</B> The Bill introduces prohibition, based on  articles 85 and 86 of the treaty of Rome. Clause 60  contains general principles and it is intended to ensure  that the Bill, subject to certain caveats, will be applied in a  manner that is consistent with those articles. It is therefore  central to the Government's objectives and it is vital that  it is workable. I use such terms as opposed to  assertions to maintain an atmosphere of courtesy. I am  usually charming. 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman would do  better to make his remarks in the clause stand part debate.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hayes:</B> I am grateful, Mrs. Roe, for the chance to  consult my notes in more detail. I return to the questions  that Conservative Members wish to ask about the clause. 
<P>
When will the clause apply and when will it not  apply in relation to the incompatibilities that are referred  to in the Bill? We require details of the provisions that  depart from European competition law, or from what one  might term the European competition law approach. 
<P>
What does the clause require when it does apply? Those  adjudicating on prohibition should do so in the manner of  those judging under the terms of articles 85 and 86. 
<P>
What are the principles in the Bill that will be applied  by the relevant courts? Speaking of the caveats that I  mentioned during an earlier debate, what are the  corresponding questions? Are there parallel proceedings  in the European Court of Justice that apply to particular  alleged abuses, or do the questions raise materially similar  facts? Surely the Under-Secretary would admit that any  European Court case should be capable of being followed  in its entirety. 
<P>
Will the clause apply to conduct that infringes the  substantive prohibitions? Will it also apply to the  consequences of any such infringement? If the latter  applies, the Under-Secretary will be aware that the  relevant case law in the European courts suggests that  such matters must be dealt with entirely under the  jurisdiction of courts in this country. Surely a provision  must specify the rights that private parties will enjoy in  case of infringement. 
<P>
Are the powers of enforcement penalty exhaustive?  What are the rights and powers of competitors and  consumers? Given article 90, what will be the impact of  the chapter I and chapter II prohibitions on industry  specific and United Kingdom specific law? The clause  must not be vague. If it is vague, it will prove untenable  when tested in the courts. I hope that the Under-Secretary  will answer the specific questions that I have asked. 
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Dr. Ladyman:</B> The hon. Member for South Holland  and The Deepings (Mr. Hayes) is right to say that this is  one of the Bill's key clauses it is probably the key  clause. In the few interventions that I have made, I have  said that the application of European law to the Bill is  what will make the Government's intentions work and  that it is key to the Government's defence against many  of the substantive amendments that the Opposition have  moved. 
<P>
Clause 60 will make clause 18 effective against  predatory pricing. Clause 60 strengthens clause 18, so that  we could remove clause 19 and still have confidence that  we had the powers in the Bill to deal with such matters  as the newspaper industry. Given their usual fondness for  matters European and their defence of clause 19, I am  surprised that Liberal Democrat Members are absent. We  have reached the key clause that will make the Bill work;  clause 60 is fundamental to the Bill. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> As the hon. Member for South Thanet  has said, this is a crucial clause. It reopens the question  that we posed at the outset of our deliberations will the  Bill align our law clearly and strongly with European law?  Indeed, will the Bill go further and apply European  jurisprudence rules in such matters, so that there is no  incompatibility between the two regimes? We have  always said that that will not be the result of the Bill. 
<P>
Clause 60 is far too weak and general to achieve what  I think was the Government's aim when they first  suggested the Bill. Ministers have been misled about what  clause 60 will achieve. The President of the Board of  Trade referred to 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"clause 60, which brings European jurisprudence into effect here" . <P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
I see no words in the clause that will do that. She also  said: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Clause 60 states explicitly that, in interpreting those terms in all  markets covered by the Bill, our law must follow European  jurisprudence and have regard to clarifying policy statements from  the European Commission."  [Official Report, 11 May 1998; Vol. 312, c. 28-30.] <P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
Again, those words do not appear in the clause.  Unfortunately, the Minister of State is not here, but he  said: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Clause 60 requires European jurisprudence to be followed."   [Official Report, 11 May 1998; Vol. 312, c. 118.]<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
The clause is much weaker than those broad claims  would lead us to believe. In a slightly hesitant way, it  states: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The purpose of this section is to ensure that so far as is possible  (having regard to any relevant differences between the provisions  concerned), questions arising under this Part in relation to  competition within the United Kingdom are dealt with in a manner  which is consistent with the treatment of corresponding questions  arising in Community law in relation to competition within the  Community." <P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
That is about as good as we will get. It has been our  case that there will always be two different jurisdictions,  that they will not always reach the same conclusion, and  that rules governing inter-state trading will result in  different decisions from those governing intra-state  trading within the United Kingdom. That is why, even  with that attempt in the Bill, there will continue to be  double jeopardy, different decisions and complexity for  business as there have been occasions when such  complexities occurred under the old regime. Indeed, we  consider that there will be more such problems under this  Bill than under the old legislation. 
<P>
The Committee should understand that a question  arising under the clause is not the same as the issues that  may fall for determination. Many lawyers, who are  rewarded much more amply than Members of Parliament,  will spend much time arguing about what is a question  and whether a particular matter is covered by that loose  word. They will point out that matters have only to be  dealt with in a manner "which is consistent"  in so far as  it is possible to be consistent with the provisions under  clause 60(1). 
<P>
The clause sets out a weak proposition. It is true that a  further explanation follows in subsections (2) and (3). For  example, subsection (3) states: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The court must, in addition, have regard to any relevant decision  or statement of the Commission."  <P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
It would be interesting to hear the Under-Secretary  explain what "a statement"  means. Could a  Commissioner, making an off-the-cuff remark in a  television interview, be deemed to have made a statement,  or should that be interpreted as being something more  formal than that? What is meant by a "relevant decision" ?  Is it limiting such matters to those formal competition  decisions that are taken by a competition Commissioner,  perhaps in consultation with other Commissioners, or  does it go wider to include more general policy decisions  of the European Community? 
<P>
<B>Dr. Ladyman:</B> I challenge the right hon. Gentleman's  contention that the provision is weak. I draw his attention  to subsection (2), from which I shall quote some words  such as, "at any time" , "it must act"  not that the court  should act or could act, but that "it must act" . It goes on  to state that the court should act 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"with a view to securing that there is no inconsistency between" . <P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
Those are strong terms. They are not weak, as the right  hon. Gentleman is trying to imply. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> The hon. Gentleman is very good  compared with the rest of the Labour Members of the  Committee. He has chosen the only words in the  complicated clause that have any strength. However, he  should have read on, because that strength is diluted  immediately by weak words. It is true that the court "must  act" , but those words are followed immediately by the  words: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"so far as is compatible with the provisions of this Part" . <P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
As I explained, the rest of that part is weak and, thus,  strong words are diluted again by the those waspish and  woolly words which follow immediately one of only two  strong statements. 
<P>
As the hon. Gentleman said, the provision continues  with the words: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"with a view to securing that there is no inconsistency between" , <P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
but that is followed by a set of weak words, such as  "principles applied" . That does not provide the type of  provision that is needed if it is to be lawyer proof in  various courts and the Competition Commission when  such matters are tested. 
<P>
I welcome the fact that the draftsmen of the clause have  understood and grappled with the very problems that we  have been exposing. They accept that the clause concerns  two jurisdictions. Intra-state and inter-state trading may  require different types of decision and regulation and it  will not always be possible to reach the same conclusions,  or even apply the same principles, in each case. Different  approaches are required. 
<P>
The Under-Secretary has often mentioned the single  industry example of the bus industry, and I have always  found our aims in that context to be similar. Neither he  nor I wish small, provincial town markets to be dominated  by a single bus company, which may have achieved that  dominance by predatory pricing. Vigilance and strong  control are needed, whether under the old regime or the  new I would argue that either would work to stop such  things happening. There is no way that European  jurisdiction can achieve the desired result, because the  instance does not have an impact on a big enough area of  the European Community, and does not pose cross-border  issues, which is what the European jurisdiction is all  about. Of course a mechanism is needed in the United  Kingdom expressly for that job. It is no good claiming  that there will always be compatibility with Community  law. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hayes:</B> My right hon. Friend has made precisely  the points that I made when I asked when the provision  would apply. There are industry-specific and case-specific  laws that are recognised in the Bill by the raising of the  issue of compatibility and, implicitly, incompatibility.  However, the Bill does not make it clear when and how  the provisions will apply. That ambiguity makes the Bill  weak, not strong, contrary to the assertion of the hon.  Member for South Thanet.

<P>

<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> My hon. Friend is right. I hope that we  may, either now or in later debates, if the occasion arises,  be able to tease from the Government more information  on where they expect EC jurisprudence to rule OK, and  where they expect a domestic competence to rule, and a  little more about the meaning of the words "consistent"   and "corresponding" . 
<P>
Lawyers who have examined the clause have, I am told,  already raised a series of questions about which they think  they could argue endlessly in a court of law, should the  words I have quoted remain unamended. They think that  they could argue endlessly about what constituted a  question, about whether a provision was a corresponding  provision as between EC law and British law, and even  about the presence of inconsistency. It could be argued, if  one was testing different cases involving different  geographical extents, that it was perfectly consistent to  reach a different answer in the United Kingdom. That  would amount to a different problem judged by a  different jurisdiction. 
<P>
The lawyers could argue about what constituted a  relevant decision of the European Court. It is not claimed  that all decisions of the European Court form part of the  jurisprudence background to these matters in the United  Kingdom. The same question about relevance arises with  respect to decisions or statements by the European  Commission. 
<P>
<B>Dr. Ladyman:</B> The right hon. Gentleman is simply  trying to score debating points. There is no problem about  the definition of a question in the context. The answer to  the question from the hon. Member for South Holland and  the Deepings about when the provisions will apply is that  the clause states that "at any time"  when a decision is  before the court it must take account of European  jurisprudence. The question was posed earlier as to  whether a statement by a Commissioner on the television  could be construed as appropriate. The clause does not  refer to a statement by a Commissioner, but to a  "statement of the Commission" . The meaning of the  clause is clear. The right hon. Gentleman is trying to make  some good debating points by claiming that it is woolly,  but it is not. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> I am delighted that the hon. Gentleman  thinks that they are good debating points. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clive Betts (Sheffield, Attercliffe):</B> For the right  hon. Gentleman. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> That is a high standard, as the hon.  Gentleman will know, so I am even more delighted. The  points that I have made are serious ones about matters  that will affect everyday business life if the clause is  passed. Those cavils over the meaning of words were not  invented by me. I know that I have dealt with this matter  mostly on my own, but I have listened to the advice of  lawyers and the words that I have mentioned are exactly  the ones that they identified as vague enough to provide  good sport in court. 
<P>
I do not want to keep the Under-Secretary from his  dinner longer than necessary. Before Report, he should  reconsider whether, in order to carry out the wishes of the  President of the Board of Trade as expressed to  Parliament, he should toughen or clarify the clause. 
<P>
It would be helpful if the Under-Secretary wrote to the  Committee with more guidance on the decisions and  jurisprudence that the clause introduces from the  European system. Businesses would then have a better  idea of what would have a direct impact on British  competition authorities, and would not worry so much  about how United Kingdom competition authorities would  react in any given circumstances. 
<P>
<H5>6.30 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
I shall not prolong our proceedings. I have given the  Committee some food for thought. I shall understand if  the Under-Secretary cannot reply to all the points tonight;  an answer in writing would assist the Committee. We are  told that the Government aim to bring us more into line  with European law. In that case, it would be wise of them  to strengthen the clause. Otherwise, it will not achieve  their aim. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> Clause 60 seeks to ensure as far as  possible that the United Kingdom and EC prohibitions are  interpreted and develop consistently with EC competition  law. On several occasions, Opposition Members have said  that an agreement or conduct should have an appreciable  effect on trade between member states if articles 85 or 86  are to apply. 
<P>
Opposition Members have also argued that the  requirement somehow makes the competition test for the application of the domestic prohibition different from  that for the application of article 85. It may be helpful to  the Committee if I set out, in some detail, why I believe  that they are mistaken. 
<P>
The requirement that there be an effect on inter-state  trade for the application of article 85 is a jurisdictional  hurdle. It does not affect the meaning of the prohibition  in the sense of determining whether or not an agreement  is anti-competitive, nor does it affect the meaning of the  prohibition in determining whether conduct abuses a  dominant position. We are creating a UK competition  system that aligns the tests for what is anti-competitive  under the UK prohibition with that of the EC system, and  that relies on EC jurisprudence. Businesses whose  agreements are already subject to article 85 will be  relieved of performing a wholly different form-based  competition law analysis when assessing the application  of domestic competition law. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hayes:</B> I understand the Under-Secretary's  comments about establishing a system that is in line with  EU jurisprudence, especially with articles 85 and 86. But  the Bill refers to compatibilities; it deals with relevance,  and, by implication, irrelevance. He should tell the  Committee where he perceives contradictions. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> We have made it clear that we are not  importing the EC system lock, stock and barrel. We have  explained how and why our system differs from the EC  system, for example in the detail of the procedures that  will apply. But when no difference exists, for example, in  the prohibitions, European jurisprudence will apply. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Boswell (Daventry):</B> In some tricky problems,  such as what constitutes a question and what constitutes  a decision given that we are considering domestic UK  legislation, although the Minister wishes it to be broadly  comparable to the European system if there is doubt  about a European decision's construction, could a British  judge apply to the European Court for a declaratory ruling  to clarify a decision? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> Importing EC jurisprudence extends not  only to the substantive law but to the principles developed  under EC law. Such principles are part and parcel of the  prohibitions. The fact that single market objectives will  not be relevant for many agreements which come within  the scope of the chapter I prohibition does not mean that  the European Commission and the UK prohibitions are  different. For example, it does not mean that single market  considerations must be dissected out of an EU decision  before applying clause 60. 
<P>
Under each prohibition, what is important is whether  the agreement can be said to have the object or effect  of restricting, preventing or distorting competition. As a  general rule, agreements which seek to divide markets  along national lines raise serious competition concerns.  That is because barriers to trade still exist between  member states. 
<P>
The Government are aligning the competition tests of  the UK prohibitions with EC competition law; when  prohibitions apply, business can look to EC jurisprudence  to determine how their agreements and conduct will be  treated under the UK prohibitions. We hope that reference  will be possible to the European Court of Justice on  unresolved points of EC law that could have an impact on  the application of the prohibitions. However, ultimately  the question of whether a reference is possible is one of  Community law, over which we have no control. We must  continue to be careful not to depart from the substance of  articles 85 and 86. My hon. Friend the Member for South  Thanet pointed out that the Bill is far from woolly; it is  clear and clause 60 is clear. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hayes:</B> rose  
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> I shall certainly give the hon.  Gentleman a chance to intervene, but his right hon. and  hon. Friends have had months to back up their statements  that this is a woolly clause. If they had wanted to tighten  it up, they could have done so by tabling amendments.  However, they did not do that. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hayes:</B> Will the Under-Secretary deal with the  specific points that I made? They contradict the assertion  that he has just made. If the clause is tightly worded, how  does it deal with the effects of infringements, rather than  the actual infringements? In European case law,  infringements are deemed to be the responsibility of  national Parliaments and national law, rather than of the  European Court of Justice. Furthermore, how does the  clause deal with what are described as corresponding  questions? Are they questions that will be dealt with  simultaneously in Europe, or are they questions with  similar material facts? 
<P>
<B>Mr Griffiths:</B> Let me take the hon. Gentleman's last  question, as it has more substance than the earlier one.  There will not necessarily be similar facts. If the same  issues of law are raised, parallel proceedings might not  be needed. I hope that that clarifies matters for the hon.  Gentleman and his right hon. and hon. Friends, and I commend the clause to the Committee. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> That was not a convincing answer to  the points made by my hon. Friends and me. The  Under-Secretary asked why the Opposition had not tabled  amendments to tighten the clause in the way that we  should like. The main reason that we did not do so is that  our argument, throughout the proceedings of the Bill, has  been that it is not possible to produce a single jurisdiction,  nor to avoid conflicts and differences between the two  jurisdictions. As I made clear in my introduction to the  clause stand part debate, we have much sympathy with  the parliamentary draftsmen who had to wrestle with the  matter. We realised that they had experienced problems  with the clause and we could not find any way to improve  it. That vindicates the case that we have been making: the  main objectives set out by the President of the Board of  Trade cannot be met. The clause demonstrates that we cannot have one all-singing, all-dancing jurisdiction a  seamless web between Brussels and the United  Kingdom because all sorts of cases are different and will  need different treatment. 
<P>
I return to the case of bus industry for once, the Under- Secretary and I are on the same side in what we  want to achieve. We cannot deal with an individual bus  company exploiting or trying to exploit a small town  market in the United Kingdom, because no issues of  cross-border trade are concerned and the area is not big  enough to be significant to the Community. If we simply  replicate Community-level jurisdiction and substitute the  United Kingdom for the Community, that still would not  work.

<P>

<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> I had almost completed my remarks  when we suspended. I was making the point that in the  case of the bus industry, one cannot simply delete the  words "European Union"  and replace them with "United  Kingdom"  because of market definitions and other  problems. There must be separate development of a  British approach to the difficulties within relatively small  parts of the United Kingdom, which none the less form  important markets. There are also many other  incompatibilities that caused the draftsman problems  when he constructed the clause. 
<P>
I urge the Under-Secretary to think about these issues  before the Bill returns to the House on Report. We fear  that the Government's intention is not being followed, but  we are not surprised by that. Good points were also made  about the rights of private parties and the rights in law of  consumers and competitors affected by the infringement.  We have not had a proper answer to them, either. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Nigel Griffiths:</B> I will try to deal with the more  serious points made by the right hon. Gentleman and also  the issues raised by my hon. Friend the Member for  South Thanet. 
<P>
I was asked what was meant by determining a question.  When the director general, the tribunal or the courts are  applying the prohibition and deciding whether an  agreement is anti-competitive or on what terms an  exception should be granted, there must be no  inconsistency with European competition law. The  language echoes that used in the European Communities  Act 1972. United Kingdom courts therefore have more  than 25 years' experience of dealing with the language  and application of European Community law. 
<P>
The penultimate point of the right hon. Member for  Wokingham was about buses. That agreement is often  quoted as one that is unlikely to affect inter-state trade. When bus operators in a UK town are accused of  anti-competitive behaviour by preventing new entrants  from coming into the market, the Commission is likely  not to have jurisdiction to apply the article 85 competition  test. Limiting or sharing markets, which is what such bus  companies do, are examples under EC and UK  prohibitions of agreements that are anti-competitive. EC  jurisprudence on what is anti-competitive therefore  provides the guide for UK businesses, determining  whether their agreements would be anti-competitive for  the purposes of the UK prohibition. 
<P>
How do people know what is not compatible with EC  jurisprudence? We are not importing the European system  lock, stock and barrel. We have made it clear how and  why we differ from the EC system, such as in the terms  of the detail of the procedures to be applied. Where there  is no such difference for example, in the meaning of the  prohibitions European jurisprudence will apply. 
<P>
There are differences in the exclusions from the  prohibitions; merger exclusion is one example. We have  given a wider exclusion from the prohibition for mergers  than the equivalent special treatment for mergers that  exists at EC level. That difference has been welcomed by  business and it does not lose the benefits of alignment  with EC prohibitions. When UK prohibitions apply, UK  business can look to EC jurisprudence. That is not  compatible with EC jurisprudence, and is an example of  a departure. 
<P>
The clause creates a system that will work well  alongside European law. I commend it to the Committee.

<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> The Bill was amended in the other place  to ensure that the director general's powers to delegate  under schedule 1 of the Fair Trading Act 1973 also apply  to the investigation function.
