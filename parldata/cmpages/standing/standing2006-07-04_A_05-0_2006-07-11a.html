<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071158000458"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I shall be brief. The amendments relate to public
access, transparency and openness. The proposed section 3(10) of the
Charities Act 1993 is laudable and the principle that copies of charity
trusts should be open to inspection at all times is desirable. It is
therefore strange that proposed subsection (11) has a qualification
that is not explained or justified. I wonder whether it has
accidentally fallen into the Bill or whether there is a perfectly
rational explanation for it. I look forward to the Minister&#146;s
comments.</div><a name="06071158000032"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06071158000459"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Andrew Turner</b> (Isle of Wight) (Con): How nice it is to see
you once again this morning, Mr. Gale. The hon. Member for Cheltenham
(Martin Horwood) must be optimistic because he is still wearing his
summer suit. I understand why he wishes to expunge the subsection. I
have looked on GuideStar and believe that the subsection covers
charities such as women&#146;s aid charities that might have
registered addresses or even names of trustees who might be subject to
pressure were they to become widely known. Amendment No. 20 is designed
to allow only part of the details that are recorded by the commission
to be withheld from public inspection. It is not necessary to do either
all or nothing; the Government should have the opportunity to go
part-way on such
matters.</div><a name="06071158000033"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071158000460"></a>The
Parliamentary Secretary, Cabinet Office (Edward Miliband):</b>
It is nice to see you back in the Chair, Mr. Gale. The
amendment is worth considering properly. I shall briefly explain the
position for the benefit of the Committee. The hon. Member for Isle of
Wight (Mr. Turner) rightly raised the issue of when disclosing the name
of a trustee may place that person at risk. The Charity Commission has
a dispensation to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column159" />Column number: 160</div>remove such information from its register. A separate power is available
only to Ministers, which is to restrict access in respect of the trusts
of a charity. The power has existed for 45 years or so since the early
1960s, but has not been used by Ministers. Labour Members will know
that Aneurin Bevan said that the purpose of getting power is to be able
to give it away. In that spirit, I make a commitment to the Committee
to consider whether the power is really necessary. My immediate
presumption is that it probably is not, but I shall come back on Report
and I hope that I will have good news
then.</div><a name="06071158000034"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071158000461"></a>Martin

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071158000464"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> Amendments Nos. 160 to 163 are about exempt
charities. When I acquired my responsibility, I seemed odd that,
although the Charity Commission has a list of most charities, I had to
search quite a lot in the depths of the legislation to find which
charities are exempt. I found a useful page in the Charities Act 1993
that contained a long list of exempt charities as well as a long list
of gaps. One then has to go further, because things have been removed,
to find out which things have subsequently been added to that list at
different stages. One then finds that the Minister will have the power
to create new exempt charities.</div>
<a name="06071158000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No.160, regarding the proposed new section 3A(2)(a) to the 1993 Act,
would mean that an exempt charity would be subject to the same
requirement to register with the Charity Commission as excepted
charities. That is to say, they are not required to register if they
have an income that does not exceed &#163;100,000. Most exempt
charities have an income that exceeds that figure, because they are
creatures of Government and are therefore well funded by them or
because they are long-established organisations, such as the Church
Commissioners. Therefore, my proposal would require 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column160" />Column number: 161</div>exempt charities to register except those which have an income of less
than
&#163;100,000.</div><a name="06071158000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No.161 is about the power to vary the threshold of any charity that
registers. It would mean that the Secretary of State is limited to
raising the threshold and could not lower it. We have heard how onerous
registration might be for some charities.</div>
<a name="06071158000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.163 continues the
theme of exempt charities. It sets out that they would not be required
to do anything other than register, except to provide the name of their
principal regulator. As they have a different regulator, they would not
be required to do any of the other things that charities have to do,
such as supplying documents to the Charity Commission. However, they
would be required to supply the name of the principal regulator. I hope
that&#151;because it was too late to put that under the
responsibilities of the commission&#151;the commission would take
that information about the name of the regulator and include it in the
register. Amendment Nos. 161 and 162 are about raising the thresholds
for registration.</div> <a name="06071158000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
turn now to amendment No. 21. On Second Reading, we heard that there
are 190,000 charities, and 420 charities of them responded on the issue
of the thresholds to registration&#151;the maximum response to any
part of the consultation&#151;and that is a poor response rate and
even lower than we would find in the European elections. It suggests
that the voluntary and charitable sectors have had no detailed
engagement with the consultation. It undermines some of the conclusions
that were reached in the preparatory stages of the Bill, whether by the
Government or the Joint Committee.</div>
<a name="06071158000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">The strategy
unit recommended a lower threshold of &#163;10,000 for mandatory
registration, permitting smaller organisations to register if they
wished to do so. The Government responded to the review&#146;s
recommendation of &#163;10,000 by going for &#163;5,000. I am not
entirely clear about the reasons for that except that they may have
split the difference, an understandable Government position but one
that does not seem to have any justification. The Minister in the House
of Lords agreed with that when he
said:</div><a name="06071158000401"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We can
see that there is some merit in raising the threshold to
&#163;10,000. But it is not a step we should take without there being
full consultation because the figures in the Bill have been consulted
on&#148;.&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 28 June
2005; Vol. 673, c.
231.]</div><a name="06071158000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is true that
the Government consulted on the figures, but the response rate was
pretty low. One theory was that no one would be allowed to register
below &#163;10,000, but that was removed as a result of the
consultation. I do not see any particular justification for the figure
of &#163;5,000, and I do not see anything particularly bad about the
figure of &#163;10,000. I commend the amendment to the
Committee.</div><a name="06071158000050"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071158000465"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> Amendment No. 90 is designed to address the
Secretary of State&#146;s power to change the list of exempt
charities, to which the hon. Member for Isle of Wight has referred, and
the income threshold for the registration of charities.</div>
<a name="06071158000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">The power is
critical. It will affect the status and the regulator of any number of
exempt charities or charities that might become exempt, including
significant bodies such as the ancient universities and other
charitable and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column161" />Column number: 162</div>benevolent institutions. It deserves proper consideration, and
Parliament should have the opportunity to consider it in full. That is
why amendment No. 90 would require an order to be</div>
<a name="06071158000402"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;laid before, and approved by a
resolution of, each House of
Parliament.&#148;</div><a name="06071158000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 91 examines proposed new section 3A(10)(b). It is not so much a
probing amendment as a cautionary one. It is clear that an alternative
is necessary to simply referring to a charity&#146;s gross income
during its previous financial year, because that can sometimes be
misleading. The obvious example is an organisation such as Comic
Relief. In the year of a red nose day, its income is in the tens of
millions; in other years, it is much less. Charities&#146; incomes
rise and fall. Occasionally, they rise and fall for other reasons that
are much less predictable. The classic example for smaller charities
involves legacies. A run of good legacies during a couple of years can
double or quadruple a small charity&#146;s income compared with that
for previous years, but that is not necessarily a guide to subsequent
years&#146; performance, which might be much less.</div>
<a name="06071158000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">The idea that
the commission will reliably be able to estimate a charity&#146;s
likely gross income stretches its powers of prediction. It is often
difficult enough for the charities themselves to predict their income
the following year, for reasons other than legacies. The value of
investments can rise and fall suddenly. One charity with which I was
involved relied heavily on an endowment fund. When the stock
market&#151;I hate to say &#147;crashed&#148; in a
Minister&#146;s presence&#151;experienced a seasonal fluctuation,
the charity&#146;s income dropped unexpectedly.</div>
<a name="06071158000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is a difficult clause. The
Association for Charities included in its dossier an example of the
Charity Commission estimating income quite wrongly in the case of the
Cancer Care Foundation. I am not sure what the alternative is, but I am
sure that the present measures are not a good way forward. I should
like the Minister&#146;s comments on the clause and how practical it
is. However, the alternative might have something to do with being able
to amend the provisions for income in the following
year.</div><a name="06071158000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">I turn to the
Conservative amendments. Amendment No. 21, which would raise the
threshold at which a charity must register from &#163;5,000 to
&#163;10,000, seems laudable. In theory, we all want to lighten the
burden of regulation on small charities, but we are talking about tens
of thousands of charities. Many examples that we have encountered of
less-than-perfect administration pertain to smaller organisations. It
has been mentioned in previous sittings that failure to produce
financial returns might be the first indicator that something more
serious is wrong and might be the precursor to somebody disappearing
with the charity&#146;s money. Such a process leads to loss of
donors&#146; money and public confidence, and ultimately to the
damaging of beneficiaries&#146; interests. So I am not sure that it
is always right to keep raising the threshold to remove more small
charities.</div><a name="06071158000426"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.45

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071158000466"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that although the
percentage of inquiries affecting charities with income of less than
&#163;10,000 is 13.2 per cent., the income of such charities accounts
for only 0.8 per cent 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column162" />Column number: 163</div>of the gross income of charities? We need a sense of proportion. I fear
that the Charity Commission, and charities themselves, are spending
money haring after the possibility that some of that 0.8 per cent. of
income is ill used, despite the fact that smaller charities spend far
less on administration and fundraising than the larger charities do.
The larger charities are probably wasting money but doing so in a
reputable way, whereas the smaller charities, although they may from
time to time lose money, lose a great deal less of
it.</div><a name="06071158000057"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071158000467"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I think that what the hon. Gentleman is talking
about is simply a function of the fact that the largest organisations
generate a much higher percentage of the sector&#146;s entire income.
Two thirds of the sector&#146;s total income is, I believe, generated
by approximately 3,200 organisations, which constitute just 2 per cent.
of the sector. The statistics can be worked any way, but even in
charities that account for only a small percentage of the income, a
well publicised scandal can damage confidence in the whole sector. That
does no good to small or large charities. I am therefore content for
amendment No. 21 to fall, and for the registration amount to remain at
&#163;5,000 for the time being.</div>
<a name="06071158000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have no strong views on
amendments Nos. 161 or 162. It seems desirable for the Secretary of
State to have more flexibility on the time scale in which to raise or
lower the
threshold.</div><a name="06071158000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am puzzled by amendment No. 163. The general tone of the contributions
made by the hon. Member for Isle of Wight is of wanting to avoid red
tape, yet despite exempt charities having regulators and being
scrutinised, the amendment would make them subject to extra regulation
just for the hell of it. They would have to supply their details to the
Charity Commission for inclusion on the register and give the name of
the principal regulator. I therefore oppose that amendment.</div>
<a name="06071158000060"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071158000468"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b> I shall start with amendments Nos. 160 and 163,
which were tabled by the hon. Member for Isle of Wight. I accept the
point made by the hon. Member for Cheltenham that the regulatory burden
of charities should not be increased, and that is why I cannot accept
the amendment. I am sympathetic to the idea of listing exempt charities
that are regulated for charity law purposes by a principal regulator
other than the Charity Commission, if it is possible to do that
non-bureaucratically. It would be even better if there could be a
comprehensive list that included those charities, perhaps with a little
&#147;e&#148; next to them to denote that they were exempt. I do
not know if that is possible, but I shall consider it and talk to the
Charity Commission about it. The powers of investigation of the hon.
Member for Isle of Wight are impressive, but it should be possible to
see a list of exempt charities. I shall revisit that point on Report. I
hope that that satisfies the Committee.</div>
<a name="06071158000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments Nos. 161, 21 and 162
also deal with the threshold. We are sympathetic to the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s deregulatory aims and have said that there will be a
review of all thresholds within a year of the legislation receiving
Royal Assent. The Committee might like to know that, after the Bill is
enacted, there will be a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column163" />Column number: 164</div>number of thresholds in charity law&#151;&#163;5,000,
&#163;10,000, &#163;90,000, &#163;100,000 and
&#163;500,000&#151;that will have different requirements. We want
to have a comprehensive look at such
matters.</div><a name="06071158000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">I take the
hon. Gentleman&#146;s point that, although there has been
consultation on the Bill as a whole, it was not focused specifically on
registration so we should consult on such issues and take into account
the balance. The hon. Gentleman is right. We can think of a charity
with, say, &#163;160,000-worth of capital that might have a 5 per
cent. return&#151;&#163;8,000 of income&#151;but it is not clear
to me that that charity should be outwith the requirement to register.
We shall consult about matters within a year of Royal Assent and I hope
that my reassurance has satisfied him in respect of amendment Nos. 161,
21 and 162.</div><a name="06071158000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
amendment No. 90, unbeknownst to him, the hon. Member for Cheltenham,
has discovered a flaw in the legislation. It suggests that we may only
vary the thresholds after a report has been submitted on the operation
of the Act. We have made a commitment to submit that report within five
years of Royal Assent, so that provision will get in the way of our
ambition to have a review a year after Royal Assent. Thanks to the hon.
Gentleman, we shall be coming back on Report to make good the flaw in
the Bill. I am not sure that we agree with him about the resolution
procedures, but we shall investigate that as part of the wider
subject.</div><a name="06071158000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">I come now to
amendment No. 91 and gross income. It is important to realise that
subsection (10)(a) clearly states that a reference to a
charity&#146;s gross income shall be construed, in relation to a
particular time</div><a name="06071158000403"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;as a
reference to the charity&#146;s gross income in its financial year
immediately preceding that
time&#148;.</div><a name="06071158000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">That will clearly
be the presumption of the Charity Commission. The only purpose of
subsection (10)(b) is to deal with those circumstances in which a
charity has just been set up and we would not want it not to have the
obligation to register for the whole year during its first year of
operation. The provision allows the Charity Commission to say that, on
the basis of the charity&#146;s expected gross income, it will be
subject to a requirement to register. Similarly, if a charity faces
difficult times and its income has dropped precipitously to below the
threshold, it will be removed from the requirement to register on the
basis of its expected gross income. I hope that that explanation has
satisfied the hon.
Gentleman.</div><a name="06071158000066"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071158000469"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> It does not entirely satisfy me. If that is the
purpose behind the clause, perhaps it should say so. The clause gives a
much broader power than
that.</div><a name="06071158000067"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071158000470"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b> I can honestly assure the hon. Gentleman that
the Charity Commission will not ask the 190,000 charities in Great
Britain, &#147;What is your expected gross income? Is it different
from the income in the previous financial year?&#148; The clause will
cater for such circumstances. I hope that he will accept my assurances
in a charitable spirit and not press the amendment to a
Division.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071158000471"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071158000472"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> I wish to probe a little further. The clause seems
to say that, if for whatever reason we do not introduce clause 9, we
can take advantage of some of its benefits by replacing what is in the
Charities Act 1993 about the thresholds for charities that
have neither permanent endowment nor the use or occupation of any land
under section 3(5)(c) or section 3(12) of the Act. I am not sure if the
Parliamentary Secretary is saying that there will be
delays.</div><a name="06071158000073"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071158000473"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b> There is a simple explanation. We have given a
promise, to excepted charities in particular, that clause 9 will not be
fully implemented before October 2007. However, we want to have the
power to raise from &#163;1,000 to &#163;5,000 the general
threshold for the requirement to register before that point. That is
the reason why clause 10 will, in essence, explode once clause 9 is
implemented. That will not be before October 2007 because that is the
promise that has been made to the excepted
charities.</div>
<a name="06071158000074"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071158000474"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for that
explanation. As all explanations do, it generates a few more questions.
Am I correct in understanding that the Minister does not intend to
implement proposed new sections 3, 3A and 3B of the 1993 Act and
therefore that the changes to excepted charities&#151;or indeed to
exempt charities&#151;will not take place until October 2007 but that
he does intend to raise the threshold for small charities? Therefore,
some charities will be affected because they will be excepted. Is that
what he is saying? May I invite the Minister to intervene? If he does
not want to intervene, I will keep
going.</div><a name="06071158000075"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071158000475"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b> The hon. Gentleman is correct. The provisions
relating to excepted and exempt charities will not come into force
before October 2007. Since the charities are excepted up to that point,
they will not be affected by the increase in the general threshold from
&#163;1,000 to &#163;5,000 which will take place before that date.
That is simply to allow us to implement the new regulatory ambitions
that we all share sooner than October
2007.</div><a name="06071158000076"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071158000476"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071158000479"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I am afraid that I have left my copy of the 1993
Act elsewhere, so hon. Members will have to bear with me. Amendment No.
94 is intended to tidy up the messy area of exempt charities&#151;a
matter that I and many in the sector had hoped would be addressed by
the Bill. There are historical anomalies in the list of exempt and
non-exempt charities in the 1993 Act, such as the references to
Winchester and Eton, Oxford, Cambridge, Durham and Queen Mary and
Westfield colleges. Those references are now out of time. It is logical
to replace the specific references with a reference to the universities
and colleges of &#147;England and Wales&#148;, as the amendment
proposes. That would lend complete consistency to the matter of whether
universities are exempt charities.</div>
<a name="06071158000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
95 would extend, on a fair and equitable basis, the special treatment
of the Church Commissioners and institutions administered by them. It
would provide the opportunity for the Privy Council to make an exempt
charity of any Church, religious congregation or institution or group
of institutions through an Order in Council. That may have useful
benefits for the non-established Churches&#151;the Church in Wales
may fall into that category&#151;in respect of which the Bill appears
to impose a registration requirement on far more organisations and
congregations at local level than is the case for the Church of
England. Again, there is a need for consistency and equity, which the
amendment seeks to
address.</div><a name="06071158000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
96 relates to the rather strange clause 11(9), which omits the National
Lottery Charities Board without replacing it with its successor
organisation. I am not clear why the Big Lottery Fund, the successor
organisation, should not be treated in the same way as the National
Lottery Charities Board was. I am looking forward to hearing the
Minister&#146;s comments on that.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column166" />Column number: 167</div><a name="06071158000087"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06071158000480"></a><b class="B">Tom

<a name="06071158000427"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071158000481"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> The hon. Gentleman may be technically correct,
although that does not stop the Big Lottery Fund from having its own
notepaper and status, nor from issuing grants for several years.
Nevertheless, it seems logical for the two Bills to be consistent.
Without a copy to hand I am not sure whether the National Lottery Bill
amends this Bill or the previous Act, but it seems logical&#151;at
least for this legislation&#151;to refer to the institution that we
know will be set up by the time that this Bill becomes law. If the
lawyers are worried about the anomaly it might be just a question of
getting the Royal Assents in the right order.</div>
<a name="06071158000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 97 is in the
spirit of my earlier amendment and would permit alterations to the
exemption of charities to happen only after the relevant statutory
instrument had been laid before each House, and approved by resolution
of each House. It reflects the importance of exempt status and the
significance of that status for the affected
institutions.</div><a name="06071158000090"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071158000482"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> My amendment would omit the provision on page 15
that omits the Church Commissioners. I understand that the reason for
that omission was that nobody could think of anyone to be the
commissioners&#146; principal regulator. I am not sure if that is
true, but the commissioners are quite a respectable body of people.
[<i class="I">Interruption.</i>] Some of them are, anyway. Mr. Speaker is a
Church Commissioner, for example. On the other hand, so are the First
Lord of the Treasury, the Lord Chancellor&#151;if he continues to
exist&#151;the Lord President of the Council, the Secretary of State
for the Home Department, the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and
Sport, the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Archbishop of York, the hon.
Member for Middlesbrough (Sir Stuart Bell), three other right reverend
prelates in another place, and one who is not in the other place, and
someone called Canon P.N.E Bruinvels; some of us have heard of him.
Along with them are a number of luminaries elected by the General
Synod.</div><a name="06071158000091"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06071158000483"></a><b class="B">Peter

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071158000484"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> I am grateful for that confirmation, though it
somewhat undermines parts of my original argument. None the less, the
commissioners are mostly a respectable bunch of people, and I see no
reason why they should be omitted from being an exempt
charity&#151;for all the reasons that the hon. Member for Cheltenham
gave in respect of the church in Wales.</div>
<a name="06071158000093"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071158000485"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b> Let me deal with this clutch of amendments as
briefly as I can. It is a rare occurrence but I think that the hon.
Member for Cheltenham simply misunderstood what amendment No. 94 would
do. So far as we can see, the only effect of it would be to omit the
colleges of Winchester and Eton whose 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column167" />Column number: 168</div>exempt status is removed by the Bill. I know that that is not the
intention of his amendment, but that is the effect.</div>
<a name="06071158000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me
clarify what the clause does on higher education
institutions&#151;the specific issue that he raised. Higher education
institutions, with the exception that I shall describe, will for the
most part remain exempt charities subject to principal regulation by
the Higher Education Funding Council for England. There is a particular
issue around the colleges and halls of Oxford, Cambridge and Durham,
which have no relationship with the HEFCE and which therefore need a
different principal regulator. That regulator will be the Charity
Commission. Had we included that in the Bill, however, it would have
made the Bill a hybrid Bill, which would further have elongated the
process of enacting it. We will therefore make provision for the
colleges and halls of Oxford, Cambridge and Durham to be regulated by
the Charity Commission in secondary legislation. That is the long and
the short of the position on universities. The hon. Gentleman&#146;s
amendment is unnecessary and would not achieve its
purpose.</div><a name="06071158000095"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071158000486"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I am not entirely sure that the Minister is
correct, although I am struggling without a copy of the 1993 Act in
front of me. [<i class="I">Interruption.</i>] I am grateful to the hon. Member
for Isle of
Wight.</div><a name="06071158000096"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071158000487"></a>Peter
Bottomley:</b> On a point of order, Mr. Gale. Is the problem
partly the distinction between the amendment to the Bill or that the
hon. Gentleman may be making an amendment to the 1993
Act?</div><a name="06071158000097"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071158000488"></a>The

is a point of order for the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071158000489"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his
intervention. I am aware that I am amending the schedule under the 1993
Act. The amendment that was tabled was an amendment to schedule 2. I am
sure that that was
intended.</div><a name="06071158000099"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071158000490"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Shall we allow the hon. Gentleman time to gather
his thoughts and perhaps intervene
later?</div><a name="06071158000100"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071158000491"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b> Again in the spirit of good faith, I hope that
the hon. Gentleman accepts my assurances. I spent a long time last
night trying to understand the nature of his amendment. It rather
ruined my night&#146;s sleep. However, having talked to officials
this morning, I concluded that I am indeed correct and that his
amendment is not fit for purpose. It would not achieve what he wants,
apart from in relation to Winchester and Eton, which I am sure he wants
to be regulated by the Charity Commission. I am sure that he does not
want them to be exempt. I have panoply of choices before
me.</div><a name="06071158000101"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071158000492"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> This may be an unfair question, but why would the
omission of the colleges and halls of Oxford, Cambridge and Durham
universities make the Bill a hybrid Bill, whereas the omission of the
colleges of Winchester and Eton would not?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column168" />Column number: 169</div><a name="06071158000102"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071158000493"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b> It is an unfair question, but I shall try to
answer it none the less. I understand that Winchester and Eton are
covered by the Bill on the same footing as other schools, whereas if we
single out the colleges and halls of Oxford, Cambridge and Durham, they
will be put on a different footing from other higher education
institutions. It is necessary to put them on a different footing
because they do not have a relationship with HEFCE, nevertheless it
would make such a measure a hybrid Bill. That takes us to secondary
legislation. Because there will be a discrete class for the purposes of
any order that is made, issues of hybridity will not arise because such
matters will be treated as a distinct class and will not be compared
with other higher education institutions. I hope that I have satisfied
the hon.
Gentleman.</div><a name="06071158000103"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071158000494"></a>Peter

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071158000495"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b> That was definitely an unfair question. Yes, the
hon. Member for Worthing, West is correct. I hope that I have

94.</div><a name="06071158000105"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071158000496"></a>Tom
Levitt:</b> I am grateful to the Parliamentary Secretary for
the extreme clarity that he has brought to this discussion and his
confirmation that universities will remain exempt charities under the
1993 Act. Are there implications for the National Union of Students?
Can it qualify for charitable status in some form or another? I know
that several hon. Members have expressed interest in
that.</div><a name="06071158000106"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071158000497"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b> My hon. Friend asks an important question.
Whatever their views on the National Union of Students, it may surprise
some Opposition Members to learn that it currently has charitable
status. The matter has been tested in the courts and we expect that the
National Union of Students will continue to enjoy charitable
status.</div><a name="06071158000107"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071158000498"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> Now that I have gathered my thoughts on the
amendment, the proposal would create exemption for all the universities
of England and Wales, including those of Oxford and Cambridge, but that
does not extend to the colleges and halls, which are not universities
and are separate legal institutions. Can the Minister clarify who the
regulator is of the universities of Oxford and Cambridge, as opposed to
the colleges and halls which form parts of those universities and are
legally separate bodies? I will then accept his reassurances on that
amendment.</div><a name="06071158000108"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071158000499"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b> That is not so much an unfair question as an
incomprehensible one. To the extent that I understand the question, my
answer is&#151;if I may say so, I think that the hon. Gentleman
misunderstands the 1993 Charities Act&#151;that the universities of
England and Wales currently enjoy exempt status. What will change as a
result of the Bill is that we will bring in a principal regulator,
HEFCE for the most part, which will regulate them for the purposes of
charity law.</div>
<a name="06071158000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">Whatever the
nature of his ambitions for his amendment, I can assure him that it is
not fit for purpose. The 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column169" />Column number: 170</div>universities of Oxford and Cambridge have a relationship with HEFCE and
will be regulated by HEFCE as their principal regulator. I hope that he
is satisfied with that and that I can move on to amendment
No.95.</div><a name="06071158000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.95
also stands in the name of the hon. Member for Cheltenham. Although it
is meaningful, I confess that I do not understand why he wants to do
it. It would allow an Order in Council to be made to declare an
exemption for Churches and other religious organisations and make them
exempt charities. At a time that we are driving to increase the
accountability of other exempt charities, I cannot understand why he
wants to do it.</div> <a name="06071158000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
amendment No.95, I do not understand why he thinks that the Privy
Council is an appropriate body to make those decisions. Does he want to
give that power to Ministers anyway? I do not understand why he wants
to give exempt status to
Churches.</div><a name="06071158000112"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071158000500"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b><b class="B"> </b>I am content with the intention of the
Bill to bring Churches out of exempt status and under the registration
of the commission. However, there are specific examples&#151;I
mentioned the Church in Wales&#151;where that is not having the
intended effect and is adding a level of bureaucracy to local,
parochial Church Councils that does not apply to the Church of England
purely because of their different institutional
status.</div><a name="06071158000113"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071158000501"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b> I may be able to look into that. My
understanding is that many Churches will have excepted status. The
provisions under the Bill mean that only those excepted charities, with
incomes over &#163;100,000, will be required to register. I hope that
those particular circumstances, which I am happy to look into, will be
catered for by that.</div>
<a name="06071158000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is convenient to deal with
the matter of amendment No.165 in this context because it is about the
Church Commissioners. I agree with what the hon. Member for Isle of
Wight says about the Church Commissioners and, for the most part, that
it is an august body. Again, I am not entirely convinced that the
amendment is
necessary.</div><a name="06071158000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Church
Commissioners will now be regulated by the Charity Commission. We have
had discussions with the Church Commissioners. They had some concerns.
Those concerns have been satisfied. Good order will prevail. They will
be able to continue with their work. Therefore, I am not completely
convinced that this amendment is necessary.</div>
<a name="06071158000116"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071158000502"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> The responsibility of the principal regulator to
an exempt charity is different from the responsibility of the Charity
Commission to a non-exempt charity. The commission&#146;s
responsibilities are set out in section 7 on page 5, new section 1B of
the 1993 Act and include five objectives. The principal regulator of an
exempt charity has only one comparable objective, which is that of
compliance. Therefore, he is introducing a greater level of regulation
in to those charities that cease to be exempt, than would otherwise be
the
case.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071158000503"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b> That may be correct&#151;a charity does cease
to be exempt. However, it is part of the wider discussion on the level
of obligations that charities face, whether it be the Church
Commissioners or other charities. I do not understand why the powers
that the Charity Commission will have in relation to the Church
Commissioners, which will be on a level footing with the powers that
they have in relation to other charities, will be particularly onerous.
As we shall be discussing, the Charity Commission also has powers in
relation to exempt charities, though subject to its relationship with
the principal regulator. I hope that that satisfies the hon.
Gentleman.</div><a name="06071158000118"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071158000504"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> I accept that it is an explanation. What I am
concerned about, however, is how many organisations will cease to be
exempt as a result of clause
11(7).</div><a name="06071158000119"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071158000505"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b> I suggest that I write to the hon. Gentleman
with a list. Let me briefly explain the process. In seeking a level
playing field so that there would no longer be exempt charities that
were not subject to regulation save for charity law purposes, the
Government sought in all circumstances to find a regulator&#151;other
than the Charity Commission&#151;which would be an existing regulator
having a relationship with the charity concerned. In a number of cases
it proved impossible, after discussion with the relevant charities, to
find a suitable regulator other than the Charity Commission. The
default position was therefore to move to the Charity Commission. I am
happy to send the hon. Gentleman a list of the organisations that will
now be regulated by the Charity Commission. I hope that that is
satisfactory.</div><a name="06071158000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 96 concerns the National Lottery Charities Board and was tabled by
the hon. Member for Cheltenham. The hon. Gentleman is correct that the
National Lottery Charities Board is an exempt charity. It is being
abolished and will be replaced by the Big Lottery Fund, which will not
be a charity. That is to do with the way in which the Big Lottery Fund
is being established. I believe that it is a company limited by
guarantee.</div><a name="06071158000121"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071158000506"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> We have established at length, and we may do so
further later on today, that being a company limited by guarantee does
not exclude one from charitable status.</div>
<a name="06071158000122"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071158000507"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b> Indeed. I am not an expert on the Big Lottery
Fund, though the hon. Gentleman might be. However, it will not be a
charity and it is not the intention that it be a charity. The point
therefore does not arise. The hon. Gentleman may not have had it in
mind when we tabled his amendment, but it turns out that we are
removing the National Lottery Charities Board from the list of exempt
charities in the National Lottery Bill which is currently before the
House of Lords. That is being dealt with in that Bill, so I suspect
that we shall in any case need to table an amendment for the purposes
of tidying up of the process.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column171" />Column number: 172</div><a name="06071158000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the amendment that concerns
affirmative and negative resolutions, I repeat what I have said before.
The Committees of both the House of Commons and the House of Lords have
examined the matter and are satisfied with the procedures that the
Government propose, so I hope that the amendment will be
withdrawn.</div><a name="06071158000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, I
believe that I misspoke when I said that the National Union of Students
is itself charitable. The key point is that student unions are
charitable but the NUS itself is not necessarily so. I can see some
relief about that on the faces of hon. Gentlemen
opposite.</div><a name="06071158000125"></a>

Bottomley:</b> May I follow on from what the Parliamentary
Secretary said rather than attempt a debate that the clause stand part?
He mentioned various powers&#151;I refer here to not to groups of
charities but to individual ones. Does the Minister have the power
under subsection 12(b) to help officially change the name of a charity?
For example, if Queen Mary and Westfield College drops the &#147;and
Westfield&#148; part of its name legally, as well as in common
usage&#151;it is now called Queen Mary College, but I am not sure
whether it has changed its name officially&#151;will the Minister be
able to update matters by order? If not, might I suggest that he
consult with people to consider how it can be done in some other way?
For a college to change its name and have to be deregistered and
re-registered as a new one would be hard way in which to go about
things. That might be something that the hon. Gentleman will consider
later. I do not want a response
straightaway.</div><a name="06071158000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">As for
the Welsh Church, it will be interesting to know whether the
Parliamentary Secretary has consulted or will consult with its main

assurances that have been given will work in

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071158000509"></a>Edward

Ministers can change the name of charities, but charities can do so in
consultation with the Charity Commission. We are coming to some clauses
that deal with those

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071158000510"></a>Peter

the Minister has said, but I hope that we have explored the issues
surrounding the amendments in sufficient detail for him now to consult
further on the implications of some aspects of the Bill, especially the
Big Lottery Fund. It strikes me as surprising that it will not have
charitable status. It seems a slightly unhealthy sign that its focus is
moving even further away from funding charities as the National Lottery
Charities Board did. I raised that worry when we were debating the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071158000515"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> We tabled the amendment because the Bill expands
the power of the commission to act for the protection of exempt
charities. That sounds wise, but given our discussion on the exempt
status of universities any power to expand the rights of any body,
including the Charity Commission, over our universities is a major step
and should not pass without debate. Currently, following the
institution of a section 8 inquiry the commission may suspend any
trustee, officer, agent or employee of the charity, order any debtor of
the charity not to pay the debts or appoint receivers and
managers.</div><a name="06071158000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are
familiar with that in terms of the rights of registered charities. They
have become used to such powers and the Bill deals with many of their
worries about the Charity Commission exercising such extensive powers
over them. However, it is new for those powers to have been acquired
quietly over the aforementioned universities of Oxford, Cambridge and
those throughout the rest of the country. In effect, that would give
power to the Charity Commission to remove Oxford dons from their posts.
That would be a major step and one that should not pass without full
debate. I shall be grateful if the Parliamentary Secretary can reassure
us that that is not the case. I cannot see how the
powers of the commission could be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column173" />Column number: 174</div>extended to exempt charities as set out in the Bill and for that not to
apply. That is the reason behind amendment No.
98.</div><a name="06071158000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 99 and the other amendments tabled by the Liberal Democrats deal
with some of the uncertainties under the Bill about who is regulated by
whom. Parts of the 1993 Act refer to the commission in respect of
regulatory functions, but it is not explicitly pointed out exactly how
many of the powers extend to other principal regulators in relation to
exempt charities. That is what amendment No. 99 addresses. The
intention is to make it clear that references to the commission, in
terms of the regulatory powers, also mean the principal regulators, as
defined elsewhere in the Act. In other words, the amendment would make
it clear that the regulatory powers that pertain to the commission in
relation to non-exempt charities also pertain to principal regulators
in relation to exempt charities.</div>
<a name="06071158000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 92 addresses the
ability of the Secretary of State to decide who the principal regulator
is for various exempt charities. The Bill gives him that power by
regulation, and our amendment would take that power away. That connects
with amendment No. 93; we assume that if no other regulator
exists, the regulator will be the Privy Council. We tried to work out
who was the current regulator of the Oxbridge colleges and halls, and
it seems to be the Privy Council. Amendment No. 93 provides for the
eventuality of the Minister and his advisers missing out a body, in
terms of appointing a principal regulator. It leaves the Privy Council
as the fall-back position, as we believe that it is the regulator in
the case of one particular group of colleges and
halls.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071158000516"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> We are examining a particularly important change
to the way in which universities are regulated. I am completely
astonished that universities that have lain on their backs with their
feet in the air and have allowed themselves to be regulated even more
by HEFCE. Anyone who remembers the huge row that took place in the
1990s, when the University Grants Committee was abolished and replaced
by HEFCE, will be amazed that universities got so wimpish and so
incapable of opposing. They are now so incapable of protecting their
position that the hon. Member for Cheltenham is absolutely correct when
he says that it is possible for the occupant of a teaching post paid
for by the university to be removed at the instigation of HEFCE. In
those circumstances, one wonders how long university dons can keep the
protection of free
speech.</div><a name="06071158000146"></a>

universities at the time of the abolition of the University Grants
Committee. Will someone make a complaint against a university lecturer,
saying that he erred in some direction or
other&#151;<i class="I">[Interruption.] </i>The Minister refers to charities,
but for the moment universities are exempt; they do not have a
regulator because they are trusted to regulate themselves. We are
imposing a new level of regulation. We can quite understand that those
who research controversial subjects, such as vivisection, embryology or
weaponry, may find repeated complaints being made against them to the
Charity Commission or to HEFCE.</div>

Miliband:</b> I have the utmost respect for the hon.
Gentleman, and he has made many coherent arguments during Committee,
but this is not one of them. We are talking about regulation for the
purposes of charitable law. The idea that a don teaching a
controversial subject would be slung out of his post because the
institution was not within the confines of charitable law is simply
fantastic and wrong.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071158000520"></a>Mr.

Oxford because it knew no argument but force and Cambridge knew no
force but argument. He was trying to remove dons from the university
because they were peddling theories with which he was not happy. In
short, I have a great deal of sympathy with amendment No.98 and I am
horrified that the universities have been so
wet.</div><a name="06071158000429"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.30
am</div><a name="06071158000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
105 is a probing amendment that fulfils the same function as amendment
No. 99, which is to find out whether the responsibilities of the
principal regulator are the same as those of the Charity Commission. If
they are not, we are not creating the level playing
field&#151;equivalent regulation for all charities&#151;which the
Minister says is the whole purpose of the Bill. An increasing number of
exempt charities are bodies that are the creatures of Government, yet
the principal regulator has only one objective in respect of those
institutions whereas the Charity Commission has five objectives in
respect of all other charities. The Minister must explain why the level
of regulation of exempt charities is less when one of the purposes of
the Bill is to create a level playing field. If he is saying that the
regulation will be exactly the same, at least that is consistent with
the purposes of the
Bill.</div><a name="06071158000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 22
is an attempt to deal with what I consider too broad a provision in
clause 13 which, put simply, allows the Minister to amend the list of
principal regulators and to make amendments subsequent to the enactment
of the legislation which would change the powers of the principal
regulator. Whether the powers are as I fear that they are, or they are
as I suspect the Minister believes they are, there is no need for him
to have the power to amend
them.</div><a name="06071158000152"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071158000521"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b> I think that we are getting hot under the collar
about the idea of Oxford dons being sacked without any good reason at
all. Let me try and explain why that is the case.</div>
<a name="06071158000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">All the universities are
required to follow charity law. However, they are not monitored in that
respect. The Bill would introduce proper monitoring of the way in which
universities and other institutions follow charitable law. That is the
context in which we have to understand the amendments and the
clause.</div> <a name="06071158000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me say
something about the relationship between the principal regulator where
that is not the Charity Commission, and the Charity Commission. It is
fair to say that the situation is complicated and it is difficult to
get the arrangements right. The principal regulator where that is not
the Charity Commission, such as HEFCE or the Department for Culture,
Media and Sport in relation to some museums and galleries, will be
responsible for monitoring compliance with charity law. What happens if
the principal regulator believes that there is a problem in the
charity? It is for the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column175" />Column number: 176</div>principal regulator to say to the Charity Commission that, for example,
an inquiry into the charity is needed. The Charity Commission then has
all the powers at its disposal that it would have in relation to other
charities to inquire into what is happening in the charity. The purpose
of amendment No. 98 is to disapply those powers of the Charity
Commission, but that would not be sensible because it would create the
unlevel playing field about which the hon. Member for Isle of Wight is
worried and which is implied by the amendment tabled by the hon. Member
for Cheltenham.</div> <a name="06071158000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
then for the Charity Commission to conduct its investigations and to
reach conclusions. What happens to those conclusions? Under the Bill as
it stands, the Charity Commission can implement changes as it would
implement in the case of any other charity, with one proviso.
I draw the Committee&#146;s attention to clause 14 which
states:</div><a name="06071158000404"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Before
exercising in relation to an exempt charity any specific power
exercisable by it in relation to the charity, the Commission must
consult the charity&#146;s principal
regulator.&#148;</div><a name="06071158000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">If I may be
so bold, I suggest that the useful discussion for us to have is of
whether the requirement for the commission to consult the
charity&#146;s principal regulator is a sufficient
safeguard.</div>
<a name="06071158000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the Bill
stands, the principal regulator where that is not the
commission&#151;HEFCE, in the case that we have been
discussing&#151;is in the driving seat of monitoring compliance with
charity law. When HEFCE feels that an inquiry is necessary, it goes to
the Charity Commission and says so. The Charity Commission then reaches
conclusions, but before it can implement them, it must consult the
principal regulator. I have not been asked to do so, but because I am a
generous soul and we need the best Bill possible, I will consider
whether consultation between the commission and the principal regulator
is a sufficient safeguard. Although that is not what hon. Members were
complaining about, I think that it is the most important
aspect.</div><a name="06071158000158"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06071158000522"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Peter Bone</b> (Wellingborough) (Con): I am following what the
Minister says exactly. If the principal regulator thinks that something
is wrong, it refers the matter to the Charity Commission, which
investigates, and at present when it reaches a conclusion it only has
to consult the principal regulator. Is he suggesting that the principal
regulator should have a veto over what the Charity Commission says?
What happens if the commission says, &#147;We have investigated this,
and this is what&#146;s happened, but we don&#146;t think any
action should be taken,&#148; but the principal regulator thinks that
it
should?</div><a name="06071158000159"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071158000523"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b> I do not think that a veto would be appropriate.
The precise reason why we are giving the Charity Commission such powers
in relation to exempt charities is that it has the expertise to work
out what is happening in a charity, and it can do so only if it is
commissioned to do so by the principal regulator. In addition, any
decision that the commission makes is appealable by the charity
concerned to our old friend the charity tribunal. However, I will
consider whether the relationship between the commission and the
principal regulator is a sufficient safeguard. I hope that that
explains the background to the clauses that we are discussing and
provides some reassurance on the amendments.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column176" />Column number: 177</div><a name="06071158000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not think that amendment
No. 98, which was tabled by the hon. Member for Cheltenham, is
sensible, because it would remove from the Charity Commission powers
relating to exempt charities that might be considered necessary by the
principal regulator when it believes that there is a problem with that
charity and that the Charity Commission should exercise its powers. I
hope that on that basis, and in the spirit of achieving a level playing
field, he will feel able to withdraw his
amendment.</div><a name="06071158000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 99 it not sensible, either. We cannot give two different
organisations the same powers over the same charities; that would make
for a terrible mess. The amendment would move the powers listed in
schedule 5 from the commission to the principal regulator. The problem
is that the commission will be best able to inquire into and will have
the expertise and resources to work out what is going wrong in a
charity, when there is something going wrong, and to put it right. If
it is the principal regulator that is to decide to put the commission
in control, it is hard to say that the powers to take action should lie
with the principal regulator rather than the commission. None the less,
as I said, I think that we need to probe whether the
commission&#146;s relationship with the principal regulator is
correctly drawn to provide the regulator with sufficient safeguards
over what the commission does. I shall return on Report with the
answer.</div><a name="06071158000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not sure
whether amendments Nos. 92 and 93, which also stand in the name of the
hon. Member for Cheltenham, are wise. Amendment No. 92 would remove the
Secretary of State&#146;s power to prescribe a principal regulator. I
am not sure who would prescribe the principle regulator if the
amendment were made, and in fact I fear that the amendment would have
no effect, because elsewhere the Bill provides that references to
regulations are normally to regulations made by the Secretary of State.
It is right to provide that the Secretary of State should be able to
say who the principal regulator for an exempt charity should be. I hope
that the hon. Gentleman will not press the
amendment.</div><a name="06071158000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 93 is about the Privy Council, which I do not think is an
appropriate body, even as a backstop, for regulating.
<i class="I">[Interruption.]</i> My right hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff,
South and Penarth (Alun Michael) clearly does not want the
responsibility. The Privy Council is an august body. I take the point
that we need to ensure that principal regulators are set out for all
the different exempt institutions, but giving the power to the Privy
Council, which advises Her Majesty, is not
appropriate.</div>

we have all demonstrated that this is a very complicated field. The
niceties of who regulates whom are not always clear, nor are they set

would be the principal regulator, if not the Privy

arise; I am sure that they will not, given the assiduousness of our
officials.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column177" />Column number: 178</div><a name="06071158000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 105 falls prey to
the problem that I mentioned earlier: it would give dual powers to the
Charity Commission and the principal regulator. However, it would not
be sensible for two bodies to have the same powers over the same
institution.</div> <a name="06071158000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
amendment No. 22 deals with Ministers&#146; ability to amend
enactments. Essentially, that is to ensure that principal regulators
can properly secure their functions. I should say to the hon. Member
for Isle of Wight that clause 13(3) states that</div>
<a name="06071158000405"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The compliance
objective is to increase compliance by the charity trustees with their
legal obligations in exercising control and management of the
administration of the
charity.&#148;</div><a name="06071158000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is now a
job for the principal regulator. The part of the clause that the hon.
Gentleman seeks to amend would simply ensure that if a principal
regulator does not feel that it has the powers in statute to carry out
those functions, we can make a technical amendment to allow it to have
the powers set out in clause 13(3) so that it can promote compliance by
the charity trustees with their legal obligations. I hope that, on that
basis, the hon. Gentleman is
satisfied.</div><a name="06071158000169"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071158000526"></a>Peter
Bottomley:</b> Will the Minister consider adding the words
&#147;at the request of the regulating authority&#148;? I am not
suggesting that the Government intend to have a coach and horses
enactment, but the provision would give the Minister the power to make
any change to any enactment, as long as it could somehow be hooked to a
regulation. I ask the Minister to reflect on whether some limitation
would be helpful.</div>
<a name="06071158000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 13(1) reminds us that a
Minister of the Crown can be</div>
<a name="06071158000406"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the principal regulator in
relation to an exempt
charity.&#148;</div><a name="06071158000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will the
Minister remind us of one or two of the exempt charities for which a
Minister could be a
regulator?</div><a name="06071158000172"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071158000527"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b> As always, the hon. Gentleman makes sensible
points. I shall take the first one away and consider it.</div>
<a name="06071158000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Gentleman mentioned
Ministers of the Crown. I do not think that I would be the principal
regulator in relation to an exempt charity&#151;at least I hope not.
However, I shall give the Committee some examples, as the hon.
Gentleman makes a fair point. The Qualifications and Curriculum
Authority will be the responsibility of the Department for Education
and Skills. A number of museums will be the responsibility of the
Department for Culture, Media and Sport. The Royal Botanic gardens at
Kew will be the responsibility of Ministers at the Department for
Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. That generally covers the main
areas where Ministers of the Crown will be
involved.</div><a name="06071158000174"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071158000528"></a>Peter
Bottomley:</b> It might be perfectly obvious&#151;if so, I
have not found the right place in the Bill&#151;but does that cover
charities in England and Wales? What about charities that operate in
other parts of the United Kingdom? Is there cross-regulation, duplicate
regulation or a lack of regulation?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column178" />Column number: 179</div><a name="06071158000175"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071158000529"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b> Separate legislation was passed for Scotland in
2005, and charities there will be covered by that
legislation.</div><a name="06071158000176"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071158000530"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> The Minister has made many reasonable statements;
he is indeed a generous soul and a reasonable person. He has provided
reasonable explanations for each part of the schedule that the
amendments would change. The amendments would extend the powers of
regulators to protect exempt charities. It seems to me that a dangerous
combination of reasonable steps could still lead to an unreasonable
outcome. I do not say that there is anything of James II about the
Minister, but we have to allow for unreasonable successors or
unreasonable Governments taking advantage of legislation. The very
purpose of legislation to secure the liberties of bodies such as
academic bodies which are a critical part of our democracy. As the hon.
Member for Isle of Wight pointed out, their liberties are extremely
important.</div> <a name="06071158000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister says that bodies such as the Higher Education Funding Council
and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport may refer institutions
that may have a problem under charitable law to the Charity Commission,
which will then institute an inquiry. He implied that the commission
already had the power to do that. He may intervene on me if I am
mistaken, but I believe that section 18 of the 1993 Act does not apply
to exempt charities. The specific power to intervene and to suspend a
trustee, officer, agent or employee of the charity&#151;it is a very
broad power&#151;did not previously apply to universities. A major
step is being taken, which I want to
remove.</div>
<a name="06071158000178"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071158000531"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b> I said that such bodies previously had to comply
with charity law, but that they were not monitored. I agree that the
powers are new. I am sorry to have to ask the hon. Gentleman to be
consistent, but consistency is important. Why should such charities not
have to comply with the principles of charity law and have the same
powers exercised over them if they do not comply as other charities? It
takes us back to the NSPCC-Eton issue. Surely, if provision good enough
for the NSPCC, it is good enough for our
universities.</div>
<a name="06071158000179"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071158000532"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I am grateful to the Minister. I shall return to
the matter of level playing fields. I am not sure that the Bill sets
out a level playing field for all charities. It certainly sets out
different playing fields, and the logic of exempt status is that some
bodies should have a different playing field.</div>
<a name="06071158000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">It seems to me that if a good
rationale can be advanced for treating a body differently, it should be
treated differently. The academic freedom of our universities is
important and needs to be defended. The Minister has conceded that the
potentially draconian powers of section 18 of the 1993 Act did not
apply previously to universities but that they will do so under the
Bill unless the amendments are accepted.</div>
<a name="06071158000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the
Association for Charities has pointed out, the Charity
Commission&#146;s reputation among charities suggests that sometimes
the powers can be used, if not abused, to an extent that can be
upsetting or distressing and even unfair to many of the participants in
charities; indeed, it may cause real grievances to arise. For the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column179" />Column number: 180</div>Government to step into that territory with our
great universities seems a brave thing to do.</div>
<a name="06071158000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
universities are of course subject to charity law at the moment.
Processes are available through the courts to anybody to force their
compliance with charity law, but not to remove dons from academic
posts. The regulator for the Oxford and Cambridge colleges will be the
Charity Commission, not the Higher Education Funding Council for
England. We are talking about the Charity Commission
not&#151;according to the Minister&#146;s description&#151;having
the expertise to step in and look into the administration of charities,
but having the expertise to rule on whether an Oxford or Cambridge
college is complying with charity law.</div>
<a name="06071158000183"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071158000533"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b> I do not know where the hon. Gentleman went to
university&#151;his defence of Oxford and Cambridge colleges is
incredibly passionate&#151;but the proposals are not about removing
dons from posts. They are about trustees fulfilling the purposes of the
charity and complying with charity law.</div>
<a name="06071158000184"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071158000534"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> The Minister is quite wrong. The phrase is
a</div><a name="06071158000407"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;trustee, officer,
agent or employee&#148;.</div><a name="06071158000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
not simply a trustee who can be
removed.</div><a name="06071158000186"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071158000535"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b> In relation to charity
law.</div><a name="06071158000187"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071158000536"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> It may or may not be in relation to charity law,
but the provision still extends that explicit power to Ministers in a
way that was not there before. If we have mixed confidence in the
Charity Commission&#146;s ability to intervene in charities in the
voluntary sector, giving it the power to intervene in colleges will
stretch that confidence to breaking point. There is also a concern
about a level playing
field.</div><a name="06071158000188"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071158000537"></a>Peter
Bottomley:</b> Perhaps the hon. Gentleman could consider the
issue the other way round. Instead of someone trying to require a
university or college to do something with a member of its staff, is it
not more likely that a university or college might have disciplined or
dismissed a member of staff for reasons that somebody else&#151;or
even the person concerned&#151;regarded as wrong and in need of
challenge, upon which that person, whether the outsider or the insider,
would go to the Charity Commission and say, &#147;Will you please
investigate?&#148; That is a far more likely occurrence, to which the
answer from the Charity Commission or regulating authority would
normally be, &#147;That&#146;s an internal affair and it has no
charitable effect.&#148; Is that what the hon. Gentleman is worried
about?</div><a name="06071158000189"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071158000538"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman, but I am not
sure that that is exactly what I am worried about. As the Minister
pointed out, a relevant case would have to relate overtly to charity
law, but it is not entirely clear how a particular appointment would
apply in that sense.</div>
<a name="06071158000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is an issue concerning a
level playing field. Having an exempt status and different regulators
who can regulate with expertise that is appropriate to particular
bodies does not necessarily provide a level playing field, but it does
at least provide different playing fields for different areas of the
new charity law. The logic of that is that those new regulators should
not have inappropriate powers. However, the powers 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column180" />Column number: 181</div>given to the Charity Commission in relation to the colleges of the
ancient universities is not appropriate. I shall therefore not withdraw
the amendment.</div>
<a name="06071158000191"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071158000539"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> The Minister repeatedly asserts that the
provisions are for the purposes of charity law but the problem is that,
for purposes of charity law, the commission or HEFCE can intervene to
require an institute to balance its books, for example, which means
cutting staff. The commission or HEFCE might say, &#147;Well, if you
don&#146;t cut staff, we will&#151;and these are the areas where we
will cut
them.&#148;</div><a name="06071158000192"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071158000540"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b> That is
ridiculous.</div><a name="06071158000193"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071158000541"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> It is all very well for the Minister to say that,
but if we give powers to organisations without properly constraining
them, they will use those powers. They might not intend to use those
powers malevolently, but they will use
them.</div><a name="06071158000194"></a>

imagine circumstances, such as those that have previously existed with
registered charities, where campaigning activities or publications that

dangerous by the Charity Commission and where, on the precedent of my

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071158000558"></a>Helen
Goodman:</b> May I say how nice it is to see you in the Chair
this morning, Mr. Gale? I shall speak to amendment Nos. 134 to 136,
which are in my
name.</div><a name="06071158000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clauses 15 to
18&#151;the cy-près clauses&#151;refer to the practice in
the charitable sector of having restricted and unrestricted funds. The
distinction between restricted and unrestricted funds has a significant
advantage, in that it often makes it easier for charities to raise
money for particular pieces of work or causes. However, it can also be
difficult to manage the restricted funds. They can be rather inflexible
and, because of how the Bill is set out, they will continue to be too
bureaucratic.</div> <a name="06071158000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall
give two examples of problems that I have seen arising from the
treatment of such funds. The first is one that I referred to the other
day&#151;what I call the Leicestershire cobblers&#146; sons
problem&#151;in which money was given for a charitable purpose many
years ago, but the need is no longer there. That is what is referred to
in proposed new section 13(1A)(b) of the 1993 Act, which deals with
cases in which</div> <a name="06071158000410"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
social and economic circumstances prevailing at the time of the
proposed alteration of the original purposes&#148;</div>
<a name="06071158000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">have changed. In that instance, we need
flexibility to spend the money on other

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071158000559"></a>Mr.

gift&#148;</div><a name="06071158000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">would cover many
types of other work, such as Leicestershire poor artisans, or
Leicestershire people who work in the footwear industry. How broadly
would she be prepared to interpret paragraph

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071158000560"></a>Helen
Goodman:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes my point. If he will be
a little more patient, I shall come on to that.</div>
<a name="06071158000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I say, one set of
circumstances is where a gift was given a long time ago on a very
narrow definition that no longer applies. The other set of
circumstances in which there may be restricted funds that are now
difficult to use is where money was raised for a particular piece of
work and that piece of work has been completed, but it was not as
expensive as anticipated, so some of the restricted funds
remain.</div>
<a name="06071158000430"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12
pm</div><a name="06071158000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">I must
apologise, Mr. Gale, as my spidery handwriting was slightly
misinterpreted. In fact, I intended that amendment No. 134 should read
&#147;when the work for which the gift was made has already been
completed&#148;, not</div>
<a name="06071158000412"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;whether or not the work for which
the gift was made has already been
completed.&#148;</div><a name="06071158000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the cases
where the restriction is so tight that the money can no longer be used
for the purpose for which it was originally intended, money is sitting
in the bank. That is obviously wasteful and it sometimes means that
voluntary sector organisations raise extra money to do new pieces of
work that they would not need to raise if they had greater
flexibility.</div>

take account of the legitimate concern that she has
raised.</div>
<a name="06071158000235"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071158000562"></a>Helen
Goodman:</b> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that
reassurance.</div> <a name="06071158000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want
to move on to amendments Nos. 136 and 135. Amendment No. 136 is an
alternative way of implementing amendment No. 135, which hon. Members
might find easier to understand. In amendment No. 135, I suggest that
when the amount of money left is &#163;5,000 or less, it should not
be necessary for the charity to go to the Charity Commission to lift
the restrictions on the funds. The amendment contains a further
provision so that that applies only to large charities with assets of
more than &#163;100,000. That is because if it was a small charity
and we gave the trustees complete flexibility to change the purposes
for which the money could be used, we would change the whole work of
the organisation. The measure is largely designed to help medium and
larger charities to run their affairs more
efficiently.</div><a name="06071158000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to
anticipate some of the criticisms that could be made. One could be that
people might have given money for one thing that could then be used for
anything else, but, of course, that is not true because it will be used
by a charity with clearly laid out objectives. To address in part the
point made by the hon. Member for Isle of Wight, money for
Leicestershire cobbler&#146;s 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column183" />Column number: 184</div>sons would not be spent on horticulture or animals.
It would be spent, if possible, on other work with children in
Leicestershire, for example.</div>
<a name="06071158000238"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071158000563"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> I am not sure why the hon. Lady distinguishes
between a large and a small charity. With a small amount of
money&#151;less than &#163;5,000&#151;the measure should apply
across the board rather than distinctly in favour of a large or
medium-sized charity.
</div><a name="06071158000239"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071158000564"></a>Helen
Goodman:</b> That would be a more liberal interpretation. I
made the distinction because I felt that a large charity would have
more scope to shift the money to other similar work than a small
charity, where a shift could change the nature of the organisation in
toto.</div> <a name="06071158000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another point
that has since been made to me is that some later clauses, such as
clause 41 and those around it, deal with some of the small charity
issues. My main objective is to reduce bureaucracy. We spoke about that
last week. Rather than giving the Charity Commission a general
objective to reduce bureaucracy, what we should have done as we went
through the legislation, was to look at particular instances in which
we were imposing a bureaucratic burden. We expect trustees to behave in
a responsible way. We put various obligations on them and we should
treat them like adults. The notion that someone sitting in the Charity
Commission 300 miles away, should be second-guessing the ways in which
small packets of money are used seems to be totally out of
time.</div> <a name="06071158000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would like to
draw an article to the attention of hon. Members, on the front page of
this morning&#146;s <i class="I">Financial Times </i>with the headline,<i class="I">
</i>&#147;Call to use dormant bank funds for charity: Treasury backs
report on putting millions to use.&#148; The article
begins:</div><a name="06071158000416"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Ambitious
plans for a new financial institution to take over and invest the
hundreds of millions of pounds lying unclaimed in British bank and
building society accounts will be set out tomorrow in a
Treasury-sponsored
report.&#148;</div><a name="06071158000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">and so it goes
on. If the Government are considering transferring money that was never
given for any purpose, which totals several hundreds of millions of
pounds, we should consider sympathetically shifting small amounts of
money within charities and that is the purpose of those
amendments.</div><a name="06071158000243"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071158000565"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I am extremely sympathetic to the instincts
behind those amendments. With some reassurances from the Minister, I
would be content to support them. There is the classic example, which
applies to large rather than small charities, of tightly drawn
emergency appeals.</div>
<a name="06071158000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">The rehousing of Bangladeshi
flood victims was the classic and often quoted example at Oxfam. It was
an enormously popular appeal that raised huge amounts of money across a
number of different charitable organisations both in the UK and
internationally. In due course, all the victims were rehoused, but
millions of pounds remained for that specific purpose. The charities
were in the ludicrous position of having to wait for another flood to
be able to apply those funds. It is not clear that the existing
legislation, which refers to matters such as social and economic
circumstances, allows those emergency charities to have that let-out.
Therefore, the hon. Lady&#146;s amendment may be
necessary.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071158000566"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b> I will deal with my hon. Friend&#146;s
amendment in my remarks. Briefly, clause 17 is designed precisely to
respond to the circumstances that the hon. Gentleman raised in which
cy-près can be applied to gifts made in response to certain
solicitations. Therefore, it marks significant progress in relation to
the specific case that he raised and the worries that he has. I hope
that he recognises
that.</div><a name="06071158000246"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071158000567"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I am grateful for the Minister&#146;s
intervention, and my subsequent amendments also relate to clause 17.
However, I am not entirely sure that he is quite right. The principle
of cy-près would still require the deviation from the original
charity purpose under current law to be reasonably close.</div>
<a name="06071158000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the appeal had specifically
mentioned a particular country, it would have been difficult for that
appeal money to be directed to another country, which would have been
necessary in the Bangladesh case. Therefore, the Minister should look
kindly on the amendment because it addresses a dimension of flexibility
that is desirable in law and that would not otherwise be there.
</div><a name="06071158000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">My only reservation
with the hon. Lady&#146;s amendments is that we need to tread
carefully&#151;with respect to both small charities as well as large
ones&#151;to preserve donors&#146; as well as charities&#146;
rights. It is important that donors are confident that their donations
are applied to the purposes for which they give them. If a charity
chooses to invite donations to what is in effect a restricted fund, it
is important that there is a general legal principle that is reasonably
easy to enforce and that will apply those funds to such purposes.
Otherwise, charities will be able to spend money willy-nilly on
different matters.</div> <a name="06071158000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am seeking reassurance from the Minister that none of the hon.
Lady&#146;s amendments or any amendments that he might introduce
expressing the same ambitions will give too much scope to charities or
undermine the principle of cy-près. It is important, and it must
be protected. I hope that he will address that worry in my remarks.
Otherwise, I am extremely sympathetic to the hon. Lady&#146;s
amendments.</div><a name="06071158000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
amendments in this group are Nos. 101 and 100. Amendment No. 101 would
apply to the statement that must be made by the fundraiser at the
moment of solicitation. One can imagine an example of a fundraiser,
planning hopefully for a meeting with Bill Gates or some other major
donor, who has read the measure that requires the solicitation to
be</div> <a name="06071158000417"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;accompanied by a
statement to the effect that property given in response to it will, in
the event of those purposes failing, be applicable cy-près as if
given for charitable purposes generally, unless the donor makes a
relevant declaration at the time of making the
gift.&#148;</div><a name="06071158000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">The fundraiser
panics slightly, because he is not quite sure what that means. He seeks
advice from a lawyer who tells him that, to be safe, he must hand an
even more convoluted declaration to Bill Gates during the meeting to
ensure that he is covered under the Act in case the charity needs to
apply for donations cy-près at some later stage. He might also
take advice from a fundraising consultant such as Lord Levy, who might
encourage him to make a loan instead of a gift to get around difficult
regulations, although that might be a mischievous suggestion. In any
case, there is a need for greater simplicity in clause 17, and that is
what amendment No. 101 seeks to create.</div>

Miliband:</b> Again, I know that it is not the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s intention, but&#151;and I hope to short-circuit
this discussion&#151;I fear that his amendment will do precisely what
he warned us earlier against doing. By substituting his wording for the
words in clause 17(2), convoluted though they might be, he would
transfer the onus from the charity, which would offer the donor the
opportunity to make a declaration, to the donor him or herself, who
would have to take the initiative and make the declaration. I fear that
the amendment will not achieve his purposes, but will work against
them.</div><a name="06071158000253"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071158000569"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I am grateful to the Minister, but if he thinks
about it for a moment, he will see that that would be a desirable
outcome. It is always generally desirable for donations to be received
with as few restrictions as possible. That is generally a good thing
from charities&#146; point of view. If the donor wants to make a
restriction, it is up to them to make it clear what that restriction is
and to tell the charity when the donation is solicited whether there
are any particular concerns or restrictions, or projects to which that
donor wishes it to be
applied.</div><a name="06071158000254"></a>

Horwood:</b> The Minister shakes his head, but I have been in
that situation as a fundraiser, and it is exactly right. I would far
prefer the onus to be on the donor to restrict a donation, rather than
on the charity. I am proposing a simplification that would be more
practical for fundraisers in the application of the Act. I hope that he
will look kindly on it.</div>

thought he was a generous soul, but perhaps we were misled. Amendment

recent speech were &#147;I have been a fundraiser, and I know what
it&#146;s like.&#148; He is trying to make it easy for fundraisers
and not for donors. Donors are usually quite interested in the purpose
to which their generosity will be applied. I am not an enthusiast of
amendment No. 101, and I understand the purposes behind the hon.
Lady&#146;s
amendments.</div><a name="06071158000259"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
Nos. 23 and 24 are designed to give guidance on how to make the
declaration. It is all very well saying that a declaration must or must
not be made, but it is helpful to have a cast-iron declaration to hand
if a donor wants to sign it. That would not be a bad thing for
charities to bring
forward.</div><a name="06071158000431"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.15
pm</div><a name="06071158000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
25 relates to the Lanesborough hotel case. If a donor makes a donation
and the charity fails, is the donor entitled to the value of the
original donation or to the value of the asset at the time of the
charity&#146;s failure? The Lanesborough hotel&#151;the case
involves a leasehold reversion not a charity&#151;used to be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column186" />Column number: 187</div>a hospital, and before that it was a property owned by the Duke of
Westminster. He gave the property for use as a hospital and it served
as such for a while, but then it ceased to be a hospital and the Duke
of Westminster had it back.</div>
<a name="06071158000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us be clear: if we do not
have such a provision, we put donors off. I might be willing to give
something in the hope that it would be used to set up a monastery, but
200 years later along comes Henry VIII who says to me,
&#147;We&#146;re not having any monasteries, but you can have the
value of this handkerchief.&#148; Actually, Henry VIII was not as
honest as that because he would not have given anyone the value of a
handkerchief, but the principle is clear. When the asset is a real
asset, it is sensible to provide for the donor to be able to reclaim
the asset or its current value, rather than merely the value of the
asset at the time it was donated. Will the Parliamentary Secretary say
who will decide the value of the asset? What was the value of Rievaulx
abbey at the time that it was dissolved by Henry VIII? What was its
value at the time that it was donated&#151;if it was
donated?</div><a name="06071158000262"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071158000577"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Member for Isle of
Wight for giving way, although it probably was not wise of me to
intervene at that precise moment. I am not about to provide him with
the answer to the question. I am worried because his idea about the
value of the gift at a later stage is not practical because of all the
changes that might have taken place in the meantime. He says that he is
worried about donors being put off, but surely what would put them off
the most is to be presented with a complicated declaration on the
possible failure of the charitable
purpose.</div><a name="06071158000265"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071158000578"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> The donors would be asked about the failure of the
charitable purpose anyway, so they might as well have something that
makes it clear whether they were or were not given such a declaration
and the opportunity to sign it. That would clarify matters. A donor
will want to know that his donation will be used for the purpose for
which he intends it to be used and that, in the event of a failure, he
will have the opportunity to recover the property and, in all
probability, give it for another charitable
purpose.</div><a name="06071158000266"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071158000579"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> In my constituency, we have the Rushden memorial
clinic; donations were given to provide hospital and medical
facilities. We did not envisage that the clinic would be closed, that
houses would be built on the site and that the clinic would be moved
away from the town. Donors are unhappy about that sort of thing. The
proposal for a declaration to ensure that donors would receive their
original money back would discourage such things from
happening.</div><a name="06071158000267"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071158000580"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> I agree with my hon. Friend. The Frank James
memorial hospital in East Cowes is a similar example. It was paid for
out of the pay packets of people who worked for what is now G. K.
Westland, which used to be the British Hovercraft Corporation 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column187" />Column number: 188</div>and, before that, Saunders Roe, which made the Empire flying boats.
Exactly the same circumstances apply. The hospital was taken over by
the health service, of course, but it would be sad for the donors to
see that asset lost. It upsets people to see an asset that they, their
parents or grandparents gave for the benefit of their town being
absorbed into a bigger asset in a town many miles away, albeit perhaps
providing a similar service. Where people give money to a charity, they
are entitled to expect the money to be spent in accordance with their
wishes. That is the purpose of amendment No.
27.</div><a name="06071158000268"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071158000581"></a>Alun
Michael:</b> Would the value of the asset be net of the
additional investment or additional value that had been put in over the
years&#151;perhaps by the health service or another
organisation&#151;including the value of good
will?</div><a name="06071158000269"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071158000582"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> It is perfectly fair to say that the value should
be net. If a person gives a piece of land, at the end of the
process they are entitled to withdraw the value of the land, not the
value of the buildings on the land. That is perfectly fair, but it is
also fair that where a charity fails, the donor should not merely
receive the value of a silk handkerchief.</div>
<a name="06071158000270"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071158000583"></a>Tom
Levitt:</b> I rise briefly because the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
argument reminds me of a local case. Describing it in detail would not
be long enough for a speech, but would be too long for an intervention.
It involves the Devonshire Royal hospital in Buxton, which was given to
the nation by the Duke of Devonshire about 100 years ago. It became
part of the NHS on its formation, but a few years ago Stockport health
authority, which then ran it, decided that it was surplus to
requirements as a hospital and no longer wished to use it. I had an
amusing interview in my constituency office, which I think I can now
disclose under statutes of limitations, with an agitated Duke of
Devonshire, who said, &#147;For heaven&#146;s sake, they&#146;re
not going to give it me back are they?&#148; He said that on the
grounds that the building had become a liability rather than an asset,
owing to the amount of money that was required to run it.</div>
<a name="06071158000271"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would not like the word
&#147;must&#148; to be included, because that could mean giving a
liability back to donors, rather than the asset that they thought they
had donated in the first place. That is my argument against the hon.
Gentleman, but I cannot resist pointing out that amendment No. 100,
tabled by the hon. Member for Cheltenham, is probably the classic
embodiment of the Cheltenham principle, being harmless if not entirely
necessary.</div><a name="06071158000272"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071158000584"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> I fear that the hon. Gentleman heard me
mis-express the purpose of the amendment. Proposed new section 14B(4)
of the 1993 Act
says:</div><a name="06071158000418"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;If a
scheme provides for the property to be transferred to another charity,
the scheme may impose on the charity trustees of that charity a duty to
secure that the property is applied for
purposes&#148;</div><a name="06071158000273"></a><div class="hs_Para">of the charity.
My assertion is merely that the new subsection (4) should read that the
scheme &#147;must impose&#148; that duty on the trustees. If a
property is given for any purpose, it is there for that very purpose, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column188" />Column number: 189</div>whether it is with charity A or with charity B. I do not see why there
is an option for the charity to transfer that property for a different
purpose.</div> <a name="06071158000274"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am also
concerned about the principle of clause 15, because as far as I can see
clause 13 provides a broad power for varying the use of property. For
that reason, I may wish to oppose clause 15 on stand
part.</div><a name="06071158000275"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071158000585"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b> The hon. Gentleman threw in a googly at the end,
but I shall try to deal with it
nevertheless.</div><a name="06071158000276"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall
start with the worthy amendments tabled by my hon. Friend the Member
for Bishop Auckland (Helen Goodman). I have dealt with
amendment No. 134, which deals with work that has been
completed, and hope that I have reassured her about the 1993 Act.
Briefly, I am sympathetic to her de minimis desires, which are
expressed in amendments Nos. 135 and 136. The most acute of her very
acute points was about charities that had built up lots of small sums
from appeals spread over hundreds of years, which would have to go
through the process of cy-près with the Charity Commission,
issue new purposes and so on to get those amounts of money dealt with.
I undertake to consider whether there is a case for a de minimis
provision in relation to cy-près; I hope that that satisfies my
hon. Friend.</div><a name="06071158000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
amendment No. 101, the hon. Member for Cheltenham is contradicting his
own wise words, because he is transferring the onus. If someone gives
money to a certain appeal, but the money is to be used for a completely
different&#151;albeit worthy&#151;charitable purpose, it is fair
enough that the person giving money to the appeal should know that, and
should be offered the chance to make a declaration saying that that
cannot happen. That is the long and the short of what the provision
does.</div><a name="06071158000278"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071158000586"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> The circumstances that we are talking
about&#151;cases in which a charitable purpose eventually
fails&#151;are not common. They are extreme circumstances that need
to be catered for. The difficulty of trying to insert complicated
declarations as a matter of course is that they can disrupt the process
of fundraising, whether that is being carried out through a small
donation form, a coupon advertisement, or a delicate conversation with
a major donor. The declaration process may jeopardise the donation and
result in less money for the beneficiaries or the charitable purpose
for which the money is being raised. It is simply impractical to insist
on such complex declarations in those
circumstances.</div><a name="06071158000279"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071158000587"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b> I am slightly sympathetic to what the hon.
Gentleman says. In a sense, we hold the opposite point of view from the
hon. Member for Isle of Wight, who, through his amendment, seeks more
reassurance about the donor being advised on how to make the
declaration. I am pretty certain that what he wants is implicit in the
wording of new section 14B(2)(b), and on that basis I hope that he will
accept that the wording in the Bill should stand. I shall come back to
the point made by the hon. Member for Cheltenham
later.</div>

does he not just change cy-près to &#147;as near&#148;
throughout the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071158000589"></a>Edward

convention and it is well understood by those who need to understand
it. <i class="I">[Laughter.]</i></div> <a name="06071158000282"></a><div class="hs_Para">Moving
swiftly on, I disagree with the hon. Member for Isle of Wight on
amendment No. 25. He seems to be confusing a charitable donation with
an investment. If one makes a charitable donation, one cannot expect
its value to increase and to get back that value if the charity fails,
but that would be the effect of his amendment.</div>
<a name="06071158000283"></a><div class="hs_Para">First, if one gives money to a
charity, one does not expect to get it back; secondly, if in extreme
circumstances a charity fails and one does get it back, one cannot
expect it to have increased in value. I fear that if one gave a
handkerchief 200 years ago, one would get back a handkerchief or the
monetary equivalent. That is just one of those
things.</div><a name="06071158000284"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071158000590"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> Perhaps I did not express myself clearly; what I
am saying is that if one gave Rievaulx abbey 200 years ago,
what one might get back today is a handkerchief, because the value of
the abbey then was 7s 6d, which is about how much&#151;or even
less&#151;a handkerchief costs nowadays. I am not suggesting that the
donation should be an investment, but what if a donation increases in
value? If someone gives a charity a piece of land, it is reasonable to
expect to get back the piece of land, not just a
handkerchief.</div><a name="06071158000432"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.30

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071158000591"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b> I fear that that is not so. It is hard lines for
the person who gets back 7s 6d or the price of a handkerchief. Under
the hon. Gentleman&#146;s amendment, the wording would mention a sum
equal to the relevant value at the time of the charity failing, but
that is tantamount to making it an investment, because one essentially
benefits from the capital growth of the
gift.</div><a name="06071158000286"></a>

Horwood:</b> If I can be as generous to the Parliamentary
Secretary as he has been to me, I might just assist him. Surely, the
investment is a red herring. The point is that so many changes in the
nature, structure and quality of the property might have taken place in
the intervening years that it would be practically impossible to
disaggregate the value due to the donor from the value that was due to
the
charity.</div><a name="06071158000287"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071158000593"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b> That is helpful. I agree with the hon.
Gentleman.</div><a name="06071158000288"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 100 is unnecessary, because the terms of
&#147;cy-près&#148; are set out in a wider sense in section
13 of the 1993 Act, a part of which I read to my hon. Friend the Member
for Bishop Auckland. It
states:</div><a name="06071158000419"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;where the
original purposes, in whole or in part...have been as far as may
be fulfilled; or...cannot be carried out, or not according to the
directions given and to the spirit of the
gift&#148;.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column190" />Column number: 191</div><a name="06071158000289"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is a wider interpretation than would
apply under the amendment, which refers to
circumstances:</div><a name="06071158000420"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;where the
original intended purpose is impossible, impracticable or
illegal&#148;.</div><a name="06071158000290"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that he
will accept that there is a sound definition for
&#147;cy-près&#148; and will not press his
amendment.</div><a name="06071158000291"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
amendment No. 27, which deals with &#147;may&#148; or
&#147;must&#148;, I hope that I can reassure the hon. Member for
Isle of Wight that his concerns are covered in clause 18. Proposed new
section 14B(3) makes it clear that the matters defined in subsection
(2)&#151;when cy-près happens&#151;relate to the spirit of
the original gift and the desirability of securing that the properties
apply for charitable purposes that are close to the original purposes.
He can be reassured that when the transfer described in subsection (4)
takes place, it will have to be applied for charitable purposes close
to the original purposes. He may ask, &#147;Why use
&#145;may&#146; rather than &#145;must&#146;&#148;? That is a
good question. The answer is that the charity to which the transfer is
taking place already has similar purposes to those from which the
transfer is made, so it will not be necessary for the scheme to impose
a duty, because the intentions behind the duty will already be
fulfilled.</div><a name="06071158000292"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me turn
again, briefly, to a matter raised by the hon. Member for Cheltenham.
We have described the right balance between the needs of charities to
be able to make appeals and the protection of donors. I am struck by
what the hon. Gentleman said, particularly about newspaper appeals or
elsewhere and the potential difficulty of setting out a clear space for
a declaration from the individual. He made a good point and I shall
take it away and return to it on

to give specific directions for protection of
charity</div><a name="06071158000317"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071158000611"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 35, in clause 20, page
21, line 1, leave
out</div><a name="06071158000421"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#145;the Commission
considers to be expedient in the interests&#146;</div>
<a name="06071158000318"></a><div class="hs_Para">and insert</div> <div class="hs_brev">&#145;is
necessary for the protection of the
property&#146;.</div><a name="06071158000319"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment is straightforward. It would remove the power of the
commission to do all sorts of things that it might think expedient in
the interests of the charity, and instead restrict the power to things
that the commission considers necessary for the protection of the
charity&#146;s property, which is more or less the position under
section 19 of the 1993 Act. I do not really understand the case for
broadening the commission&#146;s power. The commission would be given
a fairly broad power in place of a fairly narrow one and the power
would be exercisable before the outcome of any inquiry. The commission
would not have to wait for the inquiry before deciding what to do,
whereas later parts of the Bill provide for the commission to do things
following the outcome of an
inquiry.</div><a name="06071158000320"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071158000612"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I am pleased to support the amendment, which
seems sensible. The hon. Gentleman has discovered something that gives
unnecessary latitude to the Charity Commission. If an order under the
provision were the subject of an attempted challenge by trustees or by
a charity, the trustees or the charity would have to find some error in
law on the part of the Charity Commission, yet the commission would
need only to justify its decision in terms of expediency. That seems a
very low test indeed, so the hon. Gentleman&#146;s amendment is well
thought out and should be
supported.</div><a name="06071158000321"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071158000613"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b> Let me briefly explain the intention of the
clause. At the moment, the Charity Commission has a draconian power to
suspend or remove trustees from membership of the charity, but it has
no intermediate set of powers. A number of cases have arisen in which
annual general meetings have not been held and annual accounts have not
been submitted because of, for example, a dispute with a charity. In
such circumstances, the commission faces Hobson&#146;s choice: it can
either do nothing or take extreme action to suspend trustees.</div>
<a name="06071158000322"></a><div class="hs_Para">The intention behind the clause
is to give the commission the power to give specific directions if it
considers that necessary and in the interests of the charity. That
would, of course, be reviewable by the charity tribunal. The problem
with the amendment is that it would restrict the powers to those
necessary for 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column192" />Column number: 193</div>the protection of the property. The hon. Gentleman says that that is in
the 1993 Act; that may well be the case, and that is precisely the
problem. The commission would be pushed back to either facing the
possibility of using the very extreme power to suspend trusteeship, or
sitting on its hands.</div>
<a name="06071158000323"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Gentleman raised the
question of use of the commission&#146;s powers not having to wait
for the outcome of the inquiry. It may not be much reassurance, but
that is true of all the commission&#146;s powers, which can be
exercised any time after the start of the inquiry. That has always been
the case. I hope that, on that basis and in that context, the hon.
Gentleman will accept my
reassurance.</div><a name="06071158000324"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071158000614"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> I appreciate the Minister&#146;s words, which
are meant to reassure, but am sorry to say that they do the opposite.
The power that the commissioners have at the moment comes into play
when they</div> <a name="06071158000422"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;are
satisfied...that... that there is or has been any misconduct
or mismanagement in the administration of the charity; or...that
it is necessary or desirable to act for the purpose of protecting the
property of the charity or securing a proper application for the
purposes of the charity of that property or of property coming to the
charity&#148;.</div> <a name="06071158000325"></a><div class="hs_Para">I can think of
very few improper ways in which trustees could act that would not, in
one way or another, imperil the proper application of the property,
except when the trustees were merely making decisions on
discretion&#151;they could have spent the money on A, but will spend
the money on B.</div> <a name="06071158000326"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do
not see why the commission should need an intermediate power. If the
purpose of the Bill is to enable charities to get on with running their
own affairs, there must be a high level of test before the commission
is allowed to interfere. As the hon. Member for Cheltenham said, the
power is virtually unappealable. <i class="I">[Interruption.]</i></div>
<a name="06071158000327"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister says that it is
not unappealable in law, and of course that is right, but it is
unappealable in practice because the commissioners would have to
demonstrate only that they considered it expedient and in the interests
of the charity to do one of the things listed at the bottom of page 20.
Yes, their decision would have to be reasonable and rational, but all
they would have to say is, &#147;We thought it was expedient.&#148;
The tribunal would just say, &#147;Well, you thought it was
expedient&#151;sorry, appellant, you&#146;ve had
it&#148;.</div>
<a name="06071158000328"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071158000615"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b> The hon. Gentleman is missing out the rest of
the words in the
clause:</div><a name="06071158000423"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;in the interests
of the
charity&#148;.</div><a name="06071158000329"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071158000616"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> Yes, the intervention has to be expedient in the
interests of the charity, but the commission may well take a different
view from that of the trustees on what is expedient. That is the point.
It may be expedient to invest money in A or in B.
<i class="I">[Interruption.]</i> The Minister says that it is not that
wide.</div><a name="06071158000330"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071158000617"></a>Alun
Michael:</b> Surely it is generally the case in law that in
matters of judgment, the judgment lies with those exercising the
judgment, and that what the hon. Gentleman is talking about would not
be in question.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column193" />Column number: 194</div><a name="06071158000331"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071158000618"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> Of course that is normally a matter of law, but
the provision gives the power to take any action that the commission
considers expedient. The right hon. Gentleman shakes his head. My
concern is that it is too broad a power and that it does not require
any demonstration of failure. It requires an inquiry to be established.
It does not require the inquiry to report.

Minister has been busy over the weekend and therefore might not have
had a chance to read &#147;Power without Accountability&#148;. It
repeatedly provides examples of the Charity Commission exercising, not
power, but discretion in a way that is difficult to applaud. Let me put
it no stronger than that. It is not going to be in the interests of the
good governance of charities to give the Charity Commission those broad
powers of discretion which, although technically appealable, are
impossible to appeal successfully.</div>

clause 28, page 29, line 41, leave
out &#145;&#163;10,000&#146; and insert
&#145;&#163;20,000&#146;.</div>
<a name="06071158000368"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is another measure to
reduce the amount of bureaucracy that small or medium sized voluntary
sector organisations have to deal with. The Minister said on Second
Reading that the number of charities that will no longer have to have a
full audit will be reduced by 3,000 by this section of the Bill. Since
an audit costs about &#163;5,000 on average, that will in effect
inject &#163;15 million into the sector. That is a number that we
should be trumpeting from the roof tops.</div>
<a name="06071158000369"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause goes on to suggest
that those charities with an income of between &#163;100,000 and
&#163;10,000 will not need a full audit but an independent
examination. The purpose of the amendment is to raise that limit of
&#163;10,000 to &#163;20,000, which will mean that more
organisations will not require even an independent examination and will
manage without any independent check on their bookkeeping. It is
another simple measure to reduce the amount of bureaucracy faced by
small voluntary sector organisations.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071158000639"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I applaud the intention behind the amendment, but
we have to be careful about always regarding something like an audit as
an imposition on a charity that is not in its interests. As I have
mentioned before, we are talking about a huge number of organisations;
according to the National Council for Voluntary Organisations, 56 per
cent. of the voluntary sector has an annual income of less than
&#163;10,000. We are talking about a huge area of the necessary
regulation of charities. To exempt another large swathe of small
charities might open the door for exactly the kind of difficulties that
we have already discussed.</div>

Friend has a point about deregulation and that the best way to deal

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071158000641"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I am pleased by that intervention by the
Minister. I would say yes and am happy to leave it at that, but to
complete the essential point, it can be in the interests of donors,
charities and the reputation of the charity sector as a whole for
necessary audit and examination of accounts to take place, and that
guards against fraud.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071158000642"></a>Mr.

it is a good thing. Can the hon. Gentleman point out to me the power
that the Minister will have to make decisions as a result of
that?</div><a name="06071158000374"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071158000643"></a>Martin

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071158000644"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> I should declare an interest as a chartered
accountant. I urge the hon. Lady to press her amendment. We are not
talking about a set of accounts but about having to have them audited.
An audit is frightfully expensive and is a great blow, in percentage
terms, to the
charity.</div><a name="06071158000376"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06071158000645"></a><b class="B">James
Duddridge</b> (Rochford and Southend, East) (Con): I thank my
hon. Friend for giving way. As a chartered
accountant&#151;<i class="I">[Interruption.]</i> I am not a chartered
accountant. Will my hon. Friend, as a chartered accountant, give me a
suggestion of the cost involved? In my experience, well over
&#163;1,000 is common and that would represent a significant
percentage even of &#163;20,000. I support my hon. Friend in asking
the hon. Lady to press the amendment despite reassurances from the
Minister that things will be reviewed a year
later.</div>
<a name="06071158000377"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071158000646"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> That is exactly the point. In many other areas, the
Government have recognised that fact and increased thresholds so that
organisations do not have to have audits. It is an important point and
a good
amendment.</div><a name="06071158000378"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06071158000647"></a><b class="B">Stephen
Williams</b> (Bristol, West) (LD): I am a chartered tax
consultant rather than a chartered accountant. In my experience, lots
of chartered 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column196" />Column number: 197</div>accountants&#151;I am sure that the hon. Member for Wellingborough
(Mr. Bone) is not an exception&#151;do such audits for charities on a
no-fee basis, as part of building links with the community. Would he
not advocate that his fellow practitioners audit small charities on
that basis? Then there would be no fee and no need to fear the high
charges that he
mentioned.</div><a name="06071158000379"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071158000648"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes a point, but realistically,
it is an unnecessary imposition on a charity with only &#163;10,000
of income.</div>
<a name="06071158000380"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071158000649"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b> This has been a lively debate, with interesting
views from all parties. My hon. Friend the Member for Bishop Auckland
raises an important issue, and the hon. Member for Wellingborough spoke
eloquently as an accountant about the costs that accountants can charge
and the imposition that that might make on small
charities.</div><a name="06071158000381"></a><div class="hs_Para">We need to
examine the measures properly, consulting all charities that might be
affected. The hon. Member for Isle of Wight drew attention earlier to
the relatively small number of responses on another threshold issue. I
reassure him that there are order-making powers in the Bill to vary all
the financial
thresholds.</div><a name="06071158000382"></a><div class="hs_Para">My final
point, partly in answer to the hon. Member for Wellingborough, is that
an examination can be done on charities. It is a lesser scrutiny than
an audit and is done by someone competent but not professionally
qualified, and an independent person must be involved.</div>
<a name="06071158000383"></a><div class="hs_Para">The issue raises important
points, but the hon. Member for Cheltenham cautions us against leaping
too quickly into the dark. A thorough review is the right way to go. I
hope that my hon. Friend will withdraw her
amendment.</div><a name="06071158000384"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071158000650"></a>Helen
Goodman:</b> I am grateful to the Minister. One of the nice
things about the Bill is that because he has only just arrived and is
not really responsible for it, we can be critical of it. Given that
everybody keeps saying how much consideration has gone into the Bill, I
think that the threshold should have been considered before. It is most
unfortunate that thresholds will be established this year when there is
going to be a review and everyone will have to find out what the new
thresholds are in a year&#146;s time. Despite that and
notwithstanding the blandishments of Opposition Members, I beg to ask
leave to withdraw the amendment.</div>
