<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> Welcome, Mrs. Michie. We do not intend to keep you up too late, although others have different intentions.
<P>
In his closing remarks the Minister alluded to our not having mentioned the Royal Ulster Constabulary in dispatches, and I did not want the Committee's proceedings to begin without referring to that. The Minister knows from his dealings with the Chief Constable and the RUC in Northern Ireland that the previous Government gave that institution every support. It goes without saying that we continue to admire the incredibly courageous work that it does. As a result of the Bill, and other legislation, its task may become harder, or easier--we cannot predict these things.
<P>
	Over many years the RUC has been at the forefront, at the interface, in tackling terrorism. It is one of 52 police forces throughout the United Kingdom, and is more or less the same as any other force in terms of its structure, ranks, management and style. But the RUC differs in one very important respect--in the past 25 years, 300 of its officers have been murdered, both on and off duty, and sometimes in the bosom of their families, and with their friends. About 7,000 have been injured in some way--some physically, some psychologically, and most of that injury has impaired their lives for ever. I pay tribute to the RUC, and want it on record that the official Opposition admire and respect the fine work that its officers do.
<P>
Times are indeed changing. I understand the latest statistic is that about 22 per cent. of new applicants come from the nationalist community, compared with about 8 per cent. a few years ago.
<P>
From my knowledge of discussions about the security situation, I know that the previous Government adhered to the letter scrupulously-- such was the nature of the then Secretary of State--in following all the operational guidance and recommendations of the Chief Constable. Returning to my earlier point, can the present Government hold up their hands and say, ``We are following the same path''? I wonder whether the present Chief Constable's memoirs will suggest differently?
<P>
The Minister said that the Government would ensure that the RUC had all the resources it needed to do its job. Much of its job relates, of course, to finding evidence with which to charge people in the Diplock courts, with which we are dealing in clause 2.
<P>
In the light of the present situation--the pressure must have eased somewhat because of the ceasefire--can the Minister assure the Committee that sufficient resources are being made available to the RUC to enable it to fulfil all its duties and requirements? Has the Chief Constable approached him in the past few months for additional resources either because of the changing situation or because of the implications of the changes in clause 2?
<P>
If the Minister did a straw poll of average RUC officers does he think that a majority would be in favour of the changes that he proposes to the schedule of offences in clause 2? That is an interesting question and I wonder what the average RUC officer's attitude would be. Clause 2 deals with legislation relating to Diplock courts and changes provisions for some previously scheduled categories, which the Attorney-General had no means of certifying out.
<P>
Let us remind ourselves of why the Diplock courts were introduced. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, it proved impossible to convict people whom the authorities knew had carried out terrorist acts because of the high levels of IRA intimidation of witnesses and jurors. It became well nigh impossible to convict anyone of a terrorist offence because of that. The problem did not stop at threats because in some circumstances, the IRA murdered witnesses and jurors.
<P>
When our party was in government, Conservative Members always believed that the Diplock process was right in principle and its implementation has produced some success. Having paid tribute to the RUC, I now pay tribute to the Northern Ireland judiciary. Its members, too, have been at the sharp end of considerable intimidation and threats to their lives and property. We have a distinguished counsel in our presence tonight and, if he has the opportunity, he will no doubt go into more detail about such intimidation and threats. However, it is certainly the case that the quality and dedication of people involved in the legal process are perceived, not just in Northern Ireland but throughout Britain and abroad, as second to none. Society in Northern Ireland is privileged to have such gifted and dedicated servants.
<P>
As was said earlier, in opposition the Labour party held a view that it repeated ad nauseam for many years. It wanted to remove the Diplock process as soon as it was able. The Minister confirmed that by saying that the reason for producing the legislation was to honour manifesto commitments that were given in opposition. The Labour party opposed removing Diplock for some time. I shall not accuse Labour Members of attempting or even of suggesting that they could do that at a stroke. They stated that they wished to make fundamental change, and that they were opposed in principle to the notion of Diplock courts.
<P>
One way in which the Labour party wished to make that change was to remove all the scheduled offences under schedule 1 and allow the Attorney-General to certify in those offences that should be considered in the Diplock courts. Currently, the Attorney-General looks carefully at each case and decides whether it would be in the interests of justice and of the legal process to take it out of the list of scheduled offences and try it in the normal criminal justice system. It would then be heard before a jury instead of being tried in a Diplock court without a jury.
<P>
In Committee on the legislation that led to the 1996 Act, the Labour party proposed an amendment to that effect. Labour Members spoke at length to the amendment, and divided the Committee on it. That was about a year and a half ago. The buzz word at the time was that the Attorney-General should be more ``proactive''.
<P>
Why has the Labour party, now in government, had that fundamental change of heart? The Minister ducked the question earlier, as the record will show. He said that the Committee would reach it later. Later has arrived, and the Committee has reached the same question. the Minister must answer it. He cannot, on the one hand, say that the legislation is intended to honour commitments, and on the other just tinker at the edges of one of its most essential planks. Diplock courts will still be in place. The changes are cosmetic, and tinker with the overall notion. Will the Minister explain the Labour party's change of heart? Is it just another U-turn, or a special U-turn? Is it a U-turn based on principle, or on facing the facts when in government? In opposition, there is a propensity to indulge in free thinking without facing key issues.
<P>
In Committee on the 1996 Bill, as it then was, and in debates on the Floor of the House since then, Labour Members have made a number of proposals. Some of them were made by the present Under-Secretary of State, the Member for Clydebank and Milngavie (Mr. Worthington).
<P>
<H5>8.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Those proposals were designed to effect change in this area of legislation, in other words to phase out the Diplock proceedings. Although no details were given, one proposal by the Labour party in opposition was for a mechanism that would allow sections of the legislation to lapse. I am not sure whether the proposals that we are debating constitute a lapse or an amendment. Perhaps the Minister will enlighten us. Another proposed mechanism was a collegiate court, which meant that instead of having one judge and no jury, the trial could be presided over by three judges as an alternative to the present constitution of the Diplock court.
<P>
The Labour party proposed a different method for tackling intimidation. Labour Members thought, when in opposition--obviously, they no longer think so--that measures could be introduced directly to tackle the intimidation of juries. They spoke of a review by Mr. Gearty and Mr. Kimbell, whose report contained proposals that, at the time, were espoused by Labour Members. I shall quote some of their report. It said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The names and addresses of jury panels should not be publicly accessible information in scheduled cases . . . Balloting of jurors should take place by number only in scheduled cases . . . Jurors should not have to give their name and address orally at any stage . . . Prospective jurors should not know whether they will serve in what are now scheduled or non scheduled cases . . . What are now scheduled cases should be heard in court rooms where the jury can sit out of sight of the public gallery . . . And jurors should not have to wait and eat in areas in which ordinary members of the public have access . . . As a matter of administrative practice especially in the early years following the restoration of juries, court officials should look favourably upon applications to be excused service on scheduled cases from people living in areas where loyalist or republican paramilitaries have a particularly strong influence.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Those proposals are from one section of a fairly extensive tome, which contained hosts of similar recommendations. On first reading they seem extremely plausible. Why have the Government rejected them? Why have they chosen a very different course of action? Why did we not have a debate on Second Reading about why those plausible proposals, made by the Labour party in opposition, have now been rejected?
<P>
The Labour party in opposition also had extremely strong views on the previous Government's support for the certifying-out principle. The matter is complicated, but as I understand it, the certifying-out principle meant that the Attorney-General was able to relieve a defendant of the special case as defined in schedule 1, rather than impose such restrictions, which is of course a different matter.
<P>
Let us remind ourselves of the role of the Attorney-General. He or she is responsible for all prosecutions. As such, certification would involve the Attorney-General--the prosecution--deciding the mode of trial. In other words, almost perversely, the defendant in that particular case would have been denied the right to trial by jury. I suspect that no Attorney-General worth his or her salt would countenance taking on such a role and that the realities of the situation were driven home hard to the incoming Government when they took up the reins seven months ago.
<P>
We always believed and continue to believe that Parliament, through legislation, should specify scheduled offences and that the role of the Attorney-General should be that of a second tier, not a backstop, whose responsibility is to review individual circumstances in the interests of justice. We made our case in the teeth of opposition from Labour Members, on not just one occasion but time and again. It is puzzling: the Government have now turned turtle and are now arguing from the stance that we took in government.
<P>
I turn to the detail of the offences with which the clause deals. Schedule 1 of the 1996 Act is referred to. There are 22 paragraphs--major headings--and 60 sub-paragraphs. It is detailed and runs to four pages of close type. The clause makes changes to five major headings and only two sub-paragraphs. I said in my opening remarks that that was tinkering at the edges. The Government were scraping the barrel when deciding what to pick out to curry favour with whoever--I think that we know who. What is the point? What is the logic? If the Government oppose the Diplock courts and whan fundamental change, they should get on with it and act positively to end that system--as the Labour party wanted in opposition. They should not tinker in this cosmetic way--it means virtually nothing.
<P>
The first change is at clause 2(1)(a), which refers to ``paragraph 3 (riot)''. Riot is not defined. Does the Minister consider the events of Drumcree at their height to have been a riot? Were they related to terrorist offences? After Drumcree, there was a major incident at Larne habour and incidents throughout Northern Ireland. The RUC was stretched to breaking point. That will be confirmed by Northern Ireland Members, who, more than I did, lived through it.
<P>
Why take ``riot'' out of the legislation as a scheduled offence? What purpose is served? What advantage is to be gained, or is there a political agenda? However, that makes little sense in terms of keeping the peace or ensuring that when one wishes to convict for rioting, witnesses and jurors will not be intimidated, because that will obviously happen in a Drumcree situation. Intimidation would prevent one from convicting anybody.
<P>
Paragraph (b) refers to schedule 1(12) of the 1996 Act. Paragraphs 12 and13 of that schedule come under the sub-heading of hijacking; the former refers to offences under section 1 of the Aviation Security Act 1982, which would involve aircraft, while the latter refers to offences in Northern Ireland, under section 2 of the Criminal Jurisdiction Act 1975, which would involve vehicles or ships. I do not want to go into massive detail, and no doubt the Minister will put me right if I am sailing down the wrong tack, but we seem to be talking about hijacking aircraft, ships or trains--the word is ``vehicles'', but I would not have thought that that meant cars. The provisions relate to serious hijacking of the larger modes of transport.
<P>
Why have the Government concluded that there is no longer a perceived threat of such hijacking? Just because such events have not happened does not mean that they could not happen in future. I am puzzled as to the logic of selecting those two offences when a range of others could be reconsidered which are no more or less important. Will the Minister confirm that those offences have been chosen for specific, logical reasons and that they are linked?
<P>
The Government should not approach the issue from a need to do more confidence building or to make concessions on Diplock. They now realise that they cannot do in government what they promised to do or what they wanted to do because, first, the current provisions do an excellent job and, secondly, all the advice from the security people and the lawyers in Northern Ireland suggests that although this is not a perfect world and the measures do not necessarily bring about significant increases in convictions, they are better than nothing and work reasonably well.
<P>
I met very few people in Northern Ireland who want to see current provisions amended or removed simply as a concession or as a confidence-building measure. I do not suppose that they wanted them removed from the point of view of security, because most people in Northern Ireland would say that the situation is inconclusive--they are in the middle of another so-called ceasefire, but there is no settlement, no promises, no move towards decommissioning and no move towards a total cessation of violence. The trickle of information from the Francie Molloys of this world paints a very different picture--a serious and sinister picture--which suggests to most sensible people that making concessions in such a climate will not necessarily yield the hoped-for results.
<P>
Paragraph (d) relates to schedule 1(17) of the 1996 Act--offences under the Taking of Hostages Act 1982. Again, why is it deemed necessary or important to remove that? Is taking political hostages something that the IRA would never do? Of course, we are talking not only about the IRA but loyalist and other terrorists. Just because history has not shown it to be one of the modus operandi of the IRA or of loyalist terrorists does not mean that it could not be so in future.
<P>
Political hostages could be taken, as well as what I would term economic or financial hostages. Extortion is a much more likely option, and it has been tried in Northern Ireland and on mainland Britain.

<P>

<B>Mr. Robert McCartney:</B> It happened at Dontidy in the Republic.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I thank the hon. and learned Member for North Down for pointing that out. Experience from across the world shouts to us that a rump of terrorists--from either side--who are unhappy with any settlement and are determined to continue their acts of terrorism and violence could easily take hostages.
<P>
Paragraph (e) deals with paragraph 18 of the 1996 Act and refers to section 2 of the Nuclear Material (Offences) Act 1983, covering offences involving nuclear material. I cannot think of a single incident in which terrorists have got hold of nuclear material--certainly not in Northern Ireland, nor even in mainland Britain. Perhaps the Minister knows of one. There is no nuclear material in Northern Ireland, although some people argue that plenty comes across the Irish sea. I do not believe that either, but no one could use such material in any case.
<P>
Finally, paragraph (f) refers to paragraph 22(a) of the 1996 Act. I hope that the Minister will clarify matters. As I read it, paragraph 21 refers to channel tunnel security and then alludes to ``this Act'' and to offences under it. Sections 21 and 37 are also mentioned. It is not clear what the reference there is to, but I take it that it is not channel tunnel security.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> Paragraph 21 does refer to channel tunnel security, in that it deals with the Channel Tunnel (Security) Order 1994, which covers the hijacking of channel tunnel trains and the seizure or exercise of control of the tunnel system.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> That is paragraph 21 of the 1996 Act, but proposed paragraph (f) refers to paragraph 22(a), not 21.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> It runs on.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> The Minister confirms that it runs on, as I thought. Therefore we are dealing with terrorist action against channel tunnel security. The Minister must elaborate on what the specific changes will achieve.
<P>
Clearly, terrorism poses a serious threat to the channel tunnel. I am sure that the Government accept that. The recent fire showed the mayhem and destruction that can arise from a pure accident. The channel tunnel is an obvious, prime target for IRA bombs. Unless I could be given excellent reasons for change, I would strongly deprecate any legislative diminution of deterrence of terrorism in relation to the tunnel. I am sure that all Opposition Members would agree. It is not good enough for the matter to be dropped in without a clear statement in the notes and memoranda attached to the Bill of what the provision would mean. The Minister needs to be able to give a good and plausible explanation: the proposal will have repercussions if the Government have got it wrong.
<P>
In conclusion, I go back to a point that I made earlier. This is a long and detailed schedule, yet the Government are proposing only some extremely minor changes, apart from the one relating to the channel tunnel. I really cannot see the point of these changes. Presumably the Government have come round to the Conservative party's view that Diplock courts should remain--they do a good job, there is no alternative to them in the current climate and they should continue much as they have done for many years.
<P>
Are these changes for the short term only? Will something major come along some time next year? How does the Home Secretary's review of the total prevention of terrorism legislation fit into these proposals? Is there a different agenda? Is there a hidden agenda? Is this measure just a sop to be going on with, giving a few rather cosmetic concessions that will do no real harm to the essential thrust of the Diplock legislation? Is it a sop to some of the people around the negotiating table?
<P>
How much cognisance, at this juncture, have the Government taken of the Lloyd report? The Minister referred to that in some detail in his remarks on the previous clause. I agreed with him at the time that the Lloyd report was written in circumstances which anticipated a prolonged, if not a permanent, peace. We do not have that at the moment, so I am slightly concerned as to how much of the Lloyd report is being introduced into legislation and into these changes in too hasty a way in advance of real progress being made with the building blocks. We all wish to see such progress and hope that it will be achieved.
<P>
If the Government proceed too quickly with the changes--and perhaps the next clause is even more important than this one--believing that the changes will encourage some of those around the negotiating table to talk seriously about the future of Northern Ireland, and in the hope that by giving some of these concessions they will get more co-operation, I suspect that they will have a rude awakening. Wishful thinking is all right, but sometimes it can border on the naive. I hope that the Government are taking into consideration all the ramifications of some of their actions. If they get this wrong, the swing back to violence and terrorism might be even more violent than that which we experienced last time.
<P>
I hope that the Minister will assure the Committee that there are logical, sensible reasons for the changes which make sense to him, because they do not make sense to me at this juncture. I hope that he will assure us that the Government will not move in the new year, with their new legislation and their new proposals, to a massive sea-change from this tinkering around, which lulls people into feeling that Diplock is probably inviolate. Such a major change could lead to a very unstable situation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> I support and endorse all the points made by my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Cambridgeshire, not least his justified cynicism about the Government's U-turn on certifying. I wish to concentrate only on one theme which emerges from clause 2--a theme which my hon. Friend touched on only in passing.
<P>
On Second Reading, the Government made clear what they would have us believe was the purpose of clause 2. They argued that they wished to reduce the potential for cases to be heard by Diplock courts. They said that, currently, several scheduled offences automatically had to be tried in the Diplock courts, but argued that it was conceivable that certain offences could be committed in circumstances not connected with terrorism. The Government, therefore, presented the amendments contained in clause 2 to ensure that it would be possible, in such circumstances, for cases to be certified out of the Diplock system.
<P>
None of that presents any problems--it is logical and, in one respect, I do not quarrel with the underlying principle--namely, the futuristic aspiration to move towards jury trials. But when it comes to pragmatic issues, as opposed to the underlying principle, such as the particular offences that have been selected for certifying out in clause 2 and the security assessment which, according to the Government, justifies the change, the wisdom of some aspects of clause 2 is called into question.
<P>
To state the most obvious, emergency powers exist to enable the police and the armed forces to deal with the real threat that terrorism poses to the rule of law and order, but they also send out signals of the Government's awareness of the nature and extent of that threat and the Government's seriousness in countering that threat. Therefore, the existence and use of emergency powers is partly an expression of the Government's attitude to, and assessment of, the activities of terrorists. So emergency powers can make a political statement, as well as serving their primary purpose of providing a security response.
<P>
It is worth reflecting on three incidents that happened last week because they illustrate my point. The first took place on the road from Crossmaglen to Cullaville. Four Provisionals, wearing balaclavas, combat jackets and armed with Armalites, chased in their saloon car a car driven by two postal workers. They forced the postal workers to stop. The four members of the IRA emerged and started to threaten and assault the postal workers. Miraculously, through skilled driving, the postal workers escaped unharmed. That was the first occasion since the July ceasefire on which the Provisionals had authorised the use of firearms in south Armagh, and it happened only last week.
<P>
In the second incident, also last week, armed and masked men hijacked and burned vehicles in Lurgan and Armagh. In the third incident, an IRA gunman, in a balaclava, held up a post office in Ballinderry, County Tyrone. He beat up the postmaster and stole several thousands of pounds. I emphasise that all those incidents happened last week.
<P>
The re-emergence of IRA guns is a reality, and it is happening at a time when there are growing signs of serious divisions within the republican movement and the public nature of that dissent has placed the ceasefire under real strain. It would be folly to deny that or to pretend otherwise. Is this really the right time for the Government to dilute the certifying-out regime? Does the situation on the ground justify it? I would argue that it does not.
<P>
Clause 2 permits the certifying out of various offences including causing explosions likely to endanger life or damage property; sending explosive substances; making or possessing, throwing or otherwise using petrol bombs; possessing firearms or ammunition with intent to endanger life; and committing an indictable offence or preventing arrest. If the Government are arguing that those offences are now less likely to be committed by terrorists in the course of terrorist activity than previously, they have not made their case effectively.
<P>
<H5>9.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The signal transmitted by the Government in clause 2 is that they believe the time is appropriate for a less draconian emergency regime. The evidence on the ground does not justify that opinion. Clause 2 does not respond to the realities of the security threat. Above all--this is the basis of my argument--clause 2 makes a dangerously false political statement: that the Government believe that there can be a letting up, an easing off, in the fight against terrorism.
<P>
In short, there are strong grounds for believing that, in the prevailing circumstances, the Government are profoundly mistaken in amending the 1996 Act and extending the potential for certifying out. The Government have made a grave mistake with the clause. It sends out the wrong signals. This is not the time to relax emergency powers.

<P>

<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I welcome you, Mrs. Michie, to the Chair.
<P>
Certifying out a series of offences at this time are unlikely to be carried out for purposes other than terrorism stikes me as most peculiar. It is the most inexplicable element of the changes to the emergency provisions legislation. For example, acts covered by the Explosive Substances Act 1883 that are being certified out include,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``causing explosion likely to endanger life or damage property . . . intending or conspiring to cause any such explosion, and making or possessing explosive with intent to endanger life or cause serious damage to property . . . making or possessing explosives in suspicious circumstances.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No doubt the Minister will tell us of the innumerable occasions on which explosives were used illegally in Northern Ireland by people other than terrorists. However, I am not aware of any great spate of hijacking aircraft except for the purpose of terrorism. Any hijacking of ships in the recent past has been for terrorist purposes. Why are we taking those most serious offences--offences that may lead to the deaths of dozens of people--and making them a matter of discretion when they are predominantly terrorist offences. The argument that they are becoming less frequent does not stand up. If that were so, we would have much to be grateful for, but any such offences that might subsequently occur would not be any the less terrorist offences.
<P>
Certifying out is not new. If the Government had wanted to extend the nature of the offences that could be certified out, they might have considered what had gone before. The Minister will be aware of a case which in normal circumstances would have been certified in. There was a large and valuable heist in Belfast during the ceasefire between August 1994 and February 1996. Many vehicles and people were involved and the police were successful in apprehending eight of those involved. Some has IRA links, but because of the ceasefire it was convenient to ignore the links to and the control by the IRA. For the sake of convenience it was decided that the offences would be certified out. Some of thoses involved came from Dublin. They had lorries ready to offload the stolen goods and take them south of the border where they could be redistributed, sold or turned into tangible assets for use by a terrorist organisation. To dispose of those stolen goods in Northern Ireland during a ceasefire would not have been cricket.
<P>
The eight people concerned were brought to trial but the trial folded because the jury was tampered with. However they were described during the ceasefire, those people were members or associates of the IRA. The state had to go to the expense of a second trial, but that also folded because the jury was tampered with. A layman might have thought that a simple solution would be to certify the offence back in so that it could be dealt with through a Diplock court. I have no knowledge of the matter, but I suppose that that would not have been possible. The third and fourth trials failed because the jury was tampered with. That robbery is entering a fifth trial. If that is how terrorists react when their members are involved in a robbery trial, how would they react in cases involving possession or manufacture of explosives or loss of life?
<P>
One wonders what the Minister is trying to achieve. We must have a clear answer to that. The Minister has been courteous, but has not given clear answers to or dealt incisively with our points. I do not want him to say, as he did when I asked about those sitting around the table of democracy who rejected one of the Mitchell principles, that that was not a matter for him but for the other people around the talks table. That was a weak, irresponsible answer, denoting a weak, irresponsible Government. The Minister must say what he hopes to achieve by certifying out offences relating to explosives and hijacking of aircraft and ships.
<P>
Opinion in the community is that that adjustment can only help the most evil people in society. It brings no benefit to ordinary law-abiding citizens who desire justice, or to those who will be summoned to sit on a jury in cases in which they may know the perpetrator of a crime or know people who know that perpetrator. Northern Ireland is very small; people know each other the length and breadth of it. We cannot go into a town without knowing someone there, or knowing someone who knows someone.
<P>
In such a parochial atmosphere, the whole of society--victim, juror, whoever--must be protected against terrorists. No system exists to protect jurors from the moment they leave a court after a trial. That is why Diplock courts have been necessary. No one would suggest that Diplock courts have not made mistakes. Some people prefer jury trials to the idea of a single judge sitting on the Bench. In some trials, however, such as massive trials involving high finance, juries have appeared to get it wrong, or the prosecution--specifically the Serious Fraud Squad, which has brought case after case--has got it wrong again and again and again.
<P>
<H5>9.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
There have been terrorist cases here in Great Britain in which juries appear to have got it wrong. There is tremendous pressure in such high-profile cases. That is not peculiar to Northern Ireland or, indeed, to the United Kingdom as a whole. We have seen it in the United States; we see it wherever we look.
<P>
I speak from a layman's point of view. We have seen the development of a form of defence in Northern Ireland and further afield in which the defence counsel specialises in bullying and browbeating witnesses. What are jurors who sit there, probably in fear of their lives or of those of their children, to think of such behaviour when their families may be in danger as a result? The Minister would de well to look again at the justification for the entire clause, which I believe is a terrorists charter.
<P>
There is no point in the Minister rolling his eyes; we can all do that. We must consider whether society is well served by the judicial system. It will not be well served by the judicial system if we provide the opportunity again and again and again for offences that can only be deemed terrorist offences to be certified out and dealt with by juries.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> I also welcome you, Mrs. Michie, to the inspiring debate to which you are going to have to listen. I look forward to your directions.
<P>
This is one of the areas of legislation about which I shall always be very careful; it is very much a legal matter. We should never ignore the legal input to it, especially from those who have had vast experience of implementing and working within the legal system. However, there is more to legislation than legal opinion--there must be, otherwise lay people such as the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone and I, and many others, would not be called to make an input. That is an important factor. I shall not overstate its importance, but I do think that the hon. Member for Basingstoke was correct when he said that it is a signalling by the Government of their route. However, I disagree with him in that I think that the signalling has not gone far enough--the signalling is towards normality.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman described a move--any move--towards jury courts as a ``futuristic aspiration''. I would have thought that that was an overstatement of the normal application of law in any normal society. I would not have described it as futuristic or an aspiration. I would have thought that it was a statement of the desire and the intent of the Government and our whole society for the normal application of law as represented by jury courts.
<P>
The jury courts system has defects--that will always be the case in societies that contain an abnormality. It works both ways in the north of Ireland. The nobbling of juries has been referred to by the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone. Juries have been nobbled by paramilitary groups and from within communities--I have no doubt that that has been attempted. I know first hand that there has been nobbling of juries within the legal profession, and I have drawn attention to some such cases. Juries will be nobbled as long as the temptation exists, and the capacity for nobbling is not confined to paramilitary groups or to any particular community--it stretches even to the highest echelons of the legal profession. It must be resisted by lay people such as ourselves, who are part of the political process.
<P>
The proposal is insufficient in terms of certifying in. It is not too much to ask that we move towards a jury system as a signal from the Government that we are moving, however slowly and tenuously, towards normality in our application of law. I repeat that I have reservations about the jury system even in the most normal of circumstances. I believe, however, that the signal towards normality is the important thing.
<P>
Three recent instances have been referred to: two took place in my constituency--in Cullaville and in Ballinderry--and the other took place in Armagh and Lurgan. If I were convinced that the Provisional IRA, Continuity IRA, INLA or whatever organisation would confine its activities to threatening people checking television licences, I might have more confidence in the future. I use that as an example because using guns and balaclavas to prevent people from checking other people's television licences, which has taken part in certain parts of the north of Ireland, is an absolute abnormality. That gives me--as someone who represents and comes from that area--an important message. One thing that the IRA does not risk is its guns or volunteers; it does not risk them willy-nilly and it would not risk them on such activities.
<P>
We must put those activities into perspective. What happened in Armagh and Lurgan was quite unforgivable--a stage-managed situation in which armed people wearing balaclavas prevented other human beings from going about their business, thereby costing them their livelihoods. That is crucial, because we should protect normality as well as aiming for it in the legal system.

<P>

<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I want to have the hon. Gentleman's point clarified. Does he claim that it does not fall within the IRA's bailiwick to dominate an area and administer every aspect of it? That does not accord with my experience. Terrorist organisations are jealous of what they consider to be their territory. They mete out punishment when they wish to make their presence felt. If they tell the people of south Armagh that they do not believe that the Brits, the British authorities, should exercise their right to enforce payment of television licences, and that stance makes them popular and ``the law'', they will continue their activities, risk their volunteers and use their guns. I have seen that happen in various areas. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would not gainsay my point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> I certainly would not if I knew what the point was.
<P>
I believe that, in his own way, the hon. Gentleman makes the point that I made. Paramilitary groups cannot swim in the pool of normality. They have to continue to create abnormality--through television licences, or the events in Lurgan and Armagh where people going about their business lost their livelihoods. One man lost his freight lorry, and thus his business and his income, to satisfy the lust for abnormality that exists within many paramilitary organisations. It has reached the point of absurdity. The hon. Member for Fermanagh and Tyrone mentioned television licences. That highlights the absurdity.
<P>
Various legal opinions exist about certifying in and certifying out. I have been given figures from official and legal sources. Therefore, I am not sure of their veracity. They show that 85 per cent. of cases are certified out. Whatever the figure's accuracy, an important question should be asked: who certifies them in and who certifies them out? I am being careful, but, as I understand it, the Attorney-General certifies cases in and out. That is a key point.
<P>
When certification exists, there must be a power of decision. Granting that power to the Attorney-General is pragmatic, and also sends out a political signal. If the figures are correct, 85 per cent. of cases are certified out by the Attorney-General. Would not it be more advantageous and beneficial in terms of pragmatism and making a general political statement, for the Attorney-General to deal with the 15 per cent. of cases that are certified in rather than the 85 per cent of cases that are certified out? I may be wrong and I await the Minister's clarification. The key point appears to be to look at the source of the power of decision. If it rests in both cases with the Attorney-General, surely we cannot be questioning the merit or quality of decision.
<P>
<H5>9.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
We are considering moving as quickly as we can to a normal society. If we do, we shall be able to gain confidence in the legal process and act pragmatically.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> The hon. Gentleman throws some doubt on my thinking. I see that the Minister is listening intently; no doubt he will clarify matters to our satisfaction later.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> If I have the chance.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I shall give the hon. Gentleman a chance to intervene.
<P>
Schedule 1 of the 1996 Act lists the various offences. If someone is charged, it automatically goes in the frame. Nobody certifies people in; they are there because legislation has defined the offence. The Attorney-General then decides whether the matter should be passed on to a Diplock court or whether it is appropriate for a jury. It is the Attorney-General who makes that decision in almost all cases. No doubt the Minister will confirm that later.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> The hon. Gentlemen's intervention confirms the certitude with which we are both making our observations. If the power of decision rests ultimately in both cases, as I suspect it does, with the Attorney-General, irrespective of the legislation--I understand that some 85 per cent. presently fall into the category defined in the legislation and that the Attorney-General takes the decision to certify people out--would it not be more efficient to have the 15 per cent. certified in from the same source of power?
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> We are almost there. The main difference is that Parliament makes the first determination in terms of the definition of the offence. I return to my earlier point. If the power to deny people a trial by jury is given to the Attorney-General as a prosecuting authority, it puts him in an invidious position. Certifying in is achieved under the definitions in the schedule. The Attorney-General considers the cases and decides whether trial by jury is appropriate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> We are getting somewhere, although I am not sure exactly where it is. We seem to have some agreement over the distinction between powers laid down by legislation through Parliament and powers resting with the Attorney-General to decide what should be certified in. Whatever the distinction--I hope for further enlightenment from the Minister--neither could be remotely described as a terrorists charter. Whether exercised strictly in terms of existing legislation or the Bill, or whether decided by the Attorney-General, those powers over certification cannot be described as a terrorists charter. That comment, made by the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone, was fanciful and unfair both to the legislative process and to the role of the Attorney-General.
<P>
I read the Minister's observations with interest after Second Reading. Doubts arise about the source and application of the power. When we are clear about that, the hon. Gentleman and I, and others, will know exactly where we are going.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cran:</B> I welcome you to the Chair, Mrs. Michie. I know that you will give scrupulous decisions when they are called for, which, happily, they have not been so far.
<P>
My contribution will be relatively short by comparison with some, although they were necessary to tease out the Government's intentions. None of us on the Conservative Benches is saying that any of the Government's aims is anything other than we, in their circumstances, would have sought. But we have to know their reasons. This is a condemnation of how we govern the country. Legislative proposals are published, and an explanatory document issued by a Department, giving the bare bones of the Government's intentions. The Government should tell us why they have taken certain decisions. As with all the questions on clause 2, I suspect that if they had done so the debate would have been considerably shorter. [Interruption.] I realise that Government Members are becoming fractious but methinks they doth protest too much; occasionally they all ignite. We have seen them rise after writing tomorrow's correspondence and so on.
<P>
With this and the previous clause, and no doubt the following one, and the one after that, Labour Back Benchers have simply suspended their critical powers. I am exceedingly sorry about that.
<P>
My contribution will be short because I do not want to hang around here any longer than necessary, although I suspect that the Government feel differently. I intended to sit listening to better speakers telling me why the critical clause 2 has been written as it has. But I felt a speech coming on--albeit reluctantly because I did not wish to make a speech--when the Minister spoke on the previous clause. I am addressing myself to clause 2 stand part--I know that you, Mrs. Michie, are becoming anxious. I wanted you to know that I understand that.
<P>
The reason for my speech is that the Minister castigated us for not going into the in-timbers of the previous clause, so I want to reassure him that this will not happen with clause 2. I am delighted that my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Cambridgeshire has gone to considerable lengths to reach the in-timbers of clause 2; reluctantly, I will have to do the same.
<P>
I am delighted that I have ignited a little the interest of Labour Members. Perhaps they will take some notice of what is going on, and start to listen. The Government are often called the people's Government. No doubt they will wish to side with ordinary people in the Province and elsewhere. I am sure that the population is not drooling over the Bill, but people will read commentaries about it in the press. The more facts that we get into the public domain and the more that we tease out the Government's intentions over clause 2, the better. We must allay fears.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that confidence-building measures are among the main imperatives of the Bill? If so, should not confidence be built on both sides of the negotiation? Did not the Committee's reaction earlier cause the Minister to admit that he had not explained the proposals well enough? It is important that the Committee tease out the information so that the Bill can be explained to both sides in Northern Ireland.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cran:</B> My hon. Friend displays his usual percipience in going to the heart of my contribution. I am growing uneasy at the tenor of the debate. I am also disappointed that Government Back Benchers merely titter at what they seem to consider a very funny subject. It is not a funny matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> Is not that dreadful?
<P>
<B>Mr. Cran:</B> The Minister should try to control his Back Benchers, who I see have returned to writing their letters, to obviate accusations such as the one that I have just made.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for North-East Cambridgeshire was right. It is a question of the signals that the Bill sends to the community. I have listened carefully to the debate and have become worried that my hon. Friend is right. The Government may be sending the wrong signal, or one that is heard by only one side of the community. I hope that the Minister will deal fully with that problem. Some people in the Province may not be as confident as the Government.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> It is a question of building confidence in Northern Ireland so that the community can return to normality. However, is it not of the essence also that people should have confidence in the ability of the Attorney-General--who is answerable to Parliament--accurately to specify in rather than specify out?

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Cran:</B> I have enormous respect for the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh. I seek no arguments, and the hon. Gentleman has put forward his point of view. However--
<P>
<H5>10 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Sitting suspended for a Division in the House.
<P>
<H5>10.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
On resuming--
<P>
<B>Mr. Cran:</B> Before the suspension I was replying to an intervention by the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh, who is not in his seat at the moment. He was saying that confidence-building measures were exceedingly important. I have no difficulty with the hon. Gentlemen's proposition, and I do not think that what I was saying was inconsistent with what he was saying. We were making two different points.
<P>
I know that you, Mrs. Michie, will be listening carefully for any sign of my repeating what I have already said. I assure you that I would do no such thing, but before I get into the timbers of the Bill I want to express my concern about the signals that the Government are sending to the community. They are sending one set of signals to one side of the community and another set to the other side. Lest you be worried about me straying from the Bill, Mrs. Michie, that is true of any of the clauses; it is certainly the case with clause 2.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I do not want to prolong the debate, but as the hon. Gentleman is an official spokesperson for his party, will he say more about the signals that he believes the Government are sending to the nationalist and Unionist Communities? Perhaps that would help my understanding of the Opposition's criticism of these confidence-building measures.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cran:</B> I would put it in this way: it is clear that we have different views on certain aspects of this subject, as would be the case with other subjects. I am content to leave it for others to judge whether the signals that the previous Conservative Government sent were right or wrong. Similarly, people will judge the current Government on the signals that they are sending. The Minister cannot expect me to justify what my Government did.
<P>
By the bye, having served under the former Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Sir Patrick Mayhew, I can say that his record was very honourable. He made strenuous efforts, as I know the Minister and the current Secretary of State are doing. I repeat, however, that I am content for others to make judgments such as the one that the Minister asked me to make.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> The hon. Gentleman is making a criticism about signals. He is making a judgment about the signals that are being sent to either side of the community. That is what he said. What is his understanding of the signals coming not from the previous Government, but from this Government? Let him not make those implied criticisms; let him be explicit and say exactly what they are.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cran:</B> There is simply no need for that. The Minister has been here throughout the sitting listening exhaustively, to the debate, as you have, Mrs. Michie, and as Opposition Members have. I think that he will conclude from one or two of the speeches that we have already heard that there are different perceptions of this issue. I was merely making a suggestion. Nothing was in definite terms--I used words such as ``may'' or ``possibly''. I was merely asking the Minister to deal with the subject fairly exhaustively when he winds up--he has a lot to wind up on!
<P>
<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that confidence-building measures would be justified if the Provisionals were genuinely and exclusively committed to non-violence and democracy? If they are not, such measures become concessions and the impact is negative. The key factor is whether we accept that the Provisionals are genuinely and exclusively committed to non-violence and democracy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cran:</B> My hon. Friend is an authority on the subject and his comment stands on its own--I do not need to comment on it one way or another. His comment will certainly fall on the Minister's ears and create a slight feeling of unease, like we have about the signals that are being sent.--[Interruption.] I know that the Minister is getting impatient, but he should listen. He should remember that my hon. Friend the Member for Bracknell (Mr. MacKay), the shadow Northern Ireland Secretary, made it clear on Second Reading that we support the Bill in principle--there is no question about that. The Minister must not become fractious when Conservative Members try to get answers to one or two questions about one or two clauses, including clause 2.
<P>
If there are no more interventions, I shall deal with the Bill. My hon. Friend the Member for North-East Cambridgeshire made it clear--as I am sure that the Minister will shortly--that subsection (1) extends the Attorney-General's discretion to certify an offence out of schedule 1 to include several offences. Lawyers are good talkers, but I am of course a non-lawyer and not a very good talker. I am just thinking about the issue from the point of view of the individual citizen in the Province who may ask one or two questions. He may say to himself that, as regards extending the Attorney-General's discretion, the Attorney-General will have to make normative decisions. As is always the case in life, some of those will be perceived to be good and some will be perceived to be bad. It is obviously for the Minister to shoot me down on this matter and he will have his opportunity to do so shortly, but that in no way gets rid of the controversy and difficulty.
<P>
I am not sure whether my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Cambridgeshire alluded to the use of the word ``discretion''--perhaps he will give the matter some thought and let me know. I always worry about the use of that word because it gives a lot of latitude for decision taking and I wonder whether we are talking about giving too much latitude. Lawyers may not say that we are, but I am not a lawyer and nor is the Minister. When he stands up to speak, therefore, he will be able to apply his mind and direct his answer to the citizen in the Province who will be asking precisely the same questions as me.
<P>
I realise that my hon. Friends the Members for North-East Cambridgeshire and for Basingstoke and others have raked over the list of offences once or twice, but they are undoubtedly important and we must, with your permission, Mrs. Michie, revisit them. I hope that I am still within the bounds of order if I deal with the first offence--the common law offence of riot. As a non-lawyer, I am never sure of the difference between common and criminal law. I would be delighted if, in his reply, the Minister would give us a dissertation on that point. It would certainly enlighten me, and when others come to read his answer, they would naturally be enlightened too.
<P>
The important point is the offence--if that is what one calls it--of riot. The Minister, hearing it once from my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Cambridgeshire, may think that that is a view held by my hon. Friend alone. I am trying to disabuse the Minister of that view. I would like to know the detailed answer to why the common law offence of riot is being so treated. I share the views of my hon. Friend when he asked, perfectly legitimately, about the advantages. I think that my hon. Friend mentioned the political reasons--I am not sure whether he used the word political; if he wishes, he can correct me now. None the less, that particular perception may be there. The Minister must get rid of it, and I know that he will be anxious so to do.
<P>
I do not for a second say that the Minister will answer this question, but it allows me to ask a more legitimate one. Why were all these pieces of legislation included within the original schedule? My hon. Friend the Member for North-East Cambridgeshire addressed that point, but I am keen for the Minister to address it too. That leads me to ask what the Government's rationale is in changing course and simply deleting these various offences from the schedule. I shall not become involved in the argument that developed--perhaps it was not so much an argument that developed between my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Cambridgeshire and the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh--because I began to think that there was a measure of, if not agreement, tentative consensus. That was good. However, I want to know from the Minister when he eventually replies, which I hope will be shortly, what rationale led the Government to change course from that of the previous Government. I know that the hon. Gentleman has that point on board.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> It is not only that we want to know why the Government have changed course from that of the previous Government. We would like to know why, after many years of argument, they have now adopted a position which is completely contrary to that which they argued against when the previous Government were in office. Why are the Government now going with Diplock courts and embracing most of the scheduled offences, tinkering with only half a dozen?
<P>
<B>Mr. Cran:</B> My hon. Friend asks a key question. It is slightly irritating, because it was going to be my next point--I have been robbed. Although the Minister could not rise when my hon. Friend was speaking, no doubt he could rise during my remarks to find some way of answering that question. I note that the Minister has not taken that opportunity to answer my point directly. The problem is that if he leaves it, what will happen? The point will be lost. I entreat the Minister not to lose sight of the point. Even if he does, we have it on our list of points which we will be ticking off as he answers them in his reply which, I repeat, I hope he will make shortly.
<P>
The next offence under this heading relates to section 1 of the Aviation Security Act 1982 and section 2 of the Criminal Jurisdiction Act 1975, which relates to the hijacking of aircraft, vehicles or ships.
<P>
<H5>10.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I have no intention of raking over the arguments that my hon. Friends have already deployed or the questions they have asked, but I say to the Minister that the decision is interesting and, in some respects, curious. Some, perhaps many, in the community will be asking tomorrow, or whenever they apply their minds to this point, what was in the mind of the Government when they made that decision. At the end of the day we are only searchers after the truth, trying to put this legislation before the community, which the Minister could also do--we claim no proprietorship.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> This is becoming boring. This is the second misunderstanding on this point. I had hoped that Opposition Members had gone away and found out what the Government are trying to achieve. Is the hon. Gentleman saying that every time that a hijack takes place, it is for terrorist purposes? Clearly, that would be wrong--there have been hijacks for non-terrorist purposes. Is he saying that in such cases the defendant should automatically be tried by a Diplock court, not by a jury?
<P>
<B>Mr. Cran:</B> I conclude from this exciting exchange--I am delighted that we are getting to the substance and detail of the Bill--that if at the beginning of the proceedings the Government had been rather more forthcoming about the details of their reasons for making certain decisions, people such as myself might well have been assuaged--who knows? At least the Minister has been given the opportunity, which we have been desperately trying to give him since the proceedings began at 4.30 this afternoon, to come forward with nuggets such as the one that he has just given us. I do not make quick judgments, being a canny Scot, so I will consider seriously and carefully what the Minister has said. However, we are not talking about only one offence--a whole list remains.
<P>
I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Cambridgeshire, who spoke rather eloquently about offences under section 2 of the Nuclear Material (Offences) Act 1983, which relates to offences involving nuclear material, preparatory acts and threats. There is no point in me raking over that again. If I understood him correctly--I took down his words--he said that perhaps the Government have a case. On reflection, I also take that view, so I will not proceed further on that point.
<P>
I want to deal with subsection (2), which relates to section 29 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861, which, for the edification of the Committee, relates to causing explosion or sending explosive substance or throwing corrosive liquid with intent to cause grievous bodily harm. Clearly, all those are serious offences, as my hon. Friends the Members for North-East Cambridgeshire and for Basingstoke said. That view will be shared by a majority in the Province. They will recognise that these offences are extremely serious. It comes to my mind, and may come to their mind, that this legislation is from 1861. I should have checked it--I did not know, however, that I would make a speech this evening. If I had not been provoked into making a speech, I would not be in this position. I have to say that I did not check whether the 1861 legislation is covered by much more recent legislation. Time and time again, the Committee can see that if the Government would be more forthcoming about the reasons for their actions, I would not be asking these questions.
<P>
As the Minister knows, I could make exactly the same point about offences under section 2 and, my goodness, under section 3 of the Protection of the Person and Property Act (NI) 1969, which relates very importantly to the making or possession of petrol bombs in suspicious circumstances and the throwing or use of petrol bombs. Alas, too much has been seen of that in the Province, happily not of late, but certainly in the recent past. I must again ask the Minister why the Government have taken this particular decision. If he is able to give the Opposition the detailed answers that we are seeking, he will perhaps go a long way towards assuaging a certain sector of public opinion.
<P>
I am not straying from clause 2, and the fact that you, Mrs. Michie, have not so far intervened suggests that I am ploughing a lonely and narrow furrow. I am, however, doing my best. I have missed out a screed of my speech--it was written hastily--in the interests of hon. Members who are beginning to sag in their places and get down into their correspondence. I was arrested by the material.
<P>
Subsection (3) makes similar provision in respect of very serious offences, the first of which are under sections 2, 3 and 4 of the Explosive Substances Act 1883, which deals with serious matters. Unless the Committee's mind has been sagging, I shall explain what those sections relate to. The relate to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``causing an explosion likely to endanger life or damage property; intending or conspiring to cause any such explosion, and making or possessing explosive with intent to endanger life or cause serious damage to property''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am having difficulty reading this out for the benefit of Labour Members because they are all talking. I should have thought that that was moderately discourteous, given that I am trying to help the Government. I am doing my level best to help the Government. I shall finish the point about
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``intent to endanger life or cause serious damage to property''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Minister must explain to the public why he is taking his course of action. Prima facie, normal people may well be worried. After all, so far the Minister has not explained why. After I decided to make a speech, I took time to read the Second Reading debate. Lo and behold, the Minister offered no explanation there either. It therefore seems completely reasonable to ask the questions again. I hope that the Minister does not think me laborious, but the matters are serious enough to warrant repetition.
<P>
I feel that I may be approaching the end of my remarks--[Interruption.] Hold on, I may take that as an invitation to proceed. I have ditched large parts of my speech to be brief, but now I get an invitation from Labour Members to continue.
<P>
I think that I know your mind, Mrs. Michie, on this matter. I am looking at you carefully and guess that you are saying to yourself that you have heard this before--
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike Gapes </B>(Ilford, South): Several times.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cran:</B> I am again disappointed at the reaction from the Labour Benches, but very shortly I shall begin to conclude my remarks by saying that I am uneasy about some aspects of the Bill. However, I hope that when the Minister stands up he will assuage all my fears, and those of other hon. Members.
<P>
In conclusion, I want to know why the Government consider it necessary to amend the 1996 Act in the manner proposed, especially in light of the Home Secretary's very welcome announcement of a review of all anti-terrorist legislation. That is a legitimate point. If the Minister had covered that aspect in his speech on Second Reading, I should not have posed that question. However, try as I might, I could find no answer to it in the Minister's speech on Second Reading--which, as I said, I reread when I decided to make a speech tonight. He has a golden opportunity to answer now.
<P>
Another question asked in the Chamber on Second Reading concerned the number of charges brought under any of the offences, apart from those specifically related to terrorism, in recent years. If the Minister can give that sort of information, it will go some way towards assuaging the views of Opposition Members about clause 2, to which I think I am still addressing myself.
<P>
I want to ask a question of the Minister in a different way--[Interruption.] I am speaking above the talking that is taking place in the Committee. It is difficult to come to a conclusion other than that the Government seem to be making unnecessary concessions to those who have always opposed the Diplock system. I hope that I am wrong in that conclusion, but perhaps the Minister will put me right. In the interests of making a relatively short speech, I have not touched on the merits or otherwise of the Diplock system. I did not do so because my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Cambridgeshire did. I decided that I did not want to repeat his remarks, but the Minister leaves me with no other conclusion.
<P>
I am open to contradiction from anyone, but I believe that--in general and, perhaps, even in particular--the judgments handed down by the Diplock courts have been probably the only ones that could have been reached, for all the reasons, including intimidation, that my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Cambridgeshire outlined at length.
<P>
<H5>11 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
What I am saying--I have only two pieces of paper left and I am at the bottom of the first of those--is that the Government are being precipitous and engaging in the politics of tokenism, which is a pity a few months into the tenure of a new Government. Obviously, people have high hopes of the Government--I cannot say that I share them--but they are taking a dangerous approach to serious matters.
<P>
I am coming to my last few remarks. I fear that the Government have taken a broad brush approach to the clause. They do not want to answer questions about it. ``Gosh, how boring, let's get on with it and finish by 7 o'clock this evening,'' they say--but I like the detailed approach. I like to get down to the sentences and commas and to ask what a clause means. That is my preferred approach and I wish that it was the Government's. However, the Minister has the opportunity to match what my colleagues and I have done in a relatively short debate on an exceedingly important clause.
<P>
The community needs answers. Although I am a Scotsman, my seat is in east Yorkshire--[Interruption.] I did not hear the remark made by the hon. Member for Lewisham, West. Does he want to intervene?
<P>
<B>Mr. Dowd:</B> I will see you outside.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cran:</B> That is the second threat that has been made tonight. That shows how fractious Labour Members are getting. Many Labour Back Benchers have never sat through a Committee like this. They expected to be in the Committee Room at 4.30 pm and out of it by 7 pm, ready for dinner, and no vote in the House until 10 o'clock. But that is not how it is.
<P>
The community needs answers. Although I am a Scotsman, my seat is in east Yorkshire. If the circumstances that we are considering related to my community, I would want detailed answers. I must say--these are my last words--that the Province deserves no less. I look forward to hearing from the Minister.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I hesitated before rising, Mrs. Michie, in case some of my hon. Friends wanted to intervene. I welcome you to the Chair. This is your first time in the Chair of a Committee. I do not know whether you have learnt anything from tonight, but, if not, perhaps the learning will commence from this point.
<P>
I crave your indulgence, Mrs. Michie. I was asked about the RUC. A point was made about the religious or community balance within the RUC. Figures were genuinely given, but I should correct them for the record. At the time of the previous ceasefire, applications from the nationalist community to join the RUC were hitting 22 per cent. Now, it is about 15 per cent. Clearly, there were and are too few applications. The further we move towards a normalised situation in Northern Ireland, the greater the balance will be within the RUC. There is a long way to go to achieve anything like equality but the Chief Constable and senior officers are keen that progress should be made and working parties have been set up to achieve that objective.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> The Minister will understand that those of us who have been closely associated for years with the RUC would like it to be accessible to both traditions in Northern Ireland. We have heard the Chief Constable give evidence to various Select Committees to show why it has been difficult for members of the Roman Catholic tradition to join. Individuals have faced great traumas when joining the service.
<P>
What is the Minister's assessment, however, of the fact that during the first ceasefire, 22 per cent. of applicants were from the Roman Catholic tradition, while the figure has fallen to 15 per cent. during the second ceasefire? Is the Roman Catholic tradition disillusioned by IRA-Sinn Fein sincerity over moving from reliance on the Armalite to reliance on the ballot box?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I craved your indulgence earlier, Mrs. Michie, and said that if we had a detailed debate I would probably stray beyond the parameters of what is allowed. Hon. Members who wanted to pursue points have had the opportunity to do so and Members can always make their points in their own ways. It is a matter for the Chair to determine whether those points come within the rules of our proceedings.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> On a point of order, Mrs. Michie. With the greatest of respect, if the Minister begs your indulgence in addressing a specific issue, he has some responsibility, out of courtesy and protocol, to reach some logical conclusion and to enter into some sort of dialogue. The Minister cannot beg your indulgence purely for his own satisfaction.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Hon. Members have strayed a great deal during the debate and I should be grateful if everyone would stick as closely as possible to clause 2.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> Thank you, Mrs. Michie. I want to move on to clause 2 and the substance of the debate.
<P>
In opposition and in Government, our preference has been to change from certifying out to certifying in. No question was raised against that principle in the statements my party made in opposition and we took the idea on board the minute we came into Government. Considerable effort was expended on finding the best way forward on what is undoubtedly a complex matter--it was complex when we were in opposition and it is complex now that we are in Government. A wide range of options on how best to deal with the issue was considered.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I did not doubt for a second that the Minister and his colleagues took a close look at the issue, given the position from which they came--I am sure that they examined it in detail and tossed it around like a terrier. Will the Minister admit, however, that the previous Government did exactly the same time and again and did not ignore any ideas for change that were proposed?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> That may be so, although I have no evidence to that effect. What the previous Government did with the advice that they received was a matter for them. We shall see only the judgments that emerge from the examination of that advice. I explained the matter in the way that I did to assure the Committee that we had considered a wide range of options to discover how best to give practical effect to what we said in opposition.
<P>
The choice that I faced as Minister responsible for the Bill in consultation with my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and on the basis of advice from the Attorney-General's office and from those with responsibility for the administration of the criminal justice system was whether a move towards a full certifying-in approach was practicable and deliverable at present, or whether some other approach that moved us along the road towards the introduction of more trials by jury was preferable.
<P>
What has to be borne in mind from the outset is the background against which trials of suspects are held in Northern Ireland. The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire stated--his remarks were borne out by the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh--that the intimidation of witnesses and juries can take place, which distorts the workings of the whole judicial system. That is why the Diplock courts were found to be necessary in the first place, and my party has never doubted that; nor have we ever doubted the need for such courts in certain circumstances. The certifying-in of certain circumstances implies an acceptance that Diplock courts are necessary because of that backcloth.
<P>
The reality is that the threat and problem of intimidation have still not gone away. We had to examine the issue on that basis and the Second Reading debate took place against that backdrop. The question then was not about the need for the continuance of the Diplock courts for the foreseeable future but rather about the way in which cases are determined to fall within the ambit of those courts.
<P>
I would not say that the choice that was made, which is set out in clause 2, was easy--far from it. It involved weighing up various aspects and deciding the best way forward. On the basis of the advice that we received--I am sure that hon. Members respect the fact that Ministers have to take such advice into account--the Secretary of State and I decided that practical and real difficulties were involved in moving towards a full certifying-in process.
<P>
Not the least of those difficulties was the fact that adopting the approach before us would require a decision by the Attorney-General or some other authority--for example, a judge--to deprive individuals of a jury trial. At present, such a determination is made by virtue of the nature of the scheduled offence as laid down by Parliament--it has been defined in legislation. The integrity of the judicial system is thereby protected by Act of Parliament, which is a powerful argument that must be taken into account. We cannot discount the examination process that has gone on before and which is on-going.
<P>
The other difficultes likely to arise as a consequence of a full certifying-in scheme were of a more practical nature, although they do, again, impact on the judicial process. For example, in order to ensure that persons charged correctly with terrorist offences were dealt with before Diplock courts and treated in accordance with the special arrangements for preliminary inquiries and bail, a senior police officer would have to certify during the preliminary stages of prosecution that a praticular case was connected with terrorism. That would expose the police to judicial review, and certifying in with confidence could prove to be more exacting and time consuming than certifying out. That is our assessment of the situation. Those difficulties could not be ignored, nor should they be minimised. All hon. Members must take them into consideration and I am sure that every hon. Member who has spoken is fully aware of the balance of that consideration.
<P>
<H5>11.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Consideration was given to removing offences completely from the schedule, but the Secretary of State may already do that at any time by order. It was felt that the time had not been reached in the on-going normalisation of Northern Ireland to initiate such an approach. Obviously, that remains a possibility.
<P>
What was eventually decided is as set out in clause 2, which amends schedule 1 to the 1996 Act to add to the number of scheduled offences that can be certified out of the schedule at the Attorney-General's discretion and thus be tried by a jury. The aim is to ensure that, where it is possible and correct to do so, the normal criminal procedures are applied. As the Committee is aware, a number of schedule offences must automatically be tried by Diplock courts, yet it is conceivable that some of those offences could be committed in circumstances not connected with an emergency.
<P>
I gave the example of a hijack of an aircraft. The hon. Member for Beverley and Holderness (Mr. Cran) refused to respond to the point that I put to him. It is not automatically the case that when an aircraft is hijacked it is done for terrorist purposes. If it had not been hijacked for terrorist purposes, it would be wrong not to allow the defendant to be tried by a jury. That must be the judgment of the judicial process, not of politicians.
<P>
We could go through every one of the offences listed by hon. Members and find examples of a similar nature. Not every riot is associated with terrorist offences and not every hostage is taken in connection with terrorist offences. We could go through each of the 11 points listed in the Bill and think of different circumstances in which it would be wrong to deny someone charged with those offences the right to trial by jury. No Opposition Member responded to that point, and when I gave the hon. Member for Beverley and Holderness an opportunity to do so, he simply ran away from the logic of my argument.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> That point was addressed--I believe that I responded to it. He is being trite. The greater number of cases of aircraft hijacking relate to terrorist activity. In so far as we define terrorism, I think the Minister would agree that we cannot tie terrorism specifically to organisations. Terrorism is an attempt to influence society by terrorising it. Aircraft are among the most vulnerable targets for terrorists. The wonderful thing about British law is that if someone with a mental problem hijacks an aircraft, his or her mental state can be taken into consideration, but we should not start from the position--

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I remind the hon. Gentleman that interventions are supposed to be brief and to the point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> It is exceedingly difficult, when dealing with the Minister's remarks, to remain brief, but I accept your point, Mrs. Michie.
<P>
I shall conclude by saying that this issue is exceedingly sensitive and travel by air is extremely vulnerable because of terrorism.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I do not discount that for a moment. I set out why the Government have come to the decision that they have--a balance, one against the other, had to be weighed and struck. I beseech hon. Members at least to listen to the argument. If they are not going to respond reasonably--
<P>
<B>Mr. Cran:</B> We are.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> The hon. Member for Beverley and Holderness was given the opportunity to respond, but declined. Is he going to respond now?
<P>
<B>Mr. Cran:</B> Does the Minister accept that I did not, to use his allegorical phrase, run away from anything? I am not here to provide the answers for the Government, although I think that I could do that quite as well as the hon. Gentleman does. I merely said to the Minister--he must accept what I say--that he should explain his rationale to the community. He is now beginning to do that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> Yes, but I shall finish my explanation very soon. I set out the rationale--the justification--for dealing with particular scheduled offences. The circumstances of each case would be considered, but a scheduled offence would not necessarily be of a terrorist nature. If so, it would be wrong automatically to use a Diplock court.
<P>
<B>Several hon. Members</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> No, I will not give way. Hon. Members have had plenty of opportunities to explain their position. They do not understand the force of the argument, not because they are unintelligent but because they do not want to make progress on the Bill. We face a measure of filibuster, and that detracts from the quality of the debate on such important issues. At this time of night it is unlikely that the world is listening to the rationale that has been set out or that people will read in detail what Hansard reports.
<P>
The truth is that my point remains unanswered by the Opposition. If they do not answer it, that implies that they do not accept my point of view, which would be a failure to address the issue realistically so as to assist the public's understanding of this complex issue. The Conservative party was only recently in government--their behaviour is a sad reflection on the role that it is now performing in opposition. If Conservative Members want to help the public they should respond to the point and at least accept--or dispute--the rationale behind it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> When I spoke earlier I tried, as a lay person, to distinguish between two points of view. Now it seems that there are three. On certifying in, does the power of decision rest with the Attorney-General or with Parliament, or am I to understand that it rests on the opinion of a senior police officer, as applied to a position taken by Parliament? If that is what the Minister was saying, it is even more difficult to understand why confidence is not placed in the Attorney-General, in all cases, to certify in as opposed to the responsibility to certify out resting with an anonymous senior police officer.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> That debate took place between the hon. Gentleman and the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire, who then set out his understanding of the legislation. He was correct in his assessment of how it works. In my opening remarks I expanded on that process. I repeat the most important aspect of the matter. The decision to certify in rests with the Attorney-General. If he took such a decision, he would be denying the right to trial by jury. Complications flow from that but that does not mean that a solution cannot be achieved at some point in the future. We have tried to find the best way forward at present, because Northern Ireland is not a normal society. We are trying to move the process further forward to give more flexibility within the existing legislation by allowing the Attorney-General to exercise his discretion in those areas listed in the Bill.
<P>
That is an important step forward. It may not be enough to satisfy the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh--he has a very strong and particular view on this point, and I respect that. However, we believe this to be the best way forward when it comes to a balance between assessing the complexity of the issue and giving it practical application within the procedures to ensure the maximum protection for all offenders charged under existing law. This does not necessarily mean the end of our examination of these matters.
<P>
Normalisation is bedding itself into the culture of Northern Ireland. I appreciate that Opposition Members do not necessarily believe that to be happening; they do not even think that we are making progress. That is a matter for their judgment, but that judgment is wrong. We know that from listening to the people of Northern Ireland. They know that progress is being made. It may not be rapid or substantial progress, but that can be achieved if those who have responsibility for dealing with opinions in Northern Ireland proceed to talk, to reach points of accommodation, advise those who oppose them of their point of view and examine ways of achieving a normal society in Northern Ireland. Matters rest with the politicians in Northern Ireland and the people. They have a big responsibility in taking that on board.
<P>
That is the process in which we are engaged; it is what the talks process is about. As normalisation begins to take effect, this type of legislation--and this aspect of it--will come under further scrutiny. We said in the debate on clause 1 that it would be desirable if we did not need such legislation. But we do need legislation of this nature, whether it is emergency legislation, as it is now, or whether it is permanent, as the Government hope that it will be in the longer term.
<P>
That is the reality of the situation. We must always look to a better future, and we are seeking to do that through this clause. The overall thrust of the clause is to move the process closer towards applying normal judicial procedures in certain circumstances at the discretion of the Attorney-General. That is an important step forward, and we hope that it will be recognised as such.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> No. I have resumed my place.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I want to pick up on a couple of the Ministers comments. He seems to getting a bit fractious; I understand that, because it is late at night and we have have had a lengthy debate. However, the points at issue on the Diplock courts and certifying-in and certifying-out are extremely complex.
<P>
The Minister has not answered the main thrust of our argument as to why, in Opposition, the Government were totally opposed to a situation which they now go along with. The hon. Member for Newry and Armagh has been on his feet three times; he attempted to intervene a moment ago, because he does not claim to understand, even at this stage, exactly what is going on. I do not know whether the hon. Member for Hull, North understood that on Second Reading. He has been involved in Northern Ireland affairs for the Labour party for one or perhaps two decades--I know not which, but for a very long time--and has been through all this many times when in Opposition. It is puzzling that previous Labour party policy has been abandoned.
<P>
The Bill is much the same as legislation that the Conservative Government introduced and supported through thick and thin over many years. It is not good enough for the Minister to say, that we have not answered his questions. We have asked questions because we did not understand what the Government were getting at. That is the point of opposing a measure in Committee. I am still not absolutely certain, and I know for sure that neither the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh nor the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone are certain about what the Government are up to. It is a difficult subject.
<P>
I have just one question for the Minister. Forget the list of items that can be certified out--has a situation never arisen when an offence has been committed under schedule 1 but the Attorney-General has decided that it was patently not a terrorist activity and therefore certified it out? Has he never made such an intervention, even under existing legislation?
<P>
<H5>11.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> I have a certain problem with this. I can fully understand circumstances in which certifying in is decided by Parliament under the terms of the relevant legislation. I understood that the current provisions were binding except in the case of a decision by the Attorney-General. I can see why the Attorney-General has the power to certify out--in that way, a legal decision rests with someone who can answer to Parliament about why something is certified out. I am, however, beginning to understand--I think--that there is a grey area where the opinion of a police officer, as yet undefined, can decide cases that are in between.
<P>
If I have understood the Minister's reply correctly, it must be questioned by any Parliament. If we must have emergency legislation--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman is making a very long intervention. Perhaps he could conclude it now.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> I shall try to do so, Mrs. Michie. Where does the power reside? With Parliament through the legislation; with the Attorney-General through the power that is devolved to him; or with a police officer of whatever rank, through his interpretation of the legislation?
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> The question is a pertinent one. However, it should be addressed not to me but to the Minister. When I sit down, I hope that the Minister will take the opportunity to answer the hon. Gentleman's question.
<P>
Perhaps I may try to help. I think that the hon. Gentleman heard the Minister explain that although the Government had considered certifying in, that would have involved a senior policeman identifying the offence at an early stage in order for it to proceed through the system so that the Attorney-General could say, ``Yes, that is a certifying-in case''. A police officer was mentioned in that context. The Minister went on to explain why the Government, having considered the issue, felt that they could not proceed in that way.
<P>
The Conservative Government must have considered the same issue--I did not, because I was doing other things--when, as happened frequently, we came under pressure from the Labour party about why we were not changing the legislation in the way that the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh now wants to change it, even though the party that he supports--in a roundabout way--is introducing legislation which he feels is, in the main, helping his community.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> I never offer support in a roundabout kind of way. The former Minister and the present one will understand that. Power either derives from legislation and Parliament or it is devolved to an Attorney-General. It would be an arbitrary assessment to place power somewhere in between.
<P>
In such a differential acceptable to Parliament and one of its Committees? We must be precise when it comes to emergency legislation. Someone ultimately is responsible in law and in court. If legislation has to be introduced, so be it--however unacceptable. If power is devolved to the Attorney-General--so be it. Giving power to a person in between who is not responsible to Parliament gives rise to a crucial constitutional question.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> No. The hon. Member for Newry and Armagh was making an intervention.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I am more than happy to act as a conduit for questions from the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh to the Minister. The Minister will probably stand to answer some of the questions that he has raised, but I suspect that the hon. Gentleman was slightly confused about what the Minister said earlier.
<P>
In his closing remarks, the Minister said that there was no intention to remove the Diplock procedure. I am sure that that is true as it applies to the new Government and that it is part of the negotiations. However, some of the Minister's colleagues said clearly, on Second Reading in 1996 and in Committee that year, that the policy was to do away with Diplock courts as soon as possible.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> The last point made by the hon. Gentleman shows some movement towards understanding. The Diplock courts could--and I hope would--be done away with when Northern Ireland's move towards normality made it practicable.
<P>
That was always the case. I said that earlier but clearly was not understood. It was not that circumstances did not exist that necessitated the Diplock courts. They did, as I said in my remarks, but we must find ways to move towards a normal jury system.
<P>
I hope that Opposition Members support that. It is the best way to deliver justice in a democratic society, but peculiar and unique circumstances apply in Northern Ireland.
<P>
When I accidentally intervened in the intervention from the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh, the hon. Gentleman was making a point about power. At the end of the day, the Attorney-General determines the certifying classification. The process of legislation devolves powers to others to make an initial judgment, but it is up to the judicial process to arrive at the final conclusion. I hope that that satisfies the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon indicated dissent.</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> We could spend all night on this debate, and I have offered my explanation two or three times. I am sorry that the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh is shaking his head. His lack of understanding may be due to the time of night, but I can make my explanation no clearer. We shall return to the matter on Report, and perhaps a more precise explanation can be found then.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> I do not want to spend too much time on this question. I understand that the power resides with legislation, although I do not accept that. I understand that power resides with the Attorney-General, although I do not fully accept that. The Committee is being asked, however, to accept the residence of power with the professional but subjective decision of a police officer--somewhere between legislation and the Attorney-General. The police officer who gives that professional opinion is not answerable to the Attorney-General or to Parliament. That constitutional problem is the difficulty that I have with agreeing to the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I have explained that point, and I can only repeat what I have already said to the hon. Gentleman. It is clear that the power rests ultimately with the Attorney-General, who makes the decision. The Government are taking action that will allow more discretion to apply to the consideration of scheduled offences that would now be classified automatically as terrorist offences. We are trying to normalise the process.
<P>
I hope that the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh accepts that it is a step forward. It is not as big a step as he wants. I have tried to explain the balance that the Government had to take into account. I said that ideally, we would work towards a full certifying in. If we took that approach, Diplock courts would not disappear. That shows the unique circumstances that exist in Northern Ireland, which is still a long way from normality in terms of the types of crimes under discussion. If people who are involved in the talks process have the right commitment--I know that the hon. Gentleman is an active participant--the process will move forward as he wishes it to.
<P>
That is also the Government's wish. For the sake of the people of Northern Ireland, I hope that progress can be made, and that the type of discussion that the Committee is having will be a thing of the past sooner than many of us expected.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I congratulate the Minister on coming close to admitting what his difficulty has been throughout the debate on the clause. In opposition, new Labour asserted erroneously that it was better to certify in than to certify out. However, Labour Members must now realise how power flows from the legislature to the Attorney-General.
<P>
If they reversed their policy, and acted according to their previous opinion, they would create all the difficulties that the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh has articulated so clearly. We are moving the decision outside the control of Parliament, and giving it to the policeman, who has to decide whether to apply for an offence to be certified in. If the Minister had said that at the start, it would have lessened the difficulty of the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh. It is difficult for a party that has recently come to power to admit that the philosophy that it espoused for years was totally erroneous, and that it does not work in practice. I believe that we could make progress if the Minister would adopt the position that he reluctantly spoke of at the end of the debate.
<P>
<H5>11.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
If the Minister continued in that frame of mind, he would not constantly refer back to the responsibility of the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh and myself, who are engaged in the talks process. One of the difficulties that we have had--certainly I have experienced it--is that as the Minister digresses to talk about our responsibility in the political talks process, he is encouraging us to say, ``Minister, for heaven's sake, do not pre-empt us in what we are trying to achieve on behalf of society in Northern Ireland.''
<P>
We have had that difficulty not only with the Minister, who is probably less guilty and even, to a degree, neutered--if I may use that expression--by the Secretary of State. The hon. Member for Newry and Armagh and I are expected to arrive at a conclusion about the future of society in Northern Ireland, but what do we find? Every issue in Northern Ireland that we seek to grapple with and understand by virtue of our birth is plucked out of our grasp by an over-eager Government who want to put everything right on the basis that a degree of goodwill exists between the hon. Gentleman and myself.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> The hon. Gentleman is right on one point. I have taken part in similar debates ever since I have come to the House. Tonight is the first time that I have heard an absolutely honest appraisal of the differentiation between the power of Parliament in this matter, the power of the Attorney-General as devolved to him by Government and the reasonable assessment by a senior police officer. I commend the Minister for that. It is a tremendous advance, not a regression on the part of the Minister or the Government.
<P>
This is the first time in more than 12 years in Committees such as this that I have heard an honest and rational assessment by a Minister of the reasons for legislation. That is not to say that I agree with him--I do not--but at least he has gone to the trouble of setting out the issue in the three strands that should be identified, and I accept that logic.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> The hon. Gentleman and I come from the same background. We are simple village schoolmasters. We appreciate a degree of openness from the Minister and we pay due tribute to him. I would not say that it is the first time that I have heard openness from a Government, but the occasions have been few and far between. I am delighted, even though we had to trail that openness out of the Minister, that we have achieved that this evening.
<P>
I hope that the Minister will not speak again this evening of the responsibility of the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh and myself. We are an integral part of the society from which we come and we recognise our responsibilities. I offer a final thought to the Minister, to which he may want to respond: it would be helpful if legislation such as this--vague, do-gooder, fairly ineffective--were not brought forward again and again. Such legislation tries to pre-empt exactly what the hon. member for Newry and Armagh and I hope to achieve.
<P>
I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. I acknowledge his final declaration of his reasoning behind certifying out and certifying in.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I hear what the hon. Gentleman says about the Minister's openness and about the explanation that we teased out of him at last, but is not the most important point that the Minister has been incredibly courageous? He looked at the facts when he entered the Department, and rejected the dictates of previous Labour party policy. I admire him for that.
<P>
The problem is not to be found on the Opposition Benches. The problem lies with the people sitting behind the Minister--including the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh--who do not like what they hear because the policy has changed fundamentally.
<P>
The Minister deserves commendation, which is long overdue. He realised that he could not make the fundamental changes to the Attorney-General's power to certify in and out, for which the Labour party had pushed for years. His problem is not with us. As the hon. Member for Hull, North found on Second Reading, it lies with the hon. Members sitting behind him.

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I think that the hon. Gentleman was in the middle of an intervention so long that he began to think that it was a speech.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> You will be glad to hear, Mrs. Michie, that I am about to conclude my remarks, but, in due deference to him, I give way to the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> I shall be brief. It is the first time that a debate such as this has given me a clear definition of the powers of legislation and the powers devolved to the Attorney-General. The Committee has recognised that both must be informed by an objective assessment from a police officer.
<P>
I understand those three points of view. To some extent, I accept them, and I thank the Minister for the clarification that he has provided. It may not have been what I wanted to hear, despite what the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone says. At least, however, the Minister has allowed the Committee a clear understanding of the basis of this part of the Bill. I commend him for that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I have had two interventions. I agree with most of what the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire said, although he probably overreacts when he says that the proposal galls the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh, who has spoken for himself.
<P>
I do not want to sit down without eyeballing the Minister to some extent. He must begin to recognise that he and the Northern Ireland Office undermine the genuine desire of my party and, I believe, other parties represented here for a political agreement in Northern Ireland when he pre-empts us in the Bill and in the steps that he is taking in relation to Diplock courts. At times, he speaks as though he believes that he has a deeper understanding of Northern Ireland than those who were elected to represent constituencies there. That is not so, because each of us understands the difficulties that the other faces in reaching a political settlement. To virtually wipe away Diplock courts or, at least, to leave the onus on the Attorney-General to diminish the part that they play while terrorism is still a major problem is a dangerous exercise.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I knew that the eulogies would be too good to last and the bad comments have come in at the end. The hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone should read my comments about the onus on local politicians and the people of Northern Ireland to reach solutions for their future--that responsibility rests with local politicians. The hon. Gentleman's criticism that I was trying to give the impression that I had a deeper insight is not accurate; that has never been the tenor of my remarks and it is not the way in which the new ministerial team has gone about its business in Northern Ireland.
<P>
I want to deal also with the point about the way in which the Bill is set out. Legislation is set out in Bill form because it has to stand the test of legal examination. If the hon. Gentleman does not understand legislation or the notes on clauses, he should contact the Department. If he is not satisfied with any explanations that he receives, he should speak to the responsible Minister; if that is me, I will explain the rationale behind particular aspects of the legislation to him. That is a new way of doing business, which does not mean that the Government will always succeed; we want, however, to ensure maximum understanding of what we are trying to do. The hon. Gentleman will be aware of what has happened in this country in the past 18 years when there was no such willingness to engage with as many people as possible in the wider community. I will say nothing more, other than to remind the hon. Gentleman of which side of the House he sat on during that period.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I appreciate what the Minister says about consultation, which represents progress. I hope that it is not because of the hour that I have been given such a definitive promise. I am sure that he will extend to the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh the same courtesy, because he and I have clearly have similar difficulties with aspects of the Bill. The Minister must not give the impression that he recognises the difficulties of the Unionist side of the Committee, but not those of the SDLP side.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 2 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 3</center></H4>
<H4><center>Detention orders</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Members of the Committee have been in danger of straying into the realm of tedious repetition and using arguments that they or other hon. Members have used. I hope that that will not happen during the debate on this clause and that we will stick carefully to a discussion of what is in the Bill. Again, I make a plea for brief interventions.
<P>
<H5>12 midnight</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> Thank you for that guidance, Mrs. Michie. I hope to comply, to the letter. I also hope that I was not one of the offenders, but perhaps the record will show otherwise.
<P>
The clause is straightforward. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Section 36 of, and Schedule 3 to, the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act 1996 (detention orders) shall cease to have effect.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is a major change form the previous Government's position and is perhaps the most important aspect of the Bill. That was pointed out on Second Reading by Members on both sides of the House and of both persuasions.
<P>
We have been assured, not only this evening but at other times, that the new Government are following in the footsteps of the previous Government in terms of decisions on security matters and are not just listening to but acting on the advice of the Chief Constable and the General Officer Commanding. I am puzzled. Until recently the Chief Constable was happy that the measure, albeit suspended, remained in the Bill. Seven months later, under a new Government, we are told that he is happy for it to be removed. The Minister must explain so as to allay my fears. Bearing in mind our knowledge of his recent position, my hon. Friends and I suspect that he has changed his mind on the relative importance of the internment measure--detention without trial--which, in his eyes, sat easily in the 1996 Act.
<P>
Perhaps the key to the matter is remarks made by the hon. Member for Lewisham, West, who is not in his place. He is chatting to the Whip outside the Committee Room. When in Committee during the passage of the 1996 Act, he said that in the all-important, intricate and delicate business of confidence building, the Opposition--now the Government--thought that the measure could be omitted from the Bill relatively safely to demonstrate the determination of the then Government to seek a way forward. I paraphrased the latter part of the hon. Gentleman's remarks, but note the key words--``confidence building'' and ``demonstrate''. Once again, we are in the realm of concessions, of signalling to one side of the equation to bring about a change on its part. That was the clearly stated policy of the Labour party just over a year ago. It has not wasted much time in putting it into effect.
<P>
When in government, we believed--we still believe-- that the measure should remain, albeit suspended. No one is suggesting that there are circumstances at present--or that there have been in the immediate past or will be in the immediate future--in which the measure would need to be implemented. The current political climate is, as the Minister has said many times this evening, as good as it has been for some considerable time. The idea of implementing an internment clause in legislation is the furthest thing from our minds.
<P>
I think that everyone, including Conservative Members, would accept that in the 1970s the introduction of this measure was clumsy--ham-fisted, even-- and ineffective. We have no problem accepting that. It probably had the opposite effect from that which was intended. It was based on totally inadequate intelligence at the time, and it may have united part of the nationalist community along a road of violence and terrorism. We acknowledge all the problems that have been associated with the implementation of the measure about 20 years ago. However, that does not mean to say that there are no conditions in the future, and no circumstances that could arise in which we, as a Conservative Government, would not wish that measure to be part of our armament against terrorism.
<P>
We are faced with an extremely well organised, dedicated, ruthless and violent terrorist organisation whose primary aim--clearly stated on many occasions--is the overthrow of the state in Northern Ireland. It has been said--and I would not demur from this view--that the IRA is possibly the single most successful terrorist organisation in the world.
<P>
The normal criminal process has failed over these 20 or 30 years to deal with this inherent problem. That is despite the fact that in Northern Ireland, a unique criminal justice system has evolved over time, and in that I include the Diplock system and procedures. Those judicial measures, unique to Northern Ireland, have been introduced to try and cope. Even today, we cannot put hand on heart and say that all those special measures have coped as successfully as we would have hoped, because of the special circumstances in Northern Ireland and the nature of the IRA.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> The hon. Gentleman confirms what I said earlier, and I totally agree with him. The emergency legislation in place during that time has not succeeded. The hon. Gentleman is now saying the same thing. Is there not a different view to be brought to the question of legislation in relation to such activity instead of the type of legislation before us?
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> The hon. Gentleman has a point. I am saying that although we have made specific changes to the system in Northern Ireland, they are not perfect. But without those changes, the position would be far worse. Even the Minister has acknowledged that the Government have no plans to do away with the Diplock system until there is normalisation, or a situation which would be deemed as normal, in which case the normal judicial process that we enjoy in the rest of the United Kingdom could be introduced. I am not saying that the measures have been a complete waste of time, but they have not worked as successfully as we would have liked. They have limitations, but that is not the same as saying that they have not worked at all and that to do away with them would improve the situation, although I understand that the hon. Gentleman holds that contrary point of view.
<P>
The guilty in Northern Ireland often walk free--that is as true today as it was 20 years ago. The hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone is not here at the moment, but he has noted that it is a small community in Northern Ireland. People know each other and they know who the guilty men are, but because of intimidation, threats and the murder that has gone on, many of the guilty go free.
<P>
There have been about 3,400 murders during these troubled times, some 1,800 of which remain unsolved, which is a huge proportion. It could therefore be said that the process of justice has failed Northern Ireland's society, particularly the relatives of murder victims, not to mention the many thousands of people who have been maimed or crippled for life, both physically and psychologically.

<P>

<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> As we are debating clause 3, how would the retention of internment improve that situation?
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I am not saying that there is a connection between internment and the unsolved murders. I am trying to paint a picture of the unique situation of Northern Ireland.
<P>
The Government will argue--they decided to remove the provision--that we must, out of principle, move towards a normal system of justice. We all want that. The previous Conservative Government said the same on many occasions. We must judge whether the time is now right to make more progress in that direction. The Government's judgment is that they need to move more quickly to try to make progress. I disagree. I do not think that the signs are clear enough to make such a move at this juncture. I shall develop that argument later.
<P>
In the context of an extremely violent society and a terrorist organisation that is as determined and as skilful as any in the world, one must seriously consider specific and unique provisions with which to try to combat that. I admitted that we have not been wholly successful, but I do not believe for a moment that removing internment would cause the IRA's view of the situation to move in the direction that I assume the Minister hopes it will.
<P>
Let us remind ourselves of the situation in the Republic of Ireland. I called it southern Ireland earlier, which I should not have done. It should be the Republic. Similar detention law has been on the statute book in the Republic since the 1940s, but I would argue that there has been less justification for its retention there than in Northern Ireland. The Republic has seen nothing like the level of violence and murders that Northern Ireland has experienced.
<P>
It has often been said that if internment were ever to be used in the future--again, this is hypothetical--it would work only if it was done in the north and south simultaneously. There is much merit in that argument. If, however, the Government remove internment from the statute in the north, the south may still retain it. The south obviously feels that it needs that option up its sleeve, but the Labour Government are removing the potential effectiveness of internment, which we hope would work on both sides of the border with the two Governments working in concert.
<P>
<H5>12.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
On Second Reading, Labour Members said that by introducing the measure they were fulfilling a manifesto commitment. They said that they believed internment to be wrong in principle and morally wrong. They said that they could think of no hypothetical situation in which any Government would need to have recourse to this legislation. As I said, this legislation is in suspension, but it could be resurrected fairly quickly.
<P>
A responsible Government might, however, want to use internment if, for example, progress were made to a negotiated settlement, but full decommissioning had not taken place. How on earth one measures whether full decommissioning has taken place is, of course, the $64,000 question. That settlement negotiated between the parties would then take the test of a referendum. We know that the vast majority of people in Northern Ireland want a settlement and want peace, so I am convinced that if an agreement between the parties were put to the people, it would find favour.
<P>
There would then be a group on either side--I am talking not only about the IRA, but also the loyalist side--that could not stomach that agreement, so it would return to violence against both Governments, not just in the north but in the south. What would the Government do in that situation? Can the Minister say that if agreement had been reached, peace was in the offing and a small rump of dedicated terrorists caused mayhem, it would never occur to him that internment, even on a temporary basis, might be a tool to deal with that reversion to violence that would meet with popular approval?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> Throughout proceedings in Committee we have been suffering a repeat of the arguments that were made on Second Reading. The shadow Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, the hon. Member for Bracknell (Mr. MacKay) made that point then. I say to the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire that by using that analogy, he is going down a dangerous road. He is saying that schisms would be inevitable and problems would consequently have to be dealt with by internment. I said on Second Reading and I repeat--I will also make this clear when I speak to clause 3--that internment is the terrorist's friend and will continue to be, no matter how the hon. Gentleman or his colleagues argue. He must address that point if he is to deal seriously with the subject.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I resent the accusation that I am cribbing from my hon. Friend the shadow Secretary of State's speech on Second Reading. I am not, and did not mention this matter in my speech on Second Reading, which was very short. If the Minister had wanted me to make this point then, I could have spoken for more than 11 minutes. I am making a genuine effort to discuss a hypothetical situation that a responsible Government ought to consider, given the enormity of the problem that they might face. I tried to make my argument conditional on whether the plebiscite embraced the new agreement and the peace formula and on whether the majority of people in Northern Ireland felt that something serious had to be done to cope with terrorist activity.
<P>
Can the Minister envisage no situation in which he might wish that he could consider that option? To have such a power on the face of the Bill, and in suspension, would do no harm.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stephen Pound </B>(Ealing, North): It is reasonable.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman want to make a speech or intervene?
<P>
<B>Mr. Pound:</B> At about 3 o'clock.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I am glad that the hon. Gentleman agrees with me.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pound:</B> It was a reasonable comment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman drinking water--or gin?
<P>
A return to violence remains possible, even in the heady days of the current ceasefire. A comprehensive reading of Francie Molloy's comments a few weeks ago shows that that is a distinct probability.
<P>
No arms, bullets or weights of Semtex have been handed in so far. Decommissioning will be the thorniest problem of all. Who will know when the arsenals have been destroyed? I suspect that they never will be: it did not happen last time, and it will not happen this time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I become despondent when people say that they never expect terrorist weapons to be decommissioned and destroyed. I hope that the hon. Gentleman appreciates that people who live and work in Northern Ireland want that society to be normal in every respect. We cannot accept that illegal weapons will never be destroyed. However long it takes, we must create a society in which illegal weapons are unacceptable to the majority of people, right across society in Northern Ireland.
<P>
I understand the hon. Gentleman's anxiety that it may not happen, but happen it must. He and I must unite in saying that it will happen and in convincing people right across society that all weapons--loyalist and republican--must be destroyed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I take on board the hon. Gentleman's comments, which he makes powerfully. However, that position should be emphasised as strongly in the talks process as it has been tonight. It is for the Government, not the Opposition, to be required to listen. If they hope to achieve a settlement in their first or second term of office, they must convince people of the merits of a negotiated settlement.
<P>
I said that decommissioning is the thorniest problem. I return to the question of how we will know when weapons have been decommissioned. It is not enough to say that in principle all weapons have been destroyed, because in the end we cannot know whether they have been. Even with a settlement, those arsenals could remain in bunkers in Northern Ireland and the border counties. Weapons will be accessible to any rump terrorist organisation that cares to dig them up.
<P>
The IRA probably have enough Semtex and cheap fertiliser chemical to make bombs as big as the ones that blew up South Quay and Manchester every month for the next 10 or 15 years. The arsenal is immense. It could do massive damage, and it is in the hands of a small number of people. That is nature of the problem that might need to be addressed somewhere down the road. I do not mean to imply that that might happen only through a rump of IRA terrorists; it could easily happen through a loyalist rump.
<P>
We faced that reality in government. Tonight, we ask the Government to think again about the proposal. We need responsible government and a Government who face up to and are prepared for every eventually. The retention of the power is not and never was a signal of intent to use it. Nor did we overlook or refuse to accept the mistakes of the past. We did not keep the measure on the statute book just to remain inflexible and to set our face against change. We considered carefully--this came up on Second Reading-the representations of a number of distinguished individuals who are involved with Northern Ireland, some of whom we have mentioned, and bodies such as the Standing Advisory Commission on Human Rights. Many people campaigned for the removal of the power, but we took a political decision. We would still take it if we were in government today.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> You are not.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> All right.
<P>
We also believed that if the option to use the power was removed it would be impossible to get Parliament to re-enact it in a time scale necessary to fulfil the purpose of the exercise. The Government are effectively saying that they would never use such a power and cannot conceive of a situation in which it would help to bring about a cessation of terrorist activity. However, in the climate of substantial majority agreement, the power might be welcomed by the majority of people in Northern Ireland and perceived as being in their best interests. When discussing earlier clauses, the Minister spoke about consultation. What consultation took place on the removal of the power from the statute book? Will there be future consultation about that removal?
<P>
It is a responsibility of the Government to remain vigilant and flexible. The Minster must explain why they have seen fit to remove the power, although it has been suspended for many years and successive Government have never intended to use it.
