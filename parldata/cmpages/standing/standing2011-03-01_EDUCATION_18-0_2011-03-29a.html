                        <p class="tabbed">It
is a real shame to repeal the diploma entitlement for 16 to
18-year-olds. Diplomas will wither on the vine. I oppose the repeal and
do not think the clause should stand part of the Bill. Let me set out
the concerns that various bodies have expressed. The NASUWT has said
that the
clause<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000026">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“narrows
the curriculum and undermines parity of esteem between academic and
vocational courses. It is a retrograde step that will disenfranchise
thousands of
learners”.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000588">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>The
ASCL has
said:<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000027">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“This
must not send the wrong message about the future of vocational
education. We strongly believe that high quality vocational education
must be a key aspect of the education system and, as the government is
(rightly) going ahead with the raised participation age, the demand for
it is likely to increase. The government must commit to providing
quality options for all young
people.”<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000589">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>Unison

                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“The
repeal of the diploma entitlement is another step towards scrapping
diplomas and the vocational education opportunities that came with
them.”<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000590">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">What
is the Minister’s view on the quality and value of diplomas?
What support will his Department give to ensure that they can prosper
and thrive? What assessment has he made of the impact on young people
of narrowing the curriculum, both through this clause and through his
proposals on the English
bac?<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000029">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
have referred to the raising of the participation age, and it is right
that the Government continue with that, but the Minister himself has
admitted that the demand for vocational education, and specifically
diplomas, is likely to increase as a result of it. Can he assure us
that he will provide quality options for all young people, regardless
of their interests, rather than a narrow focus on a specific academic
route, as is suggested with the English bac? What plans does he have to
ensure that diploma supply will match popular demand? On the back of
the Wolf report, can he reassure us that, in the absence of diploma
entitlement, access to high-quality vocational education in schools
will
continue?<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000030">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">One
of the key things to allow diplomas to thrive is collaboration and
partnership with schools and with local authorities. If a young person
is in a rural area, 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 722<a class="bkMark" name="Column722">&#160;</a>
                           </div>and their educational institution does not provide a particular diploma
line that he or she wants to pursue, what redress is there to ensure
that provision is made? Given the repeal in the clause, how will that
young person be able to do the course of his or her
choice?<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000031">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">What
assessment has the Minister made of the impact of the repeal on levels
of NEETs? We discussed this in Committee last week. It is important to
ensure that we have positive, enthusiastic engagement from young people
in the education and training system. By repealing this valuable
qualification, we are losing something in that regard. I would be
interested in the Minister’s thoughts about the future of
diplomas with regard to those
concerns.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000032">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">

Graham Stuart</strong> (Beverley and Holderness) (Con):<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000689">&#160;</a>
                           </span> I will be
brief, as I am sure the Minister will cover all the ground that I would
want to be
covered.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000033">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
all want to see better vocational, practical education offerings for
young people, and we recognise that our historical efforts in that
regard have been poor. We should also note, though, that the diploma
was appallingly ill thought through. It was introduced by a
Secretary of State who simply would not listen. I remember
representatives of the awarding bodies appearing before the Select
Committee, where one of them described it as the most complicated
qualification that he had ever seen. As originally laid out, the
entitlement was technically undeliverable, not least in rural areas,
and it was phenomenally expensive for a remarkably small number of
people successfully qualifying for it. It was an expensive promise made
by the previous Government that could not be delivered and
unfortunately failed to do what it set out to do. As for the respective
positions of the Front Benches, surely Labour Members should show
greater humility in respect of the diploma because it is not an
unalloyed triumph of the previous Administration. On the contrary, it
was expensive and ill thought
out.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000034">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">However,
the shadow Minister referred to making sure that we have suitable
offering and a clear picture of where we are going in the aftermath of
the original vision of diplomas and entitlement across the 13 flavours,
excluding or including the academic. None the less, we need from the
Minister a clear idea of where we are, and I am sure that he will
remind us of a few more details about the catastrophic failure of the
diploma as introduced by the former Secretary of
State.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000035">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Not for the first or last time the Chairman of the
Select Committee is right. The diploma is difficult because of some of
the reasons that he outlined. None the less, when it was introduced it
was absolutely right that we gave it a fair wind, and I was the shadow
Minister responsible for that. We debated the matter at some length
when we were in Opposition, and my hon. Friend the Minister and I took
the view that the diploma represented an opportunity to provide the
quality vocational offer that the hon. Member for Hartlepool describes
as being essential to motivate those whose tastes and talents take them
down the practical
path.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000036">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Some
of the diplomas on offer are very strong in that respect. The
engineering diploma is highly regarded, partly because it was heavily
influenced by the engineering industry at the time of its inception.
The same can be

                           </div>true for the IT diploma. Several major IT companies played a key role in
helping to shape that qualification. Nevertheless, surely it is not the
role of the Government to force local authorities, and through them,
schools and colleges, to offer the whole line of diplomas. It would be
immensely difficult to offer all 14 diploma subjects in many different
circumstances, as my hon. Friend the Member for Beverley and Holderness
said.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000037">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Those
doubts were made clear at the outset. Indeed, we were uncertain whether
there would be sufficient resource capacity to deliver all 14 diplomas.
It is for schools and colleges to decide which diplomas are appropriate
for their cohort, which they have the capacity to deliver effectively
and which will deliver the best outcomes for their students. I want
that to be at the heart of what we now do and the amendments that we
are making to the existing provision through the removal of the
entitlements does just that. It places responsibility back into the
hands of the professionals to make those
judgments.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000038">&#160;</a>

an early opportunity, the hon. Member for Hartlepool will want to
welcome the thoughtful and sensitive statement on the replacement of
the EMA made by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, which
deals particularly with transport issues that are essential if we are
to allow provision in rural areas to match the best. It is important
that, when people want to take advantage of options that are not in
their immediate locality and outside the travel area designated by the
local authority, they can do so by being supported by travel. My right
hon. Friend made it clear that that was part of the package that he was
bringing
forward.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000042">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
want to make it clear that the clause does not remove diplomas or
prevent providers of 16 to 18 education from offering diplomas if they
wish. Indeed, the Association of Colleges has also told us that
repealing the diploma entitlement will make little difference to many
colleges’ continuing commitment to the qualification. I do not
think that they will wither on the vine, as the hon. Gentleman said,
and I do not want them to do so where they deliver a quality product in
line with pupil and student expectations and where they can be tested
against proper measurements of outcome, especially destination
measures. Those measures are a much better way of our judging whether
the system is having the effect that it should. That is particularly
true of vocational qualifications, where further learning and
employment are a key measure of whether those practical qualifications
have conferred competencies that have economic
value.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000043">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I do not want to repeat many of the points that I
made about clause 28, but I will anyway. I want to ask the Minister
about three or four of those key points. How does he intend to ensure
that there is a sufficient supply of diplomas at the fourth key stage
to meet the number and variety of subjects for which there will be
demand? There is a genuine concern about the Secretary of
State’s proposals for the curriculum. Does the Minister believe
that there will be a narrowing of the curriculum available to young
people? Is he concerned that, notwithstanding broader social and
economic considerations, the effect will be to drive up NEET levels?
There is little point in getting students to do that if they are
starting to become disengaged from the more academic, classroom-based
approach to learning, but are still ambitious to do things and consider
the diplomas to be more interesting and relevant to them and their
career. There is no point in pushing square pegs into round holes. Is
he concerned that there will be a higher level of disengagement as a
result of the
provision?<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000048">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Does
he believe there will still be a role for the local authority to work
with schools to plan diplomas for the fourth key stage? As it currently
stands, the clause seems to remove the basis of the local authority
role in developing a wider 14 to 19 strategy. The key point of having
the local authority as a strategic body that held the ring to help
local education providers was a positive step made as part of our 14 to
19 strategy. Finally, what about the disadvantage and disparity between
urban or metropolitan areas and rural areas? Will the Minister’s
plans not disadvantage students from rural areas who might want to
consider doing diplomas? My concerns are very close to those that I
raised on clause 28, but I would be grateful if the Minister gave us an
outline of his
thinking.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000049">&#160;</a>

clause 29 will remove the entitlement for all key stage 4 pupils to all

not yet in force, but were they to be implemented as originally planned
they would give an entitlement to pupils of that age to study any of
the diplomas and would have placed a corresponding duty on not only
local authorities, but governing bodies and head teachers of all

would have placed a huge burden on schools. It would have resulted in
all kinds of strange changes to timetables which would have been
instituted not for pedagogical reasons but purely for logistical ones,
to enable students to travel from one institution to another, so they
could partake of those qualifications. As my hon. Friend the Minister
said, that would be particularly hard in rural areas, which answers the
point made by the hon. Member for Hartlepool. It was never realistic in

                        <p class="tabbed">We
want to have increasing freedom and autonomy for schools, and we want
to relieve them of unnecessary duties and burdens, because that is one
of the cornerstones of our schools’ quality. Throughout the
world, the case for the benefits of school autonomy is now well
established. The highest performing countries in PISA—Finland
and South Korea—are characterised by individual school autonomy,
which is why the clause gives schools greater freedom to choose for
themselves which qualifications they want to
teach.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000053">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
with clause 28, nothing in clause 29 prevents schools or any other
provider from offering diplomas if they wish to. Nor does removing the
diploma entitlement signal a lack of interest by the Government in
vocational education, as my hon. Friend so ably demonstrated.
High-quality vocational education is crucial to our country’s
economic future. While it is vital that 14 to 16-year-olds receive a
core academic education, Professor Alison Wolf’s report clearly
sets out the value of high-quality vocational education alongside that
core to help prepare young people for further study and the labour
market.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000054">&#160;</a>

particular options on schools is not the answer. The importance of the

to the educational establishments listed was to ensure that all
relevant bodies were consulted during the development of the joint
local plan. By removing the duty, schools, academies, FE colleges and
other educational establishments lose the right to be consulted in the
development of local strategic planning for children and young people.
That is a matter of concern to the National Children’s

we go through this Bill, one begins to wonder whether the phrase

for Education, given that we never hear it pass the lips of any
Minister. Perhaps we can do a word search of all our proceedings to see
whether it has been uttered, I may be mistaken. I see that Ministers
are just checking between themselves whether it has been banned and
struck from the lexicon of coalition speak. It is surprising, because,
as I recall, the Liberal Democrats were extremely keen on Every Child
Matters, and when we were in government they often pushed us to go
further on that agenda, but now they are busily taking out of
legislation lots of the things that they pushed us to include. When we
do our audit of all the things that they have voted for in the Bill, it
will be interesting to consider what they previously urged, in some
cases begged, the previous Government to include in legislation. We
were, as every Government are, reluctant to impose too many duties on
education authorities, but, unfortunately, with the Lib Dems hectoring
us to include more, we occasionally had to give
way.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000065">&#160;</a>

his party, as a united vehicle, could have pushed through a lot of the

                           </span> I want to remind the
Committee of where the duty came from. It has its roots in the horrific
murder of Victoria Climbié in 2001. Lord Laming’s
subsequent report highlighted the lack of priority given to
safeguarding by the agencies involved in the case, which made it
difficult for professionals to work together
effectively.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000070">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
the Committee will be aware, in previous sittings I have raised the
issue of the importance of keeping children’s safeguarding as a
priority. The reality always is that the number of staff involved in
that work, compared with the numbers involved in educating children, is
tiny. It is only when horrific cases occur that the spotlight is
suddenly pointed at all the organisations involved, and everyone then
says, “What’s happened here? Why did the agencies not
work effectively together?” After a period of reflection, the
world continues, and Governments, whether new or not, put other
measures in place. For example, the last Government brought
children’s services together, and we discovered that,
unfortunately, a lot of children’s services departments did not
have strong leadership in terms of safeguarding, because not
unexpectedly, the majority of the leaders of such services had
backgrounds in education. It is for that reason that we considered
inserting the clause in the 2004 Act.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000071">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I have some recollection of the
2004 Act, but as I have said previously to the hon. Member for Grantham
and Stamford—I was in his position when that legislation was
debated in the House—I was unable to speak and we do not always
remember matters as well as when we take an active part in the
Committee. But I recall very well the circumstances that led to this. I
also recall, from my experience working in children’s social
services up to 2000, the frustration at times of dealing with others
parts of the local authority or schools and getting them to co-operate
on very important issues around safeguarding. Of course, that is not
the top priority in schools. Education is the reason children go to
school and that is what we expect. But unless we recognise
that we cannot deliver safeguarding effectively without the involvement
of all agencies, children will slip through the net. I therefore ask
Government Members to take those concerns seriously, because another
child will slip through the net and we will all start to look at the
systems and whether there is systemic failure. Please look now and
consider how to ensure that we do not lose the real benefits gained
over the past decade in children’s organisations working more
effectively together.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000072">&#160;</a>

                        </p>
                        <p>for
children’s well-being. Basically, that leaves it up to
individual schools to decide for themselves how they engage with local
authorities, health services, the police, probation services and others
that they need and rely on to support the well-being of children in
their
schools.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000074">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
we all know, well-being is a huge issue for schools. Children spend up
to six hours a day in school. That is 38 weeks out of every 52, and 190
days out of 365. It is a relatively short period of time, and we
recognise that the impact that the school can have will be seriously
negated if the child’s home, family and community is not right.
Many of the barriers to learning faced by children and schools exist
outside the school gates, and good schools recognise
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000075">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">My
son sat in this Committee last week. He is a head teacher and I am
incredibly proud of him. He was the youngest head teacher in the
country for about 30 seconds. He told me that in his school
he takes the matter of the child’s education and all the other
things that go along with that incredibly seriously. Every child in his
school has access to food at the beginning of the day.
They also have a nutritious meal in the middle of the day,
because he recognises that that has an impact on a child’s
learning and behaviour. He makes sure that every child who wants to has
something to eat before they leave school, because he also recognises
that many of his children will not eat again until they come back to
school the following
day.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000076">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
police are welcome in his school, as are social workers, parents,
school nurses and the whole range of people who contribute to a
child’s well-being. He is not alone. Most head teachers
recognise and respond to the problems in inner-city schools, in schools
working in challenging circumstances and in schools where children
traditionally had less opportunity to reach their potential. Head
teachers deal with the kind of children that the Government are telling
us daily in this Committee and in the House that they want to support.
But I remind the Committee that it is very often the most successful
schools and local authorities that have the biggest gaps in learning
and achievement for their poorest children, so it is not only in
inner-city schools and in schools where the majority of pupils are on
free school meals that we need to be mindful of
well-being.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000077">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Allowing
schools to decide for themselves how they engage in safeguarding with
others within the local authority, health services, the police and
social services will result, as my hon. Friend the Member for
Sheffield, Heeley pointed out, in some schools having major engagement.
Most schools will find a way of engaging, but some schools will have
virtually no engagement at all. Ultimately, that will result in the
fragmentation of services. As a result, young people, their families
and communities will be very badly
served.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000078">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I start by reminding the Committee that the duty we
are repealing in clause 30 is the duty on schools and colleges to be
part of children’s trust arrangements. The arrangements
themselves and the duties on other members will remain, notwithstanding
the clause. There 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 729<a class="bkMark" name="Column729">&#160;</a>
                           </div>are no plans to repeal the general duty to co-operate, which forms the
basis of the children’s trust arrangements. We fully endorse the
need for effective partnership working to secure better local services
for children, young people and families. It is the unnecessary
prescription that we are seeking to tackle. While I am on the subject
of partnerships, my comments about coalition are that we all have to
compromise in a coalition. That is the essence of coalition politics.
The Conservative party has compromised on a range of issues and so have
the Liberal Democrats. That is what co-operation and working together
is all about. I would have thought that Opposition Members understood
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000079">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendments would delay removing the duty on schools and FE colleges to
co-operate with the local authority through children’s trust
arrangements until the chief inspector of Ofsted has reported on the
operation of the duty under section 10 and that report is laid before
Parliament. It is not appropriate to delay removing that burden from
schools. First, the duty to co-operate was only placed on schools and
colleges on 12 January 2010. Just nine months later, we announced on
31 October 2010 that it was to be repealed. Given that
schools and colleges knew that we intended to remove the duty as soon
as possible, it would be strange to decide to inspect them on how well
they are complying with it in the
meantime.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000080">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Secondly,
and most importantly, we already know that partnership working is
effective without a statutory duty. The Audit Commission produced a
report in 2008 that showed that, without a statutory duty,
schools and colleges were already actively engaged in effective
partnership. As the hon. Member for Darlington (Mrs Chapman)
said on Second Reading, Ofsted has in fact already produced an
evaluation report, in November last year, on the impact of
children’s trusts in six local authorities. It found that
partnership working was already well established within local
authorities before schools and colleges were required to co-operate.
Much of the field work for that report was conducted before the duty
was commenced, and the identified success was through voluntary
co-operation. Many of the children’s trust board members whom
Ofsted interviewed for that report were not in favour of extending the
duty more widely, and emphasised the importance
of<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000081">&#160;</a>

Governing bodies of schools must have arrangements in place as part of

that their functions are carried out with a view to safeguarding and
promoting the welfare of children. On the comments of the hon. Member

                           </strong> No, we are confining what Ofsted will be judging a
school on to those four areas: teaching, leadership, attainment, but
also behaviour and safety. Within that last category, a school that was
blasé about safety and safeguarding children would of course
perform badly under leadership and management, too. If everything it
was doing about safeguarding contravened its duties under the 2002
Act—or, indeed, contravened what was expected of a school in the
21st century—it would be difficult for it to demonstrate that it
had effective leadership and management. Much of that will be found in
Ofsted’s current

however, want it to be a top-down and prescriptive approach, which in
the case of schools and colleges too often turns into a box-ticking
exercise. They go through the motions of ensuring compliance with a
particular duty, but the reality underneath is not of the quality that
we want. Many of the past barriers to partnership working have been
caused by heavy-handed, top-down performance management systems. We
want to encourage flexible and responsible partnership working that

said. Notwithstanding the Minister’s point about there remaining
a duty on schools to co-operate with relevant partners locally in
relation to the five outcomes in Every Child Matters—I think he
used that phrase, but he will correct me if I am wrong—he is
simply saying that they do not have to go along to the
children’s trust any more, because he does not like them and
wants to get rid of them. That is my plain-language interpretation. I
am trying to avoid jargon and to give him an opportunity to
intervene.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000093">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
well-thought-out position that was reached by April 2010 was that
schools should not only have to promote the well-being of pupils on
their school rolls, but co-operate to promote the well-being of
children across the area in which a school is situated as well. As I
have just hinted, we do not believe that the Government have given
compelling reasons why that position should be abandoned. There may be
dangers in abandoning it going forward. The Minister should exercise
care in this

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
140 seeks to probe one practical implication of the Government’s
approach. Local authorities are charged by section 436A of the
Education Act 1996—titled “Duty to make arrangements to
identify children not receiving education”—to find out
how many children in their area are missing education. A narrow
interpretation of that provision is that it refers to children who are
not on the school roll. The Department for Education does not
systematically collect information from local authorities, although
<em>The Times Educational Supplement</em> used the Freedom of Information
Act to find out that, on 11 February 2011, 12,000 such
children were known to local authorities. That was an increase from a
Government estimate in 2006 of 10,000. The reliability of those figures
is questionable. Some 30% of those children missing from education came
from one authority. There may be reasons for that. In this case, it was
Leicester. That is the background to the reasons for tabling the
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000101">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">A wider
interpretation of the duty that I mentioned is that local authorities
should work with schools to identify children who may be at risk of
falling out of school

Minister, as well as a teacher. Local authorities need schools to
co-operate if that is to be done. They need to know when a child stops
attending school. Staff, particularly in primary schools, because they
are so embedded in the community, are likely to hear about children not
receiving education in the manner that local authorities want. It is
only section 10 of the Children Act 2004 that places a duty on schools
to co-operate with the local authority and help it fulfil that
duty.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000102">&#160;</a>

a strong emphasis on safeguarding, if schools disregarded them, this
could quickly result in children and young people becoming lost to the
system. Officers in all the authorities surveyed gave examples of
schools which had not followed the agreed procedures for exclusions.
The vulnerability of such pupils was significantly increased because
they were out of school unofficially and preventative agencies were not
aware of their potentially increased exposure to drugs, alcohol misuse,
crime, pregnancy or mental health problems. The nine local authorities
in which there were academies were struggling to establish consistent
communication about children who were vulnerable to becoming missing,
despite good cooperation from some of the
academies.”<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000598">&#160;</a>

gives a green light for some schools to decide that they do not have to

also be at risk of neglect or abuse. Often they come from disadvantaged
families, experiencing multiple risks such as poverty, substance abuse,
mental ill health and poor housing. They might be from travelling
communities or immigrant families, or they might be unaccompanied
asylum-seeking or trafficked children. Nobody should
underestimate—the hon. Gentleman does not—the importance
of the issue, but it is difficult to see how amendment 140 would
help.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000109">&#160;</a>

have legislative provisions in place. Local authorities and maintained
schools, further education colleges and sixth-form colleges have
safeguarding duties under section 175 of the 2002 Act.
Academies are also required to make provision for safeguarding under
the independent schools standards and their funding agreement
with the Secretary of State. The Children Act 1989 and the
Education and Inspections Act 2006 both place additional duties on
local authorities requiring them to establish, as far as possible, the
identity of those children of compulsory school age who are missing
education and empowering them to apply for an education supervision
order.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000110">&#160;</a>

all schools are required to inform the local authority: when a pupil
fails to attend school regularly; when a pupil has been absent from

pupil has been removed from the school roll in specific circumstances.
Failure to comply with those provisions is an offence under section

                           </strong> Does the Minister accept that this is not only
about schools notifying local authorities if a child is missing from
education for more than 10 days? In many schools, if a child does not
turn up at 9 o’clock in the morning, somebody at the school
contacts the police, social services and the local authority because
there is a known risk to that child, either from being involved in
crime or where there are real concerns about the situation in which the
child lives. Current legislation does not cover that. It is about
co-operation between the school and a range of agencies because of the
situations in which children
live.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000112">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Yes, but requiring schools to participate in
children’s trusts is not the answer to that problem, as the hon.
Lady’s own son demonstrated. The Government believe in trusting
professionals to contact the relevant agencies when they fear for a
child’s safety. That is what schools do and will continue to do,
and all schools that are not doing that should do it. That is
absolutely clear. However, the duty to co-operate with other bodies and
the way in which section 10 of the 2004 Act is drafted in respect of
schools is not the most successful way of achieving that. We are trying
to relieve schools of the increasing number of statutory duties that
have become a box-ticking exercise. We are trying to get away from that
approach and to allow schools genuinely to tackle some of those very
difficult problems.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000113">&#160;</a>

us on his conversations about social care with his colleagues in the

originate within a school. Information about what might be happening in
a child’s background does not originate in the school, but has
implications there. Taking away the relationships that mean that

well. Will the Minister update us on the conversations he has had about

will continue to occur. Our argument is that we do not need
bureaucratic duties, such as section 10 as it applies to schools and
colleges, to achieve that. This is about humans dealing with one
another in a professional way. There is a range of legislative duties
on schools already, which I have highlighted—section
175 of the 2002 Act among them—that require schools to take the
kind of action that the hon. Lady is talking about without requiring
them to attend meetings of children’s trusts. Of course, the
health service is still under a duty to co-operate with
children’s trusts.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000115">&#160;</a>

reviewing the regulations to tighten up and extend the circumstances in
which schools must inform the local authority when a child is missing
school or removed from the register. We will also revise the statutory
guidance to clarify how local authorities can best carry out their
duties to identify children missing education. Any problems experienced
in monitoring and supporting outcomes for those children is therefore a
result of implementation, not of a lack of legislation. A recent Ofsted
report, to which the hon. Gentleman referred, made a number of
recommendations that the Government are considering seriously, but it
did not recommend further legislation to compel schools to co-operate.
Children missing education highlights important challenges, and the
hon. Gentleman is right to raise the matter, but I do not believe that

are removing the duties—I made that point at the beginning of my
response to the amendment. The purpose of clause 30 is to remove
section 10(10) of the 2004 Act, covering schools and FE colleges, not
to remove children’s trusts or the co-operation between
agencies, including the health service, that happens now. Having

missing from education is an important matter. The Minister says that
he takes it seriously and I believe him. He knows the complexities of
the problem and that it is one of those areas where events can
sometimes put Ministers in a very difficult position. I simply advise
him to ensure that he has his arguments lined up straight and his facts
and statistics ready. He may not have to deal with it—perhaps it
will be one of one of his colleagues—but when children missing
from education raises its head, and there is no longer a duty to
collaborate with children’s trusts on that, it might

Williams.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000124">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The amendment
reflects what I think will be a theme this afternoon—a growing
concern among Labour Members that the problems the Bill will
inadvertently create in matters that we care deeply about are legion,
and our rising fear that those difficulties have not been thought
through. I see the amendment and our debate on it as an opportunity to
test the consequences for a key service for many of our young
people—youth services and their provision locally, as well as
the relationships between schools and youth services.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000125">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">My specific
fear is that the Government are selective in their concern about
unnecessary prescription and what that might mean for services on the
ground. We have just debated safeguarding, and I urge the Minister, if
he has not done so, to read the report of the Laming inquiry and to
think again about some of the issues we have discussed. In youth
provision, relationships between schools and a range of organisations
bring benefits for both sides, and that is especially true of youth
services.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000126">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I see schools
as a key part of the jigsaw of providing youth services for young
people in any local community, and I know from the countless e-mails
that I have received over the past couple of days that many people in
the sector share that view. Labour Members therefore feel that it is
inconsistent to exclude schools from some relationships while health
care services, youth workers

			Column number: 736<a class="bkMark" name="Column736">&#160;</a>
                           </div>or mental health care services remain parts of such relationships. With
the amendment, my aim is to explore how we might be able to protect and
extend the good work that many schools are doing in partnership with
local authorities in the face of the changes that the Government seem
intent on making.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000127">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendment closely reflects section 507B of the Education Act 1996,
which is at the heart of this debate. My hon. Friend the Member for
Bolton West will talk about that, too. Section 507B ensured that, for
the first time, a single body held lead responsibility for securing
young people’s access to what are called “positive
activities.” There is a relationship with schools and to the
Bill because of the duties the Bill imposes to secure, as far as
practically possible, services that promote the well-being of young
people through the provision of educational and leisure-time
activities. Youth services have a role in supporting those aims, and I
want to discuss the two sides of that coin.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000128">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">First, it
benefits local authorities to have an active relationship with youth
services in trying to deliver services for young people and to meet
those aims. I am sure that everyone in the House sees that as a
positive, constructive contribution to our local communities. Secondly,
there are also benefits to schools in terms of the learning environment
that is created through working with those partners. My concern is that
if we start to unhook schools from relationships with local authorities
in the guise of removing unnecessary prescription, the public benefits
that we get from such relationships may inadvertently be lost. The Bill
needs to protect both sides of that coin, which is what the amendment
seeks to do.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000129">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In how
schools are supported, the amendment refers specifically to extended
schools. That relationship is comparatively new, but I am sure that
many of us have seen the benefits of the extended schools programme
beginning to take place in our local areas. In Walthamstow last summer,
a number of fantastic youth activities involving schools were provided,
which made a real difference to many young people. Pupils or people who
knew a school were able to use its facilities for activities that were
provided by a range of voluntary and statutory sector
organisations.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000130">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Such work
requires a lot of co-ordination. I am concerned that as we start to
unhook schools from local authorities, the relationships that enable
such co-ordination, support for youth workers and youth provision in
the broader sense deteriorates. To be frank, my local authority found
the work frustrating to begin with, because some schools were more keen
than others to take part—there was a difference in
schools’ appreciation of the value of working with the local
authority.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000131">&#160;</a>

                        </h4>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendment also highlights the importance of supporting consultation
between young people and parents in deciding what sort of youth
provision a local authority will offer. I am concerned that much of the
Bill seems inadvertently to remove the voice of parents and young
people in determining their services. The belief that professionals
will always work with young people in a uniform manner may be
mistaken—we cannot be sure of that. One aim of the amendment is
to ensure that where local authorities are working actively with young
people in determining youth services, they can draw on the support and
encouragement of schools in doing so.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000132">&#160;</a>

                        </div>
                        <p class="tabbed">The other side
of that is how youth provision helps schools. It particularly helps to
create the type of environment that the Ministers want in schools, in
which young people are supported to achieve. A later amendment, which
also reflects my concerns about the implications of the Bill for
special educational needs, mirrors a similar concern. When we take away
local relationships that help schools to develop a learning environment
in which children can thrive, we make it harder for all sides—we
make it harder for the young people and for the teachers.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000133">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In the past
couple of days, I have been deluged with examples from across the
country of youth services that are helping schools to achieve good
outcomes. In Durham, youth workers are helping to provide sexual health
services, which helps young people in their personal health and social
education. In Wales, youth workers in the Oasis project are working
closely to support schools in dealing with behaviour and attainment
challenges. In Devon, youth workers are joining mental health workers
within schools to support young people in adolescence who have
developed mental health concerns. In Surrey and Halton, youth workers,
in partnership with schools, are helping to build the confidence of the
young people. Such confidence is critical to their educational
attainment in school, but it also helps them to grow.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000134">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">All of us
remember that adolescence is a difficult period of time in the best of
cases, so helping young people whose confidence is lacking is important
to developing their confidence and the soft skills that will help them
to achieve in the classroom. The amendment tries to take the best
elements of schools working with local authorities through
partnerships, youth services, or mental health services and protect
those relationships. Schools could, therefore, draw on the good work
that has taken place so far, and build on it in future.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000135">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I hope that
the Minister will accept that one of our concerns about selective
application of the principle of unnecessary prescription is that it can
be turned round as unnecessary public benefit. We have seen the
relationships that have been developed in partnerships and through
forms of co-operation. In other legislation, the Minister and other
Departments talk about the importance of co-operation and how it is at
risk.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000136">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We have
talked a lot about the changes that happen after two partners become
married in a coalition. The Liberal Democrats have always been strong
on the importance of youth services. They have tabled several
amendments, as recently as March last year, stressing the importance of
protecting partnerships and working at local level, so I hope that they
will be receptive to what I and my hon. Friend the Member for Bolton
West are trying to do through our amendment. Our aim is to get clarity
from the Ministers about how we might protect youth services in this
changing relationship.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000137">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I hope that
Ministers will respond positively and contemplatively to the idea that
partnerships at a local level can be good and can offer public
benefits. It is right to build in co-operation, which should be built
not on individuals, but on institutions. Such co-operation is
commonplace in the way people work. Just as we need to do build such
relationships around safeguarding, so we need to build them around
youth provision. That is the purpose of the amendment, and I look
forward to a positive response from the Minister for a
change.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000138">&#160;</a>

                           </span> Following on from what my
hon. Friend said, I shall talk a bit more about the statutory duty on
local authorities to provide positive activities for young people,
which by guidance was defined as youth work. Youth workers have a
distinct approach to education and many schools have accepted that they
make a valuable contribution to the educational support of young
people. Many schools have seen the benefit of working in partnership to
support young people, not only those who are underachieving and those
who have additional social problems, but young people who do not have
particular problems apart from those of growing up. The schools also
see it as part of their contribution to the integrated targeted youth
support service. As a result of the drastic cuts that are being made to
youth services, however, they will not be readily available to schools.

                        </p>
                        <p>including the duty of
local authorities to consult young people on the shape of the services

                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">A school is
not, and should not be, an island. It is part of its community. Often
it has the best buildings that the community has to offer. The
amendment is not only about allowing the community and young people to
use the buildings—although that makes a valuable contribution,
particularly to groups such as scouts and guides—but about the
fact that shoving more schooling at children does not work for an awful
lot of them.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000142">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I used to
manage a project for young people in public care, and a tension always
existed about how we should raise achievement with young people,
particularly those in care. The educationalists were pushing for young
people to have more lessons and more input in the various subjects, to
encourage them to achieve and get better qualifications. From the other
side, however, we would say that they actually needed support to sort
their heads out. If someone’s head is a mush, it does not matter
how much a teacher tries to put information into it; that information
will not stay. The issue is about addressing the social and emotional
needs of young people to enable them to learn and to thrive.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000143">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I asked the
field to give some examples of some of the partnership work that it is
doing in schools. A common strand ran through it. Some of it was about
services to all young people, such as Duke of Edinburgh award schemes
and sexual health programmes, but there was also the targeted support
and services for those who were experiencing personal, social or
educational difficulties. I want to talk about a few of those
examples.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000144">&#160;</a>

at Wheatley Park school and is advertised as a teacher-free zone, where
young people can come in total confidence to talk about their issues.
The programme involves true partnership work between a sexual health
nurse, school nurse and youth worker, who all deal with their
particular field of expertise. The youth worker deals particularly with
peer pressure, family problems, bullying and relationships.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000145">&#160;</a>

looking at things such as sociology and life skills, youth crime and

important to them. In Milton Keynes, Oasis works with the Milton Keynes
academy and various other schools to provide after-school and holiday

are experiencing difficulties.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000147">&#160;</a>

school identified that young people who were questioning their sexual
identity needed additional support, and we know that young lesbians and
gay young men suffer a great deal of bullying in schools. The school
formed an LGBT network, which was supported by the youth service, to
support young people who were experiencing such difficulties. Young
people at that school who are not engaged in school are undertaking a
10-week programme with the youth services’ outdoor education
programme. The upshot of all these programmes is that young people are
engaging better in the schools when they go back.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000148">&#160;</a>

girls to look at healthy eating, team building and body image, and to
do craft work, helping girls to come together who were not settling
easily into secondary school. Warlingham school has done an
anti-bullying DVD. Runnymede promotes educational engagements. It
talked about one young girl with learning difficulties who had been
excluded from school. She attended the PEER group and is now going to
achieve OCN qualifications. She would have left school with no

                        <p class="tabbed">Redbridge enacted
“Question Time” debates, seeking to engage young people
in the political process. There are many other examples of different
projects. I am thinking particularly of one in Oxfordshire, where a
youth worker talked about job awareness courses and drug intervention
work with young people, and said that many schools were calling on
youth workers to work in partnership with them, but that that work
would have to stop, because all the youth workers in Oxfordshire were
being made
redundant.<a class="bkMark" name="">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Overall, young
people involved in these programmes either re-engage in school or
achieve their qualifications and accreditation in other ways. The
Minister talked about the need to trust schools, but I am getting as
frustrated with “trusting schools” as I am with some of
the other slogans that he used in the Chamber.<a class="bkMark" name="">&#160;</a>

all schools are good schools. The best schools engage in the community
and with youth services and other agencies—whether
social services or whatever else. The best schools see themselves
as  the centre of their communities. They see that
they have

amendments are saying, “Yes, we want to support the best
schools, but we want all schools to recognise that they have a
responsibility.” It is not enough to shove learning into
children’s heads and expect them to assimilate it and to
achieve. The amendments are saying that different young people have
different needs. They do not come to school without bringing all the
problems that they may be experiencing at home—whether those are
with parents who are drug users, parents who they have to care for
because of disability or other issues, or issues that they may have
with their own mental health or with their own activities. How do we
ensure that those young people fulfil their potential and become
rounded human beings without, for example, unwanted pregnancies, or
dropping out of school altogether?<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000151">&#160;</a>

work—bringing in people with different educational skills to
take different approaches, particularly towards young people who are
not achieving, who cannot accept the normal way of sitting in class and
assimilating information. Those young people need additional support. I
hope that the Minister will look positively on the amendment and see
how we can continue to provide those additional services to young
people.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000152">&#160;</a>

develop through youth they are influenced by many things, not just by
what happens to them at school or even at home. It is absolutely the
case that the opportunities we can provide for people to interact both
with their peers and with others, adults in particular, have an immense
effect on the development of character. That is why the Government

opportunity for personal challenge, community service and social
mixing. We will evaluate that carefully. I agree with her that its
impact needs to be evaluated, but she also knows that we are investing
£134 million in capital funding over the next two years to

Out-of-school activities can be immensely beneficial to young people.
My hon. Friend the Member for Beverley and Holderness is not in his
place, but I should say that I welcome the decision of the Select
Committee, of which he is Chair, to launch a new inquiry into the
provision of services for young people— primarily those aged
between 13 and 25—beyond the school or college
day.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000162">&#160;</a>

of that work will help inform how the Government move forward, but as I
have said, in the pursuit of what I think is a shared
objective—to provide as rich an experience for young people as
possible—much of this work was already taking place voluntarily

2010.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000163">&#160;</a>

local authorities are putting up their rates, so scouts and guides will
not be able even to hire the huts to take part in activities that might
fill the gap before the Bill damages those relationships at local

specifically about that duty, which came into force only recently. She
will be familiar with the Ofsted report that looked at the best
practice that I described. It was published after that duty came into
force, but dealt with matters that prevailed before it. It identified
that much of that good work is happening, so we just do not think that

                           </strong> Me again. The amendment follows the pattern of the
previous one in trying to understand the connection between what the
Bill will do to the provision of local services, the Green Paper on
special educational needs and the consequences of the unhooking of
relationships at a local level for children with special educational
needs. It seeks to build on the evidence that we have about what works
at a local level in the provision of services to children with special
educational needs. I know that the Minister will respond, although I am
not sure which one; I certainly hope it is the one who is actually
listening.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000179">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Before we
look at the consequences of the Bill, and the achievement for all
partnerships, it is useful to reflect on what we are talking about. The
Committee has talked a lot about special educational needs and the
importance of early intervention, a concern that we all share. One of
my concerns is how we deal with special educational needs—I am
addressing the whole Committee; I am sure that everyone is as deeply
concerned about the matter as we are. My concerns are about the onset
of special educational needs later on in a child’s development,
particularly through mental health issues in early adolescence, what
services there are to support those people, and dealing with young
people for whom special educational and additional learning needs will
be a fact of life for a number of
years.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000180">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The hon. Lady is making an extremely important
point, too infrequently made when we debate special educational needs.
Many such needs, as she rightly says, are dynamic because they are
acquired or change their nature over time. Has she considered the code
of practice that accompanies legislation on special educational needs,
which is critical to determine both the quantification of need and the
specification of provision to meet that need? In that spirit, she might
invite my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton to
have a look at that
too.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000181">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The wonders of a Tuesday afternoon with Ministers
rapidly recognising that there is merit in scrutiny and ideas! I take
on board the Minister’s point, and I am sure that his colleague
will wish to commit on it further.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000182">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">My concern is
about implementation at a local level and the complex and sometimes
messy partnerships that need to be put together to support young people
with special educational needs—partnerships in both the
classroom and the broader community. As a starting point, I would like
to put on record the numbers of some of the young people whom we are
talking about. The latest data, from 2004, showed that one in
10 children and young people aged five to 16 had a
clinically diagnosed mental disorder; 4% had an emotional disorder; 6%
had a conduct disorder; 2% had hyper-kinetic disorder, such as
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, from which one could say that
some Government Members may be suffering at this point; and 1% had a
less common disorder, such as autism. In our previous discussions about
special educational needs we looked 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 745<a class="bkMark" name="Column745">&#160;</a>
                           </div>primarily at children with autism, and I encourage the Committee to
recognise that there is a broader range of issues and concerns that we
might be looking at when delivering for special educational needs. The
data also show that the gap between those identified at key
stage 4 as having a special educational need and their peers
is widening, and the gap in educational attainment is growing as well.
People have also been concerned about other issues. For example, eight
out of 10 children with a special educational need have been bullied
and six out of 10 have been physically
hurt.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000183">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Of
course, schools are a critical place for providing the education
support that young people need to achieve, but often people also need
support outside the classroom. The relationships that now enable
schools to develop that support are not necessarily those that begin in
the classroom; they are those that begin with relationships built by
professionals working with parents to support a child, with the child
often having the opportunity to contribute too. That is why the
educational Green Paper offers some interesting ideas for many of the
Opposition, and I welcome some of those ideas about how those
relationships might be joined up. That is why the amendment that I have
proposed refers specifically to the ideas and relationships set out in
the Green Paper. I hope that Ministers, and those concerned about
special educational needs, find much in it to admire, and recognise the
need to take on board how that whole-family approach might be
developed.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000184">&#160;</a>

                        </h4>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
am concerned about the slight contradiction between the mantra of
“trust professionals” and “let’s not burden
local authorities or schools with those relationships,” and the
desire set out in the Green Paper for relationships built at a local
level to deliver services. There is a need for greater collaboration to
join up services, in particular the joint commissioning and managing of
services, or the combination of services within a single local
authority management structure—for example, through sensory
support or educational psychology services. My concern is that very
often the services that schools might want to draw on to provide a
child with special educational needs services will not be those held
within schools. Accessing them will require schools to have a
relationship with the local authority so that they can identify where
to find those
services.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000186">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
am minded by the Special Education Consortium’s contribution to
the Bill. They say that they have yet to hear how the Government
envisage the new structures in health, social services and schools will
work together, and that they want the Government to set out more
clearly how that will happen. I think that all of us who are worried
about the provision of special educational needs are concerned that the
Green Paper was published in the middle of the Education Bill
process—perhaps not at exactly 5.37 in the afternoon, but
certainly interacting with the process. It is very difficult to see how
these systems will work together, not least because there seems to be a
juxtaposition between the common assessment frameworks currently used,
the Green Paper’s proposals—particularly the new powers
around an educational health and support plan—and the
disconnection between local authorities and schools.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000187">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Common
assessment frameworks are a key part of delivering services, and as we
heard when discussing the previous amendment many youth workers are
involved in the provision of common assessment frameworks, alongside
health care workers, schools and indeed the voluntary sector. We know
that that multi-agency working approach is effective, but I fear that
the Bill will hinder the development of that relationship and the noble
ambitions in the Green Paper. I am anxious that the Government set out
how they think these things will fit together. We see that in the
achievement for all partnerships, which I note have been highlighted in
the Green Paper as an example of the kind of relationship the
Government want to see taken forward. That sets out a very clear
relationship for such partnerships—for well-being partnerships
to be put together; for panels to work together; for improving the
achievement and progress of children with special educational needs;
for the involvement of educational psychologists, a service that we
know is at risk because of cuts; for the direct involvement of young
people in determining the educational environment they wish to learn
in; and for the involvement of health care services, particularly with
children and adolescent mental health
services.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000188">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
also want to draw the Committee’s attention to my concerns over
how other changes that are occurring, particularly in the Localism
Bill, might affect the Government’s ability to deliver on their
ambitions for special educational needs. There is therefore a need to
establish a partnership and way of working that protects special
educational needs provision. In particular, I have been written to by a
number of residents—as I am sure Members on all sides
have—about the Localism Bill and the review of statutory duties
placed on local government. I think this comes from the proposal that
there is unnecessary prescription, which the Opposition see as the
public benefit of
co-operation.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000189">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="hs_brev">“I
have a son of nine months old who has Down’s Syndrome and I am
profoundly worried about how proposed changes might impact on his
future. I believe that local authority duties that cover the provision
of services and support for disabled children and children with special
educational needs are vital and should be kept. Rights for disabled
children and those with special educational needs are not a
‘barrier’ to the delivery of services—they are
vital tools that help families and local areas to make decisions about
what support they can provide for families. Local authorities provide
services based on their statutory duties. These duties set out what
they are legally obliged to provide, and give families and
professionals a framework to help decide the services that disabled
children will receive. Many disabled children and their families have
to fight to get the services they need to lead ordinary lives. Now that
overall funding for local services has been reduced, and local
authorities are looking for ways to cut costs, there is an even greater
pressure on families trying to get
support.”<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000599">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
believe that the same criticism could be made about removing those
duties on schools to work with local authorities, and that is why I
tabled an amendment to try to take account of what is in the Green
Paper and of the good practice that the Government seem to want to
expand on. I want to hear more clearly from Ministers about that
joined-up thinking. There is the partisan concern that we have about
the disconnection between different Departments and different reforms,
and there is the human, compassionate concern that we all have that
says, woe betide all those who, in 18 months’ or two
years’ time, will be filling our surgeries, fighting to get the
services that they need for their young people.

merits to the Minister. I was involved in setting up the achievement
for all projects. There were 15 of them across the country, and I was
partly involved in setting up the one in Oldham and, to a lesser
extent, in monitoring the outcomes of the one in Sheffield. The
Government acknowledge in the Green Paper that it has been a highly
successful programme, which should be rolled out across the country. It
did exactly what the Green Paper proposes. It reduced the labelling of
children with SEN; it clearly identified the difference between
children with SEN and those who are under-achieving—there is a
huge difference, and many of those children have gone through the SEN
sausage machine in the past—and it sought to help both those
groups, and was highly successful in doing so. It appears to fit in
incredibly well with the objectives in the Green Paper, which I would
argue are slightly long on issues and short on solutions—but
that is a different issue for a different
day.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000192">&#160;</a>

had a helpful and positive discussion here last week about the
disappearance before our eyes of careers services. I want to make some
special pleading for SEN specialist support services, which again are
disappearing before our eyes. There are so many highly specialised
people taking early retirement and voluntary redundancy on 31 March,
and there will be massive pressure on educational psychology, on
low-incidence SEN services, and on services for children who are
visually impaired or blind, as well as the higher-incidence services
such as those for autism and behaviour.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000193">&#160;</a>

merit in the new clause, which fits in very well with the objectives in

disaster in those low-incidence SEN services, which are disappearing
before our eyes. From 1 April, many will not be able to be

the amendment and the new clause could have been made in relation to
some previous amendments. It certainly applies to the clause as a whole
and to some of the following clauses in this part of the Bill. It
relates to questions on which I seek assurance from the Minister. I
wish to ensure that the effect of the clauses and of any rejection by
the Government of the amendment and the new clause would not be to do
injury to the intention of Parliament when it passed the Autism Act
2009 in the previous Parliament. Unfortunately, my point would be
slightly too long to make as an intervention, so I am raising the
matter now in lieu of an intervention on the Minister. Under the Danny
Blanchflower rule, when he was manager of Northern Ireland, we had to
equalise before the other team scored. I am getting the long
intervention in

                        <p class="tabbed">In
the previous Parliament, the Autism Bill was reported on a cross-party
basis. Of course, it was sponsored by someone who was then an
Opposition Front-Bencher and who is now in Cabinet as the Secretary of
State for Wales. Some of the arguments made during the early

                           </div>stages of consideration of the Autism Bill were effectively that
sufficient powers and duties already existed, including some of the
existing powers and duties that we are discussing in relation to the
clause. The case was made persuasively to Parliament that those various
pre-existing powers and the duties on local authorities and on others
to co-operate with local authorities could be assisted if there was
further legislation to provide, in my phrase, bespoke autism Acts. They
could be used to complement and give more articulate effect to some of
those duties on local authorities, on education authorities and on a
range of service providers.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000195">&#160;</a>

of the existing provisions and services; they were trying to complement
and reinforce them. It concerns me that the Government may be
inadvertently removing some of the provisions on which the assumptions
that people had when they voted for the Autism Bill rested. I want
assurances from the Government that through the Bill and the attitude
they will take in relation to the amendments, such as that tabled by
the hon. Member for Walthamstow, they are not taking air out of the
tyres of the Autism Act, they are not removing some of the presumptions
on which it rested and they therefore will not injure the promise that

want to discuss briefly the Green Paper and the relationship with the
common assessment framework, to which the hon. Lady referred. I shall
also mention the multi-agency approach that is outlined in the SEN
Green Paper. All those who come into contact with families have a part
to play in identifying those children whose needs are not being
adequately met by the system so far. Some of those needs can be helped
by early intervention and some may need referral to more specialist
services, including local authority social care.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000198">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Many local
areas and services see the benefits where, with the family’s
consent, an assessment is made using a format that is common to all
local agencies and that can be shared, as appropriate, with other
professionals. Local arrangements of that kind are appropriate for
children who do not require statutory assessments for special
educational needs or social care, but who may, for a variety of
reasons, need support from other agencies. That might be the sort of
assessment that schools would choose to conduct to examine any
underlying causal factors—we discussed that under the
behavioural clauses earlier in Committee—such as mental health,
family problems or where a pupil displays poor behaviour that does not
improve despite the effective policies of the
school.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000199">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Before
I come to the amendment, I want to refer to the comments of the hon.
Member for North West Durham about support services. We recognise the
important role that local authorities play in meeting children’s
special educational needs and through the provision of SEN support
services. In the schools White Paper, we announced that we will be
reviewing school funding, and, in the SEN Green Paper, we ask a
question about funding SEN support staff, to inform that school funding
review. There is no change to the responsibility of local authorities
for SEN services, but we are aware of the changes that will happen as a
consequence of wider education policies, and we are consulting on
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000200">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The direction of travel and what the Minister has
said about the White Paper and schools funding are welcome, but the
crisis is now. Huge numbers of local authority staff are going, because
of Government cuts, and SEN specialist services are part of those cuts.
In local authorities that I know well, I am seeing huge numbers of
highly specialised and incredibly skilled members of staff, working in
low-incidence SEN services, who are going on 31 March or who will be
subject to compulsory redundancy shortly afterwards. That crisis is
happening now. If we wait until the review of school funding, those
people will have gone. I must say that I have not seen things as bad as
this since
1997.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000201">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I do not want to take the debate into a discussion
about the state of the public finances, but we have had to take some
difficult decisions. Local authorities must make the right decisions,
however, because their statutory duties remain in place. The decisions
that we had to make in the emergency Budget and in the spending review
in order to prevent the country going into financial meltdown take us
back to the public spending levels of 2007. It should be possible, with
careful husbandry of resources, to manage things, so that the most
vulnerable people in our society do not suffer the brunt of the savings
that must be made right across the state sector. The Prime Minister,
the Chancellor and the Secretary of State have made it clear that they
do not expect the most vulnerable to bear the brunt. The spending
review has been designed deliberately to prevent that sector of society
from suffering. I would be disappointed if there are local authorities
that are taking the approach that the hon. Lady has
mentioned.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000202">&#160;</a>

want to speak to amendment 143 and new clause 8 on the issue of special
educational needs. On the new clause, the hon. Member for Walthamstow
has served the Committee well by raising her issues. We had a short and
good-humoured debate on a highly sensitive and important matter, which
enabled us to discuss the work that schools have undertaken through
Achievement for All. New clause 8 would require schools and other
bodies, including health agencies and police forces, to participate in
Achievement for All partnerships. The partnerships would be responsible
for using a whole-family approach to assess the needs of and to deliver
services to children with special educational needs and additional
learning
needs.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000207">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Achievement
for All, which was introduced under the previous Administration, is a
school-based programme that aims to improve both the attainment and
progress of pupils who have special educational needs or who are
disabled, and their wider outcomes. It has already shown early
successes, as we have acknowledged in our Green Paper on special
educational needs and disability, “Support and
aspiration”. However, Achievement for All has succeeded without
the need for regulations or a requirement that certain local services
such as the police shall participate.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000208">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Unlike the
proposals in the new clause, the programme is not prescriptive about
how a child’s needs are assessed. Achievement for All has relied
on schools’ professionalism to assess their pupils’ needs
and to make appropriate provisions for them. We agree with that
approach. I do not want to make this into a piece of jargon, but we
trust schools’ professional judgement; school leaders and head
teachers know what works for their pupils and parents and we trust them
to exercise that
judgment.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000209">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I hope that the Minister will accept that one
reason for tabling new clause 8 and the previous new clause was that
the environment will change as a direct result of the Bill. Many of the
relationships that were put in place through the duties that are being
repealed in the Bill will no longer exist. That will make it much
harder for the professionals in whom he has so much trust to do the
work that these partnerships seek to set out.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000210">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Reading the
Green Paper, one of my concerns is that the processes in relation to
partnership are the very processes that the Bill will unpin. In 18
months’ or two years’ time a new Bill could be brought
before the House to do exactly what the new clause sets out to do and
to build those partnerships again so that parents do not have a limited
number of options for their children. Will he confirm that there is
some thinking going on about how one might deliver the kind of
relationships that currently take place within the framework that the
Bill is unpinning and that help to make Achievement for All
possible?<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000211">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I will come to that point in one moment. Let me
continue my argument. We know that the approaches used in Achievement
for All can have a very positive impact on pupil outcomes. That is why,
alongside the Green Paper, we have launched a tender for bids from
external organisations to spread the practices that those involved with
Achievement for All have developed. We will ask the successful bidder
to work with the voluntary and community sector to develop a quality
mark for those schools that are developing excellent and innovative SEN
support.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000212">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment 143 would require
maintained schools and academies to co-operate with the local authority
and the partners set out in new clause 8, through the Achievement for
All partnerships. Those partners are broadly the same as the current
Children’s Trust relevant partners. It is a further attempt to
place a statutory requirement where none is needed. That is not the
best way to deal with the important and sensitive issue of children
with special educational needs. We all agree that the early
identification of any barriers to learning, including special
educational needs, and the resulting provision of appropriate support
are vital in ensuring that every young person is able to reach their
potential.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000213">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">In the Green
Paper, we set out proposals to ensure that teachers have training to
enable them to identify, confidently and accurately, where pupils have
special educational needs and to provide appropriate support. We are
consulting on proposals under which local authorities and other local
services will communicate the range of support available for families
with children who are disabled or who have special educational needs.
However, there are some children and young people with the most complex
needs who will require support across a number of agencies. We also
propose, therefore, to trial a new approach to statutory assessment,
which in time could replace the current process for providing a
statement of SEN.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000214">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The new,
single assessment process and education health and care plan will bring
together the services on which the child and family rely, and set out
clearly who will be responsible for which service. The assessment and
plan for children and young people with the most complex needs will
involve a commitment from all parties across education, health and
social care to provide their services.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000215">&#160;</a>

excellent practice in schools and, as I have just set out, we want that
practice to spread. We do not think, however, that the right way to do
that is through prescriptive regulations or statutory requirements. I
hope that the hon. Member for Walthamstow is reassured by the range of
measures that we are proposing to improve the identification, provision
and support for children with special educational

                           </strong> These are probing amendments to find out the
Government’s thinking. The Health and Social Care Bill
introduces new local bodies, health and well-being boards, that
have to produce a health and well-being strategy—a new planning
requirement. The valuable role that schools can play in promoting child
health, and future adult health, can sometimes be easily forgotten. I
have seen some very good work on that and I am sure that the Minister
has, too.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000228">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I accept that
the Minister may not have the answers, but it would be useful to know
the Department’s view on those boards and on school
participation. Is there an expectation that schools will co-operate
with the new boards? Does the Department for Education expect schools
to be represented on the boards? How will the boards fit in with local
safeguarding boards for children? Do the Government have a view on what
is left of children’s trusts becoming accountable to health and
well-being boards?<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000229">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Given that
there is no clause stand part debate, I shall make a general point
about duties. It really took from the Children Act 2004, with no duties
on schools, until the Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning
Act 2009 for it to become clear that gentle persuasion was not
sufficient. That is why duties were put in place and we certainly
believe that the removal of those duties sends a powerful signal that
the Government do not think that even gentle persuasion is required.
The amendments are probing and I ask the Minister to answer those
questions.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000230">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I will try to do what the hon. Gentleman asks. The
health and well-being boards were discussed next door on 10 March
during Committee discussions of the Health and Social Care Bill. I do
not want to stray inadvertently into the territory of another Public
Bill Committee, but perhaps I can reassure the hon. Gentleman that the
needs of children, young people and their families are at the heart of
the NHS
reforms.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000231">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
core purpose of the new health and well-being boards is to encourage
joint commissioning across the NHS, social care, public health and
other services, such as education, that are related to health. The
Government have consulted widely on the membership arrangements of the
board and there is broad support for the proposals, which will include
directors of children’s services as well as GP consortia, the
director of adult social services, the director of public health, at
least one elected member and local healthwatch as statutory members.
Beyond that core, boards will have the flexibility to invite other
members, including schools and FE colleges, as they think appropriate.
But the determining principle should be whatever makes sense locally.
We will leave it to the local authority and health and well-being board
to decide who to
invite.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000232">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
have already debated our removal of the requirement on schools and
colleges to co-operate through children’s trust arrangements. It
would be a mistake to require all schools and colleges to be
represented on health and well-being boards and to compel them to
co-operate with those boards. It is neither practical nor
necessary.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000233">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Schools and
colleges vary enormously in circumstances, size and capacity, and they
all act in the best interests of their pupils and students and have
long recognised the

                           </div>need to tackle issues that get in the way of young people’s
education. They work with partner organisations to do that. But we need
to recognise that the small rural primary school, the schools
delivering specialist education for young people with communications
needs, the inner-city academy, the sixth form and the FE
college are all very different from one another, so it is not possible
or sensible to try to prescribe a one-size-fits-all rule on how they
should engage with local partnership arrangements—and, indeed,
with the
boards.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000234">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
boards will, of course, have an interest in encouraging the involvement
of schools and colleges. The board may in particular encourage people
who arrange for the provision of any health or social care services and
health-related services to work closely together, and this means that
where it makes sense locally for schools and colleges to be represented
on local health and well-being boards, they will have a voice in
encouraging close working arrangements for the provision of those
services for children and young people. Quite rightly, arrangements for
such representation should be determined locally in a way that is
proportionate and appropriate.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000235">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I would like
to add that, in the reformed system, the joint strategic needs
assessment will take on much greater importance, providing
commissioners access to expertise so that deep and productive
partnerships, including with schools and colleges, can develop new
commissioning solutions for the vulnerable people we are discussing
today.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000236">&#160;</a>

141 would require schools and FE colleges to co-operate with any
relevant provision of the new health and well-being strategies that are
currently being legislated for during the passage of the Health and
Social Care Bill and which will be published by the local health and
well-being board. I understand the intention behind the amendment
tabled by the hon. Member for Cardiff West, which is to ensure that
schools and colleges are involved in local strategic planning. That is
a principle that all members of the Committee agree with. Schools and
colleges should always be considered by those in a planning or
strategic role, but I do not believe that the amendment, which would
legislate to force schools and colleges to co-operate with the
strategies and indirectly give health and well-being boards the power
to direct what schools and colleges should prioritise, is the right
approach.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000237">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
new joint health and well-being strategy will be a concise summary of
how organisations will address the health and social care needs of a
community, including children’s health, and will help to reduce
health inequalities. I hope that I have persuaded the hon. Gentleman
that his amendments are not
necessary.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000238">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> We touched on planning in the debate on amendment
141. Government requirements on local authorities to produce plans,
which affect schools, about how they intend to provide education and
children’s services are not new. The word “plan”
appears 40 times in the Education Act 1944. That Act principally
required local government to produce two plans to be approved by the
Education Minister; one was a successful use of central planning and
the other was, perhaps, not so
successful.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000264">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
1944 Act required every child to be provided with a secondary
education. Local government had to follow a plan approved by the
Minister, and by the early 1950s, that provision had been achieved
through central planning. However, it took another 10 years for the
last all-age elementary schools to be converted. The other requirement
was to plan for county colleges—the forerunners of what we would
know as further education colleges. That is sometimes thought to have
not been as successful, because it did not provide a proper legal basis
for the development of further education in the following 40
years.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000265">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The Minister
may correct me if I am wrong, but the effective removal of the children
and young people’s plan through clause 31 will remove the last
Government requirement for a local authority children’s service
to have a plan that is specifically required by legislation. The
Department of Health, as we have heard, will require local authorities
to help with health and well-being strategies, with which certain
bodies must comply. For clarity, will the Minister state whether his
Department requires other plans from local authorities? Does he feel
that there are any risks of removing the plan to local authorities and
schools? Why does health need plans, but not
education?<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000266">&#160;</a>

required to prepare a statutory children and young people’s

                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">That
does not mean that those bodies should stop planning, but that central
Government will not tell them how to do it or who should have regard to
such a plan. We revoked the highly prescriptive Children’s Trust
Board (Children and Young People’s Plan) (England) Regulations
2010 in October last year to free local partners from the burden of
having to produce and publish a local strategy by 1 April, a strategy
that would have owed more to central diktat than to local
priorities.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000268">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
regulations set out in considerable detail not only what the content of
the plan should be, but how and where it should be published, the 16
different categories of partners, boards, forums and groups to consult,
and even when to review and how to revise the plan. Needless to say,
compliance with the regulations added considerably to the bureaucratic
burden on local authorities and their partners, including schools and
colleges. It resulted in many local areas having an impossibly large
number of top priorities—in other words, no priorities. It
restricted the freedom of local partners to work together in innovative
ways, and it discouraged local creativity and solutions to meet the
challenging circumstances that we all
faced.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000269">&#160;</a>

want to make it clear that the removal of the clause does not mean that
we are opposed to planning. On the contrary, we want to support
effective planning that genuinely reflects local priorities and the
worries of local people. Under the clause, we intend to free local
partners and partnerships from the micro-managements of central
Government and let them produce genuinely local
plans.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000270">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> We do not dispute the need to do something about
the duty on school governing bodies to publish a school profile. A
significant proportion of schools do not publish a profile and parents
are denied detailed comparative online information about schools. When
we were in Government, we were about to repeal the school profile
provision, but that proposal was removed at the behest of the then
Opposition in the wash-up last year. The difference between us is that
we wanted to replace the school profile with a nationally provided
school record card. Alternatively, the Government’s proposal
will deny parents useful information, a point to which I shall return
in a
moment.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000273">&#160;</a>

believe that parents, governors and the public should have access to
information about their children’s school and schools in the
local area. Currently, parents are able to access information about a
school’s performance in a variety of places. That includes the
school and college performance tables, school and local authority
websites, as well as the online school profile. We will make available
much more information and data about schools in local areas and bring
together in one place data about school performance, finance and work
force, and school and pupil characteristics. That will make it easy for
parents and others to access and compare school performance in local
areas and so use that information to hold schools to account and make
better informed
choices.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000289">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Already
this year, and for the first time, parents have been able to use the
Department’s website to create their own performance tables to
rank schools and compare them with others. We will continue our policy
to release in reusable form as much as possible of the statistical
information the Department holds. We want to free schools from
unnecessary bureaucracy and legislative burdens. Replicating
information that is widely available elsewhere is a waste of school
resource time. Schools should be free to focus on their core business
of teaching
children.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000290">&#160;</a>

policy and home school agreements, the special needs policy,
information about how the school uses the pupil premium and clear
signposting for parents who would like more detailed information. We
also expect key performance tables to focus on a range of measures,
including the English baccalaureate,

                           </strong> Clause 33 deals with the duty to appoint school
improvement partners. They grew out of work that the previous
Government started in 2003 on the new relationship with schools, and in
a short period have become a part of the schools landscape that is
valued by schools and local authorities. This Government have decided
to kill them off, and have done so by withdrawing funding from local
government, which is why the duty finishes on Royal Assent, according
to clause
78.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000296">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It
is worth noting some functions of school improvement partners. They
provide support to school governors in the performance management of
the head teacher, which is an extremely important task if we are to be
able to help head teachers to grow and develop in the demanding role
that they play in school leadership. We know that that is required of a
highly successful head teacher for a highly successful school. Perhaps
the Minister could say what support he envisages will be available to
school governors in that
task.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000297">&#160;</a>

thought it might be useful to quote from a letter that I received
earlier this month from Councillor Nickie Aiken, the cabinet member for
children and young people on Westminster City council, about school
improvement partners. She
states:<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000298">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="hs_brev">“I
also have specific concerns about school improvement and how slipping
standards can be identified quickly and effectively. The provision of a
School Improvement Partner will soon become discretionary; most local
authorities will no longer continue to provide this service. It must be
noted that without a formal school improvement partner the capacity for
a local authority to ensure the quality of education in its borough is
limited so problems will only be able to be dealt with once
schools are already
underperforming.”<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000606">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">For

The issue of school improvement partners has been raised by a local

                           </strong> I just want to add my concerns on the removal of
school improvement partners. One of the mantras that we are taking away
from this Committee is the concept of trusting professionals. Many
professionals are fantastic at their jobs and we heard from some of
them in the evidence sessions. We are trying to square that with the
concern about school standards and the ability of schools to rise to
the challenge that the Government want to put to them.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000305">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">School improvement
partners—I declare an interest as the daughter of someone who
has been a school improvement partner—have been described as the
“eyes and ears” of the local authority within a school,
and they are the people who could spot early on if problems were
developing. For example, if a head teacher was unable to implement
policies or to deal effectively with issues of behaviour or attainment,
or if there were new challenges arising within a school, that SIP can
provide support and assistance in developing proposals to deal with the
issues, before they came to the attention of Ofsted and a
more formalised intervention became necessary. From a value-for-money
perspective alone, those eyes and ears are worth their weight in gold
in being able to address problems early on.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000306">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The other
thing that I learned today is that people are concerned about early
intervention. Sometimes early intervention is a principle that we
should apply to how we work with schools, as well as how we work with
young people with challenging behaviour. The shadow Minister is right
to ask what alternative mechanism local authorities and parents will
have, so that they have the confidence that they do not have to be
there 100% of the time watching what is going on in schools like
eagles. With SIPs, they have the confidence that there are people with
experience, understanding and solutions—that is the critical
point. They have ideas on how to address some of those problems and are
part of the school’s fabric, and they do not only come in to
inspect, but to challenge and support. That is what school improvement
partners have done, where they have been effective.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000307">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I would hope that the Minister
will reflect on the clause, and perhaps think about how a different
regime of school improvement partnerships could be brought
in to support achievement within schools and bring them to the
standards that he wants them to reach, where professionals do not meet
his high expectations. I am sure that the Minister will accept that
there may be that rare occasion when that needs
addressing.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000308">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I remember many years ago visiting a school that
almost never got in touch with the local authority, had high standards
and the head teacher got on with things. We saw each other rarely. I
was visiting the school on a specific issue on a Friday afternoon. It
was going to take little time. We went through the business, and as I
got up to leave, the head said, “Sit down, because I need to
talk to you.” He explained to me that, in his position, he had
no one to talk to. He found it really useful to have someone who
listened to him, whom he could trust and who was of a professional
standing, so he could share some of the concerns within his school.
That was 20 years before SIPs came along.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000309">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It was the
kind of role that head teachers were looking for. It was someone to
look at the issues within a school, to challenge and to monitor their
self-evaluation form—I know that the SEF is not required any
more, but many head teachers I know find them useful and are going to
continue with them—and to look at the school priorities and
listen to their issues and their problems. Many times over the years I
have had phone calls from head teachers saying, “I have got this
issue.” I would say, “I will come out and see
you”, but on the drive there I would think, “I
don’t know what to say. I don’t have an answer to this
insurmountable problem.” However, when I would get there, the
head would talk through the issues. In fact, they would not be looking
to me for a solution, but for someone whom they could professionally
trust, who would listen to them, and whom they could talk to, and they
would find their own solutions. That was largely the role that SIPs
subsequently
played.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000310">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
accept that where SIPs are good, their worth to schools is high.
Equally, where SIPs are not so good or less than good, their worth is
less positive. I also accept that SIPs have been much more successful
in primary than in secondary. A lot of that was because it was much
harder to get head teachers to come out of their successful schools and
work as SIPs in other schools, which it was much easier to do in
primary. The feedback that I get from head teachers is that overall
SIPs have been a positive influence in schools and are seen as worth
while. What consultation has the Minister held with head teachers on
that, and if he has done so, can we see it? Certainly, the feedback I
get is that despite the variability, SIPs generally have been seen as
worth while in
schools.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000311">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The hon.
Member for North West Durham commented on the loneliness of, not the
long-distance runner, but a head teacher. Nothing will stop a head
teacher from appointing an improvement partner, and they did not need
legislation to force them to do so. Our direction is towards
encouraging more mentoring and peer-to-peer and school-to-school
support, so that it becomes a default approach for delivering school
improvement, which I think partially answers the comments made by the
hon. Member for Walthamstow. That is why we are building capacity in
the system for a growing network of teaching schools. We want to double
the number of national leaders and local leaders of education, and we
are identifying the best subject and specialist leaders working in
schools to designate them a specialist view of education. That is the
direction—more co-operation between experts and people who have
a proven track record. None of that will be delivered by a whole range
of new statutory duties being imposed on
schools.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000319">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Has the Minister done any work on when head
teachers might appoint a SIP or someone to support them? What evidence
does he have that people who want to challenge the way in which schools
are run—they need support or need to acknowledge that they are
perhaps falling down in areas—will do so? One benefit of the
school improvement partnership system is that it picks up things that
people may not have identified themselves. He is asking an awful lot of
a head teacher to admit that they have failings. I appreciate that he
has been listening to head teachers who do not believe that they do
anything wrong. However, occasionally they slip up, although they might
not realise it—I can say that as the daughter of a head teacher
who is watching now, so I know that I shall be in trouble when I leave.
What mechanism does the Minister expect will take account of where head
teachers might not recognise the value of mentoring or of critical
friends in helping them to improve the provision of
services?<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000320">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Well, we want to foster that culture of
co-operation, although it is not the case that we need to, because it
is live and flourishing out there among schools. Schools co-operate
with one another, and we want to help that along by creating more
national leaders of education and local leaders of education. Schools
will continue to have a relationship with the local
authority—the phrase “an island unto themselves”
has been used, but our school system is not made up of that. We want

                           </div>autonomy, but not isolated autonomy. The schools are not all seeking to
be islands unto themselves without any co-operation. Opposition Members
are painting a picture of schools today that does not reflect the
reality or the quantum of co-operation that takes place between schools
and
professionals.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000321">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Turning
to the clause, it removes the duty on local authorities to appoint a
school improvement partner to each of their maintained schools. For too
long, schools have been the focus of highly centralised, top-down
approaches, leading to the stifling of creativity and innovation. Some
of the world’s best education systems operate an autonomous
school system and, if we are to achieve world-class status and compete
with the best, our approach to school improvement needs to
change.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000322">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
are committed to creating a self-improving school system that empowers
schools to become fully responsible for their own improvement.
Alongside that, we will make much more information about schools
available in standardised formats, to allow parents and others the
ability easily to compare school performance. We want to see our best
leaders, teachers and schools take on greater responsibility for
leading school
improvement.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000323">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">In
2008, a York Consulting evaluation of the previous Government’s
new relationship with schools policy highlighted several areas for
improvement, including the need for clarity about the role of school
improvement partners and schools’ perception that that role was
duplicated by other local authority staff. The majority of local
authority respondents surveyed as part of the evaluation did not agree
that their decisions on intervention in schools were more effective as
a result of the school improvement partner
programme.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000324">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">In
conclusion, we believe that schools need to be free to take
responsibility for their own improvement by defining their improvement
priorities and accessing the most appropriate support themselves,
either from other schools or from the marketplace, which is why clause
33 should stand part of the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000325">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
experience of history, I am afraid, is that some schools act as islands
if we do not put into the system a requirement for them to co-operate,
collaborate and act together. We saw that very well in the 1980s, when
grant-maintained schools were introduced. I well remember where I
taught, some school heads decided that they would act in a singularly
unco-operative way, which was not in the interest of children in the
whole of the area, and despite the majority of heads disagreeing with
them. Sometimes we have to put in a requirement for
co-operation.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000327">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">My
hon. Friend the Member for Walthamstow said as the daughter of a head
teacher, so I can say as the son of a dinner lady, that heads slip up
sometimes. My mother often told me about such occasions—never on
a floor she mopped, but they do occasionally slip up, make mistakes,
act in a high-handed way or get out of line. As my hon. Friend the
Member for North West Durham has pointed out, they occasionally find
themselves under a lot of stress and pressure and in a position in
which it is difficult, as the “captain of your ship” to

circumstances, it is important to have a school improvement partner in
place and to have a requirement on the local authority to appoint
one.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000328">&#160;</a>

will not force the Committee to a Division on clause stand part, but I
hope that the Minister will think more about the provision, because he
might come to rue it. His continual assertions that every head teacher
everywhere can always be relied on to do the right thing on every
occasion is a bit naive or—I will not accuse him of naivety;
that would be unfair—is not borne out by experience and history.
Even if he dislikes, as I think he probably does, regulation and
prescription—I respect his political philosophy or
ideology—he sometimes needs to have a realistic view of human
nature. Head teachers are not perfect creatures. They are highly
qualified professionals and mostly act professionally, but they may
make mistakes and they are not perfect, so sometimes they will need
help. As I have said, we have discovered from bitter experience that
having that attitude towards people in positions of authority around
children is not wise. It is regrettable that the Government have
included the clause, but I will not ask the Committee to divide on it
at this
stage.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000329">&#160;</a>

school admissions. We hear a lot about that subject. Recently, the
press reported that the school adjudicator is going to stand down.
Mysteriously, he will leave his post early, I suspect because of the
Government’s work in that area. Frankly, we are concerned that
the clause is all about giving schools more wriggle room—the
phrase has been used outside the Committee—on admissions. That
will be the practical effect of the provision, even if the Minister
shakes his head. I hope that the Lib Dems are listening, because they
should pay close attention to what the Government are

I hope that it is what we all want in Committee. I know we will hear
many professions of a desire to achieve that from members of the
Committee. If possible, we want all children to be able to attend
schools, and we want all those schools to be good schools. We worked
very hard in government to try to realise that ambition, and I think
that the Government sincerely want to improve schools and to have good
schools for children to attend. However, it is still the case that some
schools are oversubscribed. I suspect that, however long the coalition
Government last, some schools will still be oversubscribed at the end
of their period in office. That is why it is so important to ensure
fairness in the allocation of state school places. Some schools are
grammar schools and can select on ability, but we are talking here
about schools that are not supposed to select on ability or any other
criteria, but to accept pupils on a fair basis. In this amendment and
those in the three groups to come, we want to show what can be done to

Government say they want to simplify and improve the schools admission
code. That is fine. I have a copy of it here. It has a nice cartoon on
the front which the Department abolished when the Minister came into
office. Our concern, and I will put it frankly to the Committee, is
that rather than simplifying it, they may want to dilute its impact on
fair admissions. We must therefore scrutinise very closely what the
Government are doing in this clause. Paragraph 1.9 of the code states
that the Education Inspection Act 2006<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000337">&#160;</a>

The White Paper, “The Importance of Teaching” states

can a local authority do that all by itself? How important is the
admissions forum? How important is the schools adjudicator? How
important is the schools admission code? How important is the local
authority’s annual review of admission arrangements? The
Government’s changes to the legislative framework since the 2010
election require a revisiting of the local authority role to secure
fair access to schools, particularly with the significant increase in
the number of academies that the Government envisage. I know the
Government have something to say about that later in the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000339">&#160;</a>

is another serious point that she makes there. In contrast, the local
authority will have to set the admissions arrangements for community
and voluntary-controlled schools with a view to ensuring fair access to
educational opportunity. Amendment 147 will require all admission
authorities, be they foundation, voluntary-aided or academy, to set
their admission arrangements on the same basis as local

Members will know from their constituency casework of the deep
disappointment felt by parents and children on not getting into the
school of their choice. Although it affects some areas more than
others, we have all probably heard parents saying that admissions
arrangements are not fair. Local newspapers are often full of stories
of disappointed parents. Even with the changes to the code following
the 2006 Act, admissions can still be complicated, time-consuming and
stressful for parents. Admissions arrangements will almost certainly
become even more complicated as more and more schools become their own
admission authorities under this Government’s education
plans.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000342">&#160;</a>

local authorities acting as the admission authority for their community
and voluntary-controlled schools, but there are thousands of
voluntary-aided, trust and foundation schools, and academies—a
growing number under the Government’s plans—all acting as
their own admission authority. As a result, large numbers of governing

                        <p class="tabbed">The fear is
that, with this large number of admission authorities, covert selection
and complexity will be given a stimulus. There is evidence that when
schools become their own admission authority, it gives them the
opportunity to exercise covert selection and unfair admissions
practices. Although it has not been featured in a letter to any member
of the Committee from the Minister, or in a departmental statement,
press reports at the weekend suggest that the Government intend to
limit the use of lotteries for admission to individual schools, rather
than to allow local authorities to conduct them. I do not know whether
the Minister can confirm whether the report in the weekend edition of
<em>The Telegraph </em>is true.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000344">&#160;</a>

research for the Department in 2008, Professor Coldron found that
schools that were their own admission authority were more likely to
select covertly, leading to more socially segregated schools and a
greater number of parental appeals. In her research in 2009 into
secondary schools’ admissions criteria across the country,
entitled “Secondary Schools Admissions in England: policy and
practice”, produced for the charity, Research and Information on
State Education Trust, Professor Anne West, from the London School of
Economics,

                        <p class="hs_brev">“Despite
improvements, our research suggests that the system is still too
complex, particularly for parents and carers who are not highly
educated or proficient in English, and especially where there are
schools responsible for their own admissions. The complexity is
exacerbated by some schools seeking additional information from
parents, often of a personal nature and unrelated to the admissions
criteria.”<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000619">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">What can be
done to reduce the difficulties of introducing more
own-admission-authority schools? Part of the answer must lie
in requiring a specific objective to be included in the schools
admission code for those schools when they set their
admission arrangements. Namely, the admission arrangements should
ensure fair access to educational opportunity. That would mean that all
admission authorities have the same objective. Amendment 147 is
designed to achieve that, and I would be grateful if the Minister could
respond to that suggestion.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000350">&#160;</a>

admissions will know that it is an aspect of education that greatly
exercises parents. The three largest areas of complaint to the local
government ombudsman are, and have been for many years, planning,
special educational needs and admissions, and that was when the local
government ombudsman only had powers to investigate admissions in
relation to local authorities, and not in relation to
schools.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000351">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As we know,
the position differs across the country, and there truly is a postcode
lottery. The establishment of local admissions forums was an attempt to
combat that. Fair access is very important to parents, and as my hon.
Friend the Member for Cardiff West has said, every year at the same
time, television programmes on BBC and ITV and the press are full of
stories of parents who are extremely angry that they have not got their
first, second or sometimes even third choice of school for their child.
I have to say that, in the main, parents understand fairness, and will
accept arrangements, as long as they feel that they are fair or, as one
parent said to me, equally unfair to everyone.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000352">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I have worked
in several parts of the country. In the north-east, where I worked for
many years, up to 98% of parents get their first choice of school for
their children because their first choice is the local school, which is
often a good school. That is what parents want. They are not looking
for something special or different; they are looking for a good school
for their children. I have also worked in parts of the country where
50% or less of parents get their first choice of school, and many do
not even get their third or fourth choice. Understandably, that makes
them angry and frustrated. The local admissions forum was a way of
giving parents the opportunity to become involved in admissions
locally, and they will be angry at its
abolition.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000353">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Changes
to school admissions under the legislation, and the proposed
simplification of the code of practice on school admissions have
worried many parents. Those who live in areas where there is a shortage
of schools, or where parents perceive, rightly or wrongly, that there
is a shortage of good places, and parents of children with special
educational needs are extremely worried that simplification will mean
“more opaque,” and that it will be easier for schools
that want to keep their children out if they want
to.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000354">&#160;</a>

the Education Committee, and I am happy to say here, that as a
practising Catholic, when I was working in London and saw some of the
practices that went on with admissions and exclusions among London
Catholic schools, I was frankly
ashamed.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000355">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
have been contacted by the Special Education Consortium, which told me
that it often hears from parents when schools are reluctant to admit
their children. The local admissions forum provided an opportunity for
parents to be involved in the scrutiny and challenge of admissions
arrangements in their areas. The Special Education Consortium told me
that it is worried that the schools adjudicator will no longer be able
directly to change admissions policy, even when it is judged to be
unlawful. It cannot understand that and, frankly, I cannot understand
it. The Education Committee recently interviewed the schools
adjudicator, and it was clear that he was particularly unhappy about
that proposal. I understand that he will leave his post early, which
says clearly what he thinks about the Government’s
proposals.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000356">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
do not understand the proposal that local authorities will no longer be
required to submit their annual review of local admission arrangements
to the schools adjudicator. That will not save bureaucracy or money,
because my understanding is that local authorities will still have to
carry out their annual reviews; they just will not have to send them on
to the schools adjudicator. The purpose cannot be to save the cost of a
stamp, because e-mail can be used. If the Government are serious about
openness, transparency and fairness in admissions, why on earth would
they not want to gather such information together, publish it, and look
at the good and the bad—there is good and bad out there. That
seems to go against the Government’s avowed policy of openness
and
transparency.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000357">&#160;</a>

welcome the proposal to bring academies’ admissions arrangements
into the remit of the schools adjudicator, but other parts of clause 34

schools that are reluctant to admit pupils with additional needs to
keep them out, and severely weaken parents’

                           </strong> First, let me say that I agree with the sentiments
behind amendment 147. Since coming into office, his Government have
tackled the growing inequality in our education system through the
introduction of the pupil premium, the SEN Green Paper “Support
and Aspiration” and, crucially, freeing schools from the weight
of regulation, bureaucracy and centralised control that prevents them
from focusing on one thing, namely raising educational standards for
all children, especially the most disadvantaged. Choosing the right
school for their child is one of the most important things parents can
do, and I agree with the hon. Member for North West Durham that going
through that process is hugely stressful for some parents. It is right
that admissions authorities should be mindful of their communities when
setting admissions arrangements.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000361">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Let me respond
to the comment made by the hon. Member for Cardiff West about whether
there is a hidden agenda to introduce covert selection through
revisions to the admissions code. Absolutely not. There are more than
660 mandatory requirements in the current code—too many to
follow—and the chief adjudicator says that the code needs to be
more accessible, That is what we seek to achieve with the revisions. We
require admissions authorities to consult their communities, because we
want to ensure that access to schools is fair and helps to achieve our
agenda of closing the attainment gap. When they amend or set
regulations, we will continue to require admissions authorities to
consult their local communities.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000362">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The school
admissions code contains a clear framework for schools and local
authorities to set clear, fair and lawful admissions policies. The code
ensures that admissions arrangements do not discriminate on the basis
of race, sex or disability. It also prevents admissions authorities
from asking for information that might lead to children being
discriminated against based on their background, and through fair
access protocols it ensures that the most vulnerable children are given
extra help in securing a school place.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000363">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
independent schools adjudicator is available for parents who are
concerned about the admissions policies of their local schools and it
can decide on the lawfulness and overall fairness of those policies. As
hon. Members will know, local authorities are already under a duty to
exercise their education functions with a view to as far as possible
ensuring fair access to opportunity for education and increasing
opportunities for parental choice. All members of the Committee share a
commitment to fair access, and successive codes have built on that, so
the effect the amendment would have is already in place. I am confident
that the codes in force that govern school admissions and admissions
appeals already set out the parameters of a system that ensures
fairness and that priority and support are given to those who need it
most, including looked-after children and those with statements of
special educational
needs.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000364">&#160;</a>

Secretary of State announced a review of the admissions process and I
assure hon. Members that the draft codes on which we will soon consult
will continue to have fairness and equality as their guiding
principles. As I said in the policy statement that we circulated to the

effectiveness of fair access protocols.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000365">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendment is about admissions forums, which we have discussed under a
previous amendment. Their abolition will remove a level of local
scrutiny working to ensure fair admissions, in which representatives of
schools, including heads, governors, parents and diocesan authorities,
are involved. They are a good example of localism—even, I dare
say, the big society. Such a move is unwise at a time when the number
of schools that set their own admissions criteria is increasing. In a
few years’ time, we could have more than 20,000 schools setting
their own admissions criteria. Now is not the time to remove an
effective local mechanism working in favour of fair
admissions.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000376">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">As
has been mentioned, the Sutton Trust study found that the most socially
selective schools were those that are their own admission authority.
There is well-researched evidence for that. In “Unlocking the
Gates: Giving disadvantaged children a fairer deal in school
admissions”, Barnardo's drew on its experience of working with
poor families and called for greater scrutiny of school

which are their own admission
authorities.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000377">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Government have provided no evidence of the need to make the proposed
change. The White Paper supports the local authority role to ensure
fair access, but then demolishes the support that helps authorities to
do that work. Establishing and working with an admissions forum is
dismissed by the Government as a bureaucratic requirement, yet the
Department for Education’s impact assessment states sets out
only a tiny cost saving from the abolition of admissions forums. That
shows that they are not much of a bureaucratic burden, especially when
balanced against the loss of scrutiny to ensure that admissions are
fair.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000378">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Perhaps
the Government think that the combination of the local authority
scrutinising local admissions, along with the powers of some parents,
schools and the local authority to complain to the adjudicator at
national level, is sufficient, but that is to neglect the importance of
those local groups working out fair arrangements, often dealing
collaboratively with sensitive issues, such as in-year admissions and
the fair access protocol, which are of great importance to parents and
schools. It needs to be borne in mind that it is far more efficient to
deal with issues locally, involving local stakeholders, than to refer
every contentious case to the schools adjudicator. Although important,
the latter should be the last resort, used efficiently as the final
arbiter when a local agreement cannot be
reached.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000379">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">A
key theme of the Bill, as stated in the impact assessment, is

                        <p>In
fact, abolishing admissions forums will reduce the role of parents in
admissions, because parents are part of the required membership of the
forums. Furthermore, forums can and do invite parent groups to come to
their meetings to make representations. Parents, regardless of where
they live, are entitled to have an effective, independent monitoring
body in each local authority to ensure fair admissions criteria and
processes, as laid down in the school admissions code, and to ensure
they are operated by all admission authorities. Voluntary forums would
not have the same powers, for example, to refer objections to the
adjudicator. Voluntary forums were introduced in 1998, but they were
soon made mandatory under the Education Act 2002, to ensure that good
practice where there was active leadership could be spread throughout
all local authorities. Later departmental consultation in 2008 included
a proposal to make admissions forums voluntary, but that was rejected
by
respondents.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000381">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
adjudicator, Ian Craig, supports the retention of admissions
forums—perhaps that is why he has to go. In his latest report,
for 2010, he recommends changes to the content of the local authority

that may need attention. He was disappointed that very few forum
reports had been sent, but said that some of

document. He repeated that view in his evidence to the Select Committee
on Education,

you can see from the recommendations in my annual report last year, I
believe, and I committed myself to believing, that admissions forums

                           </strong> The debate is about the admissions forum; it has
nothing to do with the admissions code. We tried to get the codes ready
for this debate, but they are not actually connected. All the proposals
are set out in the White Paper, and the Bill implements those aspects
of the White Paper that need legislation. There will be plenty of time

direction of travel. Where do they intend to go? This part of the Bill
takes away what I consider to be safeguards for parents and children.
We know how easy it is to have covert selection. We have to ask why,
nationally, faith schools have fewer pupils on free school meals than
non-faith schools. One faith school that I know of told parents that if
their child had an SEN statement, which would of course attract money
for the school, or was really bright academically, their school was a
really good to choose; but if the child was just in the middle or less
academically bright, it was not the school for them to
choose.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000397">&#160;</a>

all hon. Members here I have people who come to my surgery because they
did not get their children into the school that they wanted. The
closest school to me, which is just outside my constituency, has been
closed those living in to one part of it. The next nearest school, just
down the road, is talking about becoming an academy because the local
authority is trying to rejig the school’s boundaries, which the
school does not want, because it does not want to have to take children
from the council estate. That high-flying school is now saying that it
will become an academy, so that it can have its own admissions criteria
and set its own
boundary.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000398">&#160;</a>

clarifying precisely what clause 34 does in relation to admissions
forums. It removes the duty on local authorities in England to
establish admissions forums, but does not ban or abolish them. We are
advocating not their abolition, 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 774<a class="bkMark" name="Column774">&#160;</a>
                           </div>but their adoption only if that is the right local solution. Local
authorities and the communities they serve must be allowed to make
their own decisions on what systems will work for them. It is
disproportionate and bureaucratic that legislation should set out such
requirements.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000401">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Admission
forums have no substantive powers; they are advisory groups made up of
voluntary members. It is true that they have the power to request
information to help them compile a report to the schools adjudicator,
should they choose to write one, as well as the power to object to
admission arrangements. Such reports contain a forum’s analysis
of the extent to which admission arrangements in its area ensure fair
access to educational opportunity, as well as any recommendations the
forum wishes to make. Despite all that, last year only 14 out of 152
forums actually wrote a report; of those 14, seven were late and missed
the deadline, meaning that no action could be taken on the issues
highlighted. The role of forums’ reports is better filled by
local authority reports that are required annually. As we will discuss
later, local authority reports will now be published locally, so that
the local community can see and make use of the information provided by
the local authority.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000402">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Later this
year, we shall change the regulations on powers to object, so that
anyone with an interest or issue can object to admission arrangements
in their area. That gives the public and parents greater powers than
those in current legislation. That is far more powerful than a limited
and prescriptive list of possible objectors and further reduces the
need to mandate such forums. Admissions forums are therefore a
duplication of effort and expense, which is not a good use of
taxpayers’ money.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000403">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In some
areas, forums work well, and partners want to work together. We support
that voluntary approach, but some local authorities have told us that
the arrangements cost them £10,000 a year. If we scale that up
across 152 local authorities, we find that £1.5
million a year is wasted. On top of that, ensuring that forums are
quorate is often challenging, with poor attendance from the local
authority and partners, and those who do attend are often not
representative of the local community; in particular, forums have had
problems getting parental representation. Other local authorities have
told us that their forum is useful in helping to ensure that admission
arrangements are fair and non-discriminatory. We therefore have a
rather mixed bag. Arrangements should be made locally that work for
that
locality.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000404">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Admissions
forums can refer an objection to the adjudicator, but having the forum
as a check on arrangements is not reliable. Last year, only five
objections of the 151 made to the schools adjudicator were made by a
forum, and four of those were made by the same forum,
Northamptonshire—three cheers for Northamptonshire on getting
its reports in and having its objections taken seriously. However, that
raises the question of why only one other
forum—Bromley—made any objections. Where forums are
effective, they will be continued, but where they are disbanded, local
people will still be able to contribute to admissions consultations and
to make objections to the schools adjudicator if they feel arrangements
are
unfair.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000405">&#160;</a>

of the associated perils. As I have said, a deep suspicion exists that
the Government are trying to create more wriggle room around admissions
to allow schools to get out of their responsibilities on fair access.
The saga of the adjudicator suggests that there may be something to
that concern. As we have heard, we have had no opportunity to look at
the draft admissions code, which—whatever the Minister
says—would have informed our debate about whether the Government
intend to simplify or dilute the admissions code, and whether they
intend to dilute the adjudicator’s ability to do his
job.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000412">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Clause 34(3)
removes the adjudicator’s most important powers over school
admissions. At a stroke, it seriously undermines the ability of the
Office of the Schools Adjudicator to fulfil its primary purpose as
expressed through the schools admissions code. That power originally
appeared in section 90(6) of the School Standards and Framework Act
1998, which provided for the adjudicator, where he upholds an
objection,
to<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000413">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“specify

                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Early
experience showed that that power was a bit more limited than was
originally intended. Following judicial reviews, it became clear that
the power of the adjudicator to review and change admission
arrangements was restricted by the terms of the original objection. It
transpired that objectors frequently and understandably focused on a
single aspect of the arrangements that particularly affected them and
their families, but adjudicators inevitably read the arrangements as a
whole 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 776<a class="bkMark" name="Column776">&#160;</a>
                           </div>and began to notice other matters that were inconsistent with the code,
which really needed to be rectified. A number of schools that did not
want to comply with the code managed to avoid doing so, however,
because of the unduly narrow drafting of that power.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000414">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It was
further discovered that because admission arrangements are
re-determined every year, any changes that were made following a
successful objection remained in place only for the year in question.
Schools who wanted to subvert the will of Parliament were able to
revert to another version of their previous non-compliant arrangements
the following year. It became necessary for the original objector or
some other eligible person to re-object, and for the adjudicator to
consider the matter again, forcing all parties to go through the whole
process all over
again.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000415">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

                        </h4>
                        <p class="tabbed">That
led to a number of what might be called wars of attrition about
admissions—perhaps we should call them wars of
admission—between schools and objectors. It was a total waste of
time and money and it was clearly not in the public interest, because
it was completely against what Parliament had intended. In the light of
that experience, the 1998 Act was amended—first by the Education
and Inspections Act 2006, and subsequently by the Education and Skills
Act 2008—to produce section 88J as it now stands. That section
sets out clear powers for the adjudicator whenever admissions
arrangements are under consideration to specify any appropriate
modifications to the admissions arrangements—whether they arise
from an objection or otherwise—and to protect the modifications
from being changed back for up to three years. The section also obliges
the admissions authority to comply with those decisions
forthwith—not to drag its heals, but to get on and change the
admissions arrangements. The present arrangements include powers for
the adjudicator to specify any appropriate modifications and protect
them from being changed
back.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000416">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendment seeks to keep the adjudicator’s powers to make
modifications. Analysis of the cases that have been determined on the
Office of the Schools Adjudicator website shows that the
adjudicator’s available powers have been used sparingly,
sensitively and appropriately. Adjudicators have invariably consulted
admission authorities on the substance of necessary modifications. In
many cases where schools have indicated their willingness to comply
with the code, they have been given the opportunity to make the
necessary improvements, and it has not been deemed necessary to use the
three-year power of protection. However—and this goes to the
root of the Minister’s argument that always and everywhere
things are perfect in the world of school management—in a small
number of cases it has been necessary to use the powers to enforce
specific wording and to protect changes. The adjudicator has, quite
rightly, been prepared to do so.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000417">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The Minister
might suggest that if the powers are rarely used, they will not be
missed. He might choose to deploy such an argument. There are two key
reasons why it is important that the powers be retained. First, the
cases in which it has been necessary for the adjudicator to use the
full enforcement powers have invariably been made against schools that
have deliberately sought to manipulate their intake in the
schools’ interests, whatever 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 777<a class="bkMark" name="Column777">&#160;</a>
                           </div>those might have been. Such schools subvert the rights of parents and
children to secure fair access to their preferred school.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000418">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Secondly, and
more significantly, the existence of suitably strong enforcement powers
bolsters respect for the code and the willing compliance of the
majority. Such powers help the majority to comply fairly. Repeal of the
provisions will make it difficult to compel an unwilling admissions
authority—and there will be many more of those as a result of
the Government’s policies—to comply fully with the code.
It may take two or more objections spread over different admission
rounds to make an appropriate change. Such a change would be in place
only for one year before the admissions authority could revert to its
previous arrangements in the hope that potential objectors would not
notice, or would lack the stomach or resources for a further
battle—another war of attrition on admissions.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000419">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Again, there
would be an unnecessary proliferation of bureaucracy, which I know the
Minister is allergic to. A determined school would be well placed to
win any war of attrition that might develop between it and objectors.
The work of the Office of the Schools Adjudicator would simultaneously
be multiplied and made less effective. At a time when all public
offices are seeking to work more efficiently, the Bill, in effect, will
impose not an efficiency gain but an inefficiency loss in relation to
the work of the adjudicator.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000420">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It is
difficult to see what the Government expect to achieve by the repeal.
The Minister has said that the new, streamlined code, as he calls it,
is imminent, which will be easier to understand and to apply. We have
not seen that yet, so we cannot judge whether his words are true. The
point is that if the Minister wants to see a revised code implemented,
he needs a schools adjudicator with the existing powers to assist in
the effective implementation of any new code. I ask the Minister,
therefore, to think again about diluting the powers of the schools
adjudicator. Accepting amendment 149 will ensure not only that the
measures are efficient, but that the revised schools admissions code in
its imminent, but as yet unseen, form is implemented in the way that
the Government claim they want it to be.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000421">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> May I explain to the Committee again what this part
of clause 34 does? It removes the adjudicator’s power to
directly modify admission arrangements as part of his decision in
relation to objections received from parents and other persons. We
believe that that is the right step. It should be for schools to
implement such decisions, giving them the freedom to decide how and
what to change to comply with the adjudicator’s binding
decision. We should trust schools to set their admission arrangements
and to respond appropriately to any decision made by the adjudicator.
Admission authorities and schools will be held accountable for changes
to their admission arrangements. They will no longer be reliant on the
adjudicator to modify their arrangements, nor should they be reliant on
the local authority to check that they have done so. We must allow
schools and others to get on with such changes.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000422">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Clause 34
does not affect the adjudicator’s scope to receive objections
and consider admission arrangements. For example, it leaves in place
section 88I(5) of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998, which
allows the adjudicator to consider and determine any 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 778<a class="bkMark" name="Column778">&#160;</a>
                           </div>admission arrangements that he suspects do not, or may not, conform with
the requirements of admissions law. Such decisions, like those made in
response to objections from parents, remain binding for admission
authorities. I do not accept, therefore, the idea that the clause
constitutes a weakening of the admissions system.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000423">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The adjudicator’s decision is binding, so
schools have to do so. They have to correct their arrangements in the
way that they see fit, and not in a prescribed way by the schools
adjudicator. The remedy is in place, even if the clause amends the
relevant provisions of the 1998 Act.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000425">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Although such
decisions would be binding for an admission authority, under clause 34,
the adjudicator could no longer specify the changes, as I have said,
that an admission authority has to make its arrangements. That is as it
should be, and the removal of section 88J means that it is for the
admission authority to decide what action is necessary to give effect
to the adjudicator’s decision to uphold a complaint, as I have
just explained to the hon. Lady.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000426">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Where an
objection falls within the schools adjudicator’s remit, it is of
course right that the adjudicator should consider and decide on that
matter. He may also consider other matters in respect of complying with
requirements, and he may make binding decisions on such matters where
he considers that there is an additional, legitimate concern. Again,
admission authorities must comply and implement such decisions as they
would with the primary decision. It is for schools to make any
necessary changes as a result, and they will have the freedom to decide
how and what to change, knowing that the Government trust them to get
it right. The adjudicator can still comment on or recommend changes to
the admissions policy, which admission authorities are expected to
consider carefully in line with a shorter, simpler admissions code,
which will ensure that action is prompt.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000427">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I therefore
consider amendment 151 to be disproportionate, because it would give
local authorities the powers to direct schools to comply with a
decision made by the schools adjudicator. The amendment refers to
decisions of the adjudicator made under section 88E of the 1998 Act.
The section applies where admission authorities of maintained schools
propose to change their determined admission arrangements after they
have been determined for a school year, but before that school year
ends. Those are commonly referred to as in-year variations. Such
changes are likely to be infrequent, as the hon. Member for Cardiff
West said, but where they are made, a school has to refer the proposed
changes to the adjudicator, who will determine whether they should have
effect until the end of the school year and whether any modifications
are required.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000428">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">On academies,
in-year variations to their admission arrangements are made in
accordance with their funding agreements and subject to agreement with
the Secretary of State. In each of those situations, there is simply no
need for the local authority to have an additional power to enforce. I
think I have covered all the points made by the hon. Gentleman and
therefore I ask him to withdraw his
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000429">&#160;</a>

for the schools adjudicator to step in and forthwith make sure that
schools are complying and that their admissions code is rewritten to be
compliant. I accept that, in most cases, there is some wriggle room to
try to avoid that. That is what currently happens. The bit of grit that
is in the system means that, in most cases, schools will probably
comply and will probably comply in full. The Minister is putting some
more wriggle room back into a system that there has been abuse of in
the past. He is multiplying the opportunities for that abuse to occur
in the future because there are going to be many more admissions
authorities and he is weakening and diluting the role of the
adjudicator.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000432">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> May I assure the hon. Gentleman that that is not the
case? Schools are legally obliged to implement the binding decision of
the adjudicator. The question is about who makes the change. Under
these arrangements, the school makes a change rather than the
adjudicator spoon-feeding and dictating precisely what the change
should be. Fear not, they are required to make a change to ensure that
the admissions arrangements comply with the code. If they do not, legal
consequences
follow.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000433">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The use of the indefinite article is very
telling: the Minister said that schools are required to make
“a” change. The point is that, in most cases,
“a” change or “the” change required will be
made because schools know that if they do not do so, the admissions
adjudicator can compel that change or put it in themselves. The point
of having that stick in the system is to ensure that the schools do
what they are supposed to do, rather than making a change that might go
some way towards moving the admissions code in the right direction
without meeting all the needs required. I am afraid that the measure is
a dilution because, in practice, it will mean that schools are more
able to avoid the full implementation of their obligations forthwith,
when they are found to be operating an admissions code in an unfair
fashion.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000434">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">For that
reason, we are very concerned about what the Government are doing in
the clause. I respect the Minister’s sincerity, and I understand
his desire to reduce bureaucracy, but he has to accept—this has
been a real problem in the past—that the system must include the
ability for swift action to be taken forthwith to ensure that schools
are being fair to all children and parents.

                           </strong> Amendment 150, which seeks to keep the system of

another provision in the Bill that tinkers unnecessarily with an
existing law that is working well. Subsection (4) changes the
requirement that local authorities report annually to the schools
adjudicator about compliance with the school admissions code in their
area. The reporting duty is not removed altogether, but existing
arrangements are removed and a new duty to report

Minister clarify what his intentions are? It would perhaps be easier to
understand what is intended here if, again, we had sight of the
imminent new draft school admissions code. Be that as it may, if the
Bill becomes law, we will certainly see an extension of the Secretary
of State’s power to determine whether and, if so, to whom any
report should be made. If the Government are concerned that the
existing duty, as prescribed in regulations, is too onerous, the
regulations could be simplified without the need to amend primary
legislation.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000463">&#160;</a>

(4) removes the current certainty of a clear duty in primary
legislation for local authorities to report to the independent
adjudicator and replaces it with, as in so many parts of the Bill, an
extension of ministerial power. Once again, the role of the independent
adjudicator is undermined, and one mechanism whereby the school
admissions code can be implemented and enforced is removed. It is
difficult to see what the Government expect to achieve through a change
to a system that is understood and is beginning to work well in many
areas. I am sure that the Minister will try to explain what he is
trying to achieve. There is no doubt that many changes could be made to
streamline and improve the working of the system. However, if he does
not wish to see it implemented, why has the Minister gone to the
trouble of reforming the code? Without the reports, that objective will
be
weakened.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000464">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendments
152 and 153 seek to ensure that the admissions code requires reporting
of in-year admissions arrangements and on the operation of the fair
access protocol. The explanatory notes to the Bill indicate that the
school admissions code will contain the requirements for local
authority reports on admissions. Again, without sight of the code, it
is difficult to judge its contents and likely effect. That is why the
Committee should have seen a draft code before this debate. It is a
failure on the Government’s part that they have not managed to
give us one, not least because they said in the White Paper that they
would.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000465">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendments would ensure that local authority reports provide
information about children who are in need of a school place either
because their parents are newly moved to the area or because they have
been excluded from a school due to challenging behaviour. Requiring
such reports specifically to include reporting of in-year admissions
arrangements and the fair access protocol will mean that that
information is collected and a check made on children who might be out
of school. Does the Minister intend the admissions code to contain the
reporting requirements that I have outlined? I was going to ask him
when he will publish the consultation on the admissions code, but I
think that he will just say “imminently” again. I take it
that that means tomorrow.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000466">&#160;</a>

September the following year. Under current legislation, the local
authority, along with its admissions forum, is a statutory consultee
for all such arrangements in its area. The Bill removes the statutory
requirement to have a forum, which will leave only the local authority
in a position to take an overview of what is happening across all
admission authorities in the locality. It is vitally important that
somebody takes such an overview, as individual schools’
decisions, although reasonable in themselves, can interact so as to
produce a situation highly detrimental to some parents or groups of
parents and
children.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000469">&#160;</a>

current schools admissions code—I have it here, although not the
one that the Government promised us—makes it clear in paragraphs
4.7 to 4.9 that local authorities are expected to take steps, either by
negotiation or by using their powers of reference to the adjudicator,
to ensure that all admission authorities in the area comply. The
removal of the local authority duty to report to the adjudicator and
the removal of the admission forum to provide expert local
accountability on the report mean that that important aspect of
securing compliance with the admissions code will effectively go by
default. Of course, it is possible for the requirement to report on
in-year admissions and for the fair access protocol to be written into
the revised school admissions code, but it is difficult to comment
further until we have seen what was the imminent but is now becoming
the soon-to-be-released draft of the
code.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000470">&#160;</a>

154 is an attempt to ensure that the standards set for reporting
continue. The amendment would require the local authority to ensure
that its analysis of and response to the admission arrangements for
individual schools is published. That would be of great assistance to
parents, as it would prove a ready source of practical advice to help
them confirm whether the arrangements for any particular school comply
with relevant equality legislation and the code.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000471">&#160;</a>

possible to check whether local authorities are properly discharging

have fully answered the hon. Gentleman’s question. As a
Government we have been clear—we were clear even before the

with Opposition Members that having local authorities produce a report
on admissions arrangements in their areas, especially on how it
supports our most vulnerable groups, is important local information for
local people. Where we disagree, and this amendment highlights that, is
that we believe we should continue to force every local authority to
report centrally—in this case to the office of the schools
adjudicator. The report will be much more effective as a local
accountability tool, enabling parents to see and comment on the service
that they are being

it to be produced in at least January or February. There would have

Government do not realise the potential damage that the clause will do
to fair admissions. That is the charitable position for the Opposition
to take, and, as a charitable person, that is the position that I am
taking. I believe that Ministers are sincere in what they say about

                        <p class="tabbed">I
have appealed previously to Liberal Democrat colleagues, and I praise
Back-Bench Conservative Members who have participated in the Bill, some
more than others. They have made an attempt to participate and ask
appropriate questions from time to time. Whatever happens to the vote
on clause stand part, I would urge them to look at the clause again
thoroughly and consider

                           </div>its implications, because problems will develop in their areas, too. The
admissions system will be diluted in schools in every constituency that
is affected by the Bill, but it will be too late. It will be impossible
to help parents and constituents who come along to our surgeries
because the power will no longer be there to compel schools effectively
to adhere to the
code.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000491">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
are reading a great deal about admissions and the promised code of
practice in the press. We read in one press story that free schools
will be able to admit the children of those involved in their
establishment, which is an interesting back-door way of gaining
admission to a school: one just has to join the committee that sets it
up and be guaranteed a place for their child. Another story at the
weekend detailed the proposal to reduce the use of a lottery to
allocate school places. I ask the Minister again to tell the Committee,
which should have first sight of such proposals, whether that is the
Government’s policy. Is that a bit of the code they have leaked
to <em>The Daily Telegraph</em> but which we have not seen yet in
Committee, saying that lotteries may be used only by individual schools
while local authorities will be banned from using them? I am interested
in the Minister’s
response.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000492">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
am not sure that the Government have come fully clean on the
implications of their proposals for school admissions. Everything we
hear of through the press—second-hand information,
admittedly—seems designed to undermine fair admissions. The
Government say that their aim will be to maintain fairness as the
code’s guiding principle, but the clause puts that aim to the
test.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000493">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
want to hear the Minister’s response and what assurances he can
give about the concerns expressed by people such as the those at the
Sutton Trust and experts such as Chris Waterman, who has published a
series of pamphlets on the dodgy practices that primary schools, in
particular those that are their own admission authorities, have
employed to ensure that their intake gives them a high place in the
performance tables. The opportunity for such practices to continue or
to be brought back ought not to be increased by the provisions of the
clause.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000494">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

                              <span class="hs_CLMember">Mr

                           </strong> The clause makes three important changes in respect
of admissions. First, it removes the ability of the adjudicator to
modify any arrangements he finds to be in breach of the law by
repealing section 88J of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998.
It does not, as some have tried to claim through the press, weaken
admission arrangements. The adjudicator may still make decisions
binding on all parties and exercise his discretion where he finds
issues other than the specific objection to be
unlawful.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000495">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Our
only major change is to place the responsibility to make admission
arrangements compliant with the code back with the admission
authorities. Admission authorities must act on the adjudicator’s
decision to uphold a complaint, but it is up to them to decide how they
should change the arrangements to make them lawful. We are committed to
strengthening the powers of parents and communities and to reforming
how admissions work so that more children, especially those from
low-income families, can have more opportunities and not
fewer.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000496">&#160;</a>

			Column number: 786<a class="bkMark" name="Column786">&#160;</a>
                        </div>
                        <p class="tabbed">Secondly,
we are removing the requirement on local authorities to report to the
school’s adjudicator on admissions in their area. They will
still be required to produce and publish a report, but to their local
communities instead, ensuring that those who manage and deliver local
services report to those who should benefit from the
services.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000497">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
the Committee will have seen from the policy statement, the revised
code will specify some important elements of those reports, as we
believe it right that special educational needs and looked-after
children should form at least part of every local authority report.
Beyond that, however, it will be for each local authority to decide
what it should report. The adjudicator may, if he so wishes, do what
everyone else does and download the reports from the
internet.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000498">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Thirdly,
the clause removes the duty on local authorities in England to
establish admission forums. I do not advocate their abolition but,
rather, their adoption only if that is the right local solution. Local
authorities and the communities they serve must be allowed to make
their own decisions on what systems will work for them. It is
disproportionate and bureaucratic for the legislation to set out such
requirements.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000499">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Removing
forums does not mean a bad deal for vulnerable children. We shall still
require, through the code, all local authorities to create a
fair-access protocol, and we will require all schools, including
academies under the Bill, to participate. The clause is a small but
important addition to our changes, which reduce bureaucracy, increase
accountability and ensure that parents can have increasing confidence
in the
system.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000500">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> It is pretty deplorable that we have to rely on
reports from <em>The Daily Telegraph</em> to know what is in the draft
admissions code. I am afraid that is typical of the Government and
their news management strategy, despite protestations that they are not
interested in spin. It is an absolute disgrace that although we do not
get sight of the draft admissions code, the Government use the pages of

                           </strong> The clause removes the present restriction on
schools that means that where a school charges for a meal, it must
charge the same price for the same quantity of the same item. Current
arrangements permit meal price flexibility only when a school or local
authority uses the power to innovate procedure, which can involve
months of planning and paperwork. The Bill will make pricing more
responsive to local needs and free schools from bureaucracy. It will
enable schools to make special offers, for example to pupils during the
early weeks or first term at a new school, to increase the take-up of
school lunches and help form the habit of eating a healthy lunch.
Alternatively, schools may choose to help working families on low
incomes who do not qualify for free school meals, or families that have
several children at the
school.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000528">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Flexible
charging is optional, and there is no requirement to use it. Those that
want it, however, will have the freedom to market lunches to those who
need extra encouragement to eat well, or to target those in need of
financial help. At the same time, if schools wish to increase their
take-up to make the service more sustainable, they will be free to do
so without the burden of applying for the power to
innovate.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000529">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Authorities
such as Bolton and North Yorkshire have obtained the power to innovate
and have used flexible charging. They have chosen to invest in order to
increase the take-up of lunches or to help those in need of additional
support. The clause also provides the safeguard of a ceiling for meal
prices based on the locally defined cost of producing the meal in that
school or local authority. It will mean that no pupil can be charged
more for a meal than it cost to provide. Although I am sure this will
not happen, that will prevent a school from attempting to overcharge
some pupils to subsidise others. Schools want to increase the take-up
of meals. It is not in their interests to over-charge, so they will not
want to. In many cases, doing so would jeopardise the service
itself.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000530">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">This
is a simple measure, which will benefit families, teachers, caterers
and local authorities. Research shows that healthy school meals help
pupils’ concentration, behaviour and ability to learn. If
schools persuade more children to take a school lunch through this
measure, their meal service will become more cost-effective. For those
reasons, I hope that members of the Committee will be happy for the
clause to stand part of the Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000531">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I could not agree more with the Minister about
healthy school meals and their importance in helping children’s
concentration and education. I simply reflect on the deplorable decline
in standards after my mother’s retirement as a school dinner
lady. I do not associate the two things, although previous Government
policy might have something to do with it. I had not revealed to the
Committee that my mother was a dinner lady in the primary school that I
attended, so I am afraid I was forced to eat that tapioca, which I
despised, but that is another
story.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000532">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
want to ask the Minister a few questions. He gave a couple of examples
of schools that might choose to charge flexibly. What will be the
impact on schools’ finances if they choose to charge less than
cost price to some of their pupils? Does he have any views about where
schools might obtain the funds to subsidise meals for some of their
pupils? Is there an increasing bureaucratic burden on schools that
choose to charge flexibly? How will schools determine eligibility for
reduced price meals, for example, for children from families on low
income? Barnardo’s told us in evidence to the Committee that
household income is a difficult variable to track and can be fairly
easy for better-off households to misrepresent.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000533">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Will the
Minister explain why academies will be exempt from the cap? The NASUWT
told us that exempting academies means that their ability to charge
what they feel is appropriate could exclude some children and young
people not only from participating in school meals but from going to
the school in the first place. The cost of a school meal is an
essential determining factor for many parents on low incomes when
considering the choice of schools for their child, particularly if they
have large families. I would be grateful for any reassurance from the
Minister.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000534">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The hon. Member for Cardiff West is right that I was
going to cite Bolton, for example, as evidence of how this can work.
Bolton used the power to innovate, and the take-up levels increased to
record levels as a consequence of what it did to 86% of the targeted
group, which was 37% higher than the average take-up in all the year
groups in Bolton primary schools. Its subsequent £1 meal deal
produced a 69.9% take-up, which was some 21% higher than the norm.
Bolton’s initiative also produced a significant increase in
statutory free school meal
take-up.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000535">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Gentleman asked a good question: if we are not allowed to
over-charge others to fund cutting the price to some groups, where will
the money come from in these strapped times? Schools that use the
flexibility have chosen to invest funding to increase take-up to build
a better, more sustainable and cost-effective service. Therefore they
have used their school funds deliberately to make their school meal
service more sustainable, and that in turn will have led to a higher
take-up, which, if the food is healthy, will have a direct effect in
leading to better attainment and concentration levels and
behaviour.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000536">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Gentleman asked how eligibility will be determined. It will be
determined by the school. The school is free to do so, provided it does
not charge more than the cost of the food. The provisions of the
Education Act 1996 do not apply to academies or free schools, so they
do not need to apply for a power to facilitate

They are already free to make special offers to groups of children, as
they judge appropriate, to increase take-up. Such an approach will be
available in academies, and free school meals apply in academies. No
academy will charge exorbitant fees for their school meals if they
expect anyone to buy them. It is a simple market mechanism. With those
assurances, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will support the clause

most appropriate form of school when a new school is needed. It
provides that, before publishing proposals for a competition for the

consent of the Secretary of State. It also provides for the Secretary
of State or the local authority, with the consent of the Secretary of
State, to be able to halt a competition at an early first stage before
the closing date for proposals to be submitted and that academy
proposals under a section 7 competition will no longer need to be
submitted to local authorities for approval. They will instead be

slightly surprised that the hon. Member for Cardiff West seems to be
hostile to our proposal. Tony Blair, in the previous
Government’s White Paper in 2005, first sought to change the
local authority role from being a provider of education to being a
local commissioner, so it could champion parental choice pushing for
improvement rather than interfering in the day-to-day running of
schools. The hon. Gentleman has asked whether the provision will
restrict parental choice. No; the intention behind the schedule and the
general thrust of the Government’s education policy is to
increase parental choice by diversifying provisions and ensuring that
parents have a genuine choice of school to which they send their
children.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000549">&#160;</a>

is cross-party support for the academies programme and its expansion
under this Government. For example, Lord Adonis has described the
number of academies as “a phenomenal achievement”.
Recently, he said in an interview with <em>The

I nor Tony Blair believed that academies should be restricted to areas
with failing schools. We wanted all schools to be eligible for academy
status, and we were enthusiastic about the idea of entirely new schools
being established on the academy model, as in Michael Gove’s
free schools
policy.”<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000643">&#160;</a>

academies programme has proved to be a genuine revolution in raising
standards in schools across the country. A recent Public Accounts
Committee report found that the latest GCSE results show that standards
in academies continue to improve faster than the national average. It
was on the basis of evidence about the effectiveness of academies and
of international evidence from the USA, Sweden and from the far east
about the benefits of school autonomy, that the Government moved
quickly to introduce the free schools programme and expand the
academies programme, including by allowing existing maintained schools
to convert to academy status and gain greater freedoms. There are now

cross-party support for academies, which, as he has pointed out, were
introduced by the Labour Government. We had some support from
Conservatives, but none from the Liberal Democrats, whose conference
voted against having any academies whatever—they will no doubt
vote for them now. He is right that that there was cross-party support
between Labour and the Conservatives about the programme to establish
academies. In that programme, the Government focused relentlessly on
bringing academy status to underachieving schools, where other things
had failed. We focused our attention, laser-like, on trying to raise
standards for children who had not been given the right kind of
opportunity by the

right to do that, because those children were most likely to benefit
from such input given the sponsorship and leadership that comes with
academy status. The Government’s academies are very different;
they are a watered-down version in which sponsorship is not
required—a different kind of animal, albeit with the same

                        <p class="tabbed">The
Minister referred to free schools. I have visited charter schools in
America and so-called free schools in Sweden, and I have also
considered the research. The evidence is mixed. The Minister rightly
points out that, on occasion, a local school system can fail and that
some sort of autonomy via a charter school can work. As a generality,
however, the evidence suggests that it makes no difference to overall
standards. These kinds of school remain a small part of the system
rather than being a major component of the national or state education
system.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000563">&#160;</a>

are extremely concerned that these clauses will increase Government
control over the establishment of new schools, contrary to what the
Minister suggested. Unison said exactly that in evidence, and went on
to say that they weaken the local authority’s ability to plan an
education strategy in its area. If local authorities are to commission
schools, options should be available to them. At this late hour, I
shall not press for a Division, but we will look closely at what the
Minister has to say. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the

West. It is a continuing journey of academies, which enjoys cross-party
support—hopefully and encouragingly including Liberal Democrat

debate that we have had today. There was a frisson of tension earlier
between the hon. Member for Walthamstow and my hon. Friend the Member
for South Holland and The Deepings, but in general it has been a warm
debate. We have focused on positive values. In some of our amendments,
we tried to flesh out the value of positive local authority involvement
in our schools, in a section that would generally reduce their
role.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000567">&#160;</a>

enough and that they provide the opportunity and space for inspired
educational leaders, and that impediments will not be thrown in their

her whether an academy was a local school, but the general secretary of
the NASUWT was not able to answer a straightforward question. Her
answer was about 15 lines long, but it did not include yes or no. That
just connotes the lack of sympathy and understanding in some elements
of our educational infrastructure for what the Government are trying to
achieve. That is why it is so important that the Minister has done
everything he can to provide every opportunity to overcome some of
these

my community, we have two schools that for a number of years have
failed to meet the minimum standards expected of five GCSEs, including
maths and English. The percentages of children reaching that minimum
standard in one of those schools in the past few years were 32%, 28%,
39% and 33%. In the other school, those percentages were 9%, 20%, 20%,
29%. Those schools are in areas of economic deprivation and educational
challenge. Those are the areas that are crying out for new schools to
be set up by inspired teachers, who have a vision to provide
educational strength and inspiration to students and families in those
areas.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000572">&#160;</a>

an enormous remit of official and unofficial powers in doing that. We
have been engaged in discussions where local authorities have decision
rights over land, over whether they would take a meeting and over how
political votes can be used to create impediments. I find that
incredibly disheartening. If this is a shared journey that we are
taking—I did listen to some of the comments made earlier, and
there is always caution when change is made—and if we want to
have inspired teaching with freedoms, let us ensure that we have made
radical enough change so that inspired head teachers will not find
themselves worn down by the intransigence of bureaucracy, which wants

differently. In fact, Goldington

important point is that these schools must not operate in isolation.
The academies programme may create islands, which is why it is
important that if we loosen local authority control, we have to have
confidence that the other schools will be there to embrace the new
schools that are created. As I mentioned on Second Reading, I am proud
that, in my community, the Bedford borough learning exchange, which is
a collection of local head teachers, has said that it will welcome the
head of a new free school set up in Bedford. That is incredibly
important. This is a fantastic opportunity, offering people in the
poorest parts of our community a choice of two great comprehensives
that they can send their children to. That opportunity will not be
taken, because the impediments are so great. If the Minister has not
used this opportunity to clear all the impediments—every single
one—to enable teachers to take up this opportunity, in three or
four years’ time he will rue the day that this opportunity was
missed. I am seeking his reassurances that, when I vote for this, he
has done all he can to give that inspiration to teachers in our

movement, where two churches work alongside each other, looking for
things on which they agree. It is fair to say, as has been pointed out
by the hon. Member for Cardiff West, that in my party, there is
somewhat less enthusiasm for a proliferation of academies, although
there are members of my party who are enthusiastic about the process. I
recall that during the passage of the Academies Bill last summer, the
hon. Member for Gedling (Vernon Coaker), who was then the shadow
Minister, while sharing the aspirations for being laser-like to which
the hon. Member for Cardiff West referred to, betrayed an enthusiasm
for a growth in the number of academies. At the time, the Labour party
said that the academies that it brought in were different from the ones
that this Government are now seeking to bring in. The enthusiasm of the
hon. Member for Gedling for a proliferation of academies at the time
shows that he was perhaps less like a surgical laser and more like one
of Mr George Lucas’ extravaganzas. I suspect that had his
Government been returned to office, we would have seen an expansion of
the academy programme.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000580">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I accept what
the Minister says about choice, and I can imagine that in an area
without academy provision where parents believe that it would be more
beneficial to have it, a local authority might want to use the
provision in the schedule to explore that option. However, I can also
imagine a number of academies in an area, and people and parents
yearning to see a more traditional relationship between a new school
and a local authority.

                           </div>I can see things from both sides, and I hope that the Minister will
consider those factors in an area where there has been a big expansion
in the number of academies, which I accept he is passionate about and

                           </strong> Would the hon. Gentleman also like the Minister to
consider the strong evidence about the difficulties of financial
control with academies, particularly with their rapid expansion? We
have already seen evidence that a number of academies struggle to
achieve value for money. Their rapid expansion will pose another
challenge there. One of the things that local authorities can do is to
help with financial controls. Perhaps some of his colleagues in unitary
authorities might have severe concerns about schools spending large
amounts of money and about passing that money to schools without those
controls in place at such an alarming
rate.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000582">&#160;</a>

                           </div>that. That is not an area of concern to me. I want to make sure that
there is an element of choice in areas where there has already been a
great transfer of schools to academy status, and that there is the
possibility to explore another option if there is demand for
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000583">&#160;</a>

note that the Government have sought to ensure that schools will have
no huge financial benefits from achieving academy status, unlike the
previous Government, who gave a clear advantage to academy status by
providing schools with more money for participating in the process.
This Government are saying that schools would need to look at it for
other reasons—the community wants a debate, for
example—and there would not be any financial incentive. I
welcome the fact that the Government are delivering greater
transparency to the funding
formula.<a class="bkMark" name="11033061000584">&#160;</a>
