                  </span> On a point of order,
Mr Sheridan. I just wanted to express my surprise that the final
evidence session with witnesses this afternoon is due to end at 5.40
pm. My understanding is that normally afternoon sittings on a Tuesday
run until 7 o’clock. Given that we have already expressed
concerns this morning about the very limited time available to take
evidence from some witnesses, I am surprised that we will be finishing
early this afternoon. I wonder whether that was fixed this
morning.<a class="bkMark" name="1107138000013">&#160;</a>

issued a report that said the measure is do-it-yourself justice. What
impact will there be on courts and the numbers of litigants in person?
What about vulnerable people who cannot represent themselves?<a class="bkMark" name="1107138000024">&#160;</a>

Lodder:</strong>
                  </em> We have indeed made such a statement because
what I hear from young family barristers is the danger of serious
damage to the safety net for children, vulnerable people and
hard-working families. What I hear from judges in already busy court
centres is the significant risk that those people, who will now be
forced to conduct their own cases—in other words litigants in
person—will clog up the courts and dramatically increase the
cost of the system. In our view, this is a serious and worrying
prospect, particularly because among the wide group I speak
to—not just other members of the Bar but judges, interest groups
and members of the public who write because they share our concern for
the interest of justice—there is huge scepticism that any
savings will result from these cuts. Vulnerable people’s
positions are going to be compromised. People are going to be forced
into a position where they have to act on their own behalf in alien
surroundings under conditions of great stress and we think it will cost
more.<a class="bkMark" name="1107138000025">&#160;</a>

themselves.<a class="bkMark" name="1107138000026">&#160;</a>

                  </span> My question is to
Peter Lodder primarily, but Linda may be able to help as well. I
declare an interest as a criminal legal aid practitioner until the
election. It has been suggested by some quarters, including the Labour
party, that more savings could be made in the field of criminal legal
aid. We come to the Bill after many years of retrenchment in criminal
legal aid. What do you say to the proposition that more cuts can be
made in that area?<a class="bkMark" name="1107138000029">&#160;</a>

                     <strong>Peter
Lodder:</strong>
                  </em> Let us look back to the last day of the
previous Administration. I am not in the business of putting one party
against the other, but on the final day of the previous Administration,
criminal advocacy fees were cut by statutory instrument by 4.5%
successively over three years—a total of 13.5%. On top of that
cut, there are many cuts here, which will see, for example, the fees
paid in murder and manslaughter cases being 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 47<a class="bkMark" name="Column47">&#160;</a>
                  </div>cut by yet another 25%, so we are talking about nearly 40% worth of cuts
over very few years. This is against a background
of no rise in fee income for in excess of 15 years, because
fees have been frozen over that period. I am not pleading for more
money but I am saying that you are cutting us a lot already.<a class="bkMark" name="1107138000030">&#160;</a>

                  </em> It is well known that we have put forward a raft
of alternative proposals. We invite the Government again to look at
those proposals, and perhaps in more depth than previously. We agree
that savings have to be made but we think savings can be made without
impacting directly on the vulnerable. I think Peter would agree with me
that our concern is not really about the lawyers involved in this. A
very tiny percentage of solicitors in England and Wales are now
involved in legal aid work. We are interested in the impact on clients
who need help. I think we can say we are united on that
point.<a class="bkMark" name="1107138000031">&#160;</a>

concerns about the definition of domestic violence in the Bill. Could
you help me with the impact that that will have from a
practitioner’s point of
view?<a class="bkMark" name="1107138000033">&#160;</a>

                     <strong>Peter
Lodder:</strong>
                  </em> We have suggested that the definition used by
the Association of Chief Police Officers—clearly an
authoritative definition—is the one that should be used. The
Government have chosen not to do so. They have chosen what appears to
be a narrower definition. Obviously, we do not know exactly what that
will mean, save that it must be that fewer people will fall within the
definition, and therefore fewer people will be eligible for what little
legal aid is left.<a class="bkMark" name="1107138000034">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The problem is
further increased by the fact that now, in the absence of domestic
violence, people will not get legal aid. If a client presents at a
solicitor’s office on the back of a matrimonial dispute, and is
asked whether there is any evidence of domestic violence, and they are
aware of the fact that that is the only way that they will get legal
aid, there is a strong incentive to say that there is indeed
violence.<a class="bkMark" name="1107138000035">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The problem
compounds. If that allegation is made it must be investigated, and that
will bring in other authorities, at greater expense. In addition,
assuming for the moment that it is a false allegation, although the
person making the allegation will get legal aid, the alleged
perpetrator will not. In court, someone who may be facing a false
allegation will have to defend himself—it will probably be
himself—and will risk losing everything: children, liberty,
home, you name it. They will have to defend themselves in that
circumstance. We do not see how that can possibly advance access to
justice.<a class="bkMark" name="1107138000036">&#160;</a>

Government’s impact assessment, this will mean not bringing huge
numbers of cases, which should properly be brought in to
protect—in the majority of cases—women and children. All

                  </strong> But the success fee is a more general concept; it
is not just confined to clinical negligence. It is about whether you
think the success fee is a principle that needs reforming, as Lord
Justice Rupert Jackson’s review tried to change. The legal fees
for Trafigura were £100 million; the awards were £30
million. In the Naomi Campbell case with <em>The Mirror</em>, her awards
for damages were £3,500 and the legal fee award was £1.4
million. In both cases, the success fee made up nearly 50% of the legal
costs. What is clear from the example of both cases is that the success
fee, as in many other cases of success fee, is not shared with the
claimant; it is shared by the lawyers to compensate them for failing
cases elsewhere. That is the principle of the success fee as it was
changed, the latest in 2003, to compensate them for other failing cases
they might have elsewhere and to close the
risk.<a class="bkMark" name="1107138000064">&#160;</a>

                     <strong>Claire
Fazan:</strong>
                  </em> I will deal with part of that. The crucial
thing in terms of limiting the costs of civil litigation is dealing
with litigation behaviour. The concept that has been proposed by many
people in the context of these reforms is that there should be fixed
success fees that are tied to stages of litigation, and which are
designed to impact on litigation behaviour. Therefore, no success fee
is payable in a case where during the pre-action protocol period there
is an admission of liability. The defendant should not pay anything
then. If there is an admission of liability at any stage up until the
key trial preparation is being done, which is usually talked about as
being about four weeks before trial, there should be a success fee, but
not the sort of success fees that people are talking about in the
press—100%. There should be a limited, structured, fixed success
fee.<a class="bkMark" name="1107138000069">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It is only
when a case is litigated by defendants to trial or to immediately
before trial because of delays in dealing with settlement of cases that
the 100% success fee comes in. In the field of clinical negligence
litigation that is a typical pattern. It is only at the last stage that
admissions are made and cases are settled. Very few cases go to trial.
They are settled very late in the day, regardless of how they are
funded. It is in those cases that are taken in the very late stages or
to trial where if a claimant succeeds in proving what would have been
the subject of an admission, or is indeed the subject of a late
admission, it is entirely proper that they should recover a success
fee.<a class="bkMark" name="1107138000070">&#160;</a>

                     <strong>Linda
Lee:</strong>
                  </em> I agree entirely with Claire. What you have to
remember is that it is very dangerous to look at one case and say,
“That doesn’t sound right to me,” because you do
not know all the circumstances of that case. The answer is that the
court judges the circumstances of that case. On request of the paying
party, the court can look at the bill, look at the success fee and
decide whether or not that was appropriate. If the court feels that it
was not appropriate, it marks it down. There is a test to establish
whether or not it is a fair fee. The second thing is that you hear only
about the cases where the defendant has lost and, as Claire said, they
have chosen to pursue that claim to trial. You have to question why in
many
cases.<a class="bkMark" name="1107138000071">&#160;</a>

compensation. He or she pays for their failure in whatever field. I am
talking about the extra bit—the success fee—where that
defendant pays for some other failing case elsewhere or to compensate
the lawyer for taking on cases in other fields. I understand that the
people culpable should pay for the mistake they make and that they
should make reparations and so on. It is the extra bit I am concerned
about. One of the big law firms described it on its website this
morning as a “win bonus” that went to the lawyer. I do
not see why that principle is fair.<a class="bkMark" name="1107138000073">&#160;</a>

                  </em> The purpose of it is entirely because, as a
solicitor, you take on a risk. If I were running a spread of clinical
negligence cases, I would look at how much risk the firm could stand.
If solicitors are to take on riskier cases, there has to be a fighting
fund. Yes, you are right that that was the original principle, but the
award is not simply about giving you a fighting fund; it is far more
complex than that.<a class="bkMark" name="1107138000074">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">When you set
up a conditional fee arrangement, you have to notify the other side
that you have entered into it and provide information to the court, as
I said, about how you arrived at that figure. You do not simply say,
“I’d like 100% please.” You have to explain the
risk and the levels of risk. Also, the defendant’s behaviour is
looked at. The defendant has an opportunity to settle at earlier
stages. They generally have the knowledge and information, and that
opportunity. But the proposals in the civil costs part of the Bill say
that the defendant should take no risk or responsibility for their
behaviour and that instead it should be the injured person who does
that because you are talking about not recovering that element from the
defendant; you are talking about recovering it from the claimant. So
the claimant does not get 100% compensation for the injury they have
suffered.<a class="bkMark" name="1107138000075">&#160;</a>

least, one of the mechanisms is mediation. First, are there enough
mediators around to do this? Secondly, in your view is mediation a
substitute for court
action?<a class="bkMark" name="1107138000077">&#160;</a>

litigator’s armoury. The point about mediation is that it has to
be used at the right stage, in the right case, in the right way. You
cannot simply say, “It is day three, we will now apply mediation
or it doesn’t work.” The most successful mediations, as
with the most successful court actions, are where the parties have been
properly prepared. The issues have been narrowed down and time is saved
so people are ready to settle. I think Deborah will talk about numbers
of
mediators.<a class="bkMark" name="1107138000078">&#160;</a>

Lodder:</strong>
                  </em> There is a very important point here.
Mediation is available to people who come to it with a desire to
mediate. The current situation is that they have to go through that
process, but they approach it having been advised and with the support
of the advice given, knowing what that process is about. They are much
more likely to engage upon that basis. Where they are told that they
must go into it and they do not have the support of any structure
around them, they go into an alien environment, forced to do something
that at least one party will not want to do. That will simply inflame
the situation, which then spills out the other side, into litigation.
Under these proposals, that litigation will also not be supported, and
so you have people—who tend to be at one of the most stressful
points in their lives and therefore pretty unlikely to accommodate the
needs of the person causing that stress—in face-to-face contact
with no one between them and no safely consensual
outcome.<a class="bkMark" name="1107138000082">&#160;</a>

requirement from the court that there is alternative dispute resolution
at a particular stage in the case. The vast majority of clinical
negligence cases that are settled after the pre-action process, which
is before you have actually issued proceedings, are settled through an
alternative dispute resolution process, whether formal mediation or
another form of mediation between lawyers. That is incredibly useful
but it can only be done when all the evidence is available to
everybody, which is inevitably at a later stage in the case. It is
litigation that leads to mediation or alternative dispute
resolution.<a class="bkMark" name="1107138000083">&#160;</a>

I am interested in the removal of a civil aid certificate where
clinical negligence has occurred in very serious cases. I know that the

cover for initial medical reports, which I appreciate are crucial.

back is. There appears to be a suggestion that there will be some

me talk about the profoundly brain-injured children cases, because
people have an assumption that it is very easy for somebody who
specialises in the field to know the minute that somebody walks into
their office that there is a claim that can be won. I wish that was the
case. I can only think of one case in 24 years where I have been
confident. The reason is that the claimant has to prove the case; the
information is in the hands of the health providers, both in terms of
documents and witness evidence; and witness evidence is not available
until well into litigation, by which time you have had to say what your
case is.<a class="bkMark" name="1107138000114">&#160;</a>

Imaging shows that the brain is injured, but they do not know why. In
order to work out whether that is the result of negligence, I need a
midwifery expert and an obstetric expert. To know whether the
negligence would have avoided the injury I would need a paediatric
neurologist. I may have to organise brain imaging. I will need a
neuroradiologist, a foetal-maternal expert and quite

                  </div>often I will need other people such as geneticists. Only when I have all
that information can I say to my clients, “You have a case,
which I think has reasonable—not certain—prospects of
succeeding”. That is going to be very difficult for families who
are devastated and who put all savings and family plans on hold: often
they will not have further children because they cannot risk the
thought of coping with other children. They are then going to have to
find lawyers who will say, “We can take on this case”
knowing that at this stage we have no idea whether we can win it. We
also have no idea how we are going to fund the cost of these reports.
There may be some sort of after-the- event insurance which may pay for
it at the end of the day, but how is it going to be paid along the way?
Those are big costs for lawyers to carry. We know from the impact
assessment that small firms are not going to be around to carry these.
They are going to be difficult for any firm to carry in any sort of
number. I am afraid the answer is going to be reduced access for
justice for the most vulnerable people within our society.<a class="bkMark" name="1107138000115">&#160;</a>

important role. In an ideal world this would not be the case, but it
does impact on patient safety. With less cases being brought, which we
think is fairly apparent from the proposals both to remove legal aid
from scope—other than exceptional cases and we do not know what
these will be—and the Jackson proposals, which will stop a large
number of clinical negligence cases being brought but probably will not
impact on smaller-value road traffic claims, one will see a
corresponding drop in probity and consideration of problems arising

Justice Jackson produced his report, he envisaged that there would be a
legal aid safety net. Conditional fee agreements came in because of the
withdrawal of legal aid. If conditional fee agreements are then taken
out—or at least reduced to the extent that they are not
available to people—and the legal aid that they were there to
replace is not itself replaced, there is no

investigated as part of the treatment of my client. It is not necessary
for the treatment and so it is an investigation that happens only due
to litigation. In litigation we exchange reports very early on. Thanks

actual downstream costs. All the proposals will not make the problem go
away. What they will mean is that the problem is not dealt with at an
early stage by lawyers—possibly not lawyers; we are possibly
talking about not-for-profit agencies—trying to resolve matters.
This is not all about solicitors. That early help will not be
available, so what happens to those people and to that problem? Do
their children end up in care? Are there costs to society? All those
problems will happen. We very much feel that you are simply shunting
the cost away from the legal aid budget to somewhere else. The cost
will be greater. Studies and the Government’s own impact
assessment suggest that that will be the case. It is so obvious that I
cannot think of what else to
say.<a class="bkMark" name="1107138000122">&#160;</a>

context of family breakdown? In the midst of a family breakdown, in
most cases, there are children. One parent is not going to have custody
of those children. Often, when these cases come to court and lawyers
are involved, the parent who looks least likely to get custody of the
children will be told in no uncertain terms, “You’re not
going to get them and, what’s more, fighting it out in the
courts is likely to make the situation worse.”<a class="bkMark" name="1107138000123">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">People are not
always at their most receptive at times of stress, but they do
eventually listen to what is said and many cases are, in fact, settled
without the need to go to court. Plenty of evidence supports
that—for example, the Council of HM Circuit Judges has given
clear evidence on that. If these people are representing themselves,
there will be no sensible whisper in their ear. In fact, what they will
do is go into court where things will be said—one against the
other—that make the situation more, rather than less difficult,
and on it goes. The person who feels that they should have custody of
the children will not get it and will feel that it is a question of
fighting harder and longer. That is what they will do. You will clog up
the courts, just as I said earlier and just as many other authorities
have said.<a class="bkMark" name="1107138000124">&#160;</a>

certificates have been granted and there has been a pre-action
investigation, it is recognised by the Legal Services Commission and I
think the MOJ, as well as its being reflected in my practice and that

principally, about what the landscape is going to be in clinical
negligence if all the provisions of this Bill go through. We have heard
about the double whammy of removing legal aid from scope and the
changes to CFAs. I do not know if you undertake both, but if you had
one of the types of cases you talked to us about—for instance,
parents coming to you with a catastrophically injured child—how
would you advise them if the provisions of this Bill go through, and
how do you think your practice will change in the light of
that?<a class="bkMark" name="1107138000129">&#160;</a>

                     <strong>Claire
Fazan:</strong>
                  </em> There is another big question because there
were recommendations in Lord Jackson’s report, which could have
a major impact on how these reforms may affect this field of work. It
involves qualified one-way cost shifting. Until we know what is
happening there, it is very difficult to know the answer to your
question. As I understood it, his proposal was that, generally, the
defendant’s costs would not be paid by a losing claimant except
in qualified circumstances. At the beginning of the case, I have to
tell my client, “I 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 58<a class="bkMark" name="Column58">&#160;</a>
                  </div>don’t know what these qualified circumstances are going to be and
whether they’re going to affect you.”
The prudent claimant and prudent lawyer will say, “You need to
take out after-the-event insurance.” We do not know what the
after-the-event insurance market is going to be in this brave new
world, whether, in fact, it is going to exist, or whether it is a
commercial market that can last.<a class="bkMark" name="1107138000130">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">One answer to
your question is partly that I do not know. The second answer is that I
will have to take view, based on my case load, of whether this is
another case to which I can risk exposing my firm and my staff, or
whether I am simply going to have to say, “I’m sorry,
I’ve got too much exposure at the moment, you’re going to
have to go to somebody else.” The danger is that somebody else
will say the same, and so we have an ever-reducing access to justice
for these people. It is not through not wanting to help
them.<a class="bkMark" name="1107138000131">&#160;</a>

clinical negligence. The proposals are for a 10% uplift on general
damages, which will pay for the success element from the client, rather
than from anywhere else. That will be capped at 25%. There are
particular difficulties with clinical negligence, because general
damages are uncertain in personal injury cases for the most part but
particularly uncertain in clinical negligence, because you are talking
about an exacerbation of an injury rather than a pure injury. When you
are assessing the risk at the outset and trying to work out how much
money your client will get as an uplift, and where the 25% cap will be,
it will be impossible. It will be far harder than in a road traffic
case. If you look at the Jackson figures, where it is suggested that
most claimants will benefit, if you take out the simple road traffic
cases, most claimants will not benefit and they will receive less than
100% compensation. It is important that clinical negligence is seen in
that

You may be surprised to hear that, generally speaking, we do not like

any attempt to avoid that outcome is taken, and mediation is a
particularly useful way of doing it. But, as I said a short while ago
in answer to one of your colleagues, mediation helps only those who
really want to do it. You have got to have that mindset and there are
people who do not want to compromise. There are people who want to
litigate until the absolute end. In those circumstances, frankly it
does not matter how keen you are on mediation or how many mediators you
train. Those people will pursue their case.<a class="bkMark" name="1107138000136">&#160;</a>

counter-intuitive response, because those are usually considered
drivers of higher rather than lower per capita costs. So I was

increased court costs. You are not comparing like-for-like situations.
If you want us to do a full analysis on that we are happy to do so, but
you are also looking at different levels of criminality, with different
percentages of population convicted of crime. I was interrupted when I
mentioned France. In this country almost double the amount per 100,000
of people are convicted of crimes as in France. I do not know the
social reasons for that but if you drill down into the detail you find
considerable differences.<a class="bkMark" name="1107138000150">&#160;</a>

from the comparatives that were being used by the Government with other
European countries. One of the reasons why the Government have stopped
using those comparators is because the Council of Europe has said that
our legal aid costs are average in Europe. Let us compare European
countries, as they are more like us than New Zealand. Also, the Legal
Action Group in this country—not a lobbyist for
lawyers—has said our costs are average for Europe. That is their
finding and their research. I have not seen any research which goes
into the detail of this to the same degree on the Government’s
side in the way the Council of Europe does or the Legal Action Group.

professional duty to make sure that she does understand it, but she
very much needs the back-up of sensible legal advice to tell her what

important. A mediator can tell her the legal information, but they

Chair, but I will persevere. Mr Starmer, clause 12 of the Bill, which
was a surprise to some of us when it arrived, allows the Lord
Chancellor to apply a means and merits test and possibly other tests as
well to the provision of legal advice on arrest. We understand that the
Minister has said that there are no plans to use that, but the fact is
that the measure will be in the Bill if it is enacted. Do you have any
concerns about clause 12 and the possible uses of
it?<a class="bkMark" name="1107138000169">&#160;</a>

that

might or might not want to comment on this—is that you will have

arrest. Is that something that gives you

then I will leave you to my colleagues and perhaps come back if there
is time. Part 1 of the Bill deals with very significant scope changes
to legal aid. The impact assessment to the Bill concedes that that will
be detrimental to social cohesion and is likely to increase crime. As
you probably heard in our last session, it will also mean that victims
can be cross-examined by perpetrators without the benefit of
representation. Have you looked at the scope changes and do you have
any concerns from your point of view?<a class="bkMark" name="1107138000173">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> One more question if I may. There is quite a
significant increase in out-of-court disposals in the Bill. We heard
interesting evidence this morning of a substantial variation between
police areas as to the percentage. That can vary between 33% and 66% of
criminal offences being dealt with, and at least one chief constable
has said that they thought only 20% of offences should get into court.
Do you have any concerns in relation to that, whether there may be a
move away from judicial towards administrative
determination?<a class="bkMark" name="1107138000175">&#160;</a>

                     <strong>Keir
Starmer:</strong>
                  </em> I think that out-of-court disposals, if that
is the right description, have an important part to play in criminal
proceedings. They are invaluable for first-time offenders and young
offenders and, properly used, they are an important part of our
criminal justice system. The difficulty, as I see it, is where they are
used inconsistently. There is evidence in various reports of that. That
is why I have long argued that they should be part of our system, but
that there should be a coherent, consistent scheme, and a stepped
scheme, for out-of-court disposals. What I have in mind is a scheme
that provides this level of disposal for this type of criminality, this
disposal for the next level of criminality, etc., until there is a
clear threshold for cases then going into court.<a class="bkMark" name="1107138000176">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">My own
preference is to set the threshold according to the criminal conduct,
not according to the statistics. In other words, I do not seek to argue
that x% ought to go into court, or stay out of court. I would seek to
argue that above a certain level of criminality, save in exceptional
cases, the case ought to go to court. That is precisely the guidance
that I put in place for the area of out-of-court disposals that I am
predominantly responsible for, conditional cautions, so that when it
gets to a certain level of violence, the case becomes ineligible for an
out-of-court disposal and must go to court. My own view is that it is
not helpful to say that 25% ought to go to court, or should not go to
court. It is actually, what is the
threshold?<a class="bkMark" name="1107138000177">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> Welcome to the Committee. The previous witness
from the Law Society put together an alternative funding package,
saying that a lot of the measures in the Bill would not be necessary
because we could raise money elsewhere to find savings or funding. The
biggest chunk of their proposals—£79 million—was
that the CPS, which you are responsible for, should pay for all
judge-directed acquittals and dropped prosecutions at court. What is
your view of that, and if you did have to find £79 million, what
would you have to do vis-à-vis your administration of
justice?<a class="bkMark" name="1107138000179">&#160;</a>

                  </em> I did not hear that, but I would quarrel
with it. I have seen it in the figures. The problem with their analysis
is that the number of cases that have 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 64<a class="bkMark" name="Column64">&#160;</a>
                  </div>failed that are attributable to the prosecution is x%. Within that, are
all the cases where the prosecution witness does not turn up. We run
quite extensive witness care units. We do our level best to get
witnesses to court, but where they do not turn up, to then say the
prosecution must pay the cost is, in our view, unfair and counter to
the way in which criminal justice ought to be administered. I am all
for driving out inefficiencies in the criminal justice system, and
within our organisation. I do not think that particular proposal
achieves that end. All that will happen, because costs are paid out of
central funds at the moment, is moving it between one pot and another.
It would be better to require me to improve performance across the
board, and that is a challenge that I take up and what I am
endeavouring to
do.<a class="bkMark" name="1107138000180">&#160;</a>

                  </em> I understand the rationale behind the
provision. When it was first suggested, we had a number of concerns,
because the purpose of the bail regime is to prevent offending, prevent
interference with witnesses and ensure people attend at court. The
first two of these are important. We were particularly concerned about
situations, such as domestic violence, where it is sometimes important
to use the bail provisions to deal with them. To some extent, the way
in which it is now presented has allayed the fears that we had in
relation to that, because there are now provisions, as you will know,
in relation to the likelihood of offences, essentially within the
domestic setting. Where we had a concern it has now broadly been dealt
with.<a class="bkMark" name="1107138000186">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">There
are other concerns, such as the court having  to go through a
mini-sentencing exercise at the outset to assess what sentence it might
impose. That is a concern that, frankly, I think we and the courts will
rise to and meet. Some low-level concerns remain but nothing in
principle.<a class="bkMark" name="1107138000187">&#160;</a>

right. The scheme is to deal with the three purposes that I have
suggested. Where it is low-level offending, and unlikely realistically
to have a custodial sentence, in the vast majority of cases those
people will be on bail under the current system in any event. We are
talking about very small numbers. Of far greater concern to us was the
issue of offending while on bail, in the particular circumstances that
I have described, and that has been mitigated by the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="1107138000191">&#160;</a>

that I know you have been paying close attention to, in particular
clause 54, “Duty to give reasons for and to explain the effect
of sentence”. It may not be apparent to every member of the
Committee, but the CPS does have a role, and exercises this role very
diligently, in writing to victims of crime to inform them about the
outcome of cases. In particularly serious cases, there will even be
meetings with victims of crime to discuss with them any concerns they
may have. What is your view about the potential impact of proposed new
section 174? Do you think it will make the job of caseworkers and CPS
lawyers easier in putting together letters explaining sentences to

proposed new offence in relation to knife crime. As a prosecutor, have
you seen the need for this new offence to be created? This is in
relation to an offence of threatening with an offensive weapon or an
article with a blade or point and creating a risk of serious physical
harm.<a class="bkMark" name="1107138000196">&#160;</a>

follows. The conduct that is created as an offence has long been
criminal conduct and we have not experienced difficulties in bringing
prosecutions for that conduct. In a sense, nothing is added by the
creation of an offence that covers existing criminal conduct. As far as
the penalty is concerned, both the sentencing guidelines and the case
law have suggested that the ranges set out in the Bill are right for
these sorts of offence. Therefore, to some extent, the Bill is
reflecting what is already sentencing
practice.<a class="bkMark" name="1107138000197">&#160;</a>

not dissimilar to the circumstances that the sentencing guidelines and

is a rigidity that was not in the sentencing guidelines, but there is
no evidence to suggest that there was a problem with bringing charges
in relation to this conduct or that there was a problem in the
application of the guidelines as they were. No doubt this will clarify

allows us to try to inject some consistency. One of the things we have
done is to make sure that all our out of court disposals are put on a

see whether we are being consistent. It is really a matter of agreeing
with the police the approach and the thresholds that will bring the
consistency. I am not in favour of saying that only the CPS can bring
consistency and the police cannot. We have to work with the police to
bring that consistency. But where the police can charge an individual,
it makes sense to give them the power to suspend that charging
decision, which is effectively what it is, and to allow them to
conditionally caution.<a class="bkMark" name="1107138000203">&#160;</a>

               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I think that
we all agree that the tendering process involving the family law
contracts last year was a debacle, and we know that the result was
defeat for the LSC in the High Court. What lessons have been learned
from that particular episode, and how will the new Executive agency
pick up the baton and ensure that that sort of scenario is not
repeated?<a class="bkMark" name="1107138000214">&#160;</a>

                  <em>
                     <strong>Carolyn
Downs:</strong>
                  </em> To put that in context, last year the LSC let
more than 5,000 contracts on both civil and crime, and the one contract
that was not let was the family contract. Regarding the lessons
learned, I have commissioned a report. I get external people to do that
and look at the issues around implementation, the making of policy,
consultation and procurement. It is important to inform the Committee
that during the last six months, we have defended 64 judicial reviews
on our tendering process, of which just one was lost, and that was an
issue of public law. In every instance of procurement law, we won those
judicial reviews. That points, therefore, to the fact that when one
undertakes consultation and the process of developing policy, that is
the point at which we really needed to strengthen our
processes.<a class="bkMark" name="1107138000215">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We are
currently out to consultation on the family tender, which we are now
having to undertake because we extended the contract, effectively, and
we have to undertake a new one. We are in the process of consultation.
The discussions that we have had to date with the representative
bodies, all of which were here earlier, have been extremely positive
and the feedback that we have got from representative bodies to date is
positive, even with those representative bodies accepting a reduced
consultation time scale for us to undertake that work.<a class="bkMark" name="1107138000216">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">So there are
some key issues for me: one is how you formulate policy; and the second
is the time scales for implementation. An important lesson for us in
the commission is how you project manage and programme manage those
processes, because the programme and project management within the
commission was not as strong as it should have been to see that
through.<a class="bkMark" name="1107138000217">&#160;</a>

regarding the abolition of the Legal Services Commission and
independent decision making is a matter for the Ministry. However,
obviously, it is a matter that the commissioners have been careful to
consider and that they have, indeed, covered in their response to the
Government in relation to this.<a class="bkMark" name="1107138000233">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">There are two
issues to raise. First, the level of independence in some respects is
strengthened by the Bill in clause 4. Currently, on exceptional funding
cases, the Lord Chancellor makes all the decisions. Clause 4 precludes
the Lord Chancellor from making those decisions and pushes everything
to the statutory office holder. On the issue surrounding the
independence of the statutory office holder, we were very keen, in
discussion with the Ministry, to ensure that they are protected from
any political interference. We were concerned about that when the Green
Paper came out and we felt comforted by the Bill’s provisions
around the independence of decision making. I am clear that it will be
important for us to look at the guidance that the Lord Chancellor gives
to the statutory office holder in the future about what can and cannot
be funded and how clear that guidance is.<a class="bkMark" name="1107138000234">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Secondly, if I
were the statutory office holder, I would be keen to ensure that the
independent panels of solicitors and barristers whom we currently have
and who deal with appeals against the decisions of executives in the
Legal Services Commission remain in place. They can give that extra
level of independence and uphold or, indeed, overturn the decisions of
the statutory office holder. We are very keen to ensure that that
independence remains in place.<a class="bkMark" name="1107138000235">&#160;</a>

3,370 providers. On crime we have 2,000 providers. Last year, 6% left
the civil market, and 0.6% of them quoted as their reason for leaving
“reform to the legal aid system”. On crime, the figure
was higher; 9% left the market and 1% quoted legal aid reform as the
reason. The point that I want to make is that we have a lot of

problems will be removed. When you say that in the past a very small
percentage of providers left the market as a result of legal aid
