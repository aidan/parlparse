whether the Minister has written to you. He very generously agreed that
a code of practice was needed in line with the recommendation of the
Home Affairs Committee. I have mentioned it a couple of times in
Committee and the Minister knows how important I think the code of
practice is—even a draft draft. Has the Minster indicated to you
whether he intends to produce a draft just for laying on the
table—nothing else—for reference during Committee
sittings, or whether it will be available on
Report?<a class="bkMark" name="11020143000027">&#160;</a>

Further to that point of order, Mr Benton, as I indicated, we have
begun work on a code of practice and we need to discuss it with the
Association of Chief Police Officers. I did not give an indication
about the timetable. I appreciate and am certainly reflecting on the
points that the hon. Gentleman is making, but it is not something that
we can rush. I repeat that the code of practice will not go into the
detail of operational independence, or attempt to define it, but will
set out the roles of the Home Office, chief constables and police and
crime commissioners as determined by the Bill. It will evolve as the
Bill goes through this House and the other place. I cannot give any
further indication about the timing at the moment, but, as I said, work
has started and I am reflecting on the points that the hon. Gentleman
has
made.<a class="bkMark" name="11020143000029">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">When
I finished speaking on the Bill on Thursday, the Minister was kind
enough to say that he had nearly lost the will to live. I see that as a
challenge. Arundel is a very nice place and I look forward to a
by-election there. It has a very nice tea
room.<a class="bkMark" name="11020143000033">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">On
Thursday, we explored the role of the Mayor as the single person at the
head of the Metropolitan Police Authority, the role of the chief
officer, and how their relationship will be constructed in the Bill. I
have some questions, although I will not detain the Committee for as
long as I did the other day. Most of the arguments were set out, but
one or two questions need to be clarified. I take note of the fact that
we are waiting for a code of practice, which will define to some degree
the respective responsibilities and roles. As I pointed out on
Thursday, not the Mayor but the Metropolitan Police Authority holds the
chief officer to account under the current arrangements. The argument
that police and crime commissioners should be rolled out across the
country because the creation of the Mayor and the new arrangements in
London have been a success is fundamentally flawed. That has been
demonstrated by what happened on Thursday when the Metropolitan Police
Authority discussed the very important issues of undercover policing,

                        <p class="tabbed">Len
Duvall, the leader of the Labour group on the Metropolitan Police
Authority, has criticised the Mayor. He
said:<a class="bkMark" name="11020143000035">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“The
Mayor promised to take personal responsibility for the Met but his
silence on the serious reputational issues currently engulfing the
force is
deafening.”<a class="bkMark" name="11020143000362">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>That
shows that the Mayor does not perform the function of holding the chief
officer to account. The Government have to put up a stronger argument
about the role of the chief officer in being responsible on police and
crime to the Mayor or the individual appointed by the Mayor, rather
than to an elected committee that is responsible to the communities
that its members are elected to
represent.<a class="bkMark" name="11020143000036">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">On
undercover policing, issues have been raised about undercover officers
entering into personal relationships with members of the organisations
that they are investigating. If an elected Mayor of London objects to
sex outside marriage, where do we draw the boundaries between the
activities of those officers and the moral principles and approach
taken by an elected representative with very strong views? That
highlights one danger of chief officers of the Metropolitan police
being forced to respond to one individual, which is a strong argument
for having a Metropolitan Police Authority, with a range of
individuals, including elected members, from various backgrounds. I do
not know whether the code of practice will do this, but the Minister
should set out how to deal with circumstances in which there is a clear
conflict between those in operational control and an individual with a
very strong personal view, which could
arise.<a class="bkMark" name="11020143000037">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There
are examples of the individual in the Mayor’s office who chairs
the Metropolitan Police Authority having transgressed and overstepped
the mark. Although he was not criticised for a breach of the code of

Goolden, who investigated the matter, stated
that<a class="bkMark" name="11020143000038">&#160;</a>

should have sought advice from MPA officers before issuing a press
statement relating to an ongoing police investigation;…his
actions in speaking to a person arrested in a criminal investigation
were extraordinary and unwise; and…there is a risk that frank

and the MPA Chairman could be inhibited in future if Mr.
Johnson were to make public his reaction to operational briefings on

that<a class="bkMark" name="11020143000039">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We
clearly have concerns about how the roles of the chief officer and the
Metropolitan police will interact under the provisions in the Bill.
When we heard evidence from Lynne Owens from the Metropolitan police,
she expressed worries when we questioned her about whether the roles
needed more clarity, and
said:<a class="bkMark" name="11020143000040">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="hs_brev">“On
operational independence, we absolutely support the Government’s
desire to strengthen local accountability and local democratic
accountability, but our nervousness relates to how that will amalgamate
to deal with the national functions—counter-terrorism,
protective services and major crime investigation. While the drafting
of the legislation talks about having regard to a strategic policing
requirement, you can absolutely understand the pressure that a locally
elected politician may feel to the very visible, accessible parts of
the policing that we think are very important. There is, however,
another side to policing, which is not always visible or easily
explained to the communities. It is when you exaggerate it to a
country-wide model that, if the Bill is not strengthened,
there could be issues in how we service some of the most critical
incidents. We would lose the balance in our
model.”<em>––</em>[<em>Official Report, Police Reform

be set out in too much detail. It would be interesting to hear
ACPO’s current position. In response to the consultation

areas where it believes that the police commissioner, being responsible

                           </strong> Good morning, Mr Benton. We are debating clause
4, and the hon. Gentleman wants to open up again many of the wider
points that he made about the role of the Metropolitan Police
Commissioner when he spoke to the amendments at the end of last week.
The Committee does not need to revisit them, but I shall respond to him
briefly.<a class="bkMark" name="11020143000046">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
clause restates the position under the Police Act 1996 that the
commissioner of the Met shall have direction and control of the force,
and it is important that we do not upset that balance. However, it
provides that the commissioner can employ police staff in his official
capacity. That is not the case at the moment, and gives rise to an
anomaly and confusion. It is worth the hon. Gentleman reflecting on the
submission that has come into the Committee from the Metropolitan
Police Service about clause 4. On the provision allowing the
Metropolitan police to employ its police officers and staff, it
says:<a class="bkMark" name="11020143000047">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“This
is a measure the MPS strongly supports and has suggested for some time.
This will enable the Commissioner to ensure he has the appropriate
level of both policing professionals and business professionals to
support him in leading and managing the
MPS.”<a class="bkMark" name="11020143000369">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>The
changes we are suggesting in the clause, therefore, have the support of
the leadership of the Met, which is
important.<a class="bkMark" name="11020143000048">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Member for Eltham raised operational independence and the issue of
phone hacking. The Mayor is guarding against exactly what I am guarding
against as a Minister, which is crossing the line and interfering with
operational decisions. It is a matter of judgment, and I will not
repeat all the actions taken to ensure proper scrutiny of phone
hacking—such as inquiries of the House or the renewed inquiry
being conducted by the Met, on which the acting commissioner made his
position clear last week, when he said that no stone would be left
unturned.<a class="bkMark" name="11020143000049">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Member for Eltham addressed issues  wider than the terms
of the debate. However, the whole point of our arrangements is to
enhance democratic accountability in London—we are not just
accepting the status quo—so that in the future the
Assembly’s police and crime panel will bring the police and
crime commissioner or the Mayor before it to answer questions. The
panel could, of course, ask about such things. The Bill, therefore,
makes possible the holding to account of the police and crime
commissioner in London that the hon. Gentleman
seeks.<a class="bkMark" name="11020143000050">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Finally,
the hon. Member for Eltham raised an issue about the strategic policing
requirement, which he confused with the memorandum of understanding
that we discussed under the point of order raised by the hon. Member
for Gedling. However, the strategic policing requirement will be
covered under subsequent clauses. We introduced it following
consultation with ACPO, to ensure that police and crime commissioners
paid proper attention to national policing priorities. Now is not the
appropriate moment to discuss such matters, because we will do so fully
under later
provisions.<a class="bkMark" name="11020143000051">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I have one or two points for the Minister to
clarify about the relationship between the Mayor and the commissioner.
The schedule raises similar issues to the ones we discussed the other
day, on the use of similar staff to advise the Mayor in holding the
chief officer to account. For instance, if the chief officer wants to
dispose of a piece of property, and he is reporting to the Mayor, where
does the Mayor obtain information on whether that is desirable? That
comes back to independent scrutiny. I know the Minister addressed the
issue the other day, but it is raised in this schedule as
well.<a class="bkMark" name="11020143000074">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There
is also the issue of the Mayor’s office being responsible for
liabilities involving staff who are employed by, and are answerable to,
the chief officer. That opens up the Mayor’s office to
open-ended liabilities for the actions of staff who are appointed and
employed by the chief officer. Clause 4(3) states that those staff
are<a class="bkMark" name="11020143000075">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

                        </p>
                        <p>but
the liabilities come to the Mayor’s office. There may be an
explanation for that—that that is normal and expected
procedure—but as the commissioner is gaining more operational
independence in control of assets and staff than is the case currently,
will the Minister explain the intentions behind the clauses that refer
to staff liabilities becoming the responsibility of the Mayor’s
office?<a class="bkMark" name="11020143000076">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> This schedule, as the hon. Gentleman is aware,
sets out the detail and gives legal effect to the practical position of
making the commissioner employed in law. On his later question on
liabilities, the schedule provides for the Mayor’s Office for
Policing and Crime to assume the responsibility for using the police
fund to cover damages and costs incurred by or against the commissioner
in legal proceedings arising from the acts of a member of police
civilian staff. That is consistent with existing provisions on legal
costs arising from the acts of police officers in the Police Act
1996.<a class="bkMark" name="11020143000077">&#160;</a>

his question on the police and crime commissioner in London, first, the
PCC has the power to ask the chief constable for a report. That is
under clause 36, which we will come to. Secondly, the PCC can employ
staff to help him make the decisions concerned. I hope that that
answers both of the key questions that he asked on the schedule, which
otherwise just gives effect to the technical changes in clause
4.<a class="bkMark" name="11020143000078">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Good morning, Mr Benton. Welcome back from
Strasbourg; I did not say that properly in the point of order we
started with. I know that you had an exciting, interesting and
informative time with the work that you were doing. I am very pleased

                        <p class="tabbed">It
is a shame that the public gallery is not packed to witness the nerves
of steel of the Government Whip. I preface this by saying that if any
hon. Members are absent for a serious reason, I apologise, but when I
was a Government Whip, I would not have let the vote be won with a
majority of only one. His ministerial colleague was also counting. That
was a good start. When in opposition, those sorts of things are massive
victories.<a class="bkMark" name="11020143000113">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Clause 5
concerns the issuing of police and crime plans by the police
and crime commissioner. Amendment 438 proposes having a
single plan in each year. When discussing the clause, the Minister and
his colleagues clearly thought, “What we need is a police and
crime plan that will set out the direction for four years, and then we
won’t have any messing in the planning period. The PCC will come
in and put down a police and crime plan, which will not be changed
until after the next PCC election.” That idea sounded really
good, but then people questioned the numerous issuing and variations
that might take
place.<a class="bkMark" name="11020143000114">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> A double dip. The PCC would, no doubt, have to
issue a varied plan. My point is that the Minister wants a police and
crime plan at the beginning of four years, with a bit of tweaking here
and there, but not much change. Under the clause, however, there are
numerous possibilities for the plan to be varied, which I understand;
it is much better to have a police plan every year rather than every
four years. <em>[</em>
                           <em>Interruption.</em>
                           <em>]</em> The hon. Member for
Amber Valley may intervene if he wants, but unless I am very much
mistaken, there will be so many variations that the plan will change
anyway. How many variations do there need to be before it becomes a new
plan? Can the Minister outline the scale of variation?<a class="bkMark" name="11020143000118">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I do not want
to get into a stand part debate, but the Minister will recognise,
notwithstanding the point made by the hon. Member for Amber Valley,
that the PCC can not only change the plan, but can issue a whole new
one. The Minister also recognises, therefore, that a new plan may be
required. He must set out how he has decided that one plan every four
years is the appropriate time scale. What sort of variations will be
needed and on what scale?<a class="bkMark" name="11020143000119">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The clause
states that the plan may be introduced at any time. Does it mean what
it says? Would the PCC be able to introduce a plan and then issue
another one two months later, or a month before the election? Will
there be some guidance on time scale? I know that the Minister will
take this point seriously. Under the Bill, the commissioner can stand
for two terms. Imagine that I am a PCC who is standing for election.
Three months before it, I decide to have a new police and crime plan,
which I think will appeal to the electorate. My police and crime plan
thus becomes a manifesto. Has the Minister considered that
problem?<a class="bkMark" name="11020143000120">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> That is a reasonable point, which I accept. The
possibility of the plan being seen as an election manifesto would be
much smaller if it was made a year earlier and seen as an annual
process, or a normal part of doing things, than if someone who has to
produce a plan only once every four years sat down a couple of months
before an election and said, “I know. I will rewrite the police
and crime
plan.”<a class="bkMark" name="11020143000122">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">As
the Minister often says, and he is quite right to say this, such things
are sometimes a matter of judgment. However, we are making primary
legislation here. If the Minister does not think that that is a
problem, there may need to be some guidance to ensure that it is not a
problem. If the hon. Member for Amber Valley believes that that is a
problem with my amendment, in that someone might come out, in the final
year, with something with the election in mind, it might also need to
be addressed by guidance. If he sees that as a problem with my
amendment, he should also see it as a problem  with the
subsection, and one that needs to be addressed.<a class="bkMark" name="11020143000123">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">My first point
is to ask why the Minister believes that a plan for every four years is
sufficient. My second point relates to the problem of a police and
crime plan issued just before an election being more of a manifesto for
re-election than a police and crime plan. My third point is about
variation. I know that the question is difficult to answer, but what
sort of variations does the Minister expect, and how
many?<a class="bkMark" name="11020143000124">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Another
reason that I think an annual plan is much better is that one can
imagine a police and crime commissioner flushed with the excitement of
success following their election to the post establishing, or trying to
establish, a police and crime plan that may not have the depth expected
compared with one produced by a police and crime commissioner who has
had some experience in the job. I know that there will be consultation
with the police and crime panel, but I wonder whether there will be any
constraint on the police and crime
commissioner.<a class="bkMark" name="11020143000125">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Going
back to the matter of strategic policing, I know that under clause 79
the police and crime commissioner will have to have regard to the
strategic policing requirement, but is the Minister satisfied that the
Bill is strong enough to ensure that the police and crime plan will
reflect some of the strategic, national priorities; and that, if those
priorities change, the Bill is strong enough to influence the police
and crime commissioner to vary that plan? I know that the Minister has
written “have regard to” in the clause; is that phrase
strong enough? I do not want to get into semantics here and debate
whether “take into account” would be better. Who knows? I
know that we get into semantics. I simply want the Minister’s
assurance. His reading a statement into the record is sometimes
helpful—if an issue arises later, what he says in Committee is
referred to.<a class="bkMark" name="11020143000126">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">On my
amendments regarding the annual plan—I do not know whether hon.
Members have noticed this—subsections (6) and (7) contain quite
a significant process for the police and crime commissioner to go
through to vary a plan. I know that the Minister is keen and is
genuinely trying to reduce bureaucracy, but there are countless
processes here. Before issuing or varying a police and crime plan,
there are about seven things that commissioners have to do. If they
then decide to do it, there is a number of other things that they are
required to do as well. Is that for every single variation to the plan
that the police and crime commissioner wants to make, or is there a
threshold? Do colleagues see what I mean? Again, without going into
semantics, and I am making this up as I speak, if someone just wants to
put in a couple of commas and an “and”, would they have
to go through all of those processes? Of course, if it is a massive
change, clearly they would, but what sort of seriousness of change or
variation does the Minister expect would be required for those
processes to be gone through? They are clearly quite significant
changes.<a class="bkMark" name="11020143000127">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Lastly, will
the Minister comment on the Government amendment? I will come back to
that, but I am interested to hear his comments on my questions and I
will respond when he has responded to my
points.<a class="bkMark" name="11020143000128">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I hope to be able to reassure the hon. Gentleman.
First, let me clarify that the Bill allows the commissioner to issue a
plan for five years—not four—to cover his four-year
tenure and then one more. That enables the force to have a plan to
deliver against in an 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 298<a class="bkMark" name="Column298">&#160;</a>
                           </div>election year when the financial year starts in April but the election
does not take place until May. It is important that there is a plan
that covers that period. I hope that that indicates that we have
thought these matters through. This group of amendments would remove
the discretion that the commissioner or the Mayor’s Office for
Policing and Crime will need to ensure that the police and crime plan
is a living document. I shall explain why I think that would be a
mistake.<a class="bkMark" name="11020143000129">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendments
438 and 461 limit the issuing of a plan to once a year and would take
away the police and crime commissioner’s ability to respond to
the changing circumstances in emerging public priorities. The rest of
the group of amendments would have a similar effect, by removing the
power to vary a plan once it has been
issued.<a class="bkMark" name="11020143000130">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">For
too long, policing plans have simply been documents that sit on a shelf
gathering dust. That, combined with the fact that police authorities
currently do not even draft, and therefore truly own, the plans, means
that the plan is relegated to the pages of history, or can be, as soon
as it is published. The plans are currently produced
annually—that is why the hon. Member for Gedling has tabled his
amendments—but with a three-year outlook. That is neither
strategic nor able to reflect the shifting priorities. Tying the
PCC’s hands to one fixed plan for 12 months simply continues the
lack of responsiveness for which the current system is known.<a class="bkMark" name="11020143000131">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It is
significant to compare this with the system in place for London,
because the Mayor is not limited in the number of times he can vary or
reissue one of his strategies. He can do so as many times as he sees
fit, subject to the constraints of statutory consultation requirements.
That goes to the point that the hon. Gentleman made about what he
considered a potentially onerous burden in clause 5(6) and the hoops
that the police and crime commissioner would have to jump through
before varying the plan. If a key plan, which was consulted upon and
which went before the police and crime panel, is varied, it is
important that we have safeguards to ensure that it cannot be varied
unilaterally by the police and crime commissioner. In London,
flexibility allows the London mayoral strategies to be reactive to
needs and shifting priorities, just as policing plans would be under
our new model. Conversely, some of the current mayoral strategies are
those put in place by the previous Mayor. It is that kind of
flexibility, with the potential for continuity, that the Government aim
to achieve with their new requirements for police and crime
plans.<a class="bkMark" name="11020143000132">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
are attempting to design a framework that allows the police and crime
commissioner to deliver their democratic mandate, not
Whitehall’s. Clause 7 already provides that the plan must cover
how the PCC will spend their money. If they have not varied the plan
sufficiently to allow the public to see what they plan to do in their
force area, the police and crime panel has the powers that we have
given it to check the PCC’s
actions.<a class="bkMark" name="11020143000133">&#160;</a>

consent but via the active participation of the citizen, as we have

ward-level and street-level crime information. Yes, the previous
Government introduced ward-level information about local crime, but
that told the public little about what was going on. Street-level crime
mapping, which gives the public information about every recorded crime
in their street or neighbourhood, as well as incidents of antisocial
behaviour, is a new, direct and powerful form of information and
accountability. I am glad to know that the Opposition support it, which
I take from the force of the
intervention.<a class="bkMark" name="11020143000138">&#160;</a>

crime mapping has existed in one or two US cities over the past few
years. They do not report any adverse impact on house prices; they
regard it as an important form of accountability. One study, in
Redlands in California, found that there was no detrimental impact on
house prices. I do not believe that to be a
concern.<a class="bkMark" name="11020143000140">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">As
I said this morning, however, and am happy to repeat in Committee, we
cannot sweep crime under the carpet. Crime is the problem, and
transparency must be the order of the day. The public are entitled to
know about crime. Such knowledge helps to reflect the priorities set by
elected representatives. The force of the Government amendments is to
ensure that such priorities are reflected in the strategic policing
plan.<a class="bkMark" name="11020143000141">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">In
conclusion, it is essential that commissioners are able to give effect
to the wishes and needs of the people who have elected them and to
respond to issues of sufficient urgency, whether local or national. New
situations might arise that ought to be reflected in a variation to the
plan. The measure simply gives the commissioners the power to do so,
subject to all the proper checks—so that they cannot do so
without consulting properly. Providing the power to vary the plan
allows for flexibility, so restricting it to a year would be a
retrograde step which moves away from the flexibility as introduced in
London.<a class="bkMark" name="11020143000142">&#160;</a>

the Minister’s point, but the variation process laid out in the
Bill will be quite time-consuming. He did not really answer my question
about the level of seriousness of the variation that would require a
police and crime commissioner to go through the whole process laid out
in primary legislation. I do not intend to press the amendments to a
vote, because I know that he will reflect on the points made. However,
the process is potentially bureaucratic and unhelpful to his

other thing that the Minister ought to reflect on, which I should have

the plans is not clear. He may want to provide clarification on a later

that all sorts of people will be consulted on any variation to the
plans, but does not set out specifically what the role of the public
will be. Having made those comments, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the

police and crime plans. The Bill states that the police and crime

prepare a draft, consult relevant chief constables, send it to the

from the police and crime panel, and give a

police authorities, the chief constable would be required to draft the
police and crime plan and submit it to the police and crime
commissioner, who would send it to the police and crime panel for its
recommendations. The amendment would also mean that the PCC had to
publish reasons why individual recommendations from the PCP had or had
not been accepted, and that the PCC could not issue the police and
crime plan without the agreement of the chief
constable.<a class="bkMark" name="11020143000161">&#160;</a>

will not speak for too long, Mr Benton because I wish to speak in more
detail on later amendments, but I hope that you will bear with me as
there is some criss-crossing in the Bill’s provisions, as we
found in earlier debates. I want to hear the Minister’s comments
on my concerns about what the police and crime plan will contain, as
set out in clause 7. Clause 5, which relates to the issuing of the
police and crime plan, seems to imply that the first draft of the plan
has to be prepared by the chief constable, if the police and crime plan
requires that, and clause 7(1)(b) states that the plan
includes<a class="bkMark" name="11020143000162">&#160;</a>

do not know about other hon. Members, but that strikes me as close to
the subject of the policing of an area and to the deployment of police.
If that is the case, clause 7(1)(b) is relevant to amendment 457,
because if the police and crime plan includes that matter, the chief
constable should surely prepare the first draft. That is a significant
point: without rehearsing other points and

am pleased to see that the hon. Member for Edinburgh West is clearly
concerned about the issue raised by the amendment and by others. The
Government Whip has a marvellous attitude to that, and the various
amendments tabled by the Liberal Democrats are remarkable, especially
as not many of them are probing amendments. If the Liberal Democrat
members of the Committee were in opposition, they would press their
amendments to a Division. The hon. Member for Edinburgh West has tabled
an interesting amendment on the need for the PCP to be consulted much
more rigorously in drawing up the draft, and I would be interested to
hear his

there been a major change of policy? Government amendment 52 is

read. How many officers are supposed to be here or there? If that is
what is included, the Government amendment suggests not only that the
chief constable does not prepare the police and crime plan—the
PCC does—but that the PCC can include the policing of the area,

                        <p>into that consultation
process. There was, unfortunately, a drafting error with amendment 18,
which has been withdrawn. It was supposed to delete provisions on the
process of sending draft plans and having regard to and making
responses to reports and recommendations. We are trying to move the
PCPs on to a level playing field with the chief constables and ensure
that the panels are involved at a much earlier stage.<a class="bkMark" name="11020143000172">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I accept that
there is a difficult balance to be struck. The balance of power should
reside with the PCC, who will, by that stage, have received a
democratic mandate for their plans. However, the PCP is an important
part of the checks and balances to ensure that that power is used
effectively and efficiently. That is not just in the exercise of a
scrutiny role of the police commissioner. Indeed, in an earlier
Committee sitting, the Minister himself made the point that the police
and crime panel will offer key aid to the police and crime
commissioner, informing them of local opinion, especially in areas that
are exceptionally large, both geographically and numerically. The
amendment seeks to use that local knowledge and experience as a
valuable resource, rather than as an afterthought, and tries to put the
consultation required of the police and crime panel on an equal
footing, as I said previously, with that required of the chief
constable.<a class="bkMark" name="11020143000173">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I can see what my hon. Friend is trying to achieve.
My concern is that his amendment would create a consultation before a
draft plan was available. If I were on the panel and was consulted,
without a draft in front of me, I would be chucking ideas in rather
than thinking strategically. On the other hand, I think the provision
in the Bill will mean that the chief constable and commissioner work
together to produce a draft plan. I get to look at what is in there and
give my feedback, then receive a response to my comments. That seems
slightly better than the process proposed in my hon. Friend’s
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11020143000174">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I thank my hon. Friend for his comments.
However, that really is the point. There is a difference between a
consultation requirement for a chief constable and an afterthought in
drawing up the plan. There is extensive local knowledge in local
authority areas, which needs to be taken in at an earlier stage to
ensure that the plan reflects the aims. I accept that there is a
process in the Bill that might end up with a published plan being
amended to incorporate that knowledge, but why not take that step
further? Why not incorporate that knowledge at an earlier stage and
bring it on board at the point at which some meat is being put on the
bones of the plan? We should not forget that we would effectively
already have a draft plan in the manifesto of a PCC candidate who stood
for election.<a class="bkMark" name="11020143000175">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">If it is
right and proper to consult chief constables, presumably on what is
practical and on the consequences of choosing one action over another,
it is right that the police and crime commissioner should consult the
police and crime panel. I wish that the bodies created by the Bill had
different abbreviations so that we could actually use them. There are
two different PCPs—the police and 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 304<a class="bkMark" name="Column304">&#160;</a>
                           </div>crime panel, and the police and crime plan—and I am falling over
myself a little bit. Why should commissioners not consult the police
and crime panel and take into account their experience in local
priorities? Why should they merely answer the panel’s concerns
after the fact? The amendment would surely strengthen, rather than
reduce, local input into police and crime plans. If we ensure that the
PCC is required to consult the panel as well as the chief constable
before the police and crime plan is issued, the eventual plan will be
more representative of the police area as a
whole.<a class="bkMark" name="11020143000176">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> As my hon. Friend said, amendment 17
would compel the police and crime commissioner to consult the panel on
the plan before it is published. The Government’s position is
that the Bill already makes adequate allowance for the police and crime
panel to make representations on the content of the police and crime
plan.<a class="bkMark" name="11020143000177">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Clause 5
includes a requirement for commissioners not only to submit a copy of
the plan to the panel in advance of publication, but to have regard to
any of the panel’s reports or recommendations, and to provide
the panel with a response, which must be published. I hope that my hon.
Friend will agree not only that that achieves the aim of adequate
consultation, which he seeks, with a panel, but that it goes above and
beyond the basic requirements of consultation. The amendment would
therefore duplicate an existing function, because we are providing for
effective consultation anyway. The chief constable gives PCCs
professional advice on how they should address local needs, and that is
why the chief constable is consulted before a draft is sent to the
police and crime panel. It should be an agreed draft that goes to the
panel, but—and now we come to the force of the
amendments—the chief constable should not have a veto over the
plan.<a class="bkMark" name="11020143000178">&#160;</a>

that basis, I hope that my hon. Friend, who has raised an important
issue, will agree that the requirements for consultation are already in
place, but phrased differently. I am happy to confirm that there must
be proper consultation with the panel. That is the whole purpose of
ensuring representation of local authorities in the governance of
policing, and it is important that the panel can be
effective.<a class="bkMark" name="11020143000179">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Member for Gedling tabled amendments 457, 458, 459,
460, 474 and 475, which would place the responsibility for drafting the
plan for a force area on the chief constable, not the police and crime
commissioner. That would be a big step backwards. It would reflect the
status quo, but there is a problem with the status quo. As I said in
response to the previous group of amendments, the police authority does
not own or consider it owns the plan and, along with the other
weaknesses of authorities, that culminates in the general sense that
the chief constable is really the sole person in charge and that the
police authority is working to him. That is an ineffective relationship
and it is why we want to clarify
responsibilities.<a class="bkMark" name="11020143000180">&#160;</a>

police and crime commissioner with a direct mandate for the people
should work with the chief constable in drafting the plan—a
point to which I shall return—but, ultimately, it must be the
police and crime commissioner with the direct mandate who has the
responsibility for issuing it, so the balance of the

                           </div>hon. Gentleman’s amendments is wrong. I have referred
to the findings of the independent inspectorate of constabulary on the
inadequacies of police authorities in setting strategic direction and
ensuring value for money, and part of the explanation for that is that
they do not have responsibility themselves for drafting the plan at the
moment.<a class="bkMark" name="11020143000181">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">One
of the effects of the stronger governance that  we seek to
introduce, while protecting operational independence, with a chief
constable still exercising control in the direction of the force, is
that police and crime commissioners will drive things such as value for
money rather more strongly than police authorities have been able to
do. That should be reflected in their ability to set the
plan.<a class="bkMark" name="11020143000182">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendments
438, 461 and 477 would remove the discretion that we want the police
and crime commissioner or the Mayor’s Office for Police and
Crime to have  with regard to plans and their variation, so we
are back to the point about limiting the plan for one year. I 
have already explained why that would be wrong. Amendment
477 would make the police and crime panel rather than the commissioner
responsible for setting a strategic direction for the force, which is
not right. The strategic direction must be set by the elected police
and crime commissioner. The panel is there to scrutinise those
decisions and to give a voice to local authorities. The proposal would
upset the balance fundamentally, and I do not think that that is what
the hon. Gentleman intends. We know his preferred model is a directly
elected chair of a police authority, although we have not heard too
much about that this morning. However, I intend to remind him of it at
every
moment.<a class="bkMark" name="11020143000183">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
99 would eliminate the chief officer’s veto power over the final
draft of the police and crime plan. I think that I understand the hon.
Gentleman’s intentions in tabling the amendment. As drafted, the
clause confers more power on the chief constable than the police and
crime panel, because plans would not be issued without the chief
constable’s express consent. I agree that such a
provision would push the balance of power too far in favour of the
chief constable, which could severely inhibit PCCs’ ability to
deliver on their electoral mandates. That was not the
Government’s intention.<a class="bkMark" name="11020143000184">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We intend the
PCC and the chief constable to draw up the plan together. That was the
purpose behind the provision, but when we published the Bill, it was
pointed out that the drafting provides a de facto veto for the chief
constable. All members of the Committee will agree that that is not
desirable, because the elected individual would be unable to implement
the police and crime plan if the chief constable said, “No, I
don’t agree.”<a class="bkMark" name="11020143000185">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In practical
terms, the chief constable and the PCC will sit down and agree matters,
as they have in London, as we discussed last week. It is important,
however, that the drafting does not provide for the exercise of a veto
by chief constables. That is why we have tabled Government amendments
52 and 53, which will require the PCC to consult the chief constable on
the final draft or variation of the plan before it is issued. Such
provisions will replace the veto power, but will not alter the status
quo. Chief officers will be consulted at both the drafting stage and on
the final version of the plan, which I hope they will find acceptable.
The measure strikes the correct

professionals—PCCs must do so, because they will be charged with
delivering against the plan—and ensuring that elected PCCs can
follow through their electoral mandates.<a class="bkMark" name="11020143000186">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Finally,
amendments 459 and 476 seek to clarify the original language of clauses
5 and 6, emphasising that the commissioner or the Mayor’s Office
for Policing and Crime cannot issue a plan without the chief
officer’s agreement. That would not have any effect on the
meaning of the clauses, so I object to the proposals on that basis, and
for the reasons that I set out when explaining the Government

I right to think that such a consultation would be on the final draft,
before the plan is published? Does that mean that the PCC should
consult on the drafting and send it to the police and crime panel,
which will raise some issues, and a few variations will be made? Then
there will be a formal window for the chief constable effectively to
say, “Yes, I’m happy with the
variations”—or get to comment on them at least. Is that

providing in the Bill for the formal process of consultation to ensure
essential safeguards and providing for what will happen in practice. In
practice, there will be lots of informal consultation in drawing up a
plan. The PCC will sit down with the chief constable and discuss how
the plan should reflect his policing priorities and the chief constable
will say, “Yes, but we have defined operational requirements; I
need to deploy resources in the following ways.” That process
will be exactly the same as the process in London, in which the
Metropolitan Police Commissioner sat down with the Mayor of London and
discussed how to give effect to the Mayor’s strategic priorities
on knife crime and putting uniformed police officers on the street. The
distinction is between informal and formal processes that provide the
safeguards that we seek to introduce in the Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11020143000190">&#160;</a>

strengthen the role of the police and crime panels to give them more
power over the directly elected individual. No doubt the Minister will

Minister’s explanation of Government amendment 52. Perhaps he
would like to confirm whether it was an error or an unintended
consequence. If the hon. Member for Edinburgh West wants to press
amendment 17 to a vote, we will support him. However, I suspect that he
will not press it. He will need to be careful with his contributions
and about how far he can go in opposing the Government. He will be in
interesting company—the public face and the private face. But we

hon. Gentleman made a point that has not been answered by the Minister.
He talked about consultation before a draft was prepared. As we all
know, the problem is not consulting on a draft but consulting on what
should be in the draft. How many times has a member of the Committee
been presented with a draft paper that hardly changes from draft to
implementation? We all know that if we want to influence a plan or
document, we have to get in before it is actually drafted. Call it the
draft, draft, draft or whatever. That is what the hon. Gentleman was
getting at. He is absolutely right. The Bill does not say anything
about that. The Minister’s protestations are not sufficient to
answer the hon. Gentleman’s point. I suspect that he had
permission to table the amendment on the basis that he would not press
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11020143000200">&#160;</a>

to is the fact that clause 7(1)(b) says that the police and crime plan
can include:<a class="bkMark" name="11020143000201">&#160;</a>

the Bill? I would just like the Minister’s comments, because it
is important that HMIC has some influence, perhaps at a strategic

                           </strong> I appreciate the spirit in which the hon.
Gentleman tabled the amendment, which is a probing amendment. First of
all, let us agree that any recommendations by the inspectorate of
constabulary are important. I am determined that the inspectorate
continues—indeed evolves—in its role as a fierce advocate
of the public interest, issuing reports on an independent basis.
However, the reforms are about replacing bureaucratic accountability
with democratic accountability. We need to be careful about placing
statutory requirements on the various bodies in the reformed governance
arrangements, and not doing so unless we need to. I believe that the
pressures of democratic accountability will be quite enough to ensure
that the police and crime commissioner reviews their police and crime
plan at suitable junctures, changes it as necessary and pays attention
to the inspectorate’s proposals without making it a statutory
requirement.<a class="bkMark" name="11020143000232">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There
is a further assurance. The police and crime panel will receive any
inspectorate of constabulary report that relates to the force, and
clause 85 makes the necessary amendments to the Police Act 1996 to give
effect to that measure.<a class="bkMark" name="11020143000233">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I completely
understand the intention of the hon. Member for Gedling, but we do not
need to insert another statutory requirement. If a recommendation made
by the inspectorate is not acted on by the police and crime
commissioner, the inspectorate, the police and crime panel and, above
all, the public will be there to judge that and to bring to light such
failings.<a class="bkMark" name="11020143000234">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
resist the amendment, although the hon. Member for Gedling has already
said it is probing, because writing such a measure into the Bill is
unnecessary.<a class="bkMark" name="11020143000235">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Most of the main issues were debated under the
previous clause. Some, however, relate specifically to London and I
know, from my own experience as a London MP, how events in London can
impact on local policing, altering policing plans. There are major
events almost from day to day. During the student demonstrations here
at Parliament, I bumped into my own police safer neighbourhoods team in
the House of
Commons.<a class="bkMark" name="11020143000243">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Being
in the capital city has major implications for the delivery of policing
plans at the local level, because other factors can impinge. That can
happen anywhere but, in a capital city, we are more open to it. That
is, therefore, important when we are consulting. In particular, the
members of the policing and crime panel will have widespread experience
of local policing in their constituencies, as will the representatives
of the local communities. They will have experience of how such things
affect the police in London and will want to see something in the plan
that gives them some confidence in the commitment to local people that
we can deliver at the local
level.<a class="bkMark" name="11020143000244">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Minister mentioned the street crime maps, which are welcome. Such
information in police maps was pioneered under the previous Mayor and
continued by the current Mayor. The development down to street level
has to be welcomed. However, having looked at the maps briefly,
something must be followed through. Giving people information about the
level of crime in their area is an important part of the democratic
process of holding the police service to account, but if we do not give
people information about how the police are clearing up the crime, we
are just giving a lot of negative information. People will also want to
see information about the performance of the police in catching the
burglar who has burgled so often in their street. Information about the
level of crime is important, but so is the extra information for
reassuring the
public.<a class="bkMark" name="11020143000245">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">That
was an aside. On my specific point, can the Minister comment
specifically on subsection (9)(b)? It refers
to<a class="bkMark" name="11020143000246">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“the

State”.<a class="bkMark" name="11020143000379">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>London
has some major responsibilities in national policing, which can have
implications for the resources available for local policing. Where
London has that special responsibility, that should be clarified in
some way within the police plan. I know that when there is a major
incident such as 7/7 all police plans are torn up and the police must
respond. We cannot plan for those incidents, in the sense that the
police are required to respond to whatever major incident has occurred.
That is a given; but as regular extra demands are made on the
Metropolitan police does the Minister envisage some way of addressing
them in police plans, so that there will be some sort of contract
between communities and the
police?<a class="bkMark" name="11020143000247">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">With
that in mind, clause 7(c) refers to resources for police plans, and
that is another grey area, with respect to the overlap between what is
made available in the Metropolitan Police Service budget for local
policing, and what is used for national policing responsibilities. I
have raised that issue before with the chair of the Metropolitan Police
Authority. That is an issue for

                           </div>London, and I should be interested to hear from the Minister how it may
be possible to clarify the areas in question and try, as far as
possible, to set out a clear contract between the communities in London
on what the local policing plan is and how it sits in relation to the
national responsibilities of the Metropolitan
police.<a class="bkMark" name="11020143000248">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The hon. Gentleman made two broad points about
London. Clause 6 gives the Mayor’s Office for Policing and Crime
the duty to produce a policing plan, in line with other mayoral
strategies in London. I believe that the street-level crime mapping to
which he referred—I welcome his support for it—will
produce an additional new source of information for Londoners, which
will enable them to hold the police to account at a local level. The
website police.uk also provides information about the local
neighbourhood policing teams and how to get hold of them.<a class="bkMark" name="11020143000249">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The response
to the pilot study involving 7,000 people, which was done by the
National Policing Improvement Agency, was positive. People particularly
valued the provision of the information. So there is a lot to be
optimistic about in relation to the enhanced transparency and
accountability that will result. The work has revealed that last month
there were 35,000 antisocial behaviour incidents in London. There is
great public concern about antisocial behaviour, and what is happening
will assist with focusing on those incidents and the police’s
contribution to dealing with
them.<a class="bkMark" name="11020143000250">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
strategic policing priority, to which the Mayor and the Police and
Crime Commissioner must have regard, is important. We framed it in
consultation with the Association of Chief Police Officers. Of course,
the Metropolitan police have always had national policing
responsibilities as well. When the Home Secretary was the police
authority for London, there was a single point of governance and
matters were easily dealt with. Everyone agreed that that should not
continue. Whatever our disagreements about points of detail, the
general view is that devolution of power to the local level—let
us call it that—is desirable.<a class="bkMark" name="11020143000251">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">That of
course means that clarity about how resources are spent is necessary.
The Government provide significant resources to the Metropolitan
police, reflecting the fact that they police the capital and have wider
responsibilities. That includes £200 million a year in national,
international and capital city grant. Significant additional resources
are provided to the Met and that will continue. I accept the point that
it is important, as far as possible, in the spirit of transparency, to
be clear about how resources are being deployed in relation to local
matters and the wider responsibilities on which the Home Secretary and
not the Mayor holds the Met to
account.<a class="bkMark" name="11020143000252">&#160;</a>

Minister will understand, is to constrain the PCC from being able to
demand too much detail on the operational policing that will be agreed
in the plan. Amendment 477 would provide that the PCP sets out the
police and crime objectives. I am interested in the later group of
amendments, 19 and 20, tabled by the hon. Member for
Edinburgh West and his colleague, the hon. Member for Cambridge.
Although not going as far as my amendment, they clearly reflect the
concern of the hon. Member for Edinburgh West all through the
Bill—in the previous debate and the one we are having
now—that the PCP does not have enough power and that if we are
not careful, it will be a toothless tiger when dealing with the work of
the

setting out the police and crime plan, amendment 477 would
require the PCP to set out the objectives. There is a lot of good sense
in that. One of the continuing dilemmas and tensions through the Bill
is how one person could set the police and crime
objectives—especially with street mapping—for the whole
of north Wales, the whole of west Yorkshire, Devon and Cornwall, and
Thames valley. We could go through all the forces. Unless those
objectives are very high level—things no one could disagree
with, such as “We must keep people safe, we must deal with any
crime where it occurs, and we must do our best to reduce
crime”—how can one person set them?<a class="bkMark" name="11020143000264">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Once we start
trying to drill down to the detail, the police and crime plan needs
local input. I know that point is included in the next set of
amendments, but that is why the hon. Member for Edinburgh West has
tried to improve the Bill. He believes that the PCP needs to be much
more involved, and he will speak for himself when we come to the next
group. I have gone a step further and said that the panels should set
the police and crime objectives, rather than the PCC, which overcomes
the
problem.<a class="bkMark" name="11020143000265">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
other amendment of particular importance is 478, which asks,
“What do we actually want the chief officer to report to the
police and crime commissioner about?” Under the Bill as drafted,
the chief officer would report to the PCC on the provision of policing.
Amendment 478 would change that so that the report was on
the performance of the police force, because that is what 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 313<a class="bkMark" name="Column313">&#160;</a>
                           </div>people will be more concerned about; it is much more real to people. If
we follow the Minister’s logic, what is important to people in
every community, on every street, is whether crime is going down and
whether they feel safer, but under the model that the Minister has
proposed, it is the provision of policing that would be reported by the
chief officer to the PCC, rather than the performance of the police
force. “Provision of policing” means that the distinction
is
blurred.<a class="bkMark" name="11020143000266">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Minister is keen to ensure that the correct barriers exist and that
there is no crossover and so on. The amendment would help him, because
what does the provision of policing mean to people? It means where the
police are—where they are deployed. If not, what does it mean?
What anybody at any of our surgeries would want to know from the police
and crime commissioner is whether the model used has reduced crime in
their area. They would not go to Government Members, or to my hon.
Friends, and say, “Excuse me, Mr Herbert or Mr Wright, can you
talk to me about the provision of policing in my area?” They
would say, “Crime’s going up around
here—what’s going
on?”<a class="bkMark" name="11020143000267">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Even
using his own model, the Minister is not driving at the
Government’s intention, which is to get people to focus on
crime. That is the whole purpose of street mapping, which we started,
although I accept that, as the Minister said, it was at ward level and
that it has been drilled down closer to people at street level. How are
our forces organised to deal with crime? The amendments would take us
away from the real problem throughout the Bill about the responsibility
of the PCC vis-à-vis telling the chief constable what he or she
should or should not
do.<a class="bkMark" name="11020143000268">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
would have thought that amendment 478 provided clarification. I do not
agree with the Minister, but I understand why he objects to the PCP
setting the objectives, because that would drive a coach and horses
through his model. However, I will not understand if he does not at
least concede that amendment 478, on police force performance, has a
point in that it gets much closer to the nub of what he wants from the
police and crime commissioner, which is also what all our constituents
want. I shall be extremely interested to hear the Minister’s
response to that amendment, although I know what his response to
amendment 477 will
be.<a class="bkMark" name="11020143000269">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
478 makes more than a semantic point; it would completely change the
focus of how the PCC holds the chief constable to account. Not only
would that be so in a proper sense, but I would totally agree on the
accountability of the chief constable. I am not concerned about the
provision of policing, which is a matter for professional judgment; I
am concerned about whether deployment, or the way in which policing is
provided, reduces crime. That is what I am interested in, and that is
much more in tune with what the Minister is attempting to achieve in
the Bill than the way in which the clause is currently drafted. I shall
be interested to hear what the Minister has to
say.<a class="bkMark" name="11020143000270">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> If I may so, the hon. Gentleman is  all
over the place. He spoke very half-heartedly for amendment
477, which would compel PCPs to produce their own set of police and
crime objectives. Why? Outside London, the PCPs will be appointed
bodies, 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 314<a class="bkMark" name="Column314">&#160;</a>
                           </div>with nominees from local authorities. They will not have a direct
mandate. The PCPs will play an important scrutiny role, and the whole
point of the reform is that the PCCs will replace police authorities in
setting strategic objectives, because they will have a democratic
mandate. To transfer that function to PCPs, and to make them produce a
set of police and crime objectives, would be a recipe for total
confusion. They would have no mandate to do so, and the proposal would
be a confusion of their scrutiny role and would be inconsistent with
the hon. Gentleman’s policy of having
directly elected chairs of police authorities. It
just seems to be a random suggestion that has no force, and I hope that
on reflection, he will withdraw
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11020143000271">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Gentleman was keener to speak to amendment 478, which
would narrow the provision under the clause that the police and crime
plan will set out the means by which the chief
officer<a class="bkMark" name="11020143000272">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“will

                        </p>
                        <p>of
the police and crime commission. The hon. Gentleman’s contention
is that the focus should be not on how the chief officer is providing
policing, but only on performance. He did not set out with any great
clarity the difference between the two. It seems absolutely right that
the plan should specify the totality of policing on which the chief
officer is reporting back. Those measures are reporting requirements,
and do not have to cross operational
independence.<a class="bkMark" name="11020143000273">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Of
course, the chief officer should have to report for the totality of
policing. That is what effective scrutiny is about. I understand that
the hon. Gentleman’s intention under the amendment is to narrow
matters, but such an argument has not been set out. He did not really
make the case for a distinction between performance and the totality of
policing, and I do not believe that the proposal has great force. He is
coming back to operational independence. Although we have covered that,
no doubt we will continue to discuss it. I say again that it is our
intention to protect it. The clause would ensure that the plan reflects
the reporting arrangements and, given their importance, I hope that the
hon. Gentleman will withdraw the
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11020143000274">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Briefly, the amendment is intended to probe the
extent to which the Secretary of State will be able to intervene in
local police and crime plans under the Bill. As it stands, although the
Secretary of State will be able to give some guidance on what might be
included in the plan, she should not be taking the extra step of
stating how those things should be dealt with. The Liberal Democrats
welcome the focus of the Bill on removing central direction and
interference in policing decisions, which has taken place to an ever
greater extent over the past few years, and that is why we must be
certain about what we mean by “give guidance”. I have
tabled probing amendments to seek some clarification on the limits of
that
power.<a class="bkMark" name="11020143000282">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> My hon. Friend’s intentions in tabling the
amendments are clear, and I appreciate the spirit in which he has moved
them. Amendment 19 seeks to limit the scope of the guidance that the
Secretary of State will be able to give regarding police and crime
plans, while amendment 20 seeks to ensure that the police and crime
panel is listed as a statutory consultee in the event that such
guidance is issued. I do not believe that the amendments are
necessary.<a class="bkMark" name="11020143000283">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Regarding
amendment 19, the clause as currently drafted does not confer any power
on the Secretary of State to issue guidance concerning how the matters
listed in a police and crime plan should be dealt with. As I have said
before, we do not consider that the legislation will be used to set out
every detail. The clause allows the Secretary of State to issue
guidance, setting out the matters that should be dealt with in a police
and crime plan, and nothing more than that. My hon. Friend’s
goal in tabling amendment 19 will be achieved in the clause’s
current
form.<a class="bkMark" name="11020143000284">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Moving
on to amendment 20, the panel already has a key role in finalising a
police and crime plan, as set out in clauses 5 and 6. That includes
being consulted and, if the panel’s comments have been ignored,
the commissioner will have to explain why. If the panel feels that the
process has been exhausted, and wants to see information on a matter
that has not been covered, it will have the power to bring the police
and crime commissioner

                           </div>before it to answer questions. I think that that is more than enough to
ensure that the police and crime panel gets the information that it
needs. I do not think that the panel needs to be involved in the
guidance that will be used to set out the information that should be
covered in the
plan.<a class="bkMark" name="11020143000285">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
would like to be clear that that does not mean that the Secretary of
State should state what crime types the plan should cover—that
is for the police and crime commissioner to do. What we are talking
about is guidance that relates to headings and information that the
police and crime commissioner should cover, such as information on how
they will use their funding and what their objectives
are.<a class="bkMark" name="11020143000286">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Government are clear that police and crime commissioners and chief
constables are the most vital consultees in the event of issuing
regulations governing the police and crime plan. Commissioners will be
required to draft the plan, and chief constables will put it into
practice. The police and crime panel’s task is to scrutinise and
advise on the plan, not to draft it or put it into action. Therefore,
to list it as a statutory consultee is
unnecessary.<a class="bkMark" name="11020143000287">&#160;</a>

about the scope of the plan, and I hope that that will be important on

detail about what it means; a lot of people across the country will be
interested in how it works. Will it go through the police and crime
panel? Again, I do not want to rehearse the debates, but he can see the
point that I am making. How will a small local charity, a church group,
a voluntary group or a street group access one of the grants, and what
is the process? I am interested. We will not vote against the clause,

                           </strong> It is important to note, as I said before, that
the Bill creates elected police and crime commissioners. They have been
deliberately named, because we seek to place on them a wider
responsibility for crime reduction and community safety in their area.
That means that we wish those bodies to be able to receive grants from
central Government and allocate them to secure the crime and disorder
reduction set out in clause 9.<a class="bkMark" name="11020143000297">&#160;</a>

Government community safety funding gives grants to local authorities
in that respect. The change is that some of the grant may be paid
instead to the elected PCCs, who will then determine how it should be
spent. We are currently determining the grant allocation for the next
financial year, ahead of the introduction of police and crime
commissioners, and will give further clarity about the level of the
grants and how they will be determined. I am sorry that I cannot give
any further information about the grant amounts for the time being. We
must reflect that devolved arrangements already exist in London, so
separate arrangements will be made for allocation of the grant in the
capital. We intend to make the announcement

clearly must be done. I understand that the Minister’s reply
lacks its usual depth because work is still being done and the amounts
will not be clear yet. Did I understand him to say that some of the
grants being given at the moment will be retained centrally and some
given to the local policing body, or is it the intention to give
everything to the local policing body? Is that part of the policy still
being worked out, or did I misunderstand him? As I said, I will not

specific things in the broad field of crime reduction will continue to
be made from the centre by the Home Office and some may continue to be
allocated directly to local authorities, but from 2012, some will be
allocated to police and crime commissioners. We are currently
considering how that should be determined between those three areas. I

clause 10, page 9, line 35, leave
out subsection (1) and
insert—<a class="bkMark" name="11020143000306">&#160;</a>
                        </p>‘(1) The responsible
authorities under the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 (other than the local
policing body) and the local policing body must co-operate with each
other in exercising functions under sections 6 and 17 of that Act and
to assist the preparation and implementation of a police and crime plan
in relation to that police
area.’.<p class="tabbed">I
shall refer briefly to the amendment and then make a more substantive
point about the clause. Amendment 101 concerns other responsible bodies
in the force area being more fully involved in the preparation and
implementation of the police and crime plan. I understand that there is
nothing specific in the Bill to require the commissioner to involve
such bodies, which I am sure would not be the Minister’s
intention. The amendment is probing and I shall not press it to a vote,
but it is essential for all the responsible authorities that we know in
our local areas to be involved in some
way.<a class="bkMark" name="11020143000307">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">One
of the worries that people have about the Bill is that it will
undermine partnership working at a local level. The Minister has talked
about PCCs at a force level, and he will know that one of the
Bill’s other recurring themes is how that single individual
relates to local areas. Part of that concerns the PCCs’
relationships with the police and crime panels, and the police and
crime panels’ relationships with individual local authorities in
their own areas. The responsible authorities include all the various
partners in an area. It would be helpful if the Minister indicated, so
that it is on the record, how they will be involved. What role does the
Minister envisage for such people, who should have a part in bringing
about the police and crime plan? That is important, because my big
criticism of the Bill is that whatever we say about accountability, the
real issues are at a neighbourhood and local level.<a class="bkMark" name="11020143000308">&#160;</a>

and reduce crime. Local people, the police, local authorities and the
various partners believe that they are worth preserving. Many have told
me that they are concerned that the Bill will undermine such
partnerships at the local level, and they feel excluded from the
process under which the police and crime plan will be put together and
implemented. I tabled the amendment to discover the Minister’s

                        <p class="tabbed">The amendment
proposes two changes to clause 10(1). It would require members of
community safety partnerships to co-operate with police and crime
commissioners in respect of functions under section 17 of the Crime and
Disorder Act 1998 as well as functions under section 6 of that Act, and
it introduces a specific requirement on those agencies comprising
community safety partnerships to co-operate with the police and crime
commissioners in the preparation and implementation of a police and
crime plan.<a class="bkMark" name="11020143000311">&#160;</a>

first with the reference to section 17 of the 1998 Act. I am advised
that it would have no legal effect. Section 17 does not confer any
functions that could be the subject of co-operation as envisaged by the
amendment. Instead, it requires the bodies named in the section to
exercise existing functions in a particular way, namely with due regard
to the likely effect on crime and disorder. That is a separate legal
duty, which will continue to apply to the named bodies, and we are
applying it to police and crime commissioners under paragraph 109 of
schedule 15. The reference to section 17 in the amendment
does not add anything to the Bill. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will
note the care with which we have drafted the
legislation.<a class="bkMark" name="11020143000312">&#160;</a>

substantive second element of the amendment. It does not add anything
of substance to the general duty to co-operate set out in subsection
(1). It places a reciprocal duty to co-operate on police and crime
commissioners, the Mayor’s Office for Policing Crime and the
responsible authorities that comprise community safety partnerships
within the force area—NHS primary care trusts, the probation
service, the police, fire and rescue authorities, local authorities.

examine any element of those strategies. I understand the hon.

partnerships and police and crime commissioners. I am confident that we

                           </strong> May I say good afternoon to my legal adviser, the
hon. Member for Northampton North? I should be particularly interested
if he has anything to say on this aspect of the Bill. I am sorry, Mr

by, as you were not here this week.<a class="bkMark" name="11020143000321">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I am
concerned by clause 10(2). I point out to the Committee that it
says:<a class="bkMark" name="11020143000322">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“The
elected local policing body for a police area, and the criminal justice
bodies which exercise functions as criminal justice bodies in that
police area, must make
arrangements”.<a class="bkMark" name="11020143000382">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>Clause
10(2) continues in brackets, showing there is obviously some concern or
it would not be in brackets. It
continues:<a class="bkMark" name="11020143000323">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“(so
far as it is appropriate to do
so)”.<a class="bkMark" name="11020143000383">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>That
is a classic response. The Government are saying, “There is a
problem here, but we will put that in and then let the lawyers argue
about what “appropriate” is afterwards”. Clearly,
there was a concern about that wording and I am not surprised, because
I have spoken to senior legal figures and one in particular, who told
me that this issue is of quite considerable concern, in terms of what
it might lead to as well as what is actually in the Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11020143000324">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Clause 10(2)
refers to “criminal justice bodies”. If I was trying to
be fair, or rather if I was trying to look at things from the
Minister’s point of view, I could see why we would say,
“Well, look, the elected person needs to come to some
arrangement with probation staff and the youth offending teams”.
We can see, from that point of view, that the logic is, “Well,
you’ve got people causing a problem in an area”. We have
already said that sometimes the problem with confidence in policing is
that people blame the police even when they have arrested someone.
Sometimes it appears to people that the criminal justice system has not
functioned as effectively as it might have done; somebody reoffends or
whatever, or probation does not look after somebody properly in the
community. The police seem to get the blame. So if I was trying to be
fair I could understand why the clause might  say
“probation”, “youth offending teams”, and
so  on, although I understand that even that has
caused  concern.<a class="bkMark" name="11020143000325">&#160;</a>

clause 10(2) the Government propose that an elected person, with a

“arrangements” with youth offending teams and probation

                        <p class="tabbed">I am sure
that the Minister will say, “My intention is that there will be
appropriate arrangements”, but what on earth has an elected
politician got to do with prosecution? That is quite a fundamental
point that we spend a good deal of time debating. However, the Bill
says quite clearly that, where appropriate,
“arrangements” are made with a prosecutor. What on earth
is that about? What on earth are appropriate
“arrangements” between a local politician
and:<a class="bkMark" name="11020143000329">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I know the
Minister’s intention and the Government’s intention in
this clause is to deal with their frustrations with the criminal
justice system, but essentially what we are starting to see in this
clause is not only a police and crime commissioner but the beginnings
of a criminal justice commissioner.<a class="bkMark" name="11020143000331">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I must say to
the Minister that that is quite a serious point. It is not, as the Bill
has defined it, a criminal justice commissioner, but it is moving
towards an elected politician having some sort of influence over the
criminal justice system. It is not just a matter of the commissioner
saying, “What’s happened about that individual’s
probation? The service hasn’t done a very job of looking after
him. He’s reoffending on the streets. He’s causing
problems. Our crime figures are going through the roof. The police are
frustrated.” It is about prosecution and the courts.<a class="bkMark" name="11020143000332">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I have no
idea what arrangements would be appropriate between a prosecution
service and an elected politician responsible for policing. The
division between those who enforce the law and those who prosecute
individuals is a fundamental part of our democracy. I have heard
countless Members of Parliament say that our democracy is based on the
important principle that politicians play no part in how the law is
interpreted and prosecuted by the courts or in what the courts
do.<a class="bkMark" name="11020143000333">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The Minister
will say, “Things will be done as appropriate. The Bill
doesn’t mean what you say,” but that is exactly what it
means. The Crown prosecutor for Nottinghamshire, where I live, and the
police and crime commissioner, whoever that is, will have to make
arrangements. The clause does not say that they can make arrangements,
but that they “must make arrangements”. It is not a case
of their saying, “Let’s have a look and see where an
arrangement might be appropriate. If we think it’s appropriate
and we think we can do something, let’s do something.”
They positively have to go out to make arrangements.<a class="bkMark" name="11020143000334">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">There is a
fundamental point of principle here. I do not properly understand why
the clause is drawn as widely as it is. I do not want to misquote the
Home Secretary, but she said at some point that the police and crime
commissioner’s role vis-à-vis criminal justice was
important. That is a step towards an elected politician having some
influence over the criminal justice system, which many hon. Members
would find inappropriate.<a class="bkMark" name="11020143000335">&#160;</a>

a problem in this place, there will be huge problems in the House of

including barristers of all shades of opinion, look at this provision
and say what its implications are. I think there will be real problems.

                           </strong> The hon. Gentleman raises an interesting issue.
First, I hope he will reflect about which side of the argument he and
the Opposition wish to land on regarding the importance of devolving
decision making in the criminal justice system where possible and
achieving what we might describe as joining up justice.<a class="bkMark" name="11020143000337">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There is a
growing view, which is shared by professionals in the system, that it
is really important that agencies do not operate in silos but
co-operate at local level if we are to achieve the better outcomes that
we need in the criminal justice system. Effective partnership working
at the local level is important in reducing reoffending, achieving
efficiencies and driving out costs in the criminal justice system.
Indeed, the failure to integrate agencies’ responses in the past
has resulted in a fragmented criminal justice system that does not
provide a seamless service for the public, victims or anybody
else.<a class="bkMark" name="11020143000338">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I detect a
shared ambition among professionals in the system, who think, contrary
to the impression that the hon. Gentleman was giving, that to try to
achieve those greater synergies and a more holistic system is exactly
where we should be going. Some examples of best practice happen when
agencies work together at local level. I will give two
examples.<a class="bkMark" name="11020143000339">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">One
important area in which we have reduced pressures on police time and
reduced cost is the development of integrated case management handling
in London. The Crown Prosecution Service and the police have
co-operated to shorten times for case preparation and reduce cost. That
has brought about savings and reduced the call on police time. The
inspectorate of constabulary, in reporting on that, considered that it
was an important model that could be developed elsewhere. It has been
achieved precisely through such joint working. I do not believe that it
has compromised the independence of the CPS, which remains accountable
to Ministers through the
Attorney-General.<a class="bkMark" name="11020143000340">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

                        <p class="tabbed">None
of us disagrees about the fundamental importance of the independence of
the judiciary and of independent decisions about prosecution.
Nevertheless, at the local level we already have local criminal justice
boards. They are non-statutory bodies but they are places where the
leaders of local criminal justice agencies come together and try to set
local strategic priorities in relation to the 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 323<a class="bkMark" name="Column323">&#160;</a>
                           </div>criminal justice system. In some of those boards members of the
judiciary are represented, and they contribute as appropriate in a
manner that does not cut across what they jealously and rightly
guard— their judicial independence. Those boards certainly
include the chief constable or a senior representative of the force,
the Crown Prosecution Service, someone from probation, and so
on.<a class="bkMark" name="11020143000341">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There
are two issues. First, these are non-statutory bodies, and secondly
they overlap with community safety partnerships at the strategic level.
The Government’s view is that we should not be prescriptive
about how the arrangements might evolve at the local level. However, in
creating police and crime commissioners, with a broad strategic role in
relation to community safety, it does not make sense to shut them out
of local arrangements for the criminal justice system—because
partnership working is so important.<a class="bkMark" name="11020143000342">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">That is why
we made it clear in the document “Policing in the 21st
century”, and in the summary of consultation responses and next
steps published in December, that the Government still see a role for
police and crime commissioners with respect to the wider criminal
justice system, to bring about an efficient, effective service for
victims, witnesses and the wider community. We shall explore that as
further reforms develop. We have been explicit about not wanting to
shut the door on the possibility that police and crime commissioners
could have a wider role in the criminal justice
system.<a class="bkMark" name="11020143000343">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
force of the clause about which the hon. Gentleman expresses
concern—clause 10(2)—is simply that the elected police
and crime commissioner, or the Mayor in London, should co-operate with
the criminal justice bodies as appropriate. The word
“appropriate” is used precisely so as not to allow a line
to be crossed in relation to such things as the independence of the
judiciary. The hon. Gentleman did not name the concerned senior member
of the legal establishment he alluded to, but I shall be happy to have
a conversation if he wants to tell me privately who it is after the
sitting. No member of the Government seeks to trespass on the
independence of the judiciary or prosecution decisions. However,
everyone—including, I believe, senior members of the
judiciary—agrees about the importance of joint working, at
national and local
level.<a class="bkMark" name="11020143000344">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
second example that I want to give is about London. The Mayor is clear
that the wider function would be welcome, and seeks an involvement in
the efficient operation of the criminal justice system. I do not know
whether the hon. Member for Gedling has visited the Heron wing at
Feltham young offenders institution, but I encourage him to do so. My
hon. Friend the Member for Brentford and Isleworth and I visited it
recently, with the Mayor of London. The Mayor has invested in better
rehabilitation on that wing, which provides mentoring for young
offenders. The results are impressive, driving down reoffending rates.
That outcome involved an elected local politician acknowledging the
potential—perhaps his responsibility—for an elected
figure responsible for policing and community safety to recognise that
other elements in the criminal justice system closely affect the safety
of Londoners. Widening the responsibilities of the Mayor in this
respect makes a lot of sense—to the Mayor, too—and the
initiative has great support on the ground. The subsection gives it
effect.<a class="bkMark" name="11020143000345">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I end where I
started, in the same spirit in which the hon. Member for Gedling moved
his amendment and in which we have conducted the entire debate. I urge
him and the Opposition generally not to get on the wrong side of the
argument. There is huge potential for greater, joined-up working at the
local level and it would be unwise to close off the potential role of
the elected police and crime
commissioner.<a class="bkMark" name="11020143000346">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
House can take decisions down the line about how we wish to see the
role evolve, which will depend on how reforms of the criminal justice
system evolve. There should be open debate as we move along, but the
ambition to allow such a form of working is sensible and the right
direction of travel—simply to ensure that at the local level
people co-operate, which is all the provision allows. I urge the hon.
Gentleman to reflect on that and to see that no threat to the
independence of the judiciary or of prosecution decisions is intended
or made in the
provision.<a class="bkMark" name="11020143000347">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The Minister tells me not to get on the wrong side
of the argument, but that is why I spoke carefully when making my
points. Of course people want to see local arrangements and, by having
effective local arrangements, we can often deal with things that impact
directly on people’s confidence in policing in an area or on the
general safety they feel on their streets. I gave the
example of probation and how, sometimes, people find it difficult to
understand why a particular individual who is on bail or whatever does
not seem be effectively monitored. There are all sorts of issues.
I quite agree with him that people might want to see such
more effective arrangements being made. That is an absolute
given.<a class="bkMark" name="11020143000348">&#160;</a>

Minister referred to all the various bodies bringing people together so
that we do not have a situation in which everyone seems responsible but
no one actually is. I understand all those points, so it is not a case
of being on the wrong side of the argument. Equally, I could say to the
Minister that he needs to be careful that he does not get on the wrong
side of the
argument.<a class="bkMark" name="11020143000349">&#160;</a>

this House not to interfere in the judicial process by referring to the
appropriateness of conduct at all times? Also, is it not right that
there is already appropriate conjunction between elected officials and
the criminal justice system in certain respects—certainly with
regard to the efficiency of that system? For example, the
Attorney-General is an elected official. Historically, the Lord

                           </strong> The hon. Gentleman should make a contribution
because his points are reasonable. Someone who is elected might of
course want to look at the efficiency and effectiveness of the courts;
they want to ensure that there is the best value for money, and I agree
with that. It is also the case that appropriateness is in the Bill. I
point out only that the Government are saying—the Minister
confirmed this—that the Bill deals with the police and crime
commissioner with respect to the police, but what the Government really
want, and will come back to, is a criminal justice commissioner. They
want exactly the same set-up to operate in the criminal justice system
as in the police, and they do not believe that they have won that
argument yet. I alert people to that issue, because if we are not
careful the distinctions will blur in a way that is not consistent with
how our democracy
works.<a class="bkMark" name="11020143000352">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
am highlighting at great length that what is incorporated in the clause
is, essentially, the Government trying to have a halfway house. They
are saying, “How can the Opposition spokesman be against
effective working at a local level?” That is where the public
are and it is what they want. They are frustrated by how the criminal
justice system works and feel that they do not have an effective voice,
and the Minister should be on the side of that. As I have said time and
again, people are frustrated with the criminal justice system, but it
is a leap from that to saying, “At the moment we can have
arrangements, but in the end what we want is a criminal justice
commissioner,” which is what the Bill tries to move towards. I
predict that in a year or two the Government will come forward with
plans for a criminal justice commissioner. If they do not, I will buy
the Minister a
pint.<a class="bkMark" name="11020143000353">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I would hope that the hon. Gentleman might buy me
a pint anyway, but I thank him for taking my intervention and I urge
him, if he has not already done so, to discuss the issues with the
Mayor, and in

                           </div>particular with the acting Metropolitan Police Commissioner who has
responsibility in the Association of Chief Police Officers for criminal
justice issues, and a particular concern to take forward the issues.
From memory, in ACPO’s submission to the Committee—its
formal response to “Policing in the 21st
Century”—it supported the potential broader role in
relation to the criminal justice system, and I think that there is
wider support among professionals, subject to the caveats that I have
entered. I urge the hon. Gentleman to have those conversations before
he puts his stake too firmly in the
ground.<a class="bkMark" name="11020143000354">&#160;</a>

acting commissioner, and I know that he thinks that way—and I
know that the Minister and all of us would wish Sir Paul Stephenson
well in his recovery— [<span class="smallcaps">Hon.
Members:</span> “Hear hear.”] My point is that
I  am not diametrically opposed to better, more effective
arrangements, because I have said time and again that it is the
criminal justice system with which people are sometimes frustrated. The
debate that we have had on the clause has been useful in significantly
highlighting how the Government are moving, and I will leave it there.
The debate has been interesting, as was the contribution from the hon.
Member for Northampton North, who understands my point about how we
ensure that the division is effectively and appropriately
