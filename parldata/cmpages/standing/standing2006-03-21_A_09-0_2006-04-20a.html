Owen Paterson</b> (North Shropshire) (Con): It is a great

pleasure to see you back in the Chair, Sir Nicholas. I hope that

whatever was coursing through your veins on Tuesday will galvanise you

again today. I will be brief.</div>

<a name="06042062000033"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042062000323"></a>The

Minister of State, Department for Transport (Dr. Stephen

Ladyman):</b> On a point of order, Sir Nicholas. I should

point out that the hon. Gentleman described you as &#147;pumped full

of testosterone&#148; this morning.</div>

<a name="06042062000034"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042062000324"></a>The

Chairman:</b> I am most grateful for that observation. I can

only tell the Committee that I wish it were

true.</div><a name="06042062000035"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042062000325"></a>Mr.

Paterson:</b> I am glad to see that you are still on good

form, Sir

Nicholas.</div><a name="06042062000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause

15 requires all vehicles, whether left or right-hand drive, to have a

mirror covering the passenger side. The provision has been applied in

Holland and Belgium, and there is a European directive that will bring

it in and make it mandatory on all new vehicles. The new clause is a

sensible measure that will be welcome. In the case I cited, the

Hungarian driver was appalled by what happened. It would be a help to

all drivers of heavy goods vehicles in this country, whether British or

foreign.</div><a name="06042062000037"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06042062000326"></a><b class="B">Mr.

David Kidney</b> (Stafford) (Lab): When I got home just before

Easter there was a message on my answerphone from a constituent. He is

a man whom I know very well and like very much. He told me that he was

lucky to be alive that day because when driving home on the motorway he

had been overtaking a lorry from Turkey which pulled out and struck his

car, turning it round completely. He found himself driving at 70 mph in

the wrong direction down the middle lane of a three-lane motorway. As

he said, it was a frightening experience.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column307" />Column number: 307</div><a name="06042062000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">Once my constituent had stopped

and recovered&#151;fortunately he was not injured&#151;he had

various conversations. The first with someone who was on the spot

straightaway, a traffic officer. This cadre of people patrolling our

motorways to deal with just this kind of situation was one of the

brilliant decisions of the Department for Transport. He also spoke to a

member of the control staff at the control office for the motorways and

to his insurance company. They all told him that in recent years there

has been a dramatic increase in the number of those incidents, some

with fatal consequences. His response was that surely it was the

responsibility of politicians to ensure that lorry drivers using can

see other road users or they should not be on our roads. That is a

salutary description of a recent incident which the Minister should

take seriously when considering the new

clause.</div><a name="06042062000039"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042062000327"></a>The

Chairman:</b> I call Dr. Ladyman. I am not sure whether he is

pumped full of

testosterone.</div><a name="06042062000040"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042062000328"></a>Dr.

Ladyman:</b> Ministers are always pumped full of

testosterone.</div> <a name="06042062000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">Welcome

back to the Chair, Sir Nicholas, for our last sitting. This is a very

important subject. I will not advise the Committee to accept the new

clause, but that is not because I do not believe that the hon. Member

for North Shropshire (Mr. Paterson) is right in identifying this as a

very real issue. He talked about anecdotal evidence. We now have far

more than anecdotal evidence that the problem he outlines is serious.

He mentioned that it had been brought to his attention by my

parliamentary neighbour, the hon. Member for Canterbury (Mr.

Brazier).</div> <a name="06042062000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">All Kent

MPs are aware of the problem. Because of the number of foreign lorries

coming in at Dover or Ramsgate and driving along our motorways, we all

have constituents who have had that experience. Experienced motorists

in Kent are aware of it. We hang back from lorries with foreign plates

until we are absolutely sure that the road is clear, and when we

accelerate past a lorry we minimise the opportunity for it to start

pulling out. Clearly that is unsatisfactory, but it is more complex

than the hon. Member for North Shropshire realises.</div>

<a name="06042062000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">Drivers of left-hand drive

lorries do not have difficulties only with visibility on their

right-hand side and at the rear of the lorry. Very large lorries also

have visibility problems on the left-hand side and that causes

difficulties when people approach on slip roads, as well as proximity

problems just in front and down to the right of the cab. A car coming

past may briefly appear in a mirror but may disappear when it is

slightly ahead of the lorry. If the driver pulls out, he can hit the

back of the car and spin it

round.</div><a name="06042062000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">Fortunately,

the evidence is that such accidents are hugely frightening but not

often fatal, because usually the collision forces the car to the right,

and unless it hits something or is turned round, and something behind

then hits it, serious injury or fatality does not necessarily result,

although injuries and fatalities happen occasionally and we are

starting to gather evidence to that effect. As well as our experience

in Kent, <i class="I">The Daily Telegraph</i> has organised a significant

campaign, which it has presented to me.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column308" />Column number: 308</div><a name="06042062000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">How are we going to deal with

the problem? As the hon. Gentleman says, a directive will require the

fitting of further mirrors on new vehicles. That will come into force

shortly, but it does not require retro-fitting. The difficulty with the

proposal to require the UK to enforce retro-fitting is that it could

not be enforced in relation to foreign lorries. We could require it for

our own lorries, and when they go abroad and have the same problem on

the other side of the cab it would be useful, but it would not help

with foreign lorries coming into the UK.</div>

<a name="06042062000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am pleased to say that the

Commission has identified that there is a problem and has started a

consultation on how to insist on retro-fitting, with comments required

by 19 May. That is positive news, and I shall take up the matter both

with the Commission and with my Transport ministerial colleagues in

Europe, to stress to them the importance of early

action.</div><a name="06042062000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">In addition,

we should look at what can be done within European rules, and I am

looking at a number of options, although I have not yet made any

decisions. One option that I am seriously considering&#151;I put it

no more strongly than that because there are financial

considerations&#151;is to provide a stick-on mirror. It is a flat,

prismatic mirror that would stick on the inside of cab windows. We

might purchase a large number of such mirrors and hand them out to all

lorries entering the country at Dover and to our own British fleet

leaving the country, for use on the other side of its vehicles. More

work and evidence are needed to establish whether that solution would

be cost-effective, but I can assure the hon. Gentleman and my hon.

Friend that I am taking the matter seriously, and action will

follow.</div>

<a name="06042062000048"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06042062000329"></a><b class="B">Mr.

Greg Knight</b> (East Yorkshire) (Con): Has not the Minister

understated the case in respect of UK law? If our law provides that a

vehicle shall not be used on a road in the United Kingdom without a

mirror positioned on the passenger side of the exterior of the vehicle,

surely all vehicles must have a mirror fitted irrespective of the law

in the country where the vehicle comes from. We could deal with the

problem quickly and under our own legal system. Will the Minister

comment on what my hon. Friend the Member for North Shropshire (Mr.

Paterson) said about other European Union member states having taken

unilateral action in that respect?</div>

<a name="06042062000049"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042062000330"></a>Dr.

Ladyman:</b> The hon. Gentleman may regret it, but in this

area the Commission has competence. The structural requirements for

vehicles are a matter for the EC. We can require things to be done on

our own vehicles, and that is probably what the Dutch have done, but we

cannot require changes to made to every vehicle entering the country.

However, some things can be done.</div>

<a name="06042062000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">First, we can work with the

Commission to identify urgently the need for retro-fitting. I give the

Committee the assurance that we will do so. Secondly, we can talk to

Transport Ministers in Europe to ensure that they understand the

importance of doing so. Again, I assure the Committee that I shall do

that. We can also consider other techniques, which includes the

possibility&#151;I put it no stronger than that&#151;of handing 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column309" />Column number: 309</div>out flexi-glass stick-on mirrors at the ports, and possibly to our

entire UK fleet, to deal with the problem on a shorter time

scale.</div>

<a name="06042062000051"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06042062000331"></a><b class="B">Dr.

Brian Iddon</b> (Bolton, South-East) (Lab): Will my hon.

Friend urge also on the Commission the urgent need for the

retro-fitting and fitting on new vehicles of reflective

tape?</div><a name="06042062000052"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042062000332"></a>Dr.

Ladyman:</b> I have to hand it to my hon. Friend for sneaking

one in completely out of order. I have stated my views on the matter,

and he knows them. I have no doubt that we will discuss the matter

further on Report.</div>

<a name="06042062000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given that the new clause would

not be helpful, and would probably not be legal under European law, I

assure the Committee, my constituents and the people of Kent that I

recognise that it is a real and current concern for everyone, and we

will deal with it as rapidly as we legally can. We hope to be

innovative in how we tackle the problem. Before the right hon. Member

for East Yorkshire (Mr. Knight) asks me, I can say that when I decide

how to deal with the matter, I shall ensure that a written ministerial

statement is made to that effect so that everyone is aware of it. With

those assurances, I hope that the hon. Member for North Shropshire will

withdraw the motion.</div>

<a name="06042062000054"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042062000333"></a>Mr.

Knight:</b> I regret hearing that the pass has been sold to

Europe. However, I welcome the tone and substance of the

Minister&#146;s remarks, as will many road users. If the Department

is to give away free mirrors, my only caveat is that I hope that the

Chancellor of the Exchequer does not use it as an excuse further to

increase vehicle excise duty or fuel duty, claiming that it is

necessary because of the extra expense involved.</div>

<a name="06042062000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">When the Minister is

formulating the regulations, will he consider the mirrors that one

sometimes sees on new coaches? Instead of being almost level with the

driver, they stick out in front of the windscreen, thereby giving the

driver a view of the front of the vehicle. If such a design could be

incorporated in the requirements for mirrors for lorries, it might help

to solve problems with the front blind

spot.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042062000334"></a>Dr.

Ladyman:</b> I can give the right hon. Gentleman the assurance

that we are considering mirrors that will help lorry drivers see in

front of the vehicle. It had not occurred to me that the drivers of

large trucks would not be able to see in front of the vehicle, but if

one can imagine sitting back from the windscreen, the angle of descent

extends beyond the bonnet of the cab and there is a piece of road on

which small pedestrians and children can disappear. That is a problem

that we need to

examine.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042062000335"></a>Mr.

Paterson:</b> I congratulate the hon. Member for Bolton,

South-East (Dr. Iddon) on catching the Minister on his blind spot and

raising the matter of retro-reflective materials. It is worth reminding

the Committee that the Minister said that we could not use such

materials because they were contrary to European law, but the hon.

Member for Bolton, South-East and I found out that the Italians have

already done so.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column310" />Column number: 310</div><a name="06042062000058"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042062000336"></a>Dr.

Ladyman:</b> The hon. Gentleman and my hon. Friend did indeed

find out that the Italians have done that. However, they did not find

out that the Commission has indicated that it requires the Italians to

think again and is considering infraction proceedings against them

because they should not have used those

materials.</div><a name="06042062000059"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042062000337"></a>Mr.

Paterson:</b> The fact is that there are Italian trucks

driving around with retro-reflective material on them, and the

Commission is moving towards that. It would be worth the

Minister&#146;s while, either alone or with the help of his

officials, to find out what has happened in Holland and Belgium. I

think that I have read that the domestic legislation applies to foreign

hauliers operating in Holland and Belgium, but I could not find any

documents that establish that

point.</div><a name="06042062000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was

encouraged by the Minister&#146;s comments. He has a constituency

interest in the matter, which might be spurring him on more than

anything else. That is good news. He is right to cite the fact that

there are small mirrors that can be screwed on to the inside of a cab;

I have managed to find some information on a supplier.</div>

<a name="06042062000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">Like my right hon. Friend the

Member for East Yorkshire, I think that it is a pity that the Minister

is not determined to crash on and push through domestic legislation.

However, given the commitments that he has made and the fact that he is

already well down the road on the matter, we will take his comments in

good faith. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the

motion.</div><a name="06042062000062"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Motion and

added up the number of new clauses that we have still to debate, and

the other matters that have to be considered before we finish at 4

o&#146;clock. If every new clause takes as long as the previous one,

we will be up against some very sharp wire. I merely advise the

elegance and passion on Second Reading, citing some amazing cases in

his constituency in which people have offended again and again, but

because their addresses are false they have not been brought to

justice. He has given me a quotation from <i class="I">Dunstable on Sunday</i>,

citing the cases of a car that was captured 81 times on the A505. He

has also informed me of a motor cycle that has been used to commit 60

offences of excess speed, 61 of disqualified driving and 61 of driving

without insurance.</div> <a name="06042062000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">My

the fact that there have been 1,585 dangerous driving offences on south

Bedfordshire&#146;s roads. A van has been clocked for 73 offences and

a motor bike for more than 61. Cars have been caught doing 98 mph in a

likely to cause alarm, distress or annoyance to members of the

public.</div><a name="06042062000269"></a><div class="hs_brev">Advice has

been sought from the CPS and our local judiciary, there is agreement

that to apply the Section 3 test to speeding offences, that is to

suggest that speeding per se also represents careless and inconsiderate

result we are powerless to seize these vehicles under this

police, Derbyshire police and Wiltshire police. Our simple proposal is

that if a vehicle is used in contravention of the Road Traffic

Regulations (Special Events) Act 1994 on three or more

occasions&#151;I have taken that number out of the air, as this is a

probing new clause&#151;it can be subject to the powers set out in

proposed subsection (2). My hon. Friend had a constructive meeting with

the Minister, and we are happy to withdraw the motion if the Minister

has some concrete proposals that would serve the purpose intended by

the new clause.</div><a name="06042062000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">There

is a real problem of a small number of people&#151;we return to the

hard core, whom we have mentioned before&#151;who are breaking the

law in a grotesque manner, with extraordinary frequency, and who cannot

be brought to book because they cannot be tracked down. The proposed

power would be welcomed by many in the police, because it would give

them the power to seize and remove the vehicles involved in such

offences.</div><a name="06042062000072"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06042062000340"></a><b class="B">Mr.

Alistair Carmichael</b> (Orkney and Shetland) (LD): I am not

without sympathy for what the hon. 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column312" />Column number: 312</div>Gentleman is saying, but what would he propose doing once the vehicle

had been seized? Would it not have made sense to have included

provisions for the return, confiscation and forfeiture of the

vehicle?</div><a name="06042062000073"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042062000341"></a>Mr.

Paterson:</b> This is a probing amendment. I am making the

case that there is a hole in the law. I am quite happy to withdraw the

motion, but on the condition that the Minister is prepared to bring

forward workable legislation. I am not pretending that the new clause

is perfect, but a real problem has been brought to our attention by

several police forces and, in particular, by my hon. Friend the Member

for South-West Bedfordshire. I commend the new clause as it stands, but

I look forward to hearing how the Minister proposes to sort the

problem, as I think he said he would when he met my hon. Friend

privately.</div><a name="06042062000074"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042062000342"></a>Dr.

Ladyman:</b> I hope that I have taken the issue very

seriously. I met the hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire, who was

kind enough to bring with him his constituent, the police constable who

had identified the problem. They provided me with the evidence as they

saw it. I took the matter up subsequently with chief constable Med

Hughes, who is chairman of the traffic team of the Association of Chief

Police Officers. The problem in Bedfordshire had been raised with the

Home Office, which took the position that the law was quite clear and

that there were powers to deal with such a problem. There was a dispute

about that matter.</div><a name="06042062000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">Med

Hughes and officials from the Home Office were absolutely clear when

speaking to me that the law provides them with all the powers that they

need, and ACPO made it clear to me that it is not asking for more

powers. ACPO believes that the powers to deal with the problem are

sufficient and comprehensive. If future experience suggests otherwise,

it is happy to come back to us to request further powers, but at the

moment its view is that it would be a mistake for Parliament to grant

further powers to the police when they have perfectly adequate powers

that have not been utilised properly.</div>

<a name="06042062000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">ACPO believes that the problem

arose from a misunderstanding in Bedfordshire about how the powers can

be used. To try to deal with that, I facilitated a meeting between Med

Hughes and the hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire at which those

issues were to be explained. In addition, Med Hughes has spoken to the

chief constable in Bedfordshire and explained the position to her. My

understanding is that she is now satisfied that the police do have the

powers to deal with the problem and that it is just a matter of police

enforcement&#151;using the powers

appropriately.</div><a name="06042062000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">I

suspect that in forthcoming days there will be more discussions, and if

the chief constable of Bedfordshire remains uncertain that she has the

powers that she needs to deal with the problem, no doubt that will be

relayed to us before the remaining stages of the Bill. However, at the

moment, ACPO is quite clear that the police have all the powers that

they need. There are police strategies that can be used to deal with

the problem and they need to be employed in Bedfordshire and other

places to crack down on

it.</div><a name="06042062000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">With those

assurances and the assurance that I still have an open mind on the

subject, should the advice I 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column313" />Column number: 313</div>am receiving from the chief constables turn out to be inaccurate, I hope

that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the

motion.</div><a name="06042062000079"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042062000343"></a>Mr.

Paterson:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for updating us. I

think that the best way of proceeding is for me to consult further my

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042062000344"></a>Mr.

Paterson:</b> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second

time.</div><a name="06042062000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">This new clause

relates to hit-and-run accidents and is another attempt on our part to

bear down on the infamous hard core. In 2004, 145 people were killed in

23,714 hit-and-run accidents and in 1997, 119 people were killed in

18,357 similar accidents. That is a 22 per cent. increase in the number

of deaths and a 30 per cent. increase in the number of hit-and-run

accidents. The number of people injured rose by 31 per cent. from

21,574 in 1997 to 28,397 in 2004. There is a real

problem.</div><a name="06042062000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">As my hon.

Friend the Member for Epsom and Ewell (Chris Grayling) said, another

aspect is that at the moment there is a strong incentive for some

drivers to get away from the scene of an accident. They may have had a

drink or be part of the large number of people&#151;perhaps 1

million&#151;that the Government have announced are driving without

insurance. Our intention in the new clause is simple: to impose a

strong sanction on those who leave the scene of a crime. We intend the

new clause to be used when there has been an injury and other motorists

are involved. At the moment, members of the hard core have everything

to gain from getting away and getting off scot-free. Our intention is

to provide a strong incentive to make them stay on the spot and, if

necessary, help an injured person or call the emergency services and

wait for them to arrive.</div>

<a name="06042062000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is a simple provision that

would change the offence in section 170(4) of the Road Traffic

Offenders Act 1988 from a summary to an indictable one with an increase

in the penalty from six months&#146; imprisonment to 14 years. That

would impose a severe sanction on those who attempt to get away in

appalling cases when they might have injured a third

party.</div><a name="06042062000086"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042062000345"></a>Dr.

Ladyman:</b> The Committee will not be surprised&#151;I am

sure that the hon. Gentleman will not 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column314" />Column number: 314</div>be&#151;that my advice is to resist the new clause. Having said that,

I entirely agree with the sentiment behind it. Hit-and-run driving is

abhorrent and we need to clamp down on it. It is already an offence,

punishable with six months&#146; imprisonment and a &#163;5,000

fine. As the hon. Gentleman rightly said, the new clause would make

available a raft of more significant

penalties.</div><a name="06042062000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">One of the

unintended consequences would be that it would affect someone who

genuinely did not know that they had been involved in an accident and,

therefore, did not stop. That occasionally happens. It might not mean

that they were not at fault for the accident, but they might not have

realised that they had been involved&#151;we have discussed truck

drivers who cannot see what is happening on the road all around them.

If someone in those circumstances failed to stop and was subsequently

prosecuted, one of the side effects of the new clause would be that

they could face 14 years in jail, which would be an over-reaction.

However, we have said many times on previous clauses that one would

expect the courts to be rational about the way they imposed such

sentences, and that is the way to deal with the matter.</div>

<a name="06042062000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am prepared to offer the hon.

Gentleman the assurance that I shall take the matter up with the Home

Office&#151;indeed, I am already doing so&#151;to look at

sentencing guidelines, so that the existing penalties can be used more

appropriately when people have failed to

stop.</div><a name="06042062000296"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.30

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042062000346"></a>Mr.

Paterson:</b> Two points. First, as I understand it, if no

third party is involved there is currently no requirement to remain at

the scene of a crime or to demand the emergency services or anyone

else. In fact, the police advise people to move on as quickly as

possible. Secondly, the Minister must acknowledge that under current

legislation there is flexibility for courts. We are not suggesting a

mandatory 14-year prison sentence for someone who inadvertently brushes

another vehicle and does not realise what he has done. We intend for

the very severe penalties to be restricted to the hard core who make

the serious and unpleasant decision to leave the scene of a crime where

someone might have been mortally

wounded.</div><a name="06042062000090"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042062000347"></a>Dr.

Ladyman:</b> If personal injury is involved, there is already

a clear requirement to stop and report an accident. There is also a

list of other circumstances in the 1988 Act under which a person is

required to stop and report an accident but where only damage has been

caused. The problem is not with that list, which requires people to

stop and report an accident, and I do not think that anyone whom the

hon. Gentleman is trying to reach with the new clause fails to realise

that they have committed an offence and that they should

stop.</div> <a name="06042062000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">My

understanding of what the hon. Gentleman said is that he is trying to

catch those people who know perfectly well that they should stop and

report an accident, but do not because they think that the consequences

of doing so might be worse than those of being caught subsequently,

having not stopped. He is 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column315" />Column number: 315</div>right that we need to ensure that the offences that are available for

not having stopped are used sufficiently strongly to deter people from

not stopping. However, allied to the offence that the individual has

committed, and for which they can still be prosecuted, the additional

offence of failing to stop already carries a sufficiently wide range of

penalties that, if they are used appropriately by the court, can ensure

that there are sufficient incentives for people not to drive away from

the scene of an accident.</div>

<a name="06042062000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">I offer the hon. Gentleman the

assurance that I shall speak to the Home Office about the use of

sentencing guidelines to deal with the

you, Sir Nicholas, although I am not sure that I am so much a new face

as what is known in this trade as a retread, although this is the first

time that I have had occasion to welcome you back to the Chair and to

move the motion for a new

clause.</div><a name="06042062000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that

the new clause can be dealt with in fairly short compass. The title

says it all. It would empower the Secretary of State to introduce

regulations prohibiting the retro-fitting&#151;that is a ghastly

word, but it seems to be the term of art used&#151;of bull bars to

vehicles. We all know what we mean by such things: they are pretty

hideous appendages, to four-wheel drive vehicles in particular. In this

day and age, they have limited use in the rural context. In my youth, I

might have had occasion to use them, as a farmer&#146;s son, but they

are generally not regarded as being best practice for animal husbandry.

I do not think even that many involved in agriculture or sporting

activities would have any real clamant need for them. Certainly in a

town or city they are a menace. They significantly increase the

likelihood of a fatality resulting from an accident involving a

motorised vehicle and a pedestrian.</div>

<a name="06042062000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">As such vehicles are generally

higher sprung, bull bars are particular dangerous for small children,

who are more likely to be hit on the head and sustain head injuries,

and for older people who are much more likely to sustain bone injuries

to the hip. The time has come 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column316" />Column number: 316</div>for us to say that there really is no need for the retro-fitting of bull

bars, and I hope that the Minister agrees.</div>

<a name="06042062000101"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042062000351"></a>Dr.

Ladyman:</b> I entirely agree. I see no place for bull bars on

the roads of the United Kingdom. I suppose that they may have some use

if one is driving a Land Rover through the African plains chasing

rhinoceroses for photographic purposes, but since there are few

rhinoceroses in London or elsewhere in the United Kingdom, I can see no

reason for them whatever. They are unsafe. They cause damage to

pedestrians. The hon. Gentleman need not press his new clause to a

Division because I can assure him that the European Union is already

alive to the problem. Consultation with the EU has led to a directive

that will ban the retro-fitting of bull bars. We are currently in the

process of transposing it into UK law. It will become mandatory from

next May, so the objective of the new clause will be

achieved.</div><a name="06042062000102"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042062000352"></a>Mr.

Knight:</b> Will the Minister confirm that the new directive

will not have a retrospective effect wider than the problem of bull

bars? For example, can he confirm that it will not prohibit the

continued display of, for example, the &#147;Spirit of

Ecstasy&#148; on a vintage

Rolls-Royce?</div><a name="06042062000103"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042062000353"></a>Dr.

Ladyman:</b> Once again, the right hon. Gentleman puts his

finger on the nub of political debate. My postbag contains nothing but

letters on this very subject. I can assure him that the &#147;Spirit

of Ecstasy&#148; does not count as a bull bar, nor will the directive

ban the fitting of devices to the front of vehicles that make them

safer. People may wish to retro-fit equipment to the front of their car

to improve its safety to pedestrians and that will also be allowed

under the new directive. With those assurances, I hope that the hon.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042062000355"></a>Mr.

Carmichael:</b> I beg to move, That the clause be read a

Second time.</div><a name="06042062000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although

it is a fairly substantial new clause, it can again be put in a fairly

short compass. It is offered by way of a probing amendment and reflects

the fact that as technology advances, so must the law. We have

experience of black boxes in aeroplanes. We have the experience of

so-called spies in the cab&#151;the tachograph devices for lorries.

It now becomes eminently possible that similar devices will soon be

available for general domestic motoring.</div>

<a name="06042062000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">The inclusion of data recording

devices in cars could bring significant advantages for road safety.

They certainly make the investigation of road traffic accidents an

awful lot easier. In my professional experience, before I came here, I

saw tremendous advances in the investigation of road traffic accidents.

When I started as a boy solicitor many years ago, it was a fairly crude

science. It has become much more sophisticated over the years. The

information available to the police from the scene of a road traffic

accident is 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column318" />Column number: 318</div>now considerable. The fitting of such devices to cars would be of

immense assistance to police when investigating accidents, and would

provide definitive evidence regarding the duration and speed of travel,

which are important factors to establish in the investigation of

crime.</div> <a name="06042062000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have been

involved in a number of other cases in which there has been an issue

about whether a car was being driven at all at a certain time. A

classic example of that is that the police are following someone, but

manage to lose him or her and eventually turn up at someone&#146;s

house to find that they claim to have been sitting at home all night

and that, as it happens, they just had four stiff measures of Highland

Park before the police arrived, which is why they are in the state in

which they are in. That is all grist to the summary courts&#146;

mill, but a somewhat unsatisfactory situation for a 21st-century

criminal justice system. Surely, if the technology to establish such

things is available for use, with important safeguards to ensure that

it would not be misused in a way that would concern those of us who

still take civil liberties seriously, I see no reason why we should not

consider its

introduction.</div><a name="06042062000111"></a>

sometimes irritates the Minister when I go on internet forays, but I

wonder whether he has heard of the method of world crash investigation

that Ricardo Martinez, the chief executive officer of Atlanta-based

Safety Intelligence Systems, who is considering using data recorders,

describes as BOGSAT&#151;a bunch of guys sitting around talking, or

coming up with their best guess. There is real merit in the idea of

having a recording of the last five to 10 seconds of the performance of

the car. All it does is use the existing technology that is used to

trigger air bags and automatic braking systems and records the speed,

length of time for which the brakes were applied and other factors

which would have controlled the car at the time.</div>

<a name="06042062000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Americans seem to be

further down the road than us. The National Highway Traffic Safety

Administration ran a Ford F-150 truck into a wall at 30 mph to test a

whole series of different black boxes. They are taking it seriously.

The boxes are also being used in court cases. We have said that we

should be careful about citing court cases, but I shall mention two.

There was one in Fort Myers, in which a man claimed to be doing 60 mph,

but was actually doing 90 mph. In another case, in Arlington Heights, a

hearse struck a squad car and the hearse driver claimed that he had a

medical condition. It turned out that he accelerated to 63 mph in the

last five seconds, which was 20 mph above the posted limit. Therefore,

it can cut both ways. This technical advance has merit, and I am

interested to hear the Department&#146;s official view on the

measure.</div><a name="06042062000113"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042062000357"></a>Dr.

Ladyman:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Member for Orkney and

Shetland for raising this important subject. I was pleased to hear that

my earlier comments rekindled his enthusiasm for Europe, although I was

not aware that the Liberal Democrats had lost their 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column319" />Column number: 319</div>enthusiasm for it. So far today I have discovered that the new

Conservative party is pro-Europe and anti-market, and that the Liberal

Democrats are now anti-Europe and pro-market, so things are certainly

changing in the political

sphere.</div><a name="06042062000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.

Member for North Shropshire is correct: there is merit in exploring the

idea, but both he and the hon. Gentleman would be the first to agree

that we cannot legislate yet, because a bunch of guys sitting around

talking is probably not a good evidential base for legislation.

Nevertheless, it is clear that black box recorders have long-term

merit.</div><a name="06042062000297"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.45

pm</div><a name="06042062000115"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042062000358"></a>Mr.

Paterson:</b> The bunch of guys sitting around talking was the

hon. Gentleman&#146;s definition of current traffic investigations,

his criticism being that the investigations do not have accurate data.

He was obviously proposing that the system that he is trying to sell to

the US Government is a much more accurate data supplier, so that the

bunch of guys would not have to sit around

talking.</div><a name="06042062000116"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042062000359"></a>Dr.

Ladyman:</b> I realise that I am slow on the uptake sometimes,

but I got the point. My point is that the present evidence for the

potential of black boxes is also largely derived from a bunch of guys

sitting around talking. That is a necessary first stage in developing

what will ultimately be legislation, but we can pose some obvious

issues that would need to be addressed before black boxes were provided

for. What would they be used for and under what circumstances would

people have access to the information on them? How would we deal with

the freedom issues that they would present? What about compatibilities

of standards&#151;how would we make sure that we were reading them

accurately?</div><a name="06042062000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">In

principle I agree that black boxes have merits. My own vehicle has a

black box in it and I have no access to the information that it

collects. That information is downloaded to the nice chaps at Alfa

Romeo when I have my car serviced, and they use it for designing the

next generation of Alfa Romeos, which as an Alfa Romeo owner I think is

probably a good thing. What I think is a bad thing is that I have no

ability to use the data, because it might advise me on how I could

drive better, or how I could save fuel by amending my driving

habits.</div><a name="06042062000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a

whole range of things that black boxes could offer, from fuel

efficiency and environmental benefits right through to accident

investigation, but we are a long way from being able to specify or

require them, and there would have to be a raft of debate on diverse

technical and freedom issues before legislating for them. I am grateful

to the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland for beginning that debate

and I look forward to continuing it, but I urge him to withdraw the new

clause as it has served its purpose in initiating the

debate.</div><a name="06042062000119"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042062000360"></a>Mr.

Carmichael:</b> We learn something new every day, Sir

Nicholas. Apparently some cars already have black boxes, and when I get

back to Shetland tomorrow I shall have a look at my car to see whether

the makers of Vauxhall have afforded the same opportunity to 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column320" />Column number: 320</div>Vectra owners such as myself as that which has been afforded to Alfa

Romeo owners.</div><a name="06042062000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am

somehow novel or

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042062000361"></a>Mr.

Carmichael:</b> I beg to move, That the clause be read a

Second time.</div><a name="06042062000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">New

clause 21 moves on from some of the arguments advanced earlier in

relation to the inclusion of vehicle data recording devices. As I said

to the Committee then, the science&#151;and it is fair to call it a

science&#151;of road accident investigation has moved on considerably

in recent years and is a much more sophisticated branch of policing.

There is now a case for the creation of a road accident investigation

service, which would be akin to the marine accident investigation

branch and the air accidents investigation branch. New clause 21 seeks

to establish such an investigation service. Members can see from the

text that this would involve investigation

into</div><a name="06042062000270"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the causes of road

accidents particularly where they result in death or serious

injury&#148;,</div><a name="06042062000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">and that the

service would</div><a name="06042062000271"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;commission

and publish the results of research into the causes and consequences of

road

accidents&#148;.</div><a name="06042062000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

service would focus primarily on the more serious road accidents. One

that springs to mind is that which involved the Land Rover that ran off

the motorway while the driver was asleep, which ran into a train and

caused multiple deaths. A degree of expertise is necessary in that

instance. It would assist also in 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column321" />Column number: 321</div>establishing the contribution that sleep disorders make to the number

and nature of road traffic accidents. The treatment and diagnosis of

obstructive sleep apnoea, for example, is recognised much more widely

now. The impact that it has on many road accidents is the sort of

general topic that a service created specifically to investigate road

accidents would be able to take on and give a nationwide perspective

rather than a force-by-force approach, which seems to be the case at

present.</div><a name="06042062000128"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042062000362"></a>Mr.

Paterson:</b> We already have the air accidents investigation

branch. There might be some merit in creating a road accident

investigation service, but we have our doubts over whether it would be

cost effective. Before we give our full support, we need a lot more

detail than the hon. Gentleman presented. Rather like black boxes, the

subject requires further investigation. There could well be merits in

it, but at this stage, a lot more work needs to be

done.</div><a name="06042062000129"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042062000363"></a>Dr.

Ladyman:</b> Again, I am sure that the hon. Member for Orkney

and Shetland intends really to stimulate debate. As the hon. Member for

North Shropshire said, we have an air accidents investigation branch.

Of course, thankfully, air accidents are rare. We have, as the hon.

Member for Orkney and Shetland said, a marine accident investigation

branch, and as I am responsible also for marine affairs I am pleased to

say that accidents in that area are rare also. Therefore, the number of

accidents that come into the remits of those bodies, so that they have

to launch investigations, is relatively limited. One of the things that

theycan do after investigating an accident is make

recommendations on how to reduce the chances of such an accident

happening again.</div><a name="06042062000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of

course, those agencies do not deal with quite the same situations as

arise in road accidents. Road accidents result in 3,200 fatalities. I

presume that the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland would want all

those fatalities to be investigated, so immediately we are talking

about an order of magnitude and more work than faced by the other

accident investigation bodies. Does he also want serious injuries to be

investigated? If so, we are talking about an order of magnitude greater

again. Then there is the question of what we would do with the

information. To what recommendations would it lead, on which we could

subsequently act?</div><a name="06042062000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">If

we are not going to investigate all deaths and serious injuries, how

would we explain that to the loved ones of those whose accidents are

not to be investigated? What would we do when we find someone sitting

in our constituency surgery who says that such a service does not

appear to value the life of their husband or wife because it is not

prepared to investigate the case and does not think that anything can

be learned from their loved one&#146;s death? All those issues would

have to be dealt with.</div>

<a name="06042062000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">In addition, we already have

well laid out procedures for the investigation of accidents,

particularly where deaths occur. A national road death investigation

manual was produced in 2002 which sets out how investigations are to be

carried out. First, the police are involved. They have to take

leadership, because if fault is involved they may need to prosecute

someone. The police will work closely with local authorities and other 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column322" />Column number: 322</div>highway authorities to identify what can be learned from each accident.

In addition, there is the Transport Research Laboratory and the teams

working in the Highways Agency who look generally at accidents to see

what engineering improvements we could make and what lessons we could

learn that might lead to changes in road traffic offences.</div>

<a name="06042062000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">We already do quite a lot of

what the hon. Gentleman is seeking, but it may be disseminated over a

large number of organisations. We might want to consider in the coming

years whether the Transport Research Laboratory or the Department for

Transport are bringing sufficient focus to the investigation of road

accidents in order to lead to evidence-based changes in legislation or

engineering. That is a worthy debate to have. In my view, we are doing

that work at the moment, but perhaps we could do even more. We have to

decide whether it would be cost effective to move

ahead.</div><a name="06042062000134"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042062000364"></a>Mr.

Knight:</b> On many major roads we see the blue traffic

monitoring cameras in use. On some motorways&#151;for example, the

M42&#151;cameras are in place that assist the police in detecting

serious crime and vehicle fraud. Although they are not there for that

purpose, have those cameras proved to be of use when accidents have

been captured on

film?</div><a name="06042062000135"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042062000365"></a>Dr.

Ladyman:</b> I understand that the cameras that are under the

control of the police have been used for that purpose. Police cameras,

which are normally used for the detection of offences, would have an

evidential regime around them which would be sufficient to present in a

court. The Highways Agency&#146;s cameras are there to help us in any

way that is appropriate. They are there to help us to monitor

congestion and to react to it. If they pick up accidents, that

information is available to the Highways Agency and the engineering

teams to see whether it can teach us anything about the

causes.</div> <a name="06042062000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not

know&#151;if the right hon. Gentleman presses this point, I will have

to write to him&#151;whether the police have ever requested footage

from the Highways Agency&#146;s films to help them in prosecutions. I

suspect that they have and I suspect that we would make it available if

there were a properly formulated request for that information.

Certainly if any information from those cameras were suitable to help

people improve road safety we would want to use it, subject to the

practicalities of the

technology.</div><a name="06042062000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope

that the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland will once again accept

that he has raised an issue that is worthy of further debate. This is

probably not the time for legislating on it, even if we were all to

agree that it is necessary. I hope that he will withdraw his new

clause.</div><a name="06042062000138"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042062000366"></a>Mr.

Carmichael:</b> I was hoping that the Minister might have

talked for another five minutes. I felt that as his speech progressed

he warmed to the idea after his fairly lukewarm start. Of course he is

absolutely right that where there is a fatality or serious injury, the

bulk of the investigation is already done. He was right to 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column323" />Column number: 323</div>draw attention to the work of various Government agencies, including the

Transport Research Laboratory. However, investigation is needed into

whether the range of responsibilities across a diffuse range of

agencies, which may sometimes compete for resources, is in the best

interests of road safety.</div>

<a name="06042062000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall not press the matter to

a vote. I am pleased to have the Minister&#146;s view on the record,

and as the science of road traffic investigation evolves, my proposal

may become an historic inevitability. I am confident that in 10

years&#146; time a Minister&#151;probably not the present one,

because I hope for his sake and his sanity that he will have moved

on&#151;will propose exactly that. Secure in the knowledge that

history will be on my side, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the

motion.</div><a name="06042062000140"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Motion and

Second

time.</div><a name="06042062000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">This

is my last new clause. I give credit to the Parliamentary Advisory

Council for Transport Safety&#151;other hon. Members have a more

distinguished pedigree of involvement with it than I have&#151;for

the drafting of the new clause. It was stimulated by an apparent change

in the pattern of new drivers, the age at which people pass their

driving tests and the consequences that that seems to be having for

road safety.</div><a name="06042062000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is

clear that young people are taking the driving test later than ever

before and that fewer young drivers are taking it. We can only

speculate on the reasons for 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column324" />Column number: 324</div>that. I suspect that as more and more young people go into tertiary

education, the greater burden of personal debt is having an effect on

the number who are prepared to take on the expense of learning to drive

and, when they have acquired their licence, the cost of a car,

particularly the cost of insurance. However, the proportion of young

people who are involved in serious road traffic accidents is rising

dramatically and during the recess the AA Motoring Trust published

stark figures for the period to

2004.</div><a name="06042062000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">There

is a fundamental difference between my approach and that of the

Government. Competence and ability to drive stops being assessed on the

day on which someone passes their test. I suggest&#151;this is borne

out by my personal experience and no doubt that of others&#151;that

there is a period post-test when people continue to learn significantly

and acquire the degree of competence at which they plateau. The new

clause recognises the practicality of that. Subsection (2) of the new

clause would add to section 1 of the Road Traffic (New Drivers) Act

1995 a new subsection

(5):</div><a name="06042062000272"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;During

the matter at some stage. I will be sad and disappointed if he has

not.</div><a name="06042062000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">More importantly,

Pat McFadden</b> (Wolverhampton, South-East) (Lab): May I ask

the hon. Gentleman about the business of a probationary driver not

being accompanied by someone under the age of 21? I presume that the

authors of the new clause had in mind the idea that a new driver is

necessarily a young driver. It is possible that someone could pass the

test in their mid-20s or 30s. The new clause would prohibit that person

from taking their son or daughter in the car with them. Surely we would

not want

that.</div><a name="06042062000150"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042062000369"></a>Mr.

Carmichael:</b> Yes, the hon. Gentleman is right. The reason

for including the requirement was to raise the point, on which I should

like to hear the Minister&#146;s views, of the pattern of road

traffic accidents that is emerging. As fewer young people are passing

their driving test, the incidence of road traffic accidents involving a

car with four, five or even more young people in it is becoming more

pronounced. Such cases predominantly involve young people under the age

of 21. We should consider that and debate it, so we needed to include

it in the new clause. I can understand that there are some practical

considerations, but we cannot just ignore the fact this is an emerging

type of 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column325" />Column number: 325</div>road traffic accident. We will have to address it either by these means

or at a later stage.</div>

<a name="06042062000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">I suspect that the person who

holds the driving licence and has the car is becoming the nominated

driver for the evening more often. That puts him under greater pressure

from his peers to take a measure of alcohol before driving, which

contributes to the incidence of accidents following the pattern that I

outlined. That is why we suggest in proposed new subsection (7) that

for the probationary period, the alcohol limits to be allowed would be

roughly a quarter of the current level&#151;that is, 9 mg of alcohol

in 100 ml of breath, 20 mg of alcohol in 100 ml of blood, compared to

the current level of 80 mg, and 27 mg of alcohol in 100 ml of urine. In

the year or so after a person has passed a driving test, before he

acquires greater competence and becomes more accustomed to using a car,

the impact of alcohol and the level of impairment of his driving is

more acute.</div><a name="06042062000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">I said

that the world is changing. Patterns of driving and road traffic

that is a new one.</div> <a name="06042062000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">I

feel strongly about the subject and disagree with the hon. Member for

Orkney and Shetland on a lot of the points that he raised. Many, many

young people are involved in serious road accidents. Only last weekend,

an 18-year-old girl was killed on a road beside Loch Lomond. Without

making any assumptions as to the cause of that accident, it is another

indication of the problem. On the same weekend, four young people

travelling in one vehicle were killed in Aberdeenshire. There are

serious concerns, but the new clause will not address

them.</div><a name="06042062000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am

particularly concerned about the under 21-year-olds. My three sons were

ready and able to sit their driving tests the minute that they were

eligible to do so. Part of the enjoyment and pleasure of driving, which

we all share, is being able to travel with our friends, and there are

many responsible young people who take driving seriously, enjoy it very

much, and understand that they must be extremely careful. The new

clause would not address the problem at

all.</div><a name="06042062000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">To judge under

21-year-olds to be more dangerous than other groups is unfair. However,

I understand that we must acknowledge that some young people get behind

the wheels of extremely powerful cars without being able to control

them. That is part of the problem: the power of the car. Young people

learn to drive in fairly sedate driving school vehicles and are

eligible immediately to get behind the wheels of powerful cars. I am

extremely concerned about parents not accepting their responsibilities.

Many of the accidents happen in parental vehicles. They allow their

children to take their BMWs or Mercedes on to the roads without any 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column326" />Column number: 326</div>restrictions. Even new drivers aged over 21 would not be able to control

such cars. Therefore, the power of vehicles must be

considered.</div><a name="06042062000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">I agree

with the assertion that there should be a distinguishing mark for

probationer drivers. It would encourage other road users to have a bit

more consideration and to be more aware. Saying that, I always drive as

though the people round me are going to do the stupidest things

possible and, therefore, I make allowances for that. However, it is

something that we cannot always do, and not everyone

does.</div><a name="06042062000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">Nowadays, most

young people organise driver rotas; they nominate a designated driver,

so if three or four of them are out for the evening, one of them

drives. I do not see any grounds on which we should permit them to have

any alcohol or drugs. We should say that for the first two years, they

should not have any alcohol when they are driving and, therefore, they

will be much more able to control their vehicles. Saying that it is all

right to drink a certain amount would be condoning young people having

a drink when they are driving, which is not right. I want better

training before the driving test and a system of continued review after

it.</div><a name="06042062000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">We must consider

the power of the vehicles that young people are driving, parental

responsibility in allowing young people to drive their cars, and

continued training and monitoring for new drivers. I look forward to my

hon. Friend the Minister&#146;s

response.</div><a name="06042062000162"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06042062000372"></a><b class="B">Stephen

Hammond</b> (Wimbledon) (Con): It is good to see you back in

the Chair, Sir Nicholas. You missed the Minister describe himself as

demob happy&#151;<i class="I">[Interruption.] </i>Well, shall we say that he

agreed that he was demob happy? It was probably why he maligned

Conservatives as pro-European and anti-market, which is about as

accurate as describing his party as

socialist.</div><a name="06042062000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

principle behind new clause 23 is one that we support. The idea of a

graduation after completion of a driving test to encourage continued

and increasing competency should be supported. The idea of a graduation

from provisional through probationary to full, and perhaps even to an

advanced licence, would be an extremely useful approach to road safety.

We have no problem with the principle behind the new

clause.</div><a name="06042062000299"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.15

pm</div><a name="06042062000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">The substance

of the clause itself causes us a number of problems and they have been

adequately described. The hon. Members for Wolverhampton, South-East

(Mr. McFadden) and for Cumbernauld, Kilsyth and Kirkintilloch, East

(Rosemary McKenna) talked about the problem of age. I will not

reiterate their points. The second area where we take issue is alcohol.

We would need a much greater discussion about what would be

appropriate. The Committee has already had some serious discussions

about some and none at all. We have also debated whether it is just

over or just under which is causing the problem as opposed to being a

long way over.</div> <a name="06042062000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">We

have discussed the problem of serial offenders. We have also talked

about how the reduction in the number of police officers on our roads

has made 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column327" />Column number: 327</div>detection of drink-driving and enforcement of the law more difficult.

That would render subsection (7) pretty much unenforceable. Although we

would support the principle of a graduation in licence, we certainly

could not support the new clause.</div>

<a name="06042062000166"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042062000373"></a>Dr.

Ladyman:</b> Again, I understand that the hon. Member for

Orkney and Shetland is trying to stimulate a debate. He acknowledges

himself that there are many deficiencies in his new clause; it would

create a number of anomalies. I will not go through those. I will

address my brief comments to the principles involved. I entirely agree

with my hon. Friend the Member for Cumbernauld, Kilsyth and

Kirkintilloch, East (Rosemary McKenna) that this is an important issue,

but it needs to be dealt with properly.</div>

<a name="06042062000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">We can all accept that there is

a threshold in our lives before which being involved in activities with

our peers encourages us to be more reckless. After that threshold,

involvement with our peers encourages us to be less reckless. The

problem with young drivers, as opposed to newly qualified drivers, is

quite often they get into trouble when they are with their peers and

the normal social controls that we all have over our behaviour break

down. That is when people sometimes become irresponsible. However, not

all young people are like that, as my hon. Friend pointed out. Many are

very responsible. It would be very unfair to restrict their ability to

use a motor car for increased social mobility.</div>

<a name="06042062000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">Somehow we have to devise a set

of arrangements that will help us address the real problem. I do not

believe that the real problem is newly qualified drivers. Newly

qualified drivers should learn, as we all should learn, that learning

to drive is a lifelong experience. Even once we have been driving for

30 years we can still improve our driving and we should challenge

ourselves to do so. Clearly, in the first years after getting a driving

licence, people are on quite a steep learning curve. However, because

we have such a stiff driving test and a high hurdle before people get

their licence, they are already quite well up that learning

curve.</div> <a name="06042062000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">Evidence is

put to me that such and such a country&#151;Australia, some states in

America, for example&#151;has had great benefits from probationary

periods for new drivers, but we are not comparing apples with apples.

In such countries, they may have a very easy test to get through

because they have large rural communities and they want people to pass

their test easily in order to increase their social mobility.

Therefore, people are low on the learning curve once they pass their

test and have a lot more to learn about how to drive. In some places

people are allowed to get a driving licence at the age of 15 for social

mobility reasons.</div> <a name="06042062000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">In

this country, people have to be 17 before they can get a driving

licence. They have to go through a very rigorous test. The principle

that we follow here is that to get through that test a driver should

already be fully qualified. It is a very different situation from that

in those other countries. We have to get across the message that

learning to drive is a lifelong experience and that in the first few

years after passing the test people learn most rapidly.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column328" />Column number: 328</div><a name="06042062000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">We must provide people with

tools to help further learning and encourage them to take the pass-plus

test, perhaps with incentives in their insurance bills. We must ensure

that the Driving Standards Agency gears up the material that it

produces to help people to continue to learn how to drive and be safe

on the roads. We need to explore all those avenues before we start to

think of much more restrictive legislation which, frankly, would be

very difficult to

enforce.</div><a name="06042062000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">Until we have

clear evidence that we need such legislation, I am loth to go down that

route, but I assure the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland that I am

aware of the issue of young, newly qualified drivers. Actually the

issue is more to do with young drivers than newly qualified drivers;

many of the accidents and fatalities that we read about in the papers

happen to kids in their early 20s after they have already been driving

for three years and are well outside their probationary period. There

are serious things to be done in education and in improving training

provision for drivers as they prepare for their test, but at this stage

I am not convinced that probationary periods and draconian restrictions

on social mobility are the right way to

go.</div><a name="06042062000173"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042062000374"></a>Mr.

Carmichael:</b> As I said, the issue between us was that the

Government believe that significant learning stops at the point of

passing one&#146;s test and they are not prepared to take any

interest thereafter. I am disappointed that, from what the Minister

said, that still appears to be the

case.</div><a name="06042062000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

hon. Member for Cumbernauld, Kilsyth and Kirkintilloch,

East&#151;south of the Pentland firth, as I see it&#151;said that

she disagreed fundamentally with the new clause and then went on to

agree violently with most of it. The point about 21-year-olds is well

made, though, and I have made it clear that I shall not labour

it.</div><a name="06042062000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">A restriction on

engine size might very properly be included in a probationary period,

however. Allied with the display of a distinguishing mark, it would not

cause any particular problems of enforcement. In fact, it would be one

of the more easily enforced provisions in road traffic

law&#151;easier than those on driving without insurance or without an

MOT certificate, which generally become apparent only after some other

road traffic

infraction.</div><a name="06042062000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">My

principal concern remains that the changing patterns of driving produce

challenges of their own which will have to be addressed. I shall not

force a Division today, not least because our debate may allow the

House to express a view more broadly on Report. Accordingly, I beg to

ask leave to withdraw the motion.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042062000375"></a>Mr.

Paterson:</b> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second

time.</div><a name="06042062000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">We think that

there is a compelling case for the new clause. Statistics show that

when pedestrians are more visible there are road safety gains. Of all

road fatalities, 45 per cent. happen in darkness, and 21 per cent. of

all the fatal casualties on roads in 2004 were pedestrian casualties.

Some 559 pedestrians were killed or seriously injured in 2004 on

footways or verges as a result of road accidents, and in the same year

147 people were killed in accidents on motorway hard shoulders. It is

clear that pedestrians are vulnerable, and it would be a good thing for

them to be more visible.</div>

<a name="06042062000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">Approximately 40 per cent. of

drivers involved in an accident with a car driver or passenger who has

unexpectedly been forced to leave a car say that they did not see the

victim. In 2002, 28 per cent. of accidents involving a car and a

pedestrian could be attributed either to the driver looking but not

seeing the pedestrian, or to the person who was hit wearing dark or

inconspicuous

clothing.</div><a name="06042062000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall

briefly examine other countries. In 2003, 115 people were killed or

seriously injured in Spain while working at the side of the road,

repairing their vehicle or getting in or out of their car. To reduce

that number, it is now mandatory for people getting out of a car at the

road side to wear a retro-reflective vest. Similar action has been

taken in Italy, Portugal, Austria and, most recently, Israel. The

measure is being seriously considered in Sweden, which the Minister and

I happily visited before

Easter.</div><a name="06042062000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Royal

Society for the Prevention of Accidents advises that pedestrians wear

something that will make them conspicuous, particularly in conditions

of poor visibility. The US Department of Transportation has shown that

reflective clothing increases the visibility of a pedestrian by a

factor of five. In a study that it carried out, it found that wearing a

retro-reflective vest increased the distance at which a driver could

see a pedestrian by about 159 m. The evidence is compelling. There is a

European standard, EN471, for the design of reflective clothing. We

recommend in the new clause the use of that

standard.</div><a name="06042062000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">The total

cost of road accidents in the UK in 2002 was &#163;17.76 billion.

Highly visible reflective vests complying with EN471 cost as little as

a fiver, and given that the Minister thought that it was good value to

spend a tenner to change from paper licences to photographic licences,

I am sure that he would agree that there is merit in motorists having

&#163;5-worth of reflective vest in their car in case they have to

get out at the road

side.</div><a name="06042062000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">I

am always worried about the blood pressure of the Government Whip, the

hon. Member for Motherwell and Wishaw (Mr. Roy), so I will not go

through all the anecdotal history showing that reflective vests would

have had merit. However, it is worth quoting the Minister&#146;s

colleague, the hon. Member for Staffordshire, Moorlands (Charlotte

Atkins), who said last March when discussing the previous Road Safety

Bill that</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column330" />Column number: 330</div><a name="06042062000275"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;anything that helps the motorist

and their passengers to remain safer after an accident or when they

have had to stop for whatever reason is worth

considering.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report</i>, 8 March

2005; Vol. 431, c. 1451.]</div> <a name="06042062000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">So

the Government have acknowledged that there is merit in the suggestion.

Our contention is that, given the investment that a driver has to make

in a car&#151;in servicing it, insuring it, fuelling it and

everything else&#151;&#163;5 is not an exorbitant sum. There would

be real merit in having a reflective vest when a car breaks down or

when a passenger has to get out. They would be a lot safer and more

visible to oncoming road users.

</div><a name="06042062000187"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042062000376"></a>Mr.

Knight:</b> I do not want to detain the Committee for too

long, but I rise to support my hon. Friend the Member for North

Shropshire. I dislike unnecessary regulation and red tape, but where

issues of safety are concerned we should examine the experiences and

practices of other countries to see whether they are worth following.

As my hon. Friend said, the law in Spain, which I have seen in

operation, is that if a person stops his vehicle and leaves it for

whatever reason&#151;from what I have seen, that is usually owing to

a breakdown, a flat tyre or another mechanical problem&#151;he must

don a reflective jacket. That is a valuable aid to road

safety.</div><a name="06042062000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have been

involved in two near misses while driving with headlamps on and someone

with dark clothing has been standing in the carriageway. On one

occasion it looked as though the man was admiring his vehicle rather

than trying to repair it, and if he had been wearing reflective

clothing I would have seen him at a much greater

distance.</div><a name="06042062000300"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.30

pm</div><a name="06042062000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">What assessment

has the Minister or his officials made of the effectiveness of the

provision in other countries? It was as a result of a speech that I

made when we discussed the previous Bill that the then Minister, the

hon. Member for Staffordshire, Moorlands, said that she was willing to

examine what had happened in other countries and to consider the

benefits with a view to revisiting the matter. I hope that the Minister

can tell us whether an assessment has been

made.</div><a name="06042062000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister

referred to a box in his car and said that he had no idea what was in

it and, by implication, no idea what the contents meant. At first, I

thought he was referring to his red box, but he made it clear that he

was referring to a black recorder box. If he cannot give us an answer

today and my hon. Friends do not press the new clause to a vote, I hope

that he will tell us on Report what assessment his Department has made

of the effectiveness of the provision where it has been

tried.</div><a name="06042062000191"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042062000377"></a>Dr.

Ladyman:</b> When I proposed that we should have photo

identity licences at a cost of perhaps &#163;5 or &#163;10 I was

accused of introducing a stealth tax, yet here we have a Conservative

Front Bencher suggesting a further stealth tax. People would not have

to keep just one &#163;5 piece of equipment in their car. If they had

a five-seater car, presumably they would have to keep five 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column331" />Column number: 331</div>pieces of equipment in it. The hon. Gentleman&#146;s stealth tax would

be five times higher than the one that he accused me of

introducing.</div> <a name="06042062000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is

no legal distinction between parking at the road side and stopping at

the roadside because someone has broken down, so careful consideration

would have to be given to the drafting of such a provision. The hon.

Gentleman&#146;s arguments are right. A pedestrian is much safer if

they can be seen. Of the 3,000-plus accidents that result in death in

this country every year, a relatively small number involve people who

stop their car at the road side and get out of it. A much higher number

are pedestrians who are struck by cars. A logical extension of his

argument is that he would like legislation to require all pedestrians

to wear reflective clothing. We already make it clear that wearing

reflective and light-coloured clothing is good practice for children.

It is certainly good practice for adult pedestrians and for motorists

who are at the road side because they have broken down. We deal with

that in the highway code and in other guidance that we issue to

motorists. However, it is a big leap from good practice to

compulsion.</div><a name="06042062000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not

prepared to accept the new clause and I am sure that the hon. Gentleman

tabled it as a probing amendment. However, I am prepared to say to him

and the right hon. Member for East Yorkshire that we will continue to

monitor experience in other countries that introduce such legislation.

If clear evidence starts to emerge that it would have the beneficial

effect that they believe it would have, we would look again at the need

to legislate. In the meantime, we will continue to use education

campaigns and the guidance that we issue to motorists to make it clear

to them and to pedestrians that wearing light-coloured and reflective

clothing is sensible and that motorists should include some reflective

clothing in their car in case they break down. That is part of the

guidance that we already issue, which is different from legislating. We

shall look at any evidence that emerges and perhaps return to the

matter.</div><a name="06042062000194"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042062000378"></a>Mr.

Paterson:</b> I am not hugely encouraged by the

Minister&#146;s response. Later on, Sir Nicholas, you and I will be

driving up the motorway and whether we wave an ancient paper licence at

an oncoming juggernaut if we happen to break down on the M6 or the M1,

or a brand new, glossy photo licence, it will have no impact on the

oncoming driver. If we get out wearing a reflective coat it will have

an impact. The Minister should not muddle up the

two.</div><a name="06042062000195"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042062000379"></a>Dr.

Ladyman:</b> Perhaps the hon. Gentleman would tell me how many

reflective coats he has in his car. As he is so convinced by this

argument, presumably he is doing it

voluntarily.</div><a name="06042062000196"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042062000380"></a>Mr.

Paterson:</b> That is a perfectly good and fair point. I have

not purchased one yet, but I am hoping that the price will come down.

The statistics came from the Minister&#146;s Department. I said that

559 pedestrians were killed or seriously injured in 2004. That is from

table 31 of the Department for Transport&#146;s report &#147;Road

Casualties Great Britain 2004&#148;, published in September 2005. The

other figure of 147 people killed 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column332" />Column number: 332</div>in accidents on the hard shoulder of motorways comes from the

Minister&#146;s written answer on 16 October 2005.

</div><a name="06042062000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">We do not support

extra cost or extra regulation, but we support regulations that ensure

that motorists have tyres with a certain tread depth. That costs

motorists quite a lot of money. If a car&#146;s tracking goes wrong,

one has to throw away quite an expensive tyre much earlier. We support

such regulation. For &#163;5, this is not a huge investment. It is

compulsory to have triangles in the back of the car in case of a

breakdown. I am partly encouraged by one or two of the

Minister&#146;s comments which I will analyse carefully when

<i class="I">Hansard </i>is printed. On that basis, we will not push the new

the last decade, however, it has become increasingly clear that such

arbitrary restrictions may be unfair and even potentially

discriminatory... there is no convincing evidence that diabetic

drivers on insulin treatment as a group are more likely to have traffic

accidents than their non-diabetic

counterparts.&#148;</div><a name="06042062000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">Most

recently, last year a study by Mills et al reported:</div>

<a name="06042062000278"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Research into road

traffic accidents and diabetes found no significant difference in the

rate of collisions between people with diabetes and people that do not

have the

condition.&#148;</div><a name="06042062000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">It

has been a feature of international driving regulations that people who

were insulin-treated for diabetes had to suffer the blanket ban.

However, over the past few 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column333" />Column number: 333</div>years, including last year in the United States, that blanket ban has

been repealed in favour of individual assessments. The Minister will

know that in the House of Representatives in the United States, the

Secretary of State for Transport&#146;s honorary advisory panel

commented:</div> <a name="06042062000279"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;relating to

persons with diabetes, to allow individuals who use insulin to treat

their diabetes to operate commercial motor vehicles in interstate

commerce. The revised final rule shall provide for the individual

assessment of

applicants&#148;</div><a name="06042062000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">and not for a

blanket ban.</div><a name="06042062000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is our

contention, therefore, that the scientific evidence provides no

conclusive reason for the maintenance of the blanket ban and that we

should move to a system of individual assessment. The new clause would

put that into

effect.</div><a name="06042062000209"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042062000382"></a>Dr.

Ladyman:</b> It always amuses me to watch steam coming out of

the ears of the Conservative Members when I tell them that things are

banned by the European Union, so I am going to enjoy myself again. The

new clause would be illegal under European law, and before the hon.

Gentleman gets all huffy about that&#151;his right hon. Friend the

Member for East Yorkshire has popped out for a moment and is,

therefore, spared this&#151;it was a European law to which his

Government before 1997

agreed.</div><a name="06042062000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">The simple

fact is that there is a risk of people with diabetes controlled by

insulin going into diabetic shock. Therefore, it is felt that they

should not be in control of vehicles over a serious weight. The matter

is being considered, however, by a medical panel of the European Union,

with the view to seeing whether a rational way of determining those who

have good control of their diabetes and, therefore, are not a risk can

be established. In the UK, we will be informed by that work and will

contribute our views to those

discussions.</div><a name="06042062000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having

encouraged the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the new clause on the grounds

that we could not possibly accept it, I hope he will at least accept

that we understand the point that he is trying to make. There may be

people who have well controlled diabetes who are being treated unfairly

by not being allowed to drive, and if we can do it safely, we would

want, at some point in the future, to come to a conclusion whereby we

can allow them to have driving licences for those types of vehicles.

However, that will only happen when we can absolutely and fairly

determine who those individuals are, that it would be safe for them to

have such a licence, and we can agree those measures with the whole of

the European Union, which thanks to the previous Conservative

Government has competency on the

issue.</div><a name="06042062000212"></a>

Hammond:</b> Despite the Minister&#146;s initial remarks, I

was pleased to note that he must have listened to some of what I have

said. A lot of the scientific evidence that I quoted made the point

that there had been movement in the past decade in gaining knowledge,

and, therefore, anything that happened before 1997 was a decade prior.

My point was that there has been movement in the scientific evidence,

which no longer suggests that a blanket ban is necessary.</div>

<a name="06042062000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">Rather like retroflective

strips on lorries, I look forward to the European Union coming to an 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column334" />Column number: 334</div>occasional sensible decision. Also, I look forward to the medical panel

producing a conclusion in line with many other parts of the world, that

an individual assessment would be acceptable. On that basis, I beg to

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042062000384"></a>Mr.

Paterson:</b> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second

Time.</div><a name="06042062000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new clause

addresses a problem that hauliers brought to my attention. It may seem

obscure&#151;not many people know about it&#151;but it kills

approximately seven people a year. It happens when a driver hitches the

tractor unit of a semi-articulated trailer to a stationary trailer,

often in a

yard.</div><a name="06042062000301"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.45

pm</div><a name="06042062000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">When the

airbrakes have no air, they are applied. Therefore, a parked trailer in

the yard will be safe and secure with the brakes on, because there is

no air coming through. When the tractor unit is reversed up, the driver

will sense a big clunk as the big, greasy black disc&#151;the fifth

wheel&#151;connects to the coupling on the trailer. What should

happen then is that the driver applies the handbrake so that the whole

unit of tractor and trailer is connected. Sadly, that often does not

happen. Instead, with the trailer airbrakes still not connected, and

because the driver feels that the unit is stable, he jumps across the

catwalk and connects the suzie hoses that introduce air to the air

brakes. Immediately, the air brakes come off. At that point, because

the handbrake is not applied and the air takes the trailer brakes off,

the whole unit begins to move. For self-preservation the driver should

sit tight, but all too often he jumps down, frantically scrambling for

the cab to try to apply the handbrake in the vehicle. Alternatively,

the whole unit runs backwards and crushes someone else in the goods

yard.</div><a name="06042062000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">It seems

extraordinary that that happens and yet is not a matter of huge public

contention, because I am told that up to seven people a year are killed

in that way. The solution that we propose is terribly simple. The

proposal is to fit an alarm to every heavy goods vehicle so that when

the driver jumps down from the cab without the brakes on, an alarm goes

off&#151;a simple, common-sense

solution.</div><a name="06042062000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am all for

reducing costs to hauliers, but retrofitting a kit for &#163;100 on a

rig that may cost &#163;100,000 is not unbearable. DAF, Mercedes-Benz

and Scania are now fitting such devices as standard, and the new clause

has real merit because it would save lives. The problem is an ongoing

one that has had very little public attention, and I hope that the

Minister has listened carefully and will take

action.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042062000385"></a>Dr.

Ladyman:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for bringing

the issue to my attention, because it was not one of which I was aware.

When I first read the new clause I could not quite see his point; I

thought that he was seeking an audible warning if a driver leapt out of

the cab when driving along the motorway. Further investigation has led

me to conclude that there is a

problem.</div><a name="06042062000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">The problem

can be resolved voluntarily. The hauliers who have gone to him can

solve it in a number of ways: either by retrofitting the equipment in

their vehicles, or by issuing instructions to their staff to follow a

certain protocol, such that when hitching a trailer or working around a

vehicle the staff should personally check to see that the parking brake

is applied. Both measures would provide a

resolution.</div><a name="06042062000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the

hon. Gentleman said, I understand that the devices are fitted as

standard to some vehicles, and perhaps we need to encourage that for

all new vehicles. However, the sort of regulation that he suggests

cannot be introduced unilaterally in the United Kingdom; it would have

to be a matter for European-type approval. We need to work with the

Commission and with European colleagues to make them realise the

benefits of including the provision in future changes to regulations. I

am certainly prepared to raise it with them and to put it on the agenda

if it is not already

there.</div><a name="06042062000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">With that

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042062000387"></a>Mr.

Paterson:</b> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second

time.</div><a name="06042062000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">I repeat that

Conservative Members do not like extra regulation. I often say that I

came into politics to see fewer politicians, less regulation, less

government and less taxation. However, there are some areas of activity

that increase rapidly and the Government must keep up with that. One is

the phenomenon of the growth of stretched limousines. It is estimated

that in 2003 there were only 3,000, but there are now more than 11,000

and their number is increasing by 50 per cent. a year. What is worrying

is that almost all of them are not built as stretched limousines but

are standard cars that have been chopped in half and

stretched.</div> <a name="06042062000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under

current law, stretched limousines should carry only up to eight

passengers no matter how large they are. That is the legal maximum

number of passengers that can be carried by hired vehicles, but some

carry as many as 28 passengers. Advertisements often say that they can

carry 16 to 18 passengers and increasingly they carry a large number of

children or ladies going to hen parties&#151;<i class="I">[Laughter.]</i> Hon.

Members may laugh&#151;perhaps they are becoming demob

happy&#151;but 28 people in a 40 ft limousine weigh up to 6.5 tonnes.

The brakes, steering, suspension and tyres are inadequate for such

substantial weights and the inspection regimes are not being respected.

Such vehicles probably burn out their brakes within 6,000 or 7,000

miles and should probably be inspected every 10 weeks or so, but they

are not.</div><a name="06042062000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">Stretched

limousines represent a booming sector of the economy and we are all in

favour of growth, but if the legal limit on the number of passengers in

a hired vehicle is eight, there is a major safety

problem.</div>

<a name="06042062000232"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042062000388"></a>Mr.

McFadden:</b> The hon. Gentleman listed some of the dangers of

those vehicles. Does he accept that another danger is that if there

were a crash or even worse a fire, it would be difficult to get a large

number of people out of the vehicle

quickly?</div>

<a name="06042062000233"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042062000389"></a>Mr.

Paterson:</b> The hon. Gentleman is spot-on and I was about to

mention that it would be impossible to get 28 people out of one of

those vehicles quickly. Touch wood, there has not yet been a major

incident, but the increase in their number and the fact that they are

almost all converted from standard cars means that they are a nightmare

waiting to happen.</div><a name="06042062000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">A

couple of good points have been made to me. The staff of the Vehicle

and Operator Services Agency usually work from Monday until 5

o&#146;clock on Friday and are not on the streets in the evenings and

at weekends when most of the limousines are operating. The legal limit

at the moment is up to eight passengers 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column337" />Column number: 337</div>and the new clause would introduce a simple regime with a category of

limousine that can carry up to 16 passengers.</div>

<a name="06042062000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that the Minister will

seriously consider the new clause&#151;this growth area has popped up

very recently. It should not be suppressed&#151;we are all in favour

of the market and an expanding economy&#151;but it is reasonable to

bring these vehicles within sensible regulation. The hon. Member for

Wolverhampton, South-East was spot-on when he said that getting people

out of stretched limousines in case of a fire must be one of the

biggest worries.</div><a name="06042062000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

matter is attracting a little press attention, and I should like to end

the Committee on an interesting note, which is wholly irrelevant but

shows how big the vehicles can be. I have no idea what size of vehicle

you intend to drive back to Macclesfield, Sir Nicholas, but you might

consider matching the largest vehicle, as recorded in &#147;Guinness

World Records,&#148; which is a 100 ft, 26-wheeler that has a

swimming pool, a helipad and a putting green. That shows the potential

growth in such

vehicles.</div><a name="06042062000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that

the Minister will examine our seriously considered new clause, because

this area needs the Government&#146;s attention before a horrible

accident

happens.</div><a name="06042062000238"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042062000390"></a>The

Chairman:</b> The hon. Gentleman is giving me

ideas.</div><a name="06042062000239"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042062000391"></a>Dr.

Ladyman:</b> Given the hon. Gentleman&#146;s comments about

your testosterone levels, Sir Nicholas, there is another Member of the

House, who is not in Committee, who may be interested in your getting

ideas about driving back to Macclesfield in a stretch limousine with 28

women on a hen

party.</div><a name="06042062000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is an

important issue, and the hon. Gentleman is right to raise it. I must

tell him that I have had representations on both sides of the argument

in recent weeks. My hon. Friend the Member for Newport, East (Jessica

Morden) brought to my attention the case of a limousine operator in her

constituency who was taking the opposite view: that the regulations

need to be changed to allow people to get a licence for operating

stretched limousines with large numbers of people in

them.</div><a name="06042062000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are

clearly issues to be resolved, but I shall explain to the Committee my

understanding of how the law works. If the vehicle is going to carry up

to eight passengers, it can be licensed by the local authority as a

taxi or as a private hire vehicle. If it is the latter, if can be used

only for pre-bookings. If it is a taxi then it can be used to ply for

trade in the same way as other taxis. That is a matter of local

authority competence.</div>

<a name="06042062000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">If an operator wishes their

vehicles to be operated with more than eight passengers, they have to

get them licensed as public service vehicles. To do so, they first have

to get a type approval indicating that the vehicles are safe for

carrying more than eight passengers. Very few stretch limousines have

that certification, and they are therefore not legally usable for

carrying more than eight passengers. Some can be designed to be safe

enough, and some can be retrofitted for the purpose, but the standard

stretch limousine that we see around 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column338" />Column number: 338</div>the country&#151;my daughter and some of her friends used one to take

them away from primary school when they left last year&#151;is not

considered safe for more than eight people. If they are licensed at

all, it should be only as a private hire vehicle or a taxi.</div>

<a name="06042062000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">Many people have imported such

cars in the hope of using them for more than eight passengers, but to

do so they have had to sign a piece of paper to say that they

understand and will stay within the law and the limitations on use of

the vehicle. If they do not do so, they cannot plead ignorance, because

they signed that piece of paper when they imported the vehicle. It is

then a matter for the police to enforce the

law.</div><a name="06042062000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">The issues to

consider are, first, that the police are not enforcing the legislation

properly and, secondly, that some local authorities allow licences to

be granted for limousines as private hire vehicles while others say

that they are not safe at all. That is forcing some operators to

operate without any sort of licence in those local authority areas. How

will we deal with that, as it is a matter of local authority

discretion? We have been consulting, and we shall shortly publish

guidance on how local authorities should make decisions about which

vehicles can and cannot be licensed. I hope that it will provide local

authorities with much greater clarity about what they should and should

not license, and how they should deal with those issues. I hope that

those assurances will encourage the hon. Gentleman to withdraw his new

clause.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042062000392"></a>Mr.

Paterson:</b> Some of those vehicles cost about

&#163;100,000, so carrying eight passengers is simply not viable.

Properly maintained and looked after, they are safe with up to 16 or 18

people. We propose a regime in which they will be allowed to run with

16 or 18 people. If we just say&#151;blanket&#151;that they can

have only eight, they will not be viable, and I am afraid that many

people will carry on illegally. We are trying to create a legal

framework, so that if the vehicle is maintained, they can get a return

on their &#163;100,000 by carrying 16 to 18 passengers in

safety.</div>

<a name="06042062000246"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042062000393"></a>Dr.

Ladyman:</b> There is a legal framework already. If the

vehicles are safe, and a person can obtain a certificate to that

effect, they can register them as public service vehicles. In that

case, they can operate them with more than eight people. The reason why

they cannot operate them is that they cannot get the certificate, and

that is because the vehicles are not safe to operate in that mode. The

existing legislative arrangements, with improved guidance, might be the

way of resolving the problem.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042062000397"></a>Dr.

Ladyman:</b> Sir Nicholas, I offer my thanks to you and Mrs.

Anderson for the skilful and patient way in which you have steered us

through this Committee. It has been a testosterone-packed performance

from yourself, Sir Nicholas, and, according to the hon. Member for

North Shropshire, from Mrs. Anderson, too.</div>

<a name="06042062000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Committee has been very

enjoyable. That has been made possible by all members of the Committee

from all parties. We have had an enjoyable exchange of views. I have

very much enjoyed the comments from all parties, the support of my hon.

Friends and the constructive criticism of Opposition Members. The right

hon. Member for East Yorkshire has valiantly stood up for those who

have vintage Bentleys and other very nice cars, and other Conservative

and Liberal Democrat Front Benchers have sought to put their views

skilfully and constructively.</div>

<a name="06042062000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">I thank also the Clerks and

<i class="I">Hansard</i> for all their work, my officials for all the support

that they have given me, and my Parliamentary Private Secretary, my

hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton and Shepherd&#146;s Bush

(Mr. Slaughter), for the support that he has offered me. I have very

much enjoyed the experience.</div>

<a name="06042062000257"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042062000398"></a>The

Chairman:</b> I gather that there will be a Division shortly.

If the concluding ceremonies, which I always enjoy, are kept brief, we

will conclude in time for Members to go downstairs to

vote.</div><a name="06042062000258"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042062000399"></a>Mr.

through your veins, Sir Nicholas, is still working. I will be brief and

robust.</div>

<a name="06042062000259"></a><div class="hs_Para">Thank you,

Sir Nicholas, for the manner in which you chaired the Committee. I

would be grateful if you could pass on the Opposition&#146;s thanks

to Mrs. Anderson as 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column344" />Column number: 344</div>well. I thank the Minister for the way in which he answered most of our

questions. We have further work to do on Report and look forward to

revisiting some of the issues and perhaps making further

progress.</div> <a name="06042062000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">I thank my

own team for their backing and hard work over recent weeks. I

particularly want to thank the Clerks who were presented with a

Bill&#146;s progress. I thank them for the manner in which they

interpreted them and turned them into workable new clauses and

amendments.</div>

Rochdale (Paul Rowen) and myself may I echo the points made about your

chairmanship, Sir Nicholas, and that of Mrs. Anderson? I also thank the

Clerks, the officials who have supported us and the <i class="I">Hansard</i>

staff. I agree with the hon. Member for North Shropshire and the

Minister that the Committee has been exceptionally good natured. I am

delighted that we managed to cover all our business with some 54

minutes to spare. It is a good advert for self-regulation.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042062000401"></a>The

Chairman:</b> From the Chair, I thank those who have spoken

for their generous comments about me and my co-Chairman, Janet

Anderson. It has been a pleasure to chair this Committee. I

congratulate all those involved on the constructive and orderly way in

which the Bill has been debated. I, too, thank the police, the

<i class="I">Hansard</i> reporters and the Doorkeepers for their contribution to

our orderly proceedings. Picking up the remark of the hon. Gentleman,

it shows that with constructive programming, where genuine consultation

has taken place, there can be full debate on all important matters. I

can only congratulate all involved. It has been a pleasure and I will

pass on your good wishes to Mrs. Anderson.</div>

<a name="06042062000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, I thank the Clerk, who

is so essential and who, on a couple of occasions, pulled me back when

I was rushing forward in an aggressive, testosterone-charged way. I am

grateful to the Clerk&#146;s Department for the support it gives not

only to the Committee, but to the

Chairman.</div><a name="06042062000264"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question
