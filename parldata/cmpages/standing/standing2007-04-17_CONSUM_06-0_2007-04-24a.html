						<b class="B">
							<a name="0704254000457"></a>The
Minister for Trade (Mr. Ian McCartney):
						</b> I
welcome you to the Chair again this afternoon, Mr. Weir. I
hope that we enjoy the sitting as much as we enjoyed the first sitting
today. Before dealing with amendment No. 28, I should like to report
back to the Committee following the discussion of clause 13 in last
Tuesday&#146;s sitting. I told hon. Members that I would raise the
issue of the recalibration of token payment metres with Ofgem. I have
today received a written response from Ofgem, which has also written to
the Clerk of the Committee in that regard. I was not sure this morning
whether the Clerk had received that response, so I apologise for that.
In case hon. Members have not received the response, I have brought
copies of both the letter and the memorandum that Ofgem prepared for
the Committee. I hope that they will bring hon. Members up to date on
Ofgem&#146;s position and help them to consider whether they might
want to raise other issues on Report stage. Copies are on the
Table.</div>
					<a name="0704254000017"></a><div class="hs_Para">On amendment No.
23, I shall first respond to the hon. Member for Solihull and then deal
with the issues raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, North
and suggest a way forward, which I have not yet discussed with my
officials. The Government&#146;s aim in introducing the estate
agents&#146; redress provisions is to require all estate agents to
join a high-quality redress scheme. I am happy to make it absolutely
clear to the House, as I did in numerous debates this morning, that we
intend to ensure that they are high-quality, not Mickey Mouse, schemes.
<i class="I">[</i>
						<i class="I">Interruption.</i>
						<i class="I">]</i> I will say Donald Duck schemes
then.</div>
					<a name="0704254000018"></a><div class="hs_Para">A high-quality
scheme is one that uses generally accepted criteria for best practice,
which include accessibility to all consumers, including vulnerable
consumers; ease of use; clarity of operation; timeliness of complaints
resolution; and responsiveness and transparency of decision making. We
want to ensure that all home buyers and sellers have access to redress
for legitimate complaints against estate agents. The amendment would
make it compulsory for the Secretary of State to lay an order requiring
estate agents to belong to a redress scheme. We cannot accept 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column162" />Column number: 162</div>the amendment, as it is possible to envisage scenarios in which, for
short periods, there is no approved scheme for agents to
join.</div>
					<a name="0704254000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Office of
Fair Trading can withdraw its approval from a scheme if it no longer
meets the approval criteria. We discussed the circumstances in which
that could happen during our consideration of an earlier amendment. For
example, approval could be withdrawn amid serious concerns that scheme
was not providing to the OFT information that it had about agents not
complying with legislation. Approval might also be withdrawn after a
change in the governance structure that, in the OFT&#146;s opinion,
compromised the ombudsman&#146;s independence. The OFT must be
notified of any change to the running of the scheme within14
days of the change taking place. The OFT will quickly be aware of
changes to the scheme and will be able to assess whether they affect
its approval.</div>
					<a name="0704254000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">Approval
would also be withdrawn if there were concerns about the effectiveness
of the complaints handling system, where an unacceptable backlog of
unassessed cases had built up. If a scheme was unable to handle the
number of complaints, because it was not adequately resourced, for
example, the OFT could withdraw its approval. The amendment would make
no difference to what would happen in practice; all estate agents would
be required to join a redress scheme. I hope that the hon. Member for
Solihull is reassured about the drafting of the clause.</div>
					<a name="0704254000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon. Friend the Member for
Ealing, North raised the issue of fly-boarding, which is the practice
of putting up false &#147;for sale&#148; or &#147;sold&#148;
boards, to represent to consumers that an estate agent has more
properties on the books than is actually the case. &#147;For
sale&#148; boards must comply with the Town and Country Planning
(Control of Advertisements) Regulations 1992. Fly-boarding can be
addressed under the Trade Description Act 1968 and the Control of
Misleading Advertisements Regulations 1988. Abuse of that type appears
to have fallen considerably. I shall come back to that in a
moment.</div>
					<a name="0704254000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">As a
consequence of enforcement interventions by the OFT and local authority
trading standards services, many more estate agents are signing up the
relevant parts of the ombudsman&#146;s code of practice for estate
agents, which forbids fly-boarding. The OFT took action against
fly-boarding in 2004 against a company called Mankind Property
Services, trading as Bairstow Eves Countrywide. Its new office in New
Cross, London, had to give written undertakings not to erect false
&#147;for sale&#148; boards in contravention of the Control of
Misleading Advertisements Regulations 1988. Fly-boarding is to some
extent self-policing, as complaints are usually made by rival estate
agents who have a knowledge of the local market and spot false sale
boards. That is the background to the issue, but it does not help my
hon. Friend with his complaint.</div>
					<a name="0704254000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Office of Fair Trading
recommended that agents should be required to identify the specific
property in question on their sale boards. That was not proposed in the
Bill, because we needed to consider compatibility with the unfair
commercial practices directive, which was not completed at that point.
Although abuses of that sort are half folly, I take this recommendation
seriously, and I assure my hon. Friend that the OFT, my team that will
be established to implement the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column163" />Column number: 163</div>legislation and the team that is currently in place to implement the
unfair commercial practices directive will be brought together to have
a meeting to consider what more can be done to resolve the issue.
Without prejudice, I hope to try to have that discussion before we next
meet on the Floor of the House when the Bill is considered on Report. I
cannot guarantee that, but I will try to do so and report back to the
Committee on the discussions
held.</div>
					
					<a name="0704254000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="0704254000458"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Mark Prisk</b> (Hertford and Stortford) (Con): I am sure that
the Committee welcomes the Minister&#146;s comments. Does he intend
to ensure that the principal trade bodies or professional organisations
involved in the industry are at least consulted before that meeting so
that it might be informed by the views of the principal representative
practitioners, or will he do that after the
meeting?</div>
					
					<a name="0704254000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0704254000459"></a>Mr.
McCartney:
						</b> First, the OFT has already consulted on the
issue, which is why it has made its recommendations. I am simply saying
that I take the issue seriously, and I take it even more seriously when
the OFT has already considered the matter. We could not deal with the
issue when drafting the Bill, because of the formulation of the unfair
commercial practice directive. I am simply suggesting that I bring the
parties together and then come back to the Committee and inform it
about what was said. I hope to do so before the Bill is considered on
Report, but if that is not feasible, I will have to say that I was
unable resolve the issue at that stage. If I can do something, I would
rather get it right than just try to curry favour with people. I
reassure my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, North that, having taken
his point seriously, I will try to do something about
it.</div>
					
					<a name="0704254000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="0704254000460"></a>
							<b class="B">Stephen
Pound</b> (Ealing, North) (Lab): My right hon. Friend has an
enviable reputation for rapid action, but he has surpassed even his own
high standards today. I thank him most sincerely for that&#151;on
behalf of not myself, but my constituents and other hon. Members who
have raised that concern. We will look with great interest to the
statement that will be made on the Floor of the House; but in the
meantime, I thank my right hon. Friend for his prompt and positive
action.</div>
					
					<a name="0704254000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0704254000461"></a>Mr.
McCartney:
						</b> I thank my hon. Friend for his kind remarks. I
cannot definitely commit myself to dealing with the issue on Report,
but I will try my best to do so. However, hon. Members should rest
assured that, whether it is done on Report or at another time, I will
come back with a substantive reply to the Committee, and if that has to
be in writing, so be it. Given that the OFT has already done the work
on the issue, I hope that we can consider it and find a way forward. I
hope that the hon. Member for Solihull can accept my explanations and
will withdraw her amendment, but I will wait to find out whether she is
happy with what I have
said.</div>
					
					<a name="0704254000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="0704254000462"></a>
							<b class="B">Lorely
Burt</b> (Solihull) (LD): I am very interested and somewhat
reassured by what the Minister has said. He talks about exceptions that
would justify the retention of the word &#147;may&#148;. I am
sufficiently reassured by him saying that the intention is that the
word &#147;shall&#148; will be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column164" />Column number: 164</div>used. I am extremely pleased that the debate has given an opportunity
for the hon. Member for Ealing, North to air a concern that I am sure
is common to all hon. Members. I, too, look forward to hearing the
results of taking the issue forward. On that basis, I beg to ask leave
to withdraw the
amendment.</div>

Kramer:
						</b> I gather that I may have been sorely missed,
because my hon. Friend the Member for Solihull was so effective. I am
providing a little relief for her by moving the amendment.
AmendmentsNos. 24 and 25 must be read together, otherwise
neither makes any sense. They raise, once again, two issues that were
touched upon under clause 2, and which willbe raised in
relation to other amendments that will be proposed later in the
discussion. They are crucial to the Bill&#146;s character, to provide
proper protection for consumers, and they address schedule 6.</div>
					<a name="0704254000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">Proposed new section 23A in
schedule 6(2) currently
reads:</div>
					<a name="0704254000403"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Secretary of State may by order require persons who engage in estate
agency work in relation to residential property (&#147;relevant
estate agency work&#148;) to be members of an approved redress scheme
for dealing with
complaints.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0704254000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">We would
change that with these two amendments, so that it would
read:</div>
					<a name="0704254000404"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Secretary of State may by order require persons</div>
					<a name="0704254000405"></a><div class="hs_brev">
						(a) who engage in
estate agency work in relation to residential property
;</div>
					<a name="0704254000406"></a><div class="hs_brev">
						(b)
developing and directly selling residential property to members of the
public.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0704254000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">There would also
be a paragraph (c), which I will go into in just a second.</div>
					<a name="0704254000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph (b) clearly deals with
developers who are selling either directly, off-plan, or whatever else,
who are not covered under the existing language. We feel that that is a
huge loophole and that developers are not held accountable under the
same kind of redress requirements that apply to an independent estate
agent. Indeed, there is nothing to say, because there are so many forms
by which people can set themselves up to sell residential property,
that a developer could not use individuals, such as those who could
form, for example, a casual estate agency, to sell that property
off-plan.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column165" />Column number: 165</div>
					<a name="0704254000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">We think that there is a huge
loophole and that this is a great opportunity to tackle it. More and
more people are buying from developers, particularly as we rely more on
new builds for opportunities to move.One has only to look out
of the window in Londonto be aware of how widespread is the
engagement of developers in producing new homes for the market. Not to
have that covered by the Bill strikes me as an incredible
failure.</div>
					<a name="0704254000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph (c)
is probably even more important. It would draw into the redress scheme
those</div>
					<a name="0704254000407"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;facilitating
temporary periods of residence to members of the public at residential
property not owned by those members of the
public.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0704254000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those are
cumbersome words, but we all know that that is the language of letting.
Again, that is an attempt to bring letting into the scheme. The
Minister willbe aware that the letting industry is huge; it is
worth &#163;12 billion a year. I believe that the Minister accepted
on Second Reading that those who rent are often among the most
vulnerable in our communities. Under the Bill, they are offered the
least protection. Again, I will not reiterate what we have discussed,
but Shelter has examples of case studies of individuals being charged
&#163;300 just to get information on a potential let, when the only
work put in by the agency was a phone call to either side. People are
trapped and suffer real abuse. Many estate agents handle both sales and
lettings, so, again, it is relevant for the Bill to cover both sides of
what they do.</div>
					<a name="0704254000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are
conscious that the Government are putting in place a temporary deposit
protection scheme, but that does not cover many of the disputes that
surround lettings in the broader sense. We also understand that, on
Second Reading, the Minister said that a review was in hand. This is
something that the Office of Fair Trading did not consider when it
looked at the world of estate agents and it is something that was under
review. It was said that, in a couple of years, something might come
forward. It seems to me that this is obvious and straightforward. We
know that there are sometimes20 years between Bills that
address real estate issues, so why not use this opportunity to put in
place language to protect the most vulnerable? These two amendments
provide an opportunity to do
that.</div>

					<div class="Column"><a name="Column166" />Column number: 166</div>
					<a name="0704254000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would not necessarily call that
the language of residential lettings, although I think that I know
where the hon. Lady is heading with it. The reference to
&#147;periods&#148; in that context seems peculiar, and I think
that it is the idea of leasehold interests that is intended. Therefore,
my problem with the wording as it stands is that I am not clear whether
it makes any sense, either in or out of context.</div>
					<a name="0704254000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">The proposal seeks to amend this
Bill rather than address the source of the definition of estate agency
work, which lies in section 1 of the original Estate Agents Act 1979.
An estate agent is defined as being a person who stands between the
house purchaser and the vendor, and so the question is how the
legislative definition can amend or complement that concept of estate
agent as intermediary. I am not clear as to whether these amendments
achieve that, which is why I have serious reservations about them. The
aim is right, and I strongly support it. We have a 28-year-old
definition that clearly needs to be modernised, but, sadly, the
drafting falls short of the mark.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0704254000469"></a>Mr.
McCartney:
						</b> Before I deal with the amendments and my
reasons for, unsurprisingly, rejecting them, I will deal with the two
general points made as part of the overall case put by the hon. Member
for Richmond Park.</div>
					<a name="0704254000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
first general point was on letting agents, who are subject to different
regulations from estate agents. They are governed by the Accommodation
Agencies Act 1953, which makes it illegal for agents to charge
prospective tenants for lists, addresses or details of properties that
they have in their possession. I think that that was the point the hon.
Lady was making. European legislation on unfair consumer contracts and
unfair commercial practices also applies to this area. I will write to
the hon. Lady and to hon. Members on how that will happen in
practice.</div>
					<a name="0704254000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">On property
developers who act as independent estate agents, any person doing
estate agency work, as defined by section 1 of the 1979 Act, will be
caught by the redress provisions. They do not have to call themselves
estate agents; it is what they do that matters. That is an important
point of clarification for thehon.
Lady.</div>
					<a name="0704254000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments Nos.
24 and 25 seek to extend the redress provisions beyond estate agency
work to include lettings work and the sale of new-build properties. To
be fair, the hon. Lady is being consistent. Identical amendments were
tabled by the Liberal Democrats in another place, and they received no
support there&#151;probably not just because of the
Government&#146;s position, which I will come to in a moment, but
because, as the hon. Member for Hertford and Stortford (Mr.
Prisk) said, even if one agrees with their principle, they are
seriously flawed in
structure.</div>
					<a name="0704254000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I said,
letting agents are subject to different regulations from estate agents,
namely the Accommodation Agencies Act 1953. The Government have already
taken action to improve the rights of tenants. The tenancy deposit
scheme that came into force at the beginning of April deals with one of
the main causes of concern for tenants: their deposits being withheld
unfairly by landlords or their agents. Landlords have the choice of
three schemes, but they 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column167" />Column number: 167</div>must join one. For the first time, all tenants who keep their property
in good condition will have the reassurance of knowing that they can
get their deposit back. Tenants who have problems securing repayment
will have access to a free dispute-resolution service under the deposit
scheme.</div>
					<a name="0704254000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">In addition,
the Government are acting to protect the most vulnerable members of
society from exploitation. The Housing Act 2004 requires the mandatory
licensing of high-risk houses in multiple occupation. Therefore,
private landlords who manage homes in multiple occupation of three
storeys or more, or occupied by five people or more who form more than
one household, will require a licence from the local authority.
Furthermore, the local authority will have the discretion to extend
licensing to other categories of multiple occupation homes to address
particular management problems that may exist in such properties. The
Government are aware of the concerns of the quality standards of
newly-built homes. That was one of the issues that was addressed by
Kate Barker in a review of the issues underlying the supply of housing
in the United Kingdom. Her report, published in 2004, recommended that
the house building industry did not demonstrate increased levels of
customer satisfaction. By 2007, the OFT should conduct a wide-ranging
review of whether the market for new housing was working well for
consumers.</div>
					<a name="0704254000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
extremely disappointing that the House Builders Federation has not
responded to Kate Barker&#146;s call to put in place a code of
practice governing new house sales. I asked the OFT to look into the
market. I have been reassured that it is aware of Parliament&#146;s
concerns, and of the debates that we had on Second Reading and since,
and that it is keeping open the option of a market study, and currently
assessing the industry&#146;s response. If the OFT does not look at
that, I give the Committee the assurance that we will.</div>
					<a name="0704254000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">I say to the hon. Members have
spoken today that they need to look carefully at the issues on this
matter, and assess whether further action is needed. I want those
issues to be resolved, which is why I have prompted a Government review
of the wide property market, after consulting the Minister for Housing
and Planning, my hon. Friend the Member for Pontefract and Castleford.
The review will look at regulation and redress across the whole
property sector, including lettings. It does not make sense to look at
one area in isolation. We need to look at the whole story to ensure
that if we take measures in one place, that does not disadvantage the
market in the long term for consumers. Simply extending the regulation
in stages to agents and property developers without further thought is
just plain sloppy. We should apply some intelligent thought to what is
appropriate to each area, and co-ordinate it. On the plan to start the
work in the summer, officials are in the process of drawing up terms of
reference for the work, and are looking at the timescales. We need to
target the review into areas where gaps remain in the redress
provisions for consumers, although there are sure to be significant
areas of consumer detriment. Debates in the House and in another place
have already identified issues of particular concern, which will be
addressed by the review, including all comments made about the Bill in
another place and on the Floor of the House. I have 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column168" />Column number: 168</div>accepted that there is evidence of concern and have sought to meet that
with the officials dealing with the review.</div>
					<a name="0704254000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill is not the place to
make changes. Part 3 of the Bill amends the Estate Agents Act 1979,
which does not cover lettings. Detailed work will need to be done to
ensure that all the sections of the Estate Agents Act and secondary
legislation made under the Act work better for letting agents and
property developers. The Act&#146;s scope is limited specifically to
the buying and selling of land, which is clear from the fundamental
definition contained within the Act, such as &#147;interest in
land&#148; and the duties owed by estate agents, such as information
to be given to clients.</div>
					<a name="0704254000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">Moreover, the Bill implements
the recommendations made by the OFT in its report on the estate agency
market in England and Wales. That report did not look at the lettings
market, or at the market for new-build properties. We have no clear
evidence base on which to take action at this stage. Although those
markets are closely related, there are significant differences between
them, and we need to take that into account in terms of any proposals
that we bring forward to the House at a later date. It is also
important that we consult properly with industry and stakeholders. I am
sure that we agree that if the Government are to take action, it should
be based on evidence and, hopefully, a common approach to dealing with
the issues that the hon. Member for Richmond Park raised and with which
I have total empathy and understanding. I am not trying to put off the
date, or avoid the need to do something; I think that we should do it
in a more effective and comprehensive way, and the Bill is not the
place to do that. I hope, with those assurances, that the hon. Lady
will withdraw her amendments. If she presses them to a vote, I will ask
my colleagues to reject
them.</div>

							<a name="0704254000470"></a>Susan
Kramer:
						</b> First, I thank the Minister for the assurances
that he has just given us, because he has very much strengthened the
comments that he made on Second Reading, which is greatly appreciated.
What we want to see is a solution to problems, rather than to engage
into any kind of grandstanding on the issues. Although I concede that
the words that are used in the amendment are rather inelegant, the
solution is actually quite elegant. It would have brought those bodies
into the redress scheme with relatively minimal effort. There is no use
crying over spilt milk by saying that lettings and direct sales were
not brought into the concept of the Act from the beginning, which would
obviously have been the easiest course of action for everybody and
brought about a remedy
sooner.</div>
					<a name="0704254000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">Based on the
Minister&#146;s assurances, we shall not press the amendment to a
Division. We look forward to the work that I understand will be started
in the summer either under the auspices of the OFT or directly by the
Government. I look forward even more eagerly to the action that will
flow from it&#151;not just a review but actual action to deal with
potential abuses. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div>

							<a name="0704254000473"></a>Mr.
Prisk:
						</b> Amendment No. 41 is a fairly simple probing
amendment that is intended to ensure that a code of practice has been
approved by the OFT in accordance with the criteria set out. Will the
Minister clarify the circumstances in which the OFT might wish not to
approve a
scheme?</div>
					<a name="0704254000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
42 is a different matter altogether. The purpose behind it is to
establish the case for a single code of practice. Consumers need
clarity and simplicity whenever possible, particularly when they are
seeking redress. We discussed that earlier in our deliberations. The
more uncertainty or complexity, the fewer people will seek, let alone
secure, reasonable redress for their
grievances.</div>
					<a name="0704254000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
discussing redress schemes and ombudsman schemes we have had a lot of
discussion about whether there should be one scheme or more. The
problem is that if there were one, it would mean scrapping several
established schemes. There is already more than one ombudsman in the
market, with one in England, one in Scotland and so on. However, what
really matters to home buyers is that the principles upon which those
schemes are based remain either very similar or preferably the same.
That is the principle behind the amendment&#151;to have one code of
practice. There might be several ombudsman schemes, as there are now,
but they would be based on one clear code. In those circumstances,
consumers would be much better placed to understand what would happen
and they would therefore have much greater confidence in the
system.</div>
					<a name="0704254000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government
argued in another place that best practice could be achieved if several
codes existed, but there is no reason why the best codes that are out
in the public domain could not be drawn together in a single code.
After all, the perspective to consider is not that of the agent, the
legislator or the ombudsman. It should be that of the home buyer or
home seller. Having several different codes of practice, and several
different schemes drawing from them, could lead to considerable
confusion and might lower, or at least not help, consumer confidence
about how the redress schemes will work. Because we support the redress
schemes, we want to ensure that the public have the maximum confidence
and understanding of the basis upon which they operate and therefore
exactly what they are entitled to
expect.</div>
					<a name="0704254000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">To put my
question to the Minister simply, how will consumers benefit from there
being more than one code of
practice?</div>
					
					<a name="0704254000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0704254000474"></a>Mr.
McCartney:
						</b> First, I accept that the amendments are
probing; indeed, they were tabled in Grand Committee in another place
by Baroness Wilcox and Lord De Mauley. My noble Friend the
Parliamentary Under-Secretary explained the effect of
the amendments, and I shall do so again to set out the arguments for
resisting them.</div>
					<a name="0704254000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">The OFT
will not approve a scheme that does not meet the criteria set out in
the Bill. It will also be able to publish guidance about how it will
interpret those 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column170" />Column number: 170</div>criteria, so whether or not there is more than one scheme or code of
practice, it is certain that schemes will be able to operate
effectively only if they reach the standards required by the
regulator.</div>
					<a name="0704254000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">I wish to
explain why I do not support the intention behind the
amendments&#151;to require the Government to design a single code of
practice that all redress schemes would use to judge the conduct of
estate agents. I accept that the intended effect of such a code is to
introduce compulsory minimum standards. We have already extensively
debated more explicit attempts to introduce positive licensing, so I
shall not coverthat ground again. Indeed, we covered a lot of
it this morning, when we spoke a lot about what the standards would
look like if a scheme was approved and about what they should
cover.</div>
					
					<a name="0704254000425"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.30
pm</div>
					<a name="0704254000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">I know that this
is not the intention, but the amendments could weaken the Bill by
creating uncertainty about which code was being referred to. The hon.
Member for Hertford and Stortford might come back and say, &#147;We
want a single code so that there isn&#146;t any uncertainty,&#148;
and he might think that the words in the amendments are plain, but I
shall explain what I mean in a moment.</div>
					<a name="0704254000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">As drafted, the Bill allows an
ombudsman to refer to a range of industry guidance documents in coming
to a view about the grounds on which a complaint can be made and what
standards of behaviour can reasonably be expected in the industry. In
previous discussions, we said that the redress scheme covered not only
serious complaints&#151;even up to those that could require criminal
prosecutions&#151;but complaints about general issues, which might
look small on the face of it, but which might involve issues that were
very disruptive to the individual&#146;s attempts to buy and sell
property. Schemes have therefore been designed to take into account not
only breaches of the law per se, but poor practice that arises when
services are provided to the consumer. We are trying to maximise the
opportunities for the ombudsman to look at the grounds for a complaint
to see whether the consumer&#146;s expectations of the estate agent
they are complaining about are reasonable.</div>
					<a name="0704254000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">A number of industry bodies have
their own codesof practice or similar documents. The
ombudsmanfor estate agents, the National Association of Estate
Agents and the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, of which the
hon. Member for Hertford and Stortford is, I think, a member, all have
codes of practice or rules of conduct, which they expect their members
to follow. We see no reason for an ombudsman to look only at one code
or for the Government to tell industry which code estate agents should
follow and which should fall by the wayside. It is for the regulator to
determine such matters.</div>
					<a name="0704254000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">At the same time, estate agents
know that they will risk claims being made against them if they fail to
comply with good practice in a general sense and not just as prescribed
in one document. That goes back to the point that I made in one of our
debates about dealing not only with serious complaints, but with the
estate agent&#146;s general conduct towards the client. It is
important to bear in mind that a general sense of good practice cannot
be laid down in a single document, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column171" />Column number: 171</div>because it goes across a whole array of activities carried out by estate
agents and their staff.</div>
					<a name="0704254000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is also important to note
that the present drafting future-proofs the Bill against future
developments. We have had quite a lot of good debates, including this
morning, about ensuring that legislation can cope in a fast-changing
market place and that changes can be made to secure and maintain
consumers&#146; rights. We are attempting to ensure that potential
changes do not make the legislation redundant or out of date or prevent
it from quickly transmitting changes in the marketplace to protect the
consumer&#146;s interests. Best practice will develop, and new
guidance and codes will emerge over future years. It is therefore
important not to tie the ombudsman&#146;s hands to a document that
will inevitably become out of date.</div>
					<a name="0704254000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill&#146;s drafting
contains some sophistication to deal with a varied approach to
assessing complaints, but the amendments would remove that
sophistication. Our approach builds on current practice in the
industry, and will ensure, with the approval of high-quality schemes,
that consumers have redress for complaints against estate agents who
fail to comply with good practice in a general and a specific
sense.</div>
					<a name="0704254000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">With that
explanation, I hope that the hon. Member for Hertford and Stortford can
accept that we are trying genuinely to meet his objective of ensuring
that we have certainty about the high standards in the codes of
practice.</div>
					
					<a name="0704254000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0704254000475"></a>Mr.
Prisk:
						</b> The Minister has put forward two central arguments.
One is that it is better to have a general code or a range of different
documentation against which business may or may not be held to account
and that knowledge of such expectations about general conduct is more
likely to raise standards. That may be the natural perspective from the
Government&#146;s point of view, and I understand the belief behind
it&#151;it may be proved to be true&#151;but there is a difficulty.
A lot of smaller businesses&#151;most agencies, particularly the
law-abiding ones that are trying to do the right thing, are smaller
businesses&#151;will be anxious to ensure that they are crystal clear
about their obligations. If they cannot identify the things that they
are required to achieve by consulting a single source, there is a
weakness in the suggestion that they will know what their obligations
are.</div>
					<a name="0704254000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">The difficulty is
that there are two different perspectives. The one of Whitehall is
understandable; it looks down at the market and says, &#147;We want
to encourage this general conduct and it is advantageous to have
available to us the option of a range of different documents and
rules.&#148; However, I am keen to ensure that the majority of
businesses in the market understand what is required of them.
Preferably, they should be able to find that out from a single
source&#151;its information might come from a range of
contributors&#151;so that they know where they stand and what is
expected of them. Then they will also know that if they are held to
account they will be able to demonstrate what they have done correctly.
The lack of clarity worries me.</div>
					<a name="0704254000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">The future-proofing element has
some merit, given the way in which the Bill is drafted. I would have
preferred to see in the first instance a set of schemes 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column172" />Column number: 172</div>that are based on the fact that there is currently a range of redress
schemes, but which have the potential to be based on one. The
legislation could make it possible to base the process on a common set
of standards so that the industry knows where it stands and so does the
house buyer or seller.</div>
					<a name="0704254000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister has done his best
to put the Government&#146;s view. I think that he and I have the
same end aim, but I am not convinced that he has addressed my concerns,
so I wish to press amendment No. 42 toa vote.</div>

						Amendment No.
26 seeks to increase the maximum fine from the Government&#146;s
suggested amount of &#163;1,000 to &#163;10,000. It is noteworthy
and commendable that the Government have already moved from a
&#163;500 amount, which was originally suggested in another place.
However, we are discussing the maximum fine that can be imposed; it is
not the usual fine. We are seeking to put a benchmark so that, where
there are companies serially infringing, occasion after occasion, the
amount of the fine can escalate to ensure that it is effective in its
intention, which is to guarantee that an organisation is part of a
redress scheme.</div>
					<a name="0704254000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
would like to ensure that, although the usual fine will not necessarily
be &#163;10,000, there will at least be the ability to raise the fine
against vexatious organisations, to make sure that the fine really
bites on those organisations.</div>
					<a name="0704254000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 27, which was
tabled by the Conservatives, seeks to raise the amount from
&#163;1,000 to &#163;3,000. I must confess that I am slightly

Suffice it to say that the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats feel
that the maximum fine is not sufficient and &#163;1,000 will not do
the job as a maximum fine when there is a serial offender.</div>
					<a name="0704254000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would like to speak briefly
about amendmentNo. 28, which was also tabled by the Tories. It
relates to the powers of the director general of the Office of Fair
Trading to fine rogue estate agents. As I understand it, the statutory
maximum fine at the moment is &#163;5,000 and the amendment would
raise it to &#163;10,000. However, as I understand it, by putting a
figure on the amount primary legislation would be needed to ensure that
it keeps up with inflation.</div>

							<a name="0704254000507"></a>Stephen

						</b> I am grateful, as ever, to the hon. Lady. Could she

No. 26. The 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column174" />Column number: 174</div>wording in the Bill says &#147;not exceeding &#163;1,000&#148;.
She is proposing to delete &#147;&#163;1,000&#148; and insert
&#147;&#163;10,000&#148;. Thus, is she proposing that it should
say &#147;not exceeding &#163;10,000&#148;, on the basis that the
fine could be six pence halfpenny, or &#163;100, or any sum? Is she
proposing the same wording, &#147;not
exceeding&#148;?</div>

clarify that, in amendment No. 26, that is the wording that we are
seeking to include&#151;&#147;not exceeding &#163;10,000&#148;.
That would give sufficient leeway for on-the-spot fines to relate to
the seriousness of the offence, unlike amendment No. 28, which was
tabled by the Conservatives. While we believe that it is important to
have large possible fines for rogue estate agents, there may come a
point when flexibility is required. As circumstances change and as
inflation may or not increase, depending on which Government we end up
with after the next general election, primary legislation may be needed
to keep up with this. We are not minded to support amendment No. 28. We
feel that &#163;10,000 is the appropriate maximum amount which will
give plenty of leeway to make an appropriate fine to levy on individual
companies who are not members of the redress
scheme.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0704254000509"></a>Mr.
Prisk:
						</b> The three amendments relate to fines, but in
different circumstances. That is the point to bear in mind. One set of
fines relates to breaches of the rules of the redress schemes, which
come under this part of the Bill, and one fine&#151;the
&#163;10,000 in amendmentNo. 28&#151;relates to breaches
under the OFT&#146;s powers, which is a separate point. I hope that
that clarifies the matter because it can be
confusing.</div>
					<a name="0704254000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 27 would increase the limit for the fine for not being part of the
redress scheme to &#163;3,000. The Government propose that every
estate agent, or everyone training an estate agent, must be part of
such a scheme. The Government&#146;s desire to require agents to
belong to the scheme is very welcome. We strongly support it. However,
the fine that was originally proposed was just &#163;500. That is
inadequate. In the other place it was increased to &#163;1,000
following an amendment by Lord Dubs, a Labour peer. The Government
accepted that after some debate.</div>
					<a name="0704254000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given that the average estate
agent&#146;s fee is now &#163;3,000&#151;obviously in London and
the south-east it will be higher than that&#151;we feel that the fine
of &#163;1,000 is still inadequate. It needs to be higher. If the
Bill is to send the right signal to that minority who give estate
agency a bad name and who flout the rules, it needs to focus their
minds on the fact that if they breach the redress proposals they will
be fined an amount that they will notice. That is why we propose a fine
of &#163;3,000.</div>
					<a name="0704254000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">What
is the &#163;10,000 about? Amendment No. 28 would impose a large,
maximum fine for those people who have been found to have flouted the
laws under section 3 of the Estates Agents Act 1979, which the Bill
seeks to amend. As the hon. Member for Solihull pointed out, the fine
is currently &#163;5,000. Section 3 of the Act provides the OFT with
the ability to prohibit someone from trading as an estate agent. The
procedure that the director-general of the OFT follows 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column175" />Column number: 175</div>is quite clear and includes a number of investigation and warning
points. It is therefore separate from the issue of redress
schemes.</div>
					<a name="0704254000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">All hon.
Members will be aware of some of the appalling cases of rogue estate
agents who have cheated the public in a number of different ways over
the years. They are, of course, a minority, but their activities have
resulted in people being robbed of savings, being caused considerable
heartache and, in many cases, being subject to serious financial loss.
Recently the media have highlighted a number of different cases, and we
saw them on &#147;Panorama&#148;. The <i class="I">Evening Standard</i> has
also been vigilant in highlighting a series of cases where people have
been cheated and where practices have been completely
unacceptable.</div>
					<a name="0704254000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
clear that the OFT&#146;s powers need strengthening and that a clear
signal must be sent that rogue agents will be barred and face financial
penalties. As we know, the Government are proposing limited increases
in the OFT&#146;s and trading standards officers&#146; powers. That
is fine, but it will not necessarily be noticed by the real rogues,
given that, as I said, the average estate agent&#146;s fee is
&#163;3,000.</div>

fear from this because&#151;remember&#151;the fine would come only
when someone found to have broken the rules has been investigated by
the OFT and barred from trading as an estate agent. We argue that point
because the kind of person who becomes a rogue estate agent is,
frankly, also the kind of person who, having been barred by the
director-general of the OFT, will go on to be a rogue car dealer,
plumber or whatever it may
be.</div>

purported to be a rogue estate agent. The scenario that he is talking

the qualification procedures that we discussed. It is not an issue of
confidence, but of ethics, as I said. I think, therefore, that we need
to send them the clearest financial signal that if they are found
guilty by the director-general, in the way that I have described, not
only will they be barred from estate agency, but they will pay a fine
that they will note. I hope that that would then prove to be a
deterrent and encourage many of them not to trade in the industry. As I
said, it is important that they be barred, which is the case under
rules that the Government have in law. However, it is just as important
that we hit them where it really hurts&#151;the

							<b class="B">Mr.
Ben Wallace</b> (Lancaster and Wyre) (Con): I want
clarification on the penalty notices. Will they have the same effect as
we have seen elsewhere? One of the problems is often the record-keeping
of the officers or those who give them out. Certainly, we have seen
that in the police environment: people have been given them for
shoplifting, but that has not always been recorded, so the details on
some serial offenders have not been stored or logged and they have not
been traced. Perhaps I missed it&#151;I am sure that I
have&#151;but will schedule 6 provide that persons in receipt of a
notice are logged with an authority or passed on to the OFT, so that
they can be traced if, for example, they move from an area covered by a
trading standard office in London and set up shop in Lancashire? That
is important if people are to have faith in the penalty notice
system.</div>
					
					<a name="0704254000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0704254000519"></a>Mr.
McCartney:
						</b> This has been an interesting little debate.
Mirror, mirror on the wall, who&#146;s the toughest of them all? The
Liberal Democrats and the Conservatives are vying over who really is
the friend of the consumer and, as a consequence, saying that the
Government are soft. Let us remind people that this is the first
Government ever to take action in this sector. We have introduced
redress, which, as it currently stands, is established for the scheme
at up to &#163;25,000; access and new powers for the OFT and for
trading standards officers, including the ability to prevent companies
and their employees from working in the sector; and the ability and
capacity of the OFT working on the ground with trading standards
officers to take immediate action when they receive a complaint. We are
discussing a not inconsiderable resource for the
consumer.</div>
					<a name="0704254000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the hon.
Member for Hertford and Stortford said, one amendment deals with the
failure to join a redress scheme, and another deals with banning orders
and failure to comply with a banning order. Let us remember that a
banning order is issued when someone 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column177" />Column number: 177</div>has committed a serious offence, perhaps even a criminal offence, and at
that point action has already been taken. I shall return to why that is
important.</div>
					<a name="0704254000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
Nos. 26 and 27 focus on the level of the penalty charge, but the charge
is not the full enforcement story. We must not get penalty charges out
of proportion. They are a trigger point for far tougher potential
sanctions. Ultimately, estate agents face the prospect of being banned
by the OFT, following an investigation, as a result of not belonging to
a redress scheme. That is a very serious sanction, and, to most estate
agents, that deterrent will be worth far more than &#163;3,000 or
&#163;10,000. It will mean the total loss of their business, revenue
and livelihood.</div>
					<a name="0704254000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
penalty charge is a quick and simple deterrent that gives local
authority trading standards officers a quick and simple sanction
against estate agents who arenot members of a redress scheme.
It is important to remember that the &#163;1,000 charge can be
repeated again and again&#151;it is not a one-off charge. It is an
incentive, is it not? If someone wants to snub their nose at the
consumer or at a law designed to clean up the activities of people in
this sector, it will be a very expensive operation indeed. Not only
will they have a financial loss again and again, but they could lose
their capacity to operate as a
business.</div>
					<a name="0704254000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">The penalty
charge can be repeated every day, if necessary. Let me give an example.
If someone makesa complaint to a trading standards officer, it
is immediately logged. If it is found that the estate agent is not a
member of a redress scheme, they will face a potential fine of
&#163;1,000. No doubt they will be informed that they are in breach
of the law and that they should get themselves registered. If the
trading standards officer checks the following day&#151;they will be
able to identify when the agent has registered&#151;and the agent
still has not registered, another &#163;1,000 can be charged. The
trading standards officer cannot vary the amount. They cannot say,
&#147;I will give you a second chance this time and fine you only
&#163;500.&#148; That will not happen. The fine will be
&#163;1,000, &#163;1,000, &#163;1,000. It will be repeated and
repeated, if
necessary.</div>
					<a name="0704254000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">Hon. Members
have not realised the potential ofthe fine. If a trading
standards officer is faced with a blatant and continuing breach, he can
inflict a considerable financial penalty, but, crucially, it is left to
trading standards officers to use their judgment and discretion in the
light of the
circumstances.</div>
					<a name="0704254000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
expected that the penalty will be higher than the cost of membership of
an approved scheme. Let me explain the process in a bit more detail.
When an estate agent is found to be in breach of their duty to belong
to an approved redress scheme, the trading standards officer may issue
them with a penalty charge, currently laid out in the regulations at
&#163;1,000. Should the agent fail to join an approved scheme
quickly, the trading standards officer can continue to issue penalty
charges. At the same time, the trading standards officer will be under
a duty&#151;this goes back to the point that the hon. Member for
Lancaster and Wyre rightly made about whether there is an audit trail;
this is just as important&#151;to inform the OFT about any estate
agent who is not a member of a redress scheme. If an estate agent
continues not to belong to a scheme, the OFT 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column178" />Column number: 178</div>will be able to consider the fitness of the estate agent to practise and
will be able to issue a warning order, which could ultimately be
followed by banning the agent from practising. In sufficiently serious
cases, the OFT could bypass the warning order process and decide to go
straight to banning the
agent.</div>
				
					
					<a name="0704254000427"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5
pm</div>
					<a name="0704254000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Committee
can begin to see the story; it is more than just a matter of
&#163;1,000. Any estate agent, individually or collectively, who
decides not to comply is a loser from the moment it takes that
decision, anda complete loser if it continues not to comply.
In addition, under the Enterprise Act enforcers can take action such as
seeking injunctions from the High Court against estate agents
prohibiting infringements under the Estate Agents Act. Therefore, the
penalty charge itself is only part of the process, which is why we
should not over-exaggerate the importance of the figure, despite what I
said about it being charged time and again, if
necessary.</div>
					<a name="0704254000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
many advantages to having a quick and simple sanction, issued with
minimum bureaucracy, but it also has limitations. The benefits offered
by having a simple civil penalty process are greater than those offered
by a penalty charge regime that has a range of fines with a higher
maximum. Case law shows that where high fines can be levied individual
circumstances should be taken into account to ensure that the fine
imposed in a particular case is not excessive&#151;a necessarily more
bureaucratic and time-consuming process. It gives the opportunity for
the rogue elements to string things out and continue in business until
they come before a court. With a &#163;1,000 fine they pay
up&#151;end of story. If they do not pay up, there is another
&#163;1,000 fine. Each time it happens the OFT is notified and it can
order an immediate
ban.</div>

						</b> I am grateful for the Minister&#146;s
clarification of the proposal. I am confident that we are on the road
to solving the problem that I raised.</div>
					<a name="0704254000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">How broad can the OFT be in
naming individuals? We are only too aware, often through watchdog
programmes, that although the salesman may be caught out the directors
of companies stay at arm&#146;s length and may reappear in a new
company. How far can the OFT go in banning individuals or issuing a
penalty charge notice to ensure that those people who take advantage of
new, young salesmen are caught and held to
account?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0704254000521"></a>Mr.
McCartney:
						</b> When you are banned, you are banned. If someone
works for estate agent A, they cannot just pop next door and work for
estate B. They are banned for a specific purpose, because they are not
fit. If the company is closed, it is because it is not fit. It is
important to make that clear and that is why it is such a total loss if
people decide to defy the law and refuse to put into place what is
required by the enforcement officers&#151;the OFT or the trading
standards officer.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0704254000522"></a>Mr.
Wallace:
						</b> I understand what the Minister is saying with
respect to individuals, but directors of companies is a broader matter.
If we are to close down 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column179" />Column number: 179</div>
						on an industry abuse, directors, no matter how far
removed, must have some corporate responsibility. If a company is
closed down, do all the directors have a tag against their names? How
far can that
go?</div>
					
					<a name="0704254000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0704254000523"></a>Mr.
McCartney:
						</b> As the Bill shows, if individuals are culpable
they will have the full letter of the law against them, as will the
organisation concerned. I return to a point that the hon. Gentleman
made at a previous sitting, that other legislation comes into play if
directors are operating a business in an unfit way. The hon. Gentleman
does not want a junior member of staff to carry the can and I agree
with him. There was a television programme a few months ago in which an
estate agent&#151;I will not mention any names, but I think we all
know who it is&#151;was exposed for very dodgy practices, which they
will get done for under this Bill. The excuse was that one rogue
employee was to blame, and he was sacked. In those circumstances the
employee and the employer would have been liable for those breaches
under this Bill and that is critical. We cannot have people using their
power as an employer to make an employee carry out dodgy activities on
their behalf and walk away from it.</div>
					<a name="0704254000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">To be fair, there will be
occasions on which someone is operating in a way that is unacceptable
and there is a breach, and the employer may not know about that. That
is why both situations are covered. Action has to be evidence based. I
hope that that explanation helps the hon. Member for Hertford and
Stortford.</div>
					<a name="0704254000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">&#163;3,000
is not a suitable amount for a trading standards officer to walk in off
the street and levy against an estate agent, and &#163;10,000 even
less so. That sort of levy would appropriately by imposed only by a
court or tribunal where the penalty charge could be varied. This
penalty charge will be the same amount every time&#151;&#163;1,000.
That is already at the high endof the civil penalties scale.
No environmental civil penalties exceed &#163;500, and &#163;1,000
is considerably higher than the &#163;500 referred to in the
Housing Act 2004. The hon. Member for Hertford and Stortford
is right. &#163;5,000 is level 5 under the Magistrates&#146; Courts
Act 1980, I have been reliably informed&#151;not that I have had to
face that myself, by the
way.</div>
					<a name="0704254000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">Following careful
consideration of the arguments, we have already accepted an amendment
to the Bill to increase the maximum level to &#163;1,000, as the hon.
Member for Solihull said, but going any further would be unfair. Let us
remember that the real sanction, after a proper and fair process has
been conducted, is that an estate agent can be banned if found unfit
following non-membership of a redress
scheme.</div>
					<a name="0704254000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
28 is intended to increase to &#163;10,000 the maximum fine that can
be imposed by a magistrate on an estate agent who has breached a
banning order. In my view, if the case is serious enough to warrant a
&#163;10,000 fine, it should be dealt with by the Crown court, where
there is no limit on the fine that can be imposed. If we are talking
about deterrence, that is where deterrence should lie. If the case is
serious enough for a &#163;10,000 fine to be imposed, it should go to
the Crown court, because we are talking about a very serious breach
with that level of
fine.</div>
					<a name="0704254000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment is
technically in the wrong place. I do not say that for clever dick
purposes. It would fit better in clause 55, which relates to
prohibition orders. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column180" />Column number: 180</div>However, the amendment enables me to explain what we
need to do. At the moment, if a person is considered unfit to act as an
estate agent and is banned by the Office of Fair Trading from doing so
but continues to practise, one of two things can happen. They can be
convicted in a magistrates court and required to pay a fine not
exceeding the statutory maximum, which is currently &#163;5,000, so a
&#163;10,000 fine could not be imposed in those circumstances,
because the law sets out that the maximum that can be levied is
&#163;5,000. In more serious cases, defendants are tried in the Crown
court, where they are liable to pay an unlimited fine, so if we are
really looking for a return in these cases, that is where they should
go&#151;the fine is
unlimited.</div>
					<a name="0704254000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">Magistrates
have the power to send a case to the Crown court for sentencing if,
after hearing the evidence, they decide that the offence was so serious
that a higher fine should be imposed than they have the power to
inflict. We are covered in two ways. If a case goes to the magistrates
court and the evidence is such that the magistrates decide that the
level of fine that they have powers to levy is insufficient, they can
send it to the Crown court for sentencing. In my view, the types of
case that the hon. Member for Hertford and Stortford rightly
highlighted should in any event go to the Crown court, where there is
not a &#163;10,000 fine, but an unlimited fine. The Government are
not being soft on the issue&#151;far from
it.</div>
					
					<a name="0704254000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0704254000524"></a>Mr.
Prisk:
						</b> But in the nature of the legislation at the moment,
that is not necessarily an option that is
available.</div>
					
					<a name="0704254000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0704254000525"></a>Mr.
McCartney:
						</b> It is. In all circumstances, it is. Let me
explain what is changing. This takes us back to the debate that we had
earlier about the new powers of access to records and the maintenance
of records. Why is that so important? It provides an audit
trail&#151;an evidence trail&#151;where it is difficult at the
moment for that to happen. If people do not maintain the evidence and
audit trail, that is a breach in itself. So I say to anyone who thinks
that they will be clever enough not to keep the records so that they do
not face a &#163;5,000, &#163;10,000 or unlimited fine,
&#147;Forget it, pal&#148;, as they say where I come from. That is
an offence in itself, which could lead to a banning order for them and
their company. Any attempt to undermine the capacity to represent
fairly both the consumer and the good businesses in this marketplace is
doomed to failure, in my
view.</div>
					<a name="0704254000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am glad that
the amendments were tabled, in that, although I said at the beginning
that there was a competition to see who was the toughest, in reality,
if there is a toughness in this, I hope that I have explained that it
comes from the Government in how we have set this out.</div>
					<a name="0704254000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">I thank hon. Members for their
amendments, and, given the opportunity, I hope to explain that we are
not operating a minimalist approach. The proposal is to put in context
the overall strategy, structure and process to be used by the Office of
Fair Trading on the one hand and trading standards officers on the
other, and their interrelationship as regards issuing on-the-spot
fines, as well as in their dealings with the magistrates court and
higher courts, if required. If we put all those building blocks
together, we will see that our position is
significantly strengthened as regards dealing with rogue estate
agents.</div>

Burt:
						</b> This has been an extremely useful and wide-ranging
debate and, before I go on to speak to our amendment, I wish to comment
on the remarksof the hon. Member for Lancaster and Wyre. The
Minister says that, eventually, a rogue estate agent can be banned, and
that point is accepted. However, the hon. Gentleman raises a good
question about who is covered by that ban. It is important that we have
good, strong legislation in place to deal with directors who are serial
offenders. That reminds me of work that we are considering at the
moment to do with the serial liquidators of small businesses. Not only
are they a pest to the industry, but they have caused the downfall of
many of the small businesses that supply them and of their customers,
who deserve protection. I hope that this will introduce a debate that
we can take forwards.</div>
					<a name="0704254000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for Hertford and
Stortford has proposed his amendment for a &#163;3,000 maximum
penalty, and he rightly says that that represents one deal. For some
deals done in south-east England, that may be less than is appropriate.
The reason why my hon. Friend the Member for Richmond Park (Susan
Kramer) and I put forward the figure of &#163;10,000 is that we feel
that such a sum would be a genuine sanction for a serial
offender.</div>

							<a name="0704254000528"></a>Lorely

						</b> The hon. Member for Ealing, North makes another
valuable point, and I agree. What surprises and interests me about the
figures is how few complaints there are, given the prevalence of what
certain hon. Members in this room and the general public would consider
to be the misleading, inappropriate and downright illegal activities of
some estate agents. I thank him for that.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column182" />Column number: 182</div>
					<a name="0704254000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The Minister
said that this is a quick and simple sanction if an estate agent is not
a member of a redress scheme. I totally endorse those words. However, I
draw his attention to the wording of the Bill, which says that it is
&#147;not exceeding&#148;, so there is no suggestion that
&#163;10,000 would be the standard fine; it is the maximum amount
that could be levied. It gives flexibility so that, if a small estate
agency has not got around to doing the job, you could levy a small
fine; if you are dealing with a large estate agency in the south-east
of England that is a serial offender, then you have the option to levy
a higher fine.</div>

						</b> Can the hon. Lady explain to me, as a consumer,
why, if estate agency A treats me badly and is subject to the
law&#151;but unfortunately for me, this estate agency, unlike estate
agency B, is a small business, even though it has been crooked and has
done me in&#151;because it is a small business, it would not suffer
the detriment that business B would have suffered?</div>
					<a name="0704254000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is where you enter the
complicated world of determining conduct on the basis of size when it
should be determined according to compliance with the requirements of
the redress scheme. You join the redress scheme not on the basis of
whether you are a large or a small company; you join the redress scheme
for the simple reason that, if something goes wrong, the consumer is
protected. The level of protection should not be reduced if you use a
small company. This would put good small companies out of business.
Consumers would go to a large company in case something went wrong.
This would cause a real block in the marketplace. Because a company is
small, it does not follow that it is a bad company. However, when they
do not comply, it is not the size that matters, it is the type of
non-compliance. The rights of the consumer should not depend on the
size of the company.</div>

Burt</b>: The Minister makes an important point that it is not
size that matters in this situation. In some circumstances, I certainly
could not agree with him more. Throughout our discussion today, he has
talked about the need for flexibility. I would certainly endorse that.
In this circumstance, the need for flexibility is nowhere greater than
where there is a range of different organisations; there are very large
ones and very small ones. Therefore, let the punishment fit the crime
and allow the person who is imposing this fine to have that
flexibility. With that, Mr. Weir, my colleague and I wish to
press this to a vote.</div>

						I moved
amendments Nos. 27 and 28. I would liketo go back in order to
address the arguments ofthe Minister. Amendment No. 27 relates
to redress schemes. The principle is the same as that of the Liberal
Democrat amendments. That is, while I fully 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column183" />Column number: 183</div>
						recognise that the &#163;1,000 fine is a fixed
figure and can be levied on a number of occasions and is therefore
effective in that context, I do not think that it addresses the central
point that, in the context of the deals that an agent does each
day&#151;the average is &#163;3,000&#151;&#163;1,000 is a small
figure to many of them. This is in the context of redress schemes. If,
in a morning, an agency practice does six deals, that is
&#163;18,000. If there is a &#163;1,000 fine, some
agents&#151;the rogues about whom we are concerned&#151;will take a
risk assessment in their own minds as to whether it is worth breaching
the rule. I do not approve of that&#151;I totally disapprove of
it&#151;but they will make that calculation. I therefore do not
believe that &#163;1,000 is enough for redress schemes. I am anxious
that &#163;10,000 is too much, but we want to get on to the issue of
rogue agents with banning
orders.</div>

not be sufficient to concentrate the mind of a rogue estate
agent?</div>

							<a name="0704254000535"></a>Mr.

						</b> We are dealing with redress schemes, and although I
feel that &#163;1,000 is probably too small, to leap to
&#163;10,000 for breaching a redress scheme notice seems
disproportionate. As the Minister has made clear, it is a fixed point
rather than a maximum. It would be a maximum under amendment No.
28.</div>

							<a name="0704254000536"></a>Mr.

						</b> The trading standards officers levy a penalty
charge for every case dealt with, and the redress scheme is intended to
be complied with across all customer bases. If there were six, 20 or 30
cases a levy could be imposed in respect of each of them, so it would
be &#163;1,000 multiplied by x number of cases. It would be a very
expensive process for somebody who did not comply. The whole point is
to ensure that they comply. Why? Because if something goes wrong, the
redress scheme protects the consumer in all circumstances. That is why
we want agents to comply, and the scheme provides a really good
incentive. The hon. Member for Hertford and Stortford&#146;s proposal
would create the possibility of a charge of &#163;3,000 multiplied by
30, and under the hon. Member for Solihull&#146;s proposal it could
be &#163;10,000 multiplied by
30.</div>

								Mr.

						</b> I remain of the view that the &#163;1,000 fine
will not achieve the function that we want, of making it crystal clear
that there is a sharp financial deterrent. The figure of &#163;1,000
will be in the rogues&#146; minds; the
						<div class="Column"><a name="Column184" />Column number: 184</div>fact that there are multiple opportunities will not. I feel that
&#163;1,000 is inadequate, and I shall press to a Division amendment
No. 27 on raising that figure to
&#163;3,000.</div>
					<a name="0704254000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 28 relates to banning orders. Again, deterrence is at the heart of
the issue. The Minister rightly said that at the very end of the
process there is the opportunity to go to the High Court, but the
frequency with which that happens is pretty limited. I come back to the
argument about deterrence. The director general of the Office of Fair
Trading has the substantial power to stop one trading as an agent. That
is an important power and one that we support.</div>
					<a name="0704254000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are considering here not the
redress scheme but someone who has got to the point of having a banning
order. As I mentioned earlier, I am concerned here about the kind of
person who then pops up in other vocations&#151;I can put it no more
kindly than that&#151;and is quite prepared to twist the rules. I am
keen to deter such people from coming into the market in the first
place. While the ability to remove them from an industry once they have
broken the rules is important, it would be just as important and
possibly more of a deterrent if we could say to them, &#147;If you
come into this industry and bend the rules and break the practices, not
only will we bar you from this industry, we will fine you
&#163;10,000.&#148; That would be an important message to send, and
it is why I shall also press amendment No. 28 to a

							<a name="0704254000583"></a>Mr.
Prisk:
						</b> I beg to move amendment No. 69, in
clause 59, page 37, line 31, at
end insert&#151;</div>
					<div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;( ) Regulations
in this section may make provision for the exemption of certain service
providers.&#146;.</div>
					<a name="0704254000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that I have not distressed the Minister too much by not moving
amendment No. 68, and I trust that he will be able to use his arguments
on a later date&#151;although, I hope, not on this
clause.</div>
					<a name="0704254000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">The purpose of
probing amendment No. 69, which relates confusingly to clause 59, is to
establish from the Minister the likely provisions of subsequent
statutory instruments and therefore the Government&#146;s intentions.
My understanding is that their intention is to prepare a single set of
regulations for unsolicited and solicited visits. Will the Minister
confirm whether that is the case and say whether current conditions for
unsolicited visits will be changed in the new regulations? Will he also
explain which home trades are likely to be included? He will understand
the sensitivity of that
point.</div>
					<a name="0704254000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think that it
is fair to say that much of the problem centres on the installation of
things such as home improvements or property services&#151;double
glazing, stair lifts and so on. Clearly, a typical visit by a plumber
or electrician is not what we are trying to deal with. Indeed, the
clause could create quite significant problems for more regular visits.
Will the Minister explain how the regulations are intended to work and
how the balance between the rights of consumers and those of tradesmen
will be struck? I am sure that, if we reach the stand part debate, more
detailed points will be made, but I should be grateful if he could
respond to my amendment, which, as I said, is a probing
one.</div>
					
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column186" />Column number: 186</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0704254000584"></a>Mr.
McCartney:
						</b> I shall try and be as detailed as I can,
because, as hon. Members have said, this is a sensitive issue. It is
important that we strike the right balance. Let us be clear: the clause
is a very important step forward for consumer rights, and it deals with
something that has been a cause for concern over many years for trading
standards officers, in particular, and for consumer councils and other
bodies that represent consumer
interests.</div>
					<a name="0704254000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
relates to contracts concluded with consumers in their home or
workplaces&#151;namely, doorstep selling. It gives the Secretary of
State the power to provide for exemptions when he makes regulations
giving consumers the right to cancel a contract entered into during a
solicited visit to a their home or workplace. There is no need for the
clause to be amended to enable exemptions to be made in doorstep
selling regulations, because clause 60(3) will do that already by
providing that regulations under the Bill may apply generally, or be
subject to exceptions, and may make different provisions for different
cases.</div>
					<a name="0704254000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">We will consult
on the draft doorstep selling regulations, including on potential
exemptions, later this year, and I shall write to hon. Members with
more detail at the appropriate time. It would not be appropriate,
therefore, for the Bill to include specific exemptions, such as for
certain service providers, as that would pre-empt the
consultation.</div>
					<a name="0704254000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
existing doorstep selling regulations already either exempt or make
provision for effective cancellations in some cases, such as for food
and drink supplied by regular arrangement&#151;for example, milk
delivered to a consumer&#146;s door, perishable goods, goods to meet
an emergency or those incorporated into land before cancellation, such
as double-glazed windows, where the consumer is obliged to pay for the
goods and services in connection with their supply. Although I cannot
say specifically what exemptions or cancellation provisions might
apply, we are aware that some exemptions from the new regulations will
be needed.</div>
					<a name="0704254000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are
considering the need for an exemption for some specific service
providers, such as providers of funeral services. In response to a
public consultation on doorstep selling in 2004, we received
representations from the funeral services industry, seeking exemption
from the new doorstep selling regulations. Many consumers agree in
their homes a contract for a funeral or the details of an advertisement
announcing a family member&#146;s demise. The provision of funeral
services where the contract is made in the home would be caught by the
new regulations unless specifically exempted. We are currently
considering the industry&#146;s request for an exemption, in the
interests of not raising unnecessary obstacles for newly bereaved
consumers who are arranging contracts for funeral services in their
home at a very difficult time. Undertakers often carry out the funeral
within seven days. It is too late for the consumer to change their mind
when their loved one is buried, so we are not considering a cooling-off
period in those circumstances.</div>
					<a name="0704254000259"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are aware of the need to make
provision for consumers to receive goods and services during the
cooling-off period if they wish to do so. We will also aim to ensure
that those who require goods or services in an emergency can get them.
Limiting the number of specific exemptions from the regulations is a
sensible 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column187" />Column number: 187</div>
						approach, which will give consumers maximum
protection and ensure that they receive necessary services during the
cooling-off period.</div>
					<a name="0704254000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">By
contrast, the Opposition&#146;s probing amendment seeks to exempt
traders, such as plumbers, from requirements to provide a cooling-off
period or to give written notice of cancellation rights, which would
weaken the protection considerably. An exemption for emergency
services, for example, would mean an exemption for only those services
that a consumer wanted to receive during the cooling-off period, not
for all the services that were provided by the
trader.</div>
					<a name="0704254000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall give an
example. If, under our proposals, a consumer had a burst pipe, they
could call a plumber and agree that the work should be carried out
during the next seven days. The trader would not refuse to provide the
service within the cooling-off period, as the consumer could not
subsequently cancel the contract. If the consumer wanted a new bathroom
fitted, however, they could agree with the plumber a contract for the
plumbing work in advance, so there would be a cooling-off period. The
consumer would also receive written notice of their cancellation
rights.</div>
					<a name="0704254000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is
another example that applies to gardeners. If a tree in a
consumer&#146;s front garden fell, perhaps due to strong winds, and
was blocking the driveway, the consumer would probably want to have it
removed within seven days. However, for routine, regular gardening work
done by a gardener who came monthly, the consumer could agree a
contract with more than a week&#146;s notice. From the point of view
of consumer protection, it would be preferable to ensure that it would
be possible for the emergency work to be undertaken, but not to provide
a blanket exemption for all gardeners.</div>
					<a name="0704254000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment could lead to the
exemption of many traders from the new requirements for solicited
doorstep sales, thereby giving consumers less protection from rogue
traders. That cannot be in the interests of consumers, although I
accept that it is a probing amendment. The purpose behind the new
regulation is to give consumers good protection from rogue doorstep
traders. We will not weaken the new regulations by making lots of holes
in them through blanket exemptions for specific traders. We will limit
the exemptions to those that are in the interests of the consumer and
that give them the best possible protection from rogue doorstep
selling.</div>
					<a name="0704254000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">I remind
right hon. and hon. Members that I have used only examples of possible
exemptions from the new regulations by way of illustration. As I said,
we will consult on the regulations and their exemptions later this
year; I do not want to be seen to pre-empt that consultation by saying
that those examples are definitely carved out from the regulations. I
hope that I have given some sense of what we want and need to do, and
that the hon. Gentleman is able to withdraw his
amendment.</div>

some indications of the scope and character of the regulations. We will

leave to withdraw the amendment.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0704254000586"></a>Mr.
Prisk:
						</b> The principle behind the clause, as we said on
Second Reading, is one that we strongly support, although we will want
to see the regulations and how they work in practice. I would not wish
to constrain any debate in advance. The regulations for unsolicited
business date back to 1987, and provide a seven-day cooling-off period,
as the Minister has touched on, for goods or services worth more than
&#163;35. Sadly, the rogue element in the doorstep sales industry has
increasingly been finding ways around those rules.</div>
					<a name="0704254000269"></a><div class="hs_Para">We should recognise the size of
that business. The hon. Member for Richmond Park referred in an earlier
debate a couple of days ago to the fact that there is something over
&#163;1 billion in that field. However, if we take doorstep sales of
double glazing, for example, sales were &#163;1.6 billion in 2004.
Even just conservatories were worth &#163;200 million&#151;I nearly
misread that as &#147;Conservatives&#148;, which would be a
bargain. Even the market for mobility products, such as stair lifts or
scooters, was worth &#163;80 million. That was in 2004, and those
markets have grown substantially.</div>
					<a name="0704254000270"></a><div class="hs_Para">If one thinks about products
such as stair lifts or scooters, it is the elderly who get caught out,
as I have found out in my constituency. An elderly lady there contacted
me because she had seen an advertisement for a raised bed. She is
reasonably immobile. She sent for what she thought was a brochure. Five
weeks&#146; later, she got a visit and was persuaded that she had
requested the sales visit in seeking the brochure. To be fair, she
could not quite remember exactly what she had ticked. She did not have
a copy of the coupon that she sent off, because, obviously, she had
sent it, so she could not be sure, and she was persuaded that the
individual could come in. The result was a potential sale of a
&#163;3,000 product. She felt obliged, but her family stepped in,
thankfully, and I was also able to ensure that she did not have to
proceed. That was not her intention.</div>
					<a name="0704254000271"></a><div class="hs_Para">My example highlights the
differential treatmentof solicited and unsolicited goods,
which creates a potential loophole for the unscrupulous. We must
correct that danger. Placing doorstep sales on the same contractual
footing should close that loophole, as I hope that the Minister will
confirm. My only question is whether the Government have made an
assessment of the impact of similar measures on doorstep sales
elsewhere. Is there any evidence that they significantly reduce the
availability of doorstep sales? I would not buy from a doorstep
salesperson; but to be fair, I am more mobile and perhaps more awkward
as a consumer&#151;not least being a man&#151;so it is something
that I would not do. However, for other people, doorstep sales are an
important part of how they live and their availability to certain
products. I should be interested to know from the Minister what impact
the clause might have on those businesses, the vast majority of which
are entirely
legitimate.</div>
					
					<a name="0704254000272"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0704254000587"></a>Mr.
McCartney:
						</b> I apologise for not answering a question
earlier about two sets of regulations covering both aspects. We intend
to have a single set of new 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column189" />Column number: 189</div>regulations. We do not intend to amend the current set of regulations,
but we think it better to draft a new set that covers all issues
included in the consumer&#146;s home. That is important to the point
that the hon. Gentleman has just made about loopholes or potential
loopholes, intended or otherwise. I hope that that puts his mind to
rest in that
respect.</div>
					<a name="0704254000273"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the sale of
double glazing, for example, two issues arise: the sale of double
glazing and, increasingly, financial agreements. Those arrangements are
important, because people will find others not only selling the product
but providing the finance and the wherewithal for the product to be
provided. It is currently a criminal offence to canvass cash loans to a
consumer on an unsolicited basis. The consumer must have expressly
requested that in writing. If a credit agreement is signed in the
consumer&#146;s home as a result of face-to-face discussion, the
consumer has a period in which he or she can cancel, which is usually
five days after giving the required notice of cancellation
rights.</div>
					<a name="0704254000274"></a><div class="hs_Para">If agreed in
its present form, the proposed consumer credit directive would extend
those rights, and it does not make sense to change the present version
until the outcome of the negotiations on the directive is clear. The
directive may or may not come before a Committee or the European
Scrutiny Committee. If it does, we will have a discussion and a debate;
if it does not, I will ensure that I write to hon. Members to inform
them about the outcome of discussions under the German presidency. We
may seek a political agreement in May of this year, but I cannot
confirm that that will definitely
happen.</div>

					<a name="0704254000275"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are currently
considering credit agreements that are linked to doorstep sales. Those
agreements will be within the scope of the new regulations. We are
likely to seek views on that issue during the consultation on draft
regulations. It is therefore important that we cover not just aspects
of the sale of the product itself, but any credit that is given for the
purchasing of product. I hope that also puts the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s mind at rest. Cancellation of a visit as requested
aims to cover that sort of situation in the new regulations. Again,
because the regulations have been consultedon, I will ensure
that consultation is held with the organisations concerned and
interested parties and that access to the consultation is given to hon.
Members, who may wish to make a contribution.</div>
					<a name="0704254000276"></a><div class="hs_Para">Assessing the impact on those
businesses that engage on the doorstep is indeed difficult. There is no
reliable data available on how many companies engage in doorstep
selling. However, measures have been welcomed by leading trade bodies
in the industry that already provide cooling-off periods for solicitous
sales visits. Those measures are a welcome part of the Bill and, as the
hon. Gentleman said, we must attempt to draft regulations that protect
the consumer, but that do not prevent an organisation from legitimately
carrying out its business and that may actually help many people. Like
the hon. Gentleman, I do not use doorstep salespeople, but I cannot
guarantee that someone else in my family does not. In fact, I am sure
that they do, whether it is Avon women or whatever. People who are 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column190" />Column number: 190</div>housebound require and obtain legitimate services in such a way and we
must ensure that legitimate services are protected. I give an assurance
that in respect of single unit regulations there will be appropriate
consultation. I am happy to offer to have a discussion about that with
the hon. Gentleman and the Liberal Democrats in advance of the
consultation or while preparing for the
consultation.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0704254000592"></a>Mr.
Prisk:
						</b> New clause 1 seeks to bring the business of
lettings agencies within the Bill and to regulate an industry that now
handles over &#163;12 billion of people&#146;s 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column191" />Column number: 191</div>money annually and yet, ironically, it is an industry that is without
the redress that we have all discussed in a number of debates about the
Bill.</div>
					<a name="0704254000290"></a><div class="hs_Para">That anomaly is
not understood by the public, especially when residential sales and
lettings are often handled by the same agency&#151;by the same people
in the same office. Without including residential lettings in the
regulations set out by the Estate Agents Act 1979 and therefore in the
Bill, we would, in seeking to promote the arguments for redress schemes
and all the other changes that we have discussed, only be doing half
the job.</div>
					<a name="0704254000291"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Conservatives are not the first people to seek this updating of the
law. Tenants&#146; groups, for example, want to see this change and
so do a majority of the principal property organisations, including the
Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors; the National Association of
Estate Agents; the British Property Federation, and
the Residential Landlords Association. All these organisations wish to
see the law updated.</div>
					<a name="0704254000292"></a><div class="hs_Para">At present, lettings agents can
get qualified, but it is not obligatory. The British Property
Federation tells me that an average agent might handle in the region of
150 to 200 properties worth about &#163;30 million in rent, and yet
there are no regulatory rules or codes of practice that he or she is
required to follow and no obligation to handle complaints appropriately
or to be part of a redress scheme, all of which we have applauded and
agreed on in the
Committee.</div>
					<a name="0704254000293"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of course,
many tenants get caught out. I know from my own citizens advice bureau
how some agents in this market behave. Indeed, the National Association
of Citizens Advice Bureaux tells me that roughly 4,500 negative
inquiries were made against lettings agents in any typical year in the
last few years. Very often, such concerns are raised by some of the
most vulnerable members of society. Indeed, the National Association of
Estate Agents, which is a reputable organisation, says that the
majority of complaints that it receives about its members concern the
lettings sector.</div>
					<a name="0704254000294"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
sure that Ministers will say to us&#151;we heardthe
beginnings of their argument earlier&#151;that the Government are
putting in place, for example, the tenancy deposit protection scheme,
and that is being put into practice. That scheme is welcome, but it
only applies to deposits and it provides no mediation for the many
other kinds of disputes that arise, which we have discussed in other
debates. Therefore I believe that we need to go
further.</div>
					<a name="0704254000295"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause 1
would amend section 1 of the Estate Agents Act 1979 to extend the
definition of estate agency work to include residential lettings and
management. Some of the scams that are perpetrated in this market
include, for example, charging both landlords and tenants for the same
service; charging for simple procedures that are already covered by a
landlord&#146;s management fee, and charging exorbitant fees for
basic functions. There are a string of examples; perhaps the best known
are outlined on the<i class="I"> </i>
						<i class="I">Guardian Unlimited</i> website. For
example, someone was once charged &#163;60 simply for the process of
administering VAT; &#163;150 for a cleaning fee; &#163;150 for a
credit check, and &#163;100 for an administration fee. I think that
the hon. Member for Richmond Park referred to some of these examples
before. All of those charges were made without good reason.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column192" />Column number: 192</div>
					<a name="0704254000296"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is true to say&#151;I think
that the Minister alluded to this before&#151;that the national
approved letting scheme sets a minimum service standard and seeks to
ensure financial probity in this market. However, there is no
obligation on companies to join. Equally, although professional bodies
exist and maintain good standards, 60 per cent. of letting agents are
neither in NALS nor a member of those professional bodies. That is one
of the principal reasons why the industry continues to attract the
unscrupulous, and the industry recognises that.</div>
					<a name="0704254000297"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new clause would bring
residential lettings within the established legal framework. It would
ensure that residential sales and lettings were regulated in exactly
the same way; it would give trading standards officers and the Office
of Fair Trading the powers that have, as we all recognise, helped to
tackle the issue of rogue estate agents in respect of sales; and it
would mean that the improvements included in the Bill would apply to
the whole of the residential market rather than just half of
it.</div>
					<a name="0704254000298"></a><div class="hs_Para">As a Conservative,
I am instinctively cautious about arguing for more regulation. However,
as a chartered surveyor and a constituency Member of Parliament, I know
that we need to put lettings on the same regulatory footing as sales.
The fact that the National Association of Estate Agents, the Royal
Institution of Chartered Surveyors and the rest of the industry agree
shows that the measure is long overdue.</div>
					<a name="0704254000299"></a><div class="hs_Para">On lettings, let me put the
argument in the words of Shelter, which says
clearly:</div>
					<a name="0704254000415"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Shelter
sees first hand the negative consequences of high letting agent fees on
people who are already struggling to pay private rented sector rents.
This bill provides an opportunity to improve regulation of this sector
and ensure consistency and affordability of letting agent
practice.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0704254000300"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is the
important issue that I wish to address through new clause 1, which
deals with bringing residential lettings in line with all the things
that we have said that we believe are good for sales. Through new
clause 3, we seek to extend what we mean by estate agency
work.</div>
					<a name="0704254000301"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Act is 28
years old. I mean the 1979 Act, not the Bill that we are discussing,
although I appreciate that, having sat for three days, some Committee
members might feel that it is indeed 28 years old. I suspect that I
might have contributed to that sense of slow passage of
time&#151;</div>
					
					<a name="0704254000302"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0704254000593"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (Jim
Fitzpatrick):
						</b> No, surely
not.</div>
					
					<a name="0704254000303"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0704254000594"></a>Mr.
Prisk:
						</b> The Under-Secretary is very kind. However, the
Estate Agents Act 1979 which, I have to confess, I studied at
university, it was that long ago, has not allowed us to move forward
with the changes in the market over the past 15 or 20 years. There have
been significant deregulation and expansion in the mortgage field and
the growth in buy-to-lets and in direct sales by house builders and
developers&#151;just across the road there is a significant
development, all of which was sold not through the estate agency market
but directly to home buyers. None of those things will be covered under
anything that we have discussed today, because they do not count as
estate agency work under the current definition of estate
agency.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column193" />Column number: 193</div>
					<a name="0704254000304"></a><div class="hs_Para">Thanks to that definition any
individual who purchases from that block, or similar blocks that hon.
Members know of in their constituencies, will not be covered, so it
needs to be changed. We need to take the opportunity to modernise the
legislation and to make it relevant to the market as it is today. After
all, the long title of the Bill says that it
is</div>
					<a name="0704254000416"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to amend the Estate
Agents Act
1979&#148;.</div>
					<a name="0704254000305"></a><div class="hs_Para">I made it
clear to Ministers on Second Reading and prior to this debate that I
would like to work with all members of the Committee, and with the
Government, to update the legislation and thereby to help all home
occupiers. The Government have made positive noises on the issue, and
those are very welcome. My aim is to ensure that we end up with the
best possible legal framework for the market.</div>
					<a name="0704254000306"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause 3 tackles two
specific and important changes in the way in which people buy and sell
their homes, namely direct sales by house builders and developers and
the growing online market. The 1979 Act defines estate agency
through the principle that an estate agent is an intermediary. That
remains true in most transactions for most people. However, direct
sales by house builders and developers have become extremely important
in the new homes market, of which a substantial part is first-time
buyers. It is especially important for them, as consumers, to be
protected, as they would be if they were undertaking conventional
transactions.</div>
					<a name="0704254000307"></a><div class="hs_Para">The same
can be said of the increasing number of online property exchanges. I
tried to work out how many there were, and I managed to count to
over100 different web-based services. Although I appreciate
that many of them are merely portals, or shop windows, that do not seek
to effect a transaction, an increasing number do seek to effect
transactions between
persons.</div>
					<a name="0704254000308"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
told us that the aim of the Bill is to ensure that home buyers and
vendors have redress, but because the Acts that it seeks to enhance
have been overtaken by market developments, the 1979 Act needs to be
changed if our discussions on redress are to have any real meaning for
members of the home-buying community, especially for first-time
buyers.</div>
					<a name="0704254000309"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not
pretend that the wording of new clause 3 is perfect. It would add a new
clause that deals with non-intermediary transactions to the 1979 Act.
Section 1A relates to the many cases of homes being developed by house
builders and sold direct, without an agent being involved. I am told
that in the south-east that is now the norm for most new developments,
and unless we include them, much of the property market will continue
to be exactly as it is now, and nothing will change for many people
when the Bill is enacted.</div>
					<a name="0704254000310"></a><div class="hs_Para">Section 1A(b) of the new clause
refers specifically to internet sales, as at present it is unclear that
the Act applies to them. I fully recognise that there difficulties in
that part of the new clause, but it is important that it is considered,
and the Minister will want to allude to it.
</div>
					<a name="0704254000311"></a><div class="hs_Para">On Second Reading, the
Minister said that it was important that the residential market should
be better regulated, and I entirely agree with him. Ensuring proper
redress is vital to all home buyers and tenants 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column194" />Column number: 194</div>and the new clause would help in that respect by ensuring that consumers
can seek redress for all residential transactions, not just those based
on a 28-year-old
definition.</div>
					<a name="0704254000312"></a><div class="hs_Para">In respect
of new clause 3, I hope that the Minister can offer us a little more
than the promised review of the housing market as a whole, although
that review is welcome as it has merits. My worry is that it has taken
28 years to get to the point of modernising the legislation and that it
may take three, four or five more years before any reforms take effect.
Depending on what the Minister says, I may therefore want to press the
new clauses to a
Division.</div>

							<a name="0704254000595"></a>Susan
Kramer:
						</b> I shall make a couple of quick comments. Liberal
Democrat Members addressed direct sales and lettings in earlier
amendments that tackled those issues in appropriate ways. We are glad
that our Conservative colleagues supported them in spirit, but they
would not support them in the context of the language of the
amendments. But we are not proud: our goal is to get proper protection
for people purchasing off-plan and those who rent as tenants. We shall
therefore support the new clause in a
Division.</div>
					
					<a name="0704254000315"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0704254000596"></a>Mr.
Wallace:
						</b> Many hon. Members have in their constituencies a
growing number of residential park homes, often on sites run by
excellent owners, but in a few cases by highly dubious and unscrupulous
owners. They safeguard their estate agency role in the residential home
sector or their letting role in the holiday home sector to an extent
that exploits sometimes vulnerable people and raises grave
concerns.</div>
					<a name="0704254000316"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have the
distinction of having 5,000 such sites in my constituency, more than in
any other hon. Member&#146;s constituency. Constituents of the
Minister, the right hon. Member for Makerfield, are involved in a legal
case against an unscrupulous owner in my constituency. The 1979 Act
deals predominantly with those trading in land, and my constituents and
many others are exploited because the land is often owned by the park
owner but my constituents own the residential park home, which they
have purchased as some form of property. Between now and Report, could
the Minister see whether it would be possible simply to extend the
definition of &#147;estate agency work&#148; to include the growing
numbers of residential park homes so that my constituents are given
that protection?</div>
					<a name="0704254000317"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is a park in my constituency near the village of Pilling where the
owner not only insists that the park homes are bought and sold
exclusively through him, but on a 15 per cent. commission on the
advertised price, not the sale price. He therefore advertises a home
for &#163;70,000, sells it for &#163;20,000 and still charges 15
per cent. of the &#163;70,000, a price that he picked out of thin
air. I will not abuse privilege by naming this individual, but he
abuses the position of being the estate agent.</div>
					<a name="0704254000318"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon. Friend&#146;s new
clauses would help to clarify the situation and I hope that the Bill is
used to clamp down on such people and bring park homes within the fold
of other properties that people use as retirement homes or, with the
cost of housing as it is, as their main residence because they cannot
afford to buy in the areas where they would like to live. I ask the
Minister 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column195" />Column number: 195</div>to see whether an amendment to the Estate Agents Act 1979 could
give my constituents the protection they deserve and stop these
scurrilously criminal people who exploit the most vulnerable people
they can
find.</div>

							<a name="0704254000597"></a>Mr.
McCartney:
						</b> I predicted this morning that things could get
sparky this afternoon and I thought that I would be proved wrong until
the last few moments when the hon. Member for Hertford and Stortford
said two things. First, he said that the Bill was 28 years out of date
and that the Government should do something about the
&#147;wasted&#148;&#151;I quote myself&#151;years. Apparently
the Conservatives are now the self-appointed representatives who are
looking after the interests of people in rented housing<i class="I">. </i>Twenty
years ago on 11 June, I became a Member of this House. Almost
immediately, I was involved in hand-to-hand combat on the Housing Bill,
which took away the rights of all private tenants in England and Wales
to have security of tenure in order to stimulate the private housing
market. Hundreds of thousands of people who had absolute protection,
including the elderly and people with a disability, were put at risk of
a recurring tenancy agreement, not for a 12-month period but on a
six-monthly basis, with no appeal if the tenancy was withdrawn. There
was no redress scheme. There was also no redress scheme when it came to
the mis-selling of endowment policies.</div>
					
					<a name="0704254000320"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0704254000598"></a>The

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0704254000599"></a>Mr.
McCartney:
						</b> I am not going to argue about that. My point is
that the Bill is about redress. We are trying to determine who speaks
up for people in the housing market. I cannot let those remarks go by,
given allthat we have been doing as a Government in this
regard&#151;&#151;and getting no support for it. Again, on redress,
it took this Government to get redress for the mis-sold endowment
policies. As a consequence, nearly &#163;900 million has been
returned to the people who purchased them, who number nearly 430,000. I
take no lessons from the hon. Gentleman if we are to have a competition
to see who represents the best interests of house
buyers.</div>
					<a name="0704254000322"></a><div class="hs_Para">The debate
rests on new clauses 1 and 3, andcovers almost exactly the
same ground dealt with by amendments Nos. 24 and 25. The hon.
Gentleman&#146;s interest has come a bit late. The hon. Member for
Richmond Park said something very interesting, which I can confirm: in
the Grand Committee, and on Report and Third Reading of the Bill during
its passage through the Lords, the Earl of Caithness tabled amendments
to extend the Estate Agents Act 1979 to include lettings in property
management&#151;we rightly had that discussion on amendments Nos. 24
and 24. At no stage did the Conservatives support Earl of
Caithness&#146;s amendments. When he put them to the vote on Third
Reading, they abstained. In the last debate, the hon. Gentleman was
competing to see who was the toughest of them all, but it is now about
who represents consumers&#146; interests. A cynical
manoeuvre.</div>

							<a name="0704254000601"></a>Mr.
McCartney:
						</b> I suspect that he might well be a Tory grandee,
but despite that, the Tories did not support him on the issue of
principle. When it came to the vote, they did not support
him.</div>
					<a name="0704254000325"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall explain
again: the Government have taken actions to deal with problems in the
letting and property development sector. I do not want to go through
all of them because we had a really good debate on amendments Nos. 24
and 25 in which I thought that I showed not just empathy with what was
being said, but a desire to do something about it. We decided,
therefore, to set up the tenancy deposit scheme, which is very
important. It is one of the most difficult areas when dealing with
protections and
disputes.</div>
					<a name="0704254000326"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under the
Housing Act 2004, we did something about houses in multiple occupation.
On the Barker report, I mentioned today, for the first time, that the
OFT might consider a market study. However, if it does not look at the
issues and come forward with proposals, we will look at doing so
ourselves. I have prompted a review&#151;not just a simple little
review, but a review of redress and regulation in the wider property
market. No Government have ever done that. The hon. Gentleman&#146;s
party had nearly two decades in which to do it, but did not. The only
review that did take place took away consumer rights in the housing
market.</div>
					<a name="0704254000327"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
important that we start the review in the summer. We should not just
pick out what are thought to be the six consumer issues of the day. We
must be consistent and look at the market as a whole. The issues are
different and will produce different responses and answers. That is why
it is so important that the review takes place and that we come forward
with proposals.</div>
					<a name="0704254000328"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Estate Agents Act 1979 does not cover lettings and new builds, so we
cannot simply introduce secondary legislation for letting agents and
property developers. That does not work in practice. However, I accept
that the hon. Members for Hertford and Stortford and for Richmond Park
have been consistent in respect of what we are trying to achieve. That
is why we put forward in good faith our proposals for the review. I
hope that that is
accepted.</div>
					<a name="0704254000329"></a><div class="hs_Para">I know that
the matter will probably be pressed legitimately to a vote; it is going
to be the big issue. However, I must make it absolutely clear that the
Government will look at the wider issues in consultation with the
industry and consumers. This is the first Government to provide such
redress schemes. No Government have ever gone so far with redress in
the housing market. None even came close to doing so. I shall,
therefore, resist the
amendments.</div>
					<a name="0704254000330"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Lancaster and Wyre and I had a short discussion outside the
Committee on that subject and I asked him to write to me about his
concerns. I said that we would look at them in the review that is
taking place. However, on his specific issues, it might well be that,
as I said earlier, if somebody is operating as an estate agent under
the terms of the 1979 Act, they are covered already. If that person
looks like, sounds like and is like an estate agent, they are covered
by the regulations. It would be useful if the hon. Gentleman could put
that in writing to me, so that I can
respond.</div>

								Mr.
Wallace:
						</b> My point was that, in the 1979 Act, the
definition of estate agency work related to land, and whether
&#147;land&#148; encompasses the definition of a residential park
home, as opposed to bricks and mortar or a plot of
land.</div>

							<a name="0704254000603"></a>Mr.
McCartney:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman wants me to give a detailed
answer on a complex issue, where there might even be a legal case. I am
trying genuinely to be helpful, and if he writes to me, I will respond.
In any event, there are two ways to approach the issue: looking at the
specifics and the general review of what is taking place in the housing
market. The question may not fall into the specifics but into the
issues around the review of the housing market. Either way, I will try
to be as helpful as I possibly can to him and his constituents. Many
people are in a similar situation in other places, and I know that some
of the cases that he raised involve people in my constituency. However,
as of yet, they have not asked me to help them, so good luck to him. I
hope that he does a good job&#151;I shall keep an eye on
him.</div>
					<a name="0704254000333"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member
for Hertford and Stortford raised several questions about the internet.
In December 2005, the OFT issued guidance on the types of activities
carried out by internet property retailers and said that their work was
unlikely to fall within the definition of estate agency work as
contained in the 1979 Act. However, if internet property retailers
undertake activities that fall within the definition, they will be
required to be members of a redress scheme. I shall write to Members in
more detail about
that.</div>
					<a name="0704254000334"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will review
what was said in previous sittings. If I have not responded to any
questions, I will write to Members so that they have answers before the
Bill goes back to the Floor of the House in two or three weeks&#146;
time. With that, I ask the hon. Gentleman to do something that I am
sure he will not do. I ask him to withdraw the amendment on the basis
that the Government will go ahead with a review. As a consequence,
there will be a more proactive and extensive review of market issues,
including those that he raised. I have an empathy with those concerns
and want to try to resolve
them.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0704254000604"></a>Mr.
Prisk:
						</b> The Minister&#146;s mind has failed at the last
hurdle. Sadly, just when we thought that we would have a positive
debate all the way through, he could not resist the partisan nature of
it. If it is the case that changes were not made during the years of
the Conservative Government and, indeed, the subsequent 10 years of
this Government, that is something on which we should both reflect. I
do not seek to make a partisan point about
it.</div>
					<a name="0704254000336"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is a shame that
the Minister chose to be negative on the important issue of tenancy
rights. It may be that he is embarrassed that many Labour Back Benchers
actually support the principles that we are propounding. It may be that
he hoped that we had come to the end of the debate and was therefore
unwilling to engage in the matter. I hope not, because that would be a
shame.</div>
					<a name="0704254000337"></a><div class="hs_Para">Apparently there
is some sort of competition in the Minister&#146;s mind on the
question of tenants&#146; rights. I am not engaged in that process. I
am more interested in what we can do now, not in whether mistakes were 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column198" />Column number: 198</div>
						made 10, 15 or 20 years ago. Perhaps my party did do
something wrong 10, 15 or 20 years ago. If we did, we would be happy to
acknowledge that we did. It is a shame that the Minister lowered the
debate in that way.</div>
					<a name="0704254000338"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have been offered a commitment to a review. I am sure that that will
really help the tenants who are struggling in the circumstances that I
described. I recognise that there is merit in looking at the housing
market as a whole. That would have considerable benefits, but a
commitment to a review does not amount to
much.</div>
					<a name="0704254000339"></a><div class="hs_Para">We did not get
from the Minister any reference, for example, to the anomaly whereby
the person who deals with someone who is buying a home will be treated
entirely different when they let someone a home. He did not deal with
the question about direct sales by house builders. The first-time
buyers who make up the majority of that market will find that, if they
buy a new home from a house builder, they are not protected by anything
that we have discussed in the Bill. They will not be
covered.</div>
					<a name="0704254000340"></a><div class="hs_Para">I had hoped
that we might have a little more positive thought. I had hoped that the
Minister might indicate that he would put into the Bill on Report a
clause that will give a future Secretary of State, whether of his party
or mine, an opportunity to amend the 1979 Act. That would allow a
considered review of the market but also the opportunity for the
Government to introduce in the next 12 months or so changes that would
make a real difference to tenants and estate agents. Instead, we were
given a commitment to a review. That is fine. If that is the
Government&#146;s position, we will listen to it. We will act in a
collaborative way, but the commitment is
inadequate.</div>
					<a name="0704254000341"></a><div class="hs_Para">I return to
the two points that Shelter raised, which are that the proposals that
we made on tenancy be included and that the definition of estate agency
be extended. Both would provide us with consistency and affordability
for the people involved. That is the aim. That is what Shelter sought,
and&#151;</div>

							<a name="0704254000635"></a>Mr.
McCartney:
						</b> On a point of order, Mr. Weir, I am
extremely grateful to you and to Mr. Caton for your guidance
and stewardship during these proceedings, as well as for your tolerance
and patience during the days of debate. In this relatively short
session, we have had broadly constructive debates that I believe
reflect a common desire on all sides to deliver a Bill of real benefit
to all consumers.</div>
					<a name="0704254000392"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
that spirit, I also thank the hon. Members for Hertford and Stortford
and for Richmond Park for their constructive and diligent approach to
proposals, and for their contributions. I put on record my appreciation
for the way in which they have taken on board Government views on
several issues. I have, in turn, reciprocated. I am fully aware that,
despite areas of agreement, there remain areas of difference between
us, and I wish to return to those on Report.</div>
					<a name="0704254000393"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am grateful to the
Under-Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, my hon. Friend the
Member for Poplar and Canning Town, for his unstinting support in
Committee. He dealt with a large number of important issues,
particularly during my enforced 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column200" />Column number: 200</div>absence last Thursday. I put on record my appreciation for my
Parliamentary Private Secretary, my hon. Friend the Member for Wigan,
and for my hon. Friend the Member for West Ham, for keeping the
Government side of the Committee organised. I also thank my hon. Friend
the Member for Ealing, North, and I am sorry that I failed to restrain
his premature rising on one
occasion.</div>
					<a name="0704254000394"></a><div class="hs_Para">I thank the
officials, who have done a brilliant job, not just in Committee but
through the months during which we have prepared for the Bill, and kept
the Committee fully briefed and informed. Finally, Mr. Weir,
I thank the Clerk and all the staff for their efforts: the <i class="I">Hansard
</i>reporters, the police and the officers of the House have played an
important part in ensuring the smooth running of the
Committee.</div>
					<a name="0704254000395"></a><div class="hs_Para">I thank you
for listening to me, Mr. Weir. This is the first time that I
have been in Committee for a number of years, and I have really enjoyed
it. I look forward to Report and, even more importantly, to when the
Bill becomes an Act and we implement it effectively for the first time
for millions of consumers and get them redress in situations in which,
until now, they have been able to complain but had no possibility of
getting redress. I look forward to the discussions that will take place
in a few weeks&#146;
time.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0704254000636"></a>Mr.
Prisk:
						</b> Further to that point of order, Mr.
Weir. I match the Minister&#146;s remarks to you and your fellow
Chairman, Mr. Caton. The Committee has been pleasant and we
have managed to keep matters reasonably restrained. There has been the
odd outburst now and again, but what would we be if we were not able to
do that? I thank you for your guidance, Mr. Weir, and extend
my thanks to the officers of the House and particularly the Clerks for
their help and guidance in ensuring that we have been able to consider
matters and prepare amendments to ensure that the quality of scrutiny
is as it should be.</div>
					<a name="0704254000397"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
extend to both Ministers my thanks for the generally very positive way
in which they have approached the issues. We will disagree on certain
issues, which is only right and proper, and I am sure that that will
continue in a positive way&#151;or occasionally a negative
way&#151;on Report. Generally speaking, the way in which we have
sought to deal with the matters before us, and the way in which the
Ministers have reciprocated, has been positive. I hope that it has
shown the House in a good light. I extend those comments to the hon.
Ladies, the hon. Members for Richmond Park and for Solihull, the other
double act in this theatre of comedy. Sadly, the jester is not with
us&#151;the hon. Member for Ealing, North, or, as I always call him,
the hon. Member for Ealing

from least, I thank my hon. Friends, who have steadfastly listened
to&#151;I was going to say my remarkable erudition, but they might
have different words for it. They have been supportive and helpful, and
it is always useful to have people who take an interest. My hon.
Friends have not only done that but on a number of occasions forced the
Government to recognise the weaknesses of the Bill and perhaps change
them.</div>

						</b> Further to that point of order, Mr.
Weir. Thank you for the opportunity to speak the last words in the
gathering of the Committee. I express my thanks, on behalf of my hon.
Friend the Member for Solihull, to you and to Mr. Caton for
chairing the Committee and for your patience with people
whohave relatively little experience of Committee work.
Although many of the amendments that we wish had been accepted were
not, there was real movement in the course of the Committee&#146;s
deliberations.</div>
					<a name="0704254000401"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
underlying issues and shared concern across the House that the Bill
should eventually be a successful 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column202" />Column number: 202</div>Act led to positive exchanges with which I was really pleased. I was a
little saddened by the tiny bit of sniping at the end, which perhaps
reminded us of the place that we are in. However, the Committee has
been overwhelmingly positive and we feel that real progress has been
made. We hope that more can be made on Report. My thanks to everyone
who has beeninvolved, and I return the compliments to
Ministers, Government Members and the Conservative Opposition as well
as to yourself, Mr. Weir, andthe
officials.</div>
