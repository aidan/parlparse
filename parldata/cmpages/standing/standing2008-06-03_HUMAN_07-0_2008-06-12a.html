Simmonds</b> (Boston and Skegness) (Con): I have one quick
question. The clause deals with civil partnerships and it mirrors
clause 39, which deals with heterosexual partnerships and the use of a
man&#146;s sperm after his death. My understanding of clause 46 is
that a woman who was not in a civil partnership&#151;and might
therefore not be in an intimate relationship with a women receiving
treatment&#151;who has no genetic link to the child, and who is also
dead, can be named on the birth certificate as the second parent. Is
the Minister comfortable with
that?</div><a name="08061260000028"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061260000220"></a>The
Minister of State, Department of Health (Dawn Primarolo):</b>
Under the clause, through assisted conception in a United
Kingdom-licensed clinic at the time when the woman was not in a
marriage or a civil partnership, but her female partner had died before
the embryo could be transferred to the woman, the female partner could
be registered as the parent in certain circumstances: when, immediately
before the female partner&#146;s death, the agreed parenthood
conditions under clause 44 were in place; when the female partner had
consented in writing, and had not withdrawn that consent, to the
transfer of the embryo to the woman and to herself being registered as
the parent of the child born as a result; when the mother decided
within the 42 days in England and Wales, and 21 days in Scotland, to
register that on the birth certificate; and when no else was treated as
a father or parent of the child under the provisions of the Bill, or
under adoption or legitimacy law. Such circumstances reflect the
position of married couples. Yes, I am satisfied that one clause
mirrors the other&#151;and no
more.</div><a name="08061260000029"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061260000221"></a>Mark
Simmonds:</b> I shall again be quick. It would be helpful if
the Minister would put her views on record. We talked about sperm
donors under early clauses and this clause relates to egg donors. Can
the right hon. Lady confirm that a record is kept of egg donors by the
Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority and that those who have
benefited will have a right to discover who the egg donors were at the
appropriate age? Will it be ensured that the information available for
those aged 16 and 18 absolutely mirrors that in relation to sperm
donors?</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061260000222"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> I am happy to say yes. The hon. Gentleman is
correct. The clause gives the access that he described, and it would
have to, because the treatment would take place at a licensed clinic
that was subject to requirements to trace the
donor.</div><a name="08061260000034"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061260000225"></a>Mark
Simmonds:</b> I acknowledge that the proposals are probing
amendments to elicit from the Minister the logic behind the clause,
under which a deceased person is to be treated as the father for the
purposes of being named on the birth certificate, but for no other
reason. Will the right hon. Lady explain what the clause is trying to
prevent? Presumably, the deceased person will be the biological father
in some instances, so would not normal inheritance circumstances occur?
The Minister was right to mention the other day that if someone wanted
to leave something after their death to a subsequent child, they could
do so in their will. That explains how someone can circumvent the
problem, but not why the clause is in the Bill. For those members of
the Committee who want to follow this argument, the two parts of the
clause that I am particularly referring to are subsections (3)(b) and
(4)(b). I would be grateful if the Minister explained the intention
behind
them.</div><a name="08061260000039"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08061260000226"></a><b class="B">Dr.
John Pugh</b> (Southport) (LD): The clause refers to someone

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061260000231"></a>Dr.
Pugh:</b> I want to know whether the expression
&#147;treated as father&#148; carries the same meaning throughout
the Bill, given that it is qualified in this context. The Minister has
explained that when we were talking about someone treated as a father,
we meant treated as a father purely for the purpose of recognition on
the birth certificate. There is some inkling in this context that it
means something different in certain circumstances, so I seek
clarification.</div><a name="08061260000045"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061260000232"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> The Bill replaces and extends the provisions of
the Human Fertilisation and Embryology (Deceased Fathers) Act 2003. We
have returned to this point several times as we have gone through the
latter clauses in the Bill. The 2003 Act provisions are re-enacted in
clauses 39 and 40. Clause 39 relates to the use of a man&#146;s own
sperm to create a child with his consent after his death, while clause
40 relates to the registration of a father when a child is born to a
woman as a result of the transfer of an embryo created with donor sperm
when her husband or male partner was alive and the man dies before the
embryo is transferred. Clause 46 extends the provisions to same-sex
couples, whether they are in a civil partnership or not, to mirror
other provisions. We have had that
discussion.</div><a name="08061260000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
provisions allow for a man, or a female intended parent, to be recorded
in the register of births as a father or parent, but otherwise not to
be treated as the legal parent for other purposes in law. The Human
Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990, as originally drafted, did not
allow for deceased men to be treated as fathers of children conceived
after their deaths. That position was based on the recommendations of
the Warnock report and concerns that that might prevent the winding up
of a person&#146;s estate if children were born years after their
death. In a well known case, of which the hon. Member for Boston and
Skegness is aware, there are now several such children. The fear in the
Warnock report was that an estate could never be wound up because
people would have to wait on whether genetic material from the deceased
man meant that any future children could have a claim on the
estate.</div><a name="08061260000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
1990 Act was amended by the 2003 Act, a private Member&#146;s Bill
piloted through the House by my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham,
Hall Green. That Act allowed a man to be treated as the father for the
purpose of birth registration&#151;the matter now under
consideration&#151;and for no other purpose, such as decoupling from
concerns over the winding up of an estate. That represents a pragmatic
and fair approach.</div>
<a name="08061260000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">The probing
amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Boston and Skegness would
remove the subsection that ensures that no further legal status is
assigned to those parents. They would have only the symbolic effect of
their name being recorded on the birth certificate. I do not think that
he will want to do that. On reflection&#151;given the questions that
he has asked and the fact that he says that these are probing
amendments&#151;I think 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column242" />Column number: 242</div>that he will believe, as the Government do, that it is right, even with
explicit consent, that full legal parenthood should not be conferred on
a deceased father or parent in relation to children born following
their death.</div>
<a name="08061260000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Southport asked what is meant by the phrase
&#147;treated...as the father&#148;, which is used throughout
the Bill. It has a specific meaning in relation to clause 48. The term
is used to mean treated as the father under the law. When the term is
used in a more limited sense elsewhere in the Bill, that fact is
expressly conveyed. That is why it is necessary at this point, in a
cross-reference to the 2003 Act, to say that it is only for the
purposes of registration, which is what we are discussing. It ensures
that there is no inadvertent opening up of issues to which the House
has already agreed.</div>
<a name="08061260000050"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061260000233"></a>Dr.
Pugh:</b> Is the Minister saying that in a prior clause, or as
a qualification in this clause, that the expressions
&#147;treated...as the father&#148; or
&#147;treated...as a parent&#148; have the general meaning of
a parent in law&#151;a father in the legal sense&#151;except when
expressly qualified in the
legislation?</div><a name="08061260000051"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061260000234"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> Yes, that is the case, because of the unique
circumstances being dealt with in the clause with reference to the 2003
Act. I hope that I have reassured both hon. Gentlemen that the
provision is tightly drawn for a good reason. On reflection, I know
that they will
agree.</div><a name="08061260000052"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061260000235"></a>Mark
Simmonds:</b> The Minister has answered the point thoroughly
and with great clarity. The point about it not being possible to wind
up the estate many years after the person&#146;s death is the
ultimate reason for the provision. That seems to make sense, so I beg
to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061260000237"></a>Mark
Simmonds:</b> I wish to lift a little more information about
the amendments from the Minister. I understand that they relate to
circumstances in which written consent was not required as the parties
believed themselves to be in a civil partnership or marriage, but later
discovered that the marriage or the civil partnership was invalid. Am I
right that the amendments apply to marriages as well as civil
partnerships, or only to civil partnerships? What is the basis for an
invalid civil partnership? Presumably, it is not the same as a void
marriage.</div>

am</div><a name="08061260000057"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061260000238"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> These are consequential amendments related to
other Acts, including the Legitimacy Act 1976 and the Family Law Reform
Act 1987. They relate to the legitimacy of children born by assisted
conception to civil partners and are intended to bring the rules into
line with those for married
couples.</div><a name="08061260000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">Since
the Bill was introduced, it has been identified that although a child
born to a same-sex couple that later entered into a civil partnership
would be treated as legitimate in law for all purposes, a child born to
civil partners would be treated as legitimate in law only for the more
limited purposes set out in statute. For example, many family trusts
create classes of beneficiary limited to the lawful issue: the
legitimate child of the settlor. That anomaly will operate in the cases
before us unless we correct it by means of the
amendments.</div><a name="08061260000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments are tightly drawn to correct that unintended consequence by
making a clear statement that a child born to civil partners will be
treated as legitimate in law for all purposes. That comes back to the
point raised by the hon. Member for Southport, who asked me to
distinguish between a parent or a father elsewhere in the Bill, as
opposed to in the clauses before us. The issue is the flip side of the
debate that we have just had, and the example that we would use would
be trust law.</div>
<a name="08061260000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">Provision is
already made&#151;there is an equivalent&#151;in clause 49, which
we are coming to. That clause sets out the test that is applied when
there is a void marriage or civil partnership. These clauses are
interlinked to reinforce the point. I hope that that clarifies the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s point.</div>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column244" />Column number: 244</div><a name="08061260000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is a
probing amendment, which is intended to elicit from the Minister the
compelling reason behind the provisions on late registration. First,
will she clarify whether it is common for people to take more than 42
days to register a birth? Secondly, is the defence applicable only
where there has been non-partner IVF treatment, or can it be used by
everyone and in other circumstances? Finally, will the Minister explain
the circumstances in which more than 42 days would be required to
register a birth and why that might be necessary? It would make sense
if there were medical reasons&#151;the mother might, for example, be
in a coma. If there are other circumstances, however, it would be
helpful to establish what they are, and the reasons for
them.</div><a name="08061260000069"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061260000240"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> The clause extends further the 2003 Act. As the
hon. Gentleman mentioned, the provisions allow for the extension of the
period during which the mother may elect that her deceased partner
should be treated as her child&#146;s father or parent for the
purpose of birth registration, with the consent of the relevant
Registrar General. That is unchanged from the 2003 Act, apart from the
incorporation of references to same-sex couples; the provision operates
in the same way as it would for an application for delay of
registration under the 2003 Act, but is extended to same-sex
couples.</div>
<a name="08061260000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">The period of
time could be extended only if the registrar was satisfied that there
were compelling reasons. For the purpose of the clause, in the event
that after giving birth the mother was unable to register the birth
within the statutory period&#151;an example would be that her ill
health prevented it&#151;she could be granted an extension of the
period in which to register. That is based on the fact that it would
clearly be more appropriate for the mother to register the birth than
for someone else to do it on her behalf, in that fewer mistakes would
be likely to be made. That is the basis for the registration
requirement with respect to the mother; the provision maintains that
link.</div>
<a name="08061260000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">The registrar
must, however, be satisfied, and the ill health in question must be
something that would absolutely prevent the mother from registering the
birth. I recall reading, and will check the figures, because I do not
have them with me, that thus far, for married couples&#151;obviously
we cannot say what happens with same-sex couples, because they will not
get the relevant right until the Bill receives Royal
Assent&#151;there have been very few late applications. I have a
figure in mind of fewer than 20.</div>
<a name="08061260000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">The reason
why we know the figures is that the registrar has referred such matters
upwards, because they are exceptional, and has requested advice. Such
instances are rare; it is expected that they will arise only in
exceptional circumstances. It will not be a matter of inconvenience, or
something like a cold, preventing registration; it will be the same
rules for everyone, in exceptional
circumstances.</div><a name="08061260000073"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061260000241"></a>Mark
Simmonds:</b> To be absolutely certain, will the Minister
confirm that a compelling reason would not be the mother&#146;s
indecision, for more than 42 days, about who should be named on the
birth
certificate?</div><a name="08061260000074"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061260000242"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> It is my understanding that that would not be a
compelling reason, but perhaps I may enter a caveat. If we are back to
scenarios that might arise, there might be a complication of reasons,
such as 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column245" />Column number: 245</div>a combination of extreme distress that one&#146;s partner had died, a
difficult birth and, as a consequence, mental or physical health
matters impinging on the mother&#146;s ability to start her life
again and register her child. However, one must be absolutely precise.
Whether to put the father on the birth certificate might be part of
that situation, but the case that the hon. Gentleman mentioned, of
thinking, &#147;I am not quite sure; I need a few more days to think
about it,&#148; would not be enough. That would not be acceptable. To
my knowledge, that is not how it has operated until now and there is no
reason to believe that it should
change.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061260000246"></a>Mark
Simmonds:</b> On a point of order, Mr. Hood.
Perhaps we could have a point of clarification from the Chair. I want
to understand why Government amendment No. 104 is detailed under clause
53, when in fact it is an amendment to schedule
6.</div>
<a name="08061260000081"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061260000247"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman for his question. It
is a matter of selection. The amendment was deemed relevant to the
debate, and that is why it has been
selected.</div>
<a name="08061260000082"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061260000248"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> The Bill sets out the provisions regarding
legal parenthood for same-sex couples following assisted conception.
The provisions allow for the female partner of the woman giving birth,
whether in a civil partnership or not, to be entered as a parent at
birth registration&#151;that is a debate that we have had over a
series of clauses.</div>
<a name="08061260000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">Something
else happens at birth registration, which is why there is a
cross-reference with legislation in other clauses. At birth
registration, some statistical information is collected under statute
by the registrar. It relates to the mother&#146;s and father&#146;s
ages and, if they are married, the date of marriage, whether the mother
has been married before and the number of children born to the mother.
The information that the registrar is required to collect is set out in
the Population (Statistics) Act 1938. As a result of the measures in
the Bill, the questions asked when registering the birth require
amendment, as the existing wording would be inappropriate for same-sex
couples.</div>
<a name="08061260000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
makes the necessary changes to the 1938 Act&#151;we were required to
do it this way round&#151;in order to allow for the collection of
information relating to the age of the same-sex parents and the date of
any civil partnership, where applicable, so as to treat same-sex 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column246" />Column number: 246</div>parents the same as other parents. This is a requirement beyond the Bill
about the collection of statistics and other things under the 1938 Act
and the registration of birth. That is why I presume, as you said,
Mr. Hood, that all the references that occur in another
clause are put together here for the substantive debate. It is exactly
the same principle. It is about recording the information.</div>
<a name="08061260000085"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061260000249"></a>Mark
Simmonds:</b> Again, this provision is fairly standard fare
when a Bill will go on to become an Act and amend previous Acts. I
suspect&#151;the Minister may or may not confirm this&#151;that the
reason why amendment No. 61 and subsequent amendments were tabled,
affecting both clause 53 and schedule 6, is that the 1938 Act was
missed off the original list. I am not sure why it is not on the
original list in clause 53(5)(a) to (m). Is the Minister absolutely
confident that the Bill will not impact on any other Acts? I cannot see
anywhere in this clause regulation-making powers to amend other Acts of
Parliament&#151;of 1938, 1927 or 1895&#151;to ensure that the
provisions are comprehensive and that primary legislation is not
required in the future to change Acts that are already in
place.</div>

if it is not clear, there is a power in clause 64 to make consequential

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061260000253"></a>Dr.
Pugh:</b> I have the challenging job of moving an amendment
tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon,
which I will endeavour to do relatively
briefly.</div>
<a name="08061260000100"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061260000254"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> Much more
briefly.</div><a name="08061260000101"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061260000255"></a>Dr.
Pugh:</b> Indeed. I preface this by saying that my hon. Friend
and I do not see eye to eye on many issues in the Bill, but I am doing
this in a spirit of charity and comradeship and not necessarily because
I see it as anything other than a probing amendment to which the
Minister may want to respond.</div>
<a name="08061260000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before I
discuss the amendment, I have a brief observation about the whole
clause. Throughout the previous part of the legislation, when we were
trying to tease out the rights of the person who has given non-genetic
material&#151;cytoplasm&#151;to the IVF process, we rigidly defined
motherhood along the lines of child bearing. I have got that clear in
my head. The mother is the person who bears the child and not the one
who produces the genetic material that forms the child. I understand
that. Here, interestingly, we decouple that. We allow it to be
decoupled in a way which is probably quite novel. Always under
surrogacy, there has been some decoupling. Now we have the clear
concept of motherhood being viewed in two different ways by the same
bit of legislation.</div>
<a name="08061260000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">Returning to
my hon. Friend&#146;s amendment, the crucial issue to which I will
draw hon. Members&#146; attention is probably the very first section
of parental orders in which he has a objection to the word &#147;two
people&#148; and wishes to eliminate &#147;two&#148;. He suggests
that now that the concept of supportive parenting has been established,
it seems timely to ensure that single parents should have the
opportunity to apply for a parental order following surrogacy. He
suggests that that would make the law consistent with current adoption
law, which allows applications from single people and couples. The 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column248" />Column number: 248</div>amendment that he proposed would bring the legislation in line with the
current adoption law.</div>
<a name="08061260000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon.
Friend&#146;s key point is that when the Bill refers to a
couple&#151;a same-sex couple, a civil partnership or a married
couple&#151;additional phrasing would allow a couple to be defined in
the same way as in the legislation, but he adds to that that one person
who is not married or a civil partner is also a potential beneficiary
of a parental order. He wishes to stress that his point is purely to
make the provision consistent with adoption
law.</div><a name="08061260000105"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061260000256"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> Surrogacy is a complex area. I shall start by
responding to the hon. Gentleman. As far as surrogacy is concerned, the
mother who gives birth is the mother. Parental orders, like adoption
orders, transfer parenthood after birth. In my view, there is a
difference, and I will seek to explain why before asking him not to
press the
amendments.</div><a name="08061260000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under
the 1990 Act, it is possible to make parental orders transferring
parenthood only to married couples. The Bill extends the provisions to
include civil partners and couples who are not in a civil partnership
or married, but who are living as partners in an enduring relationship.
A parental order is awarded by a court, subject to the report of the
parental order reporter, who visits the parties concerned and prepares
a report on whether the provisions of the law are met&#151;for
example, whether the woman who carried the child has freely given her
unconditional
consent.</div><a name="08061260000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">Surrogacy
arrangements are not in themselves enforceable in law, although, when
making decisions about whether or not to grant a
parental order, the courts will take into account factors such
as&#151;as we would expect&#151;where it would be in the best
interests of the child to be brought up. The Bill does not extend
parental orders to single people. As the hon. Gentleman said, the
amendments seek to change that with regard to surrogacy. It is
interesting to note that surrogacy has rarely featured in the scrutiny
and the debates that have taken place on the review of the 1990 Act and
the Bill. Arguments for the change to access to parental orders, which
the amendments seek, have surfaced only
recently.</div><a name="08061260000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before
I answer the specific points, it might be useful to recap by saying
that surrogacy is such a sensitive issue, fraught with potential
complications such as the surrogate mother being entitled to change her
mind and decide to keep her baby, that the 1990 Act quite specifically
limits parental orders to married couples where the gametes of at least
one of them are used. That recognises the magnitude of a situation in
which a person becomes pregnant with the express intention of handing
the child over to someone else, and the responsibility that that places
on the people who will receive the child. There is an argument, which
the Government have acknowledged in the Bill, that such a
responsibility is likely to be better handled by a couple than a single
man or
woman.</div><a name="08061260000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
would say to the hon. Gentleman that there is a difference. His point
was that single people are able to adopt and to receive IVF, so why can
they not get a parental order over surrogacy? The difference is this:
adoption involves a child who already exists and whose parents are not
able to keep the child, for whom new parents are sought. That is
different, which is why there  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column249" />Column number: 249</div>is no parallel. IVF involves a woman becoming pregnant herself and
giving birth to her child&#151;there is not a direct parallel.
Surrogacy, however, involves agreeing to hand over a child even before
conception. The Government are still of the view that the magnitude of
that means that it is best dealt with by a couple. That is why we have
made the arrangements that we
have.</div><a name="08061260000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for raising the debate, but I say to
him that in the Government&#146;s view, discussions about surrogacy
should be dealt with elsewhere and not by amending the Bill, because
the issues involved are complex and the debate has not been properly
considered due to its late emergence as an issue in the
Bill.</div>

out subsection
(4).</div><a name="08061260000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister was absolutely right to confirm that this is a complex and
difficult area. I was pleased on Tuesday when she reassured the
Committee that she would take away the whole area of surrogacy and, as
was confirmed in the pre-legislative scrutiny Committee, look at the
matter in more detail in the context of the Surrogacy Arrangements Act
1985, which is the foundation from which all current surrogacy
legislation
flows.</div><a name="08061260000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
suspect that the hon. Member for Southport agrees with the position of
both the Minister and myself with regard to the amendments that we have
just discussed. This Committee is the wrong place to get into a
detailed discussion about making the surrogacy legislation even more
complex and&#151;to be blunt&#151;confused than it is already. I
agree with the Minister that in this particular context, surrogacy is
better handled by a couple than by a single individual.</div>
<a name="08061260000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
relates to subsection (4), in which either one or both of the
applicants must be domiciled in the United Kingdom or the Channel
Islands, or in the Isle of Man. I understand from legal advice that the
subsection is inconsistent with section 2 of the British Nationality
Act 1981, which states that a person born outside the UK is a British
citizen if, at the time of his or her birth, his father or mother is a
British citizen, other than by descent. This may be a very difficult
area that the Minister cannot respond to now, but it would be helpful
is she could explain in writing how the Bill and the Act are
reconciled. If they are not reconciled, why is section 2 of the British
Nationality Act not being amended to take account of the fact that both
applicants must be domiciled in the United Kingdom? That appears, at
least on the surface, to be in direct conflict with section 2 of that
Act.</div><a name="08061260000118"></a>

relationship to which I referred earlier. I am 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column250" />Column number: 250</div>informed that there are about 50 lawful surrogate arrangements a year
through applications for parental orders. That indicates to me that in
the current system, the conflict with the Nationality Act that the hon.
Gentleman refers to does not appear to have been raised, but as he has
brought up that issue I shall go back and check, and write to him as
quickly as I can. I have a feeling that if there was a conflict, we
would have known about it by now through the interaction of the two
Acts, but it is possible that there is a problem and I will certainly
look at that. I am grateful for his probing

amendment.</div><a name="08061260000197"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.45

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061260000261"></a>Mark
Simmonds:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 177, in
clause 54, page 47, line 13, after
&#145;wife&#146;, insert</div> <div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;who,
in the case of couples who are neither married nor in a civil
partnership, must have been in a relationship for a minimum period of
twelve
months.&#146;.</div><a name="08061260000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment would insert a provision whereby couples who fall within the
category in the clause but who are not married or in a civil
partnership must have been in a prior relationship, and would stipulate
a minimum time period for that relationship. Some hon. Members may feel
that it is nit-picking, but I draw their attention to the differences
between various provisions of clause 54. Subsection (2) refers to an
&#147;enduring family relationship&#148;, but subsection (11), the
retrospective provision, makes no reference to it. Is that a drafting
oversight, or is there a specific reason why an enduring family
relationship is not relevant for those trying to obtain retrospective
parental orders under the Bill that they could not obtain under the
1990
Act?</div><a name="08061260000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another
point that I wish to make&#151;I hope to catch your eye if we get to
a stand part debate, Mr. Hood&#151;is that greater
clarification seems to be needed of what an enduring family
relationship is. As has been said, there is absolutely no necessity for
a couple, whether same-sex or different-sex, to be in an intimate
relationship to get the benefit of many of the clauses that we have
discussed. I am trying to establish why there is a difference between
subsections of the clause, and particularly why subsection (11) does
not state that an enduring relationship is a fundamental requirement
for getting a parental
order.</div><a name="08061260000123"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061260000262"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> I can see that you are following what the hon.
Gentleman says as closely as I am, Mr. Hood, as we go
delicately through these important issues. Most of us were listening
intently. <i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> I was. It is very
important, and I want to understand exactly what the hon. Gentleman is
saying, although the tone of my voice made me sound as though I did not
mean
it.</div><a name="08061260000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
54 relates to how parenthood may be transferred by a court order when a
woman has carried a child as a surrogate on behalf of a couple who
cannot have children themselves. Under the 1990 Act, parental orders
transferring parenthood can only be made for married couples. As I have
mentioned, the Bill extends the provision to include civil partners and
couples who are not married or in a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column251" />Column number: 251</div>civil partnership but who live as partners in an enduring family
relationship, which is what the hon. Gentleman&#146;s questions deal
with.</div>
<a name="08061260000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">When the 1990
Act was introduced, it included a provision allowing married couples
who had had a child through surrogacy before the Act came into force to
apply retrospectively for a parental order. The Bill mirrors that by
including a similar provision for people who were not entitled to apply
for a parental order before because they were not married. They must
apply within six months of clause 54 coming into
force.</div><a name="08061260000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman&#146;s amendment would add that a couple applying
retrospectively must have been in a relationship for a minimum of 12
months if they are not married or in a civil partnership. Surrogacy can
be a route that couples look to when they are unable to have children
themselves, and I do not believe&#151;I am sure that members of the
Committee do not either&#151;that couples would enter into it
lightly. The process of a couple deciding that they are both happy with
such an arrangement is complex, and they have to find a surrogate who
would be suitable to carry their child. That can take a number of
years, so in most cases, the couple will have gone through the process
together. In addition, when the court is considering the application,
it would have to be satisfied that the couple were in an enduring
family relationship for the parental order to be granted. As part of
that consideration, it is more than likely that the court will consider
the length of the couple&#146;s relationship as well as their
commitment to each other. The Government are prepared to continue with
the arrangement whereby the family division of the High Court would
take the decisions on what made for an enduring relationship that was
suitable and in the best interests of the child for a parental order to
be
made.</div><a name="08061260000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is no reference to this enduring family relationship in subsection
(11), to which the hon. Gentleman referred, because to make an
application to the court under section 54, if the couple are not
married or in a civil partnership, they must be in an enduring family
relationship. Therefore, it is not necessary for it to be in the
legislation in the way that the hon. Gentleman is suggesting.</div>
<a name="08061260000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am sure
that the hon. Gentleman would agree with the principle that the family
division of the High Court, with its experience, is the best place to
test whether a relationship is an enduring one. That decision is better
made by the courts than by Parliament seeking to put in place arbitrary
time periods or definitions, however well meaning we may want to be.
The ultimate test when issuing the parental order is what is best for
the child.</div>
<a name="08061260000129"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061260000263"></a>Mark
Simmonds:</b> Of course I accept that couples would not enter
into a surrogacy arrangement lightly, and the Minister was quite right
to point out that, more often than not, that process can take a number
of years. I also understand her comments about the High Court
considering the length of the relationship. However, I want to put on
record the fact that we are talking about different categories. There
is a difference between people looking forward to what may happen in
the future and enabling a retrospective decision to be made. I
understand the Minister&#146;s explanation. It may also be
interesting for the Committee to know whether the Minister has a view
about how many retrospective cases there might be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column252" />Column number: 252</div>under subsection (11) once the Bill has been enacted and about how many
of those will be same-sex couples, or different-sex
couples.</div>
<a name="08061260000130"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061260000264"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> The Government will have no idea about that as
it is not possible to measure. However, as I said during the earlier
debate on the British Nationality Act 1981, there were something like
50 applications a year for parental orders involving surrogacy. It is
not a huge number, but parental orders are considered on a case-by-case
basis by the High Court.</div>
<a name="08061260000131"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061260000265"></a>Mark
Simmonds:</b> I am grateful to the Minister. The purpose of
the amendment was to ensure that there are no loopholes in the

Key</b> (Salisbury) (Con): Schedule 6 is an enormous part of
the Bill; it is 27 pages long and, in the other place, it received
substantial scrutiny. Other things have happened since, so I wish to
ask the Minister to clarify one or two points.</div>
<a name="08061260000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">On 12
December 2007, Baroness Deech noted in another place that birth
certificates are used for all purposes and that they will be used all
over the increasingly globalised world of proof of this and that. She
argued that birth certificates should therefore focus on the
child&#146;s origins, not the situation of the parents. Baroness
Barker disagreed,
arguing:</div><a name="08061260000188"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
birth certificate is not a certificate of somebody&#146;s genetic
identity...but...a record of who a child&#146;s social
parents are at any time&#148;.</div>
<a name="08061260000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">The title of
schedule 6 is &#147;Amendments relating to parenthood in cases
involving assisted reproduction&#148;. The Minister in the other
place, Baroness Royall,
argued:</div><a name="08061260000189"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Bill allows that same-sex couples, whether in a civil partnership or
being treated together, can both be legal parents of a child born
through assisted conception. For these provisions to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column253" />Column number: 253</div>be fully legally recognised, the Bill includes amendments to other Acts
to allow birth certificates under UK, Scottish and Northern Irish law
to record that&#148;.&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, House of Lords,</i>
12 December 2007; Vol. 697, c. 296-99.]</div>
<a name="08061260000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">That seemed to be all
very certain. However, on 4 February 2008, on Third Reading, Lord
Jenkin tabled an amendment that would have meant that within four years
of schedule 6 coming into force, the Secretary of State would carry out
a review of the law and practice to decide whether to include donor
conception on birth certificates. Baroness Royall resisted the
amendment, but made a commitment that the Government would carry out a
review. She
said:</div><a name="08061260000190"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I
can make a firm commitment that the Government will carry out a review
of practices in informing donor-conceived children of the fact of their
donor conception and whether there is a need for a change in the law to
best ensure that donor-conceived children are informed of their donor
conception. We will do this within the timeframe suggested by the
amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord
Jenkin&#148;.&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, House of Lords,</i>
4 February 2008; Vol. 698, c.
904.]</div><a name="08061260000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
also seemed to make the matter clear, but on 2 June, the
Secretary of State for Work and Pensions and the Secretary of State for
Children, Schools and Families, issued their White Paper, &#147;Joint
birth registration: recording responsibility&#148;, chapter 1,
paragraph 5 of which
states:</div><a name="08061260000191"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;This
White Paper focuses on the way the birth registration system applies to
unmarried parents and their children, particularly from the
child&#146;s perspective. It does not cover the birth registration
process for married couples, which works well and where we do not
propose to make any changes. Nor does it cover changes to birth
certificates arising from adoption...or from the changes proposed
in the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Bill to allow a same-sex
couple to be recorded as parents at birth. Further consideration of the
latter will be needed once that Bill has passed through
Parliament&#148;.</div><a name="08061260000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will
the Minister explain whether the 27 pages of the Bill that we appear to
be about to nod through will be wiped off the statute book by future
Government considerations when they legislate on the document
&#147;Joint birth registration: recording responsibility&#148;? I
am sure that the Minister has a very fine answer for us and I would be
grateful to hear it before we

Pugh:</b> I have the same concerns about the schedule. If we
are honest, few of us have mastered the complete detail of this
horrendously large provision. It amends legislation&#151;indeed, we
have seen this in the past few minutes&#151;that stretches from 1928
to about
1995.</div><a name="08061260000144"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061260000269"></a>Dr.
Pugh:</b> I stand corrected.</div>
<a name="08061260000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are
confronted with an adjustment to the law that is of byzantine
complexity, but we are implicitly being asked to believe that there is
a kind of coherence to it, even though we have not established that
there is&#151;we must take that on faith. I am sure that we have
enormous faith in the ability of parliamentary draftsmen to guarantee
the integrity and coherence of the law, but I can hear the alarm bells
ringing.</div>
<a name="08061260000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">If anything,
those alarm bells grew louder last night when I inspected a website
devoted to fathers&#146; interests that explains how fathers can
successfully deal with any threat to those interests. The website put
enormous 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column254" />Column number: 254</div>stress on the importance of the birth certificate&#151;what it means
and how fathers can use it to get the rights, the access to their
children and the responsibilities that they feel they
deserve.</div>
<a name="08061260000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">There was a
naïve belief that the birth certificate had clarity, but that
can no longer be established. If there is a dispute in the House of
Lords between people who should know whether the birth certificate is
supposed to indicate genetic origin or social parenting, the ordinary
public will suffer from a certain vagueness.</div>
<a name="08061260000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061260000270"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> With respect, the quote that the hon. Gentleman
attributes to me, in which I used the word &#147;symbolic&#148; in
relation to birth certificates, was not a general statement. I was
speaking&#151;following on from the 2003 Act&#151;about specific
circumstances in which the father or parent is deceased. I was not
making a general point about the symbolism or otherwise of entries on
the birth certificate. The hon. Gentleman should not take the specific
for the general and assume that it reads across, because it does
not.</div>
<a name="08061260000151"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061260000271"></a>Dr.
Pugh:</b> In no sense was I attempting to do that. However, we
have established in the case of a deceased parent who does not
contribute sperm to the IVF process that the entry on the birth
certificate would indicate neither a social role nor genetic origin. We
are in a very confused situation, although I am not sure whether we can
rectify it in this Committee.</div>
<a name="08061260000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Salisbury talked about whether donor conception should be
indicated on the birth certificate. I stand to be reasoned with for or
against on the issue and I have no fixed views, but donor-conceived
adults should know their genetic history. If there is no way for them
automatically to find that out&#151;if nobody tells them and they
make no inquiries&#151;they could be asked in the doctor&#146;s
surgery whether they have a certain disease, and they would, in all
honesty and with complete integrity, make an inaccurate and false claim
because there was no such disease in what they thought was their
family. That is a concern.</div>
<a name="08061260000153"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061260000272"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> Does the hon. Gentleman not accept that the
same could, regrettably, apply to people&#146;s genetic make-up now?
We put absolute trust in our parents to ensure that we know such
things. With IVF, parents are put in exactly the same position of trust
in ensuring that their children know these things. The legislation
loops around.</div>
<a name="08061260000154"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061260000273"></a>Dr.
Pugh:</b> Yes, we could be wrong about our genetic inheritance
and our parents could mislead us, but they would do us a disservice,
particularly as we are learning that disease profiles are related to
one&#146;s genetic
disposition.</div><a name="08061260000155"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061260000274"></a>Robert
Key:</b> I believe that what the Minister said needs
qualifying. Of course it is true that we trust our parents to tell us
whether they are in fact our parents, but unfortunately we know that in
one live birth in 10 the mother does not know who the father is. That
evidence was given to the Joint Committee. More important today is that
there is a difference between trusting our parents and trusting the
state. To be involved in state 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column255" />Column number: 255</div>deception, with the state preventing a child from knowing its genetic
antecedents, is quite another matter.</div>
<a name="08061260000156"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061260000275"></a>Dr.
Pugh:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes a good point. The state is
knowingly putting people in a position less advantaged than they
ordinarily have. I believe that legal opinion ought to be sought on the
matter, because there is a human rights issue to be decided. The state
knows something that the individual does not. The individual may
consult the state medical service, which may ask a genuine question,
but that person cannot answer adequately because he has no means of
doing so.</div>
<a name="08061260000157"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061260000276"></a>Mark
Simmonds:</b> The hon. Gentleman may not be aware that legal
advice has been sought, but counsel&#146;s advice is that it may be
against the human rights of the child knowingly to remove potential
genetic knowledge&#151;perhaps preventing the child from benefiting
from treatment to resolve a genetic inheritance problem because the
information had been removed from the birth
certificate.</div><a name="08061260000158"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061260000277"></a>Dr.
Pugh:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that
intervention. It supplements the point that I was
making.</div>
<a name="08061260000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">The more
fundamental point is explicit. It is that people have almost a moral
right to know of what they are made. That is over and above what human
rights legislation provides. The state should not be seen to frustrate
that. We have opened up a wide debate, possibly going beyond schedule
6, but those concerns will re-emerge on
Report.</div><a name="08061260000160"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08061260000278"></a><b class="B">Dr.
Evan Harris</b> (Oxford, West and Abingdon) (LD): Before the
Committee goes down the human rights path, it is probably worth
considering the report of the Joint Committee on Human Rights on the
issue. As the hon. Member for Boston and Skegness said, at best it is a
potential right&#151;in other words, the right to know is
engaged&#151;but no case law in Europe or here has established any
sort of actionable right, not even against the
state.</div>
<a name="08061260000161"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061260000279"></a>Dr.
Pugh:</b> I thank my hon. Friend for that intervention. I am
reluctant to get into esoteric debates about human rights. My hon.
Friend is a fundamentalist on human rights in a way that possibly I am
not. The point is that I know discrimination when I stare at it; in
this case, we appear to be staring at discrimination facilitated by the
state.</div>
<a name="08061260000162"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061260000280"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> Fundamentalist or otherwise, I am grateful for the
opportunity to speak again. I am conscious of the fact that we might
debate the subject further when we come to one of the new clauses, but
it is important to clarify a number of things.</div>
<a name="08061260000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">I support the
Government&#146;s position on this part of the Bill and their
approach to birth certificates. I know that that view is not shared
across my party; for us, it is a free vote issue, and Baroness Barker
took a different view in the House of Lords. She was entitled to do
that, and she did so effectively. I respect her sincere views on the
matter, but birth certificates are a statement of legal parenthood, and
it does not necessarily relate to genetic parenthood.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column256" />Column number: 256</div><a name="08061260000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Salisbury spoke of one in 10. Some research studies show
that as many as 10 per cent. of children believe their social father to
be their genetic father when he is not; whether the mother knows who is
the father is a separate issue. The child does not know in
non-paternity cases far more frequently than in assisted reproduction.
There is clearly a difference if the state has the information, but in
respect of allowing children to know who their genetic parents are, the
Government have chosen not to tell the children directly, and not to
force parents but merely to encourage them to do
so.</div><a name="08061260000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is best practice, and it is right that the Government&#146;s funding
approach promotes it. That is right and proper. Maybe I am being a
fundamentalist about not being statist on the matter, but I do not
think that it is the state&#146;s role to wade into families, disrupt
the family dynamic and tell them what to do. It would be going over the
heads of parents, who are entitled to some privacy about non-paternity
and, if they choose not to tell their children&#151;regrettably, in
my view&#151;about assisted
reproduction.</div><a name="08061260000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
point has been made that that puts such children at a disadvantage in
terms of family history if they see a doctor, but non-paternity is far
more frequent than assisted reproduction. As we know, even where one
cannot access identifying information about a donor, it is always open
to a child who knows to get that information as an adult. Parents have
their children&#146;s best interests at heart and will be aware if
there is an issue of familial disease that will bear strongly on their
children.</div><a name="08061260000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is no perfect solution. There are significant drawbacks in seeking to
specify over the heads of parents that children should be notified or
birth certificates marked. Birth certificates are public
documents&#151;well, they are not public documents, but they must be
produced on certain occasions&#151;and people have a right to
privacy.</div>
<a name="08061260000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">To finish
with the human rights issue, it is often stated&#151;it was stated,
incorrectly, in the House of Lords&#151;that there is some human
right to know one&#146;s genetic parents. If that is the case, one
would have a right to perform paternity tests on one&#146;s father or
lie detector tests on one&#146;s mother, overriding their right to
privacy. That is not the case. Fathers and mothers have a right to
privacy. If we go down that path and follow that idea to its full
conclusion&#151;I do not suggest that hon. Members are saying that we
should&#151;there will be implications. I shall not read it out, but
I draw the Committee&#146;s attention to pages 56 and 57 of the Joint
Committee&#146;s report, which clarifies that the Rose case showed
that article 8 was engaged on private life, but that that case was
never decided in respect of what balance must be found between the
person&#146;s and the parents&#146;
rights.</div><a name="08061260000169"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061260000281"></a>Dr.
Pugh:</b> My hon. Friend spoke about maternity. The sort of
case that most acutely affects me is one in which, for example, the
child of a donor egg was female and a strong history of breast cancer,
which has a virulent genetic component, was attached to the donor
family. Would that not be putting somebody at a serious and possibly
even fatal
disadvantage?</div><a name="08061260000170"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061260000282"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> Yes. Clearly, people who have inherited a genetic
disease are at a disadvantage. That is also the case where a male
transmits a disease unbeknown to the person who inherits it. Believe
me, I know about the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column257" />Column number: 257</div>tragedy of serious inherited genetic disease, but the fact that such
things happen does not mean that we need to override parents&#146;
rights.</div>
<a name="08061260000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">The issues
are difficult, but I think that the Government have taken the right
approach. They have said that they will review the matter, and we must
remember that when the Government removed donor anonymity&#151;I
thought that that was wrong and that there should be a
choice&#151;they chose not to force parents to tell their children of
the fact of donor conception. When donors are identifiable, there is an
increased risk that parents will not tell their children, so the result
is more secrecy, not less, because parents believe&#151;wrongly, but
quite naturally&#151;that children will try to find their genetic
parent. The issues are complex, but in this Bill, the Government have
got it right. Although the schedule is complex, I support its overall
approach.</div><a name="08061260000172"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08061260000283"></a><b class="B">Dr.
Brian Iddon</b> (Bolton, South-East) (Lab): Before the
Minister responds&#151;I expected this discussion to take place under
new clause 1, but it has been generated now&#151;has she given any
thought to the suggestion floated by one organisation that we should
have a short and a long birth certificate? The short one would be
essentially the one that we use now to obtain various services and
produce to show what parents brought us up in a social way. At the same
time, if it is a donor-conceived birth, a long birth certificate would
be presented to the parents, which could be kept confidential, wherever
those parents wish to keep it. When they think that the time is right
to tell the child who is conceived in this way about its genetic
background, they could present the long birth certificate to the child.
I have not given the idea much thought, but it is worthy of
consideration by the Committee&#151;and by the review, when it takes
place.</div><a name="08061260000199"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.15

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061260000284"></a>Mark
Simmonds:</b> I would like to join other hon. Members who have
spoken in the debate and again express my concern about schedule 6. As
my hon. Friend the Member for Salisbury rightly pointed out, the
schedule is extremely lengthy, detailed and complex. I do not wish to
repeat what others have said, but I want to support the points made by
my hon. Friend and the hon. Member for Southport on the seeming
conflict that exists in Government policy direction. The Bill says, on
page 73, in paragraph
4(3)(1B):</div><a name="08061260000192"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
registrar shall not enter in the register the name of any woman as a
parent of the child by virtue of that
section&#148;.</div><a name="08061260000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
goes on to make some exceptions. That throws up the question of the
necessity and importance of a mother, as well as the importance and
necessity of a father, which we debated on the Floor of the House a
little while ago. That seems to be the policy direction in the Bill,
but let us look at the White Paper just released by the Department for
Work and Pensions. A press release from the Secretary of State for
Children, Schools and Families quotes from the foreword by the two
Ministers, which says that the White
Paper</div><a name="08061260000193"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;sets
out...measures to promote and support joint birth registration and
changes to give mothers a right to insist that the father acknowledges
his responsibilities to his child by registering on the birth
certificate. Equally, it gives a father a new right to insist that he
is
registered.&#148;</div><a name="08061260000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
accept that that is not yet legislative change. Those are
non-legislative measures. However, the press release 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column258" />Column number: 258</div>goes on to say that the two Departments will jointly develop further
legislation within the Government, which throws out the question of how
the interactions will occur and whether they will fit comfortably
alongside each other. That seems to be, at the very least, a conflict
of direction.</div>
<a name="08061260000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not wish
to get into the detail of the debate on new clause 1, which will occur
later in Committee. We need to raise specific issues in some detail
when we come to discuss that new clause. However, there appears to be
an inconsistency. We have to acknowledge that there have been
inconsistencies for some time on the contents of birth certificates.
They have not always been an exact genetic record of the child, but
that does not mean that the state should be complicit in making them
less of an accurate record. I am sure that later we will have the
genetic versus social debate, but the birth certificate is an important
document. I am nervous about the state colluding in what is,
ultimately, a  deception on behalf of the as yet unborn
child.</div><a name="08061260000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
can get into the legal wrangling later on, but I am nervous&#151;the
hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon made the point, although he
seemed to dismiss it rather quickly&#151;that we could disadvantage a
child who may well have a familial disease by not having an accurate
record on the birth certificate. We should discuss the suggestion made
by the hon. Member for Bolton, South-East, because it is a potential
solution to the problem. I have wrestled with the issue for a
considerable time and I think that I have come to a
conclusion&#151;although there are circumstances in which it would
not be possible&#151;that wherever and as much as possible the birth
certificate should be a biological record of the
child.</div><a name="08061260000178"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061260000285"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> The hon. Member for Salisbury put the matter
clearly. We have gone into other discussions that buttress that, but I
want to answer his three points specifically, without drifting into new
clause 1, which we will debate later. The Bill, set within the specific
parameters of IVF, continually cross-references and refers to the need
for the parents to be responsible for the child, except where the
parent, including the father, is deceased. In that context, all hon.
Members agree that, as I have said in our proceedings, the decision to
have a child should not be taken lightly and carries with it
responsibilities. That is continually reinforced in the Bill. It is
about caring, nurturing, supporting and providing for that
child.</div><a name="08061260000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">Schedule
6 cross-references, for same-sex couples, the responsibilities that we
are updating in the Bill in respect of the 1990 Act with every other
piece of legislation on registration and responsibilities for a
child.</div><a name="08061260000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
second point made by the hon. Member for Salisbury, which was also
considered in the debate in another place, was about whether the fact
that a child was donor-conceived should appear on their birth
certificate. The point about transmission of genetic predispositions to
certain diseases for donor-conceived children is already dealt with, as
all donors are screened. We know a huge amount about such things now,
so unless a condition is not known about, it is less likely that a
donor-conceived child will be at a disadvantage, as the hon. Member for
Southport mentioned, than that anyone else will, because their genetic
parent will have been actively screened before conception. It is a
long, difficult process and the donor enters into that
consideration.</div>

way?</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061260000287"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> I should just like to make the general points
to get them on the record, but after that I am happy for the hon.
Gentleman to respond. I should like to state my case
first.</div><a name="08061260000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before
we go down the highways and byways of human rights and everything else,
it is good to mention that the Joint Committee on Human Rights said
that it was concerned about the suggestion that the donor information
should appear on the birth certificate, because it felt that it raised
serious concerns about the privacy of the donor as well as of the
donor-conceived individual. On that basis, the Government recognised
that this was a highly complicated issue and that other considerations
were in place, including &#147;telling and talking&#148; projects
and counselling. We accepted in another place that it would be
sensible, after the Bill receives Royal Assent&#151;we 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column260" />Column number: 260</div>cannot start before then&#151;for us to consider the matter and return
to the House within four
years.</div><a name="08061260000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
final point was about what the Department for Work and Pensions record
says. The DWP White Paper, which was written before the
Bill&#151;although the Bill is going the way the White Paper wants to
go&#151;is about the responsibility of parents. That has been
recognised, specifically, in the context of a commitment to the
upbringing of the child, financially and otherwise. The White Paper
addresses that point, which is already dealt with in the Bill. The Bill
also includes a cross-reference to the child support legislation to
ensure that there is a commitment in that regard. Although the White
Paper was written without reference to the details in the Bill, which
has yet to receive Royal Assent, the Bill does not contradict it. In
fact, the White Paper talks about bringing everything up to the point
where all parents are responsible, including mothers and fathers and
those in civil partnerships and relationships. That is a different
discussion.</div><a name="08061260000186"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">It
