<P>
<B> Mr. Andrew Lansley </B>(South Cambridgeshire): I beg to move amendment No. 173, in page 18, line 25, leave out `or' and insert `and'.
<P>
<B> The Chairman:</B> With this we may take the following amendments: No. 171, in page 18, line 25, leave out from `person' to end of line 27 and insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and 
<P>
(b) protecting competition 
<P>
he may give such directions as are required for the purpose. 
<P>
(2A) In determining whether to give directions in accordance with subsection (2) the Director shall have regard to  
<P>
(a) the seriousness of the alleged infringement; 
<P>
(b) the likelihood that the infringement will be established at the completion of his investigation; 
<P>
(c) whether the imposition of a fine under this Act or an award of damages would provide an adequate remedy for that alleged infringement; and 
<P>
(d) the balance of convenience in giving or not giving such a direction.'.<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
No. 174, in page 18, line 26, leave out `the public interest' and insert `competition'. 
<P>
<B> Mr. Lansley:</B> If amendment No. 171 were moved and accepted, amendments Nos. 173 and 174 would fall. All the amendments relate to clause 36(2), under which the director general, if he has a reasonable suspicion relating to either of the two prohibitions, can, if necessary and as a matter of urgency, propose interim measures. Under what circumstances should the director general take such measures? 
<P>
The amendment would circumscribe or perhaps amplify the circumstances in which the director general could impose interim measures. The current provision is reasonable up to a point. Thus, subsection (2)(a)  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"of preventing serious, irreparable damage to a particular person or category of person"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
is a necessary test, but should we go beyond that and apply further conditions? 
<P>
The test that I want to apply derives from guidelines set in courts. I may be stretching myself since I am not a lawyer, but it is clear from guidelines laid down by the House of Lords in the case of American Cyanamid v. Ethicon Ltd. that a range of tests needs to be applied when interim measures are sought. Amendment No. 171 would set them out in proposed new subsection (2A). 
<P>
<B> Dr. Phyllis Starkey </B>(Milton Keynes, South-West): Is the hon. Gentleman proposing that the director general should intervene only if both conditions preventing irreparable damage to a person and protecting competition are applicable, or is only one or the other condition sufficient for the director general to intervene? 
<P>
<B> The Chairman:</B> Mr. Lansley preferably standing up. 
<P>
<B> Mr. Lansley:</B> Yes, indeed, Mr. Maxton, I was not proposing to speak without standing. 
<P>
If the hon. Lady looks carefully at the amendment I am doing so to ensure that I do not mislead her or the Committee she will find that I am not proposing to change the test other than by the insertion of "and". It is implicit in the first test of preventing irreparable damage to a particular person that such damage would itself damage competition  
<P>
<B> Dr. Starkey:</B> rose  
<P>
<B> Mr. Lansley:</B> Will the hon. Lady forgive me? Let me explain the point she sought clarification. The danger lies in the "or" of paragraph (a) or (b) in subsection (2): protecting the public interest could not be justified by reference to particular damage caused to a person or category of person or even to damage to competition. 
<P>
<B> Dr. Starkey:</B> I seek clarification. I understand that the hon. Gentleman proposes that the director general should not be able to act simply to prevent serious, irreparable damage to a person unless that also protected the public interest. That is my understanding of the difference between "or" and "and". 
<P>
<B> Mr. Lansley:</B> The hon. Lady would be right if we were dealing with two sets, one of which comprises the other. Therefore, 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"preventing serious, or irreparable damage to a particular person or category of person".<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
relates in this context to competition. The damage that would occur would essentially be through the anti-competitive activity, agreement or undertaking that has occurred, or by reference to an abuse of a dominant position. The Bill is intended to prevent distortions to competition. In so far as damage arises, it does so from that distortion.<P>
 
<P>
The reason for having a second limb is that, in some circumstances, the director general may have a reasonable suspicion that there has been an infringement of either of the prohibitions; interim measures may be needed to prevent not serious or irreparable damage but further damage to competition, and hence to protect competition in the marketplace. That is why the amendment is designed to take out the words "the public interest" and substitute "competition". It is reasonable to assume that the damage that would occur under subsection 2(a) is damage arising from the distortion of competition. It is within the context of the Bill. 
<P>
As the hon. Lady says, it is important to have some clarification of the drafting. She has taken me off into the second part of what I was going to say. It is important to recognise that in this context, and consistent with the rest of the Bill, we are aiming to pass legislation that is designed to protect competition. I am concerned not to intrude at various points public interest tests that may be quite separate from the tests of distortion and damage to competition. In that context, the reference to competition specifically seems to be a much more appropriate test of whether interim measures should be used. 
<P>
Proposed new subsection (2A) is useful. When the director general seeks to impose interim measures, he ought to apply the tests that courts would apply if they were granting injunctions or other forms of interim relief. The principle at stake is that giving power to investigative bodies rather than the courts ought to be subject to the safeguards. The four tests are designed to reflect those safeguards. They derive from a case in the House of Lords, American Cyanamid v. Ethicon Ltd., which laid guidelines in 1975. 
<P>
I hope that the four tests are reasonably straightforward. The first is that there must be a serious question to be tried, which in this context means that there must be a test of seriousness of the infringement that justifies the imposition of interim measures. Secondly, there must be a reasonable likelihood that the infringement will be established; otherwise, the imposition of interim measures would be disproportionate to the likely outcome of the investigation. Thirdly, there is an adequacy test that is akin to the adequacy of damages test that a court would apply: that the imposition of penalties or an award of damages arising from the proving of an infringement would give rise to an appropriate remedy. Finally, not solely on a financial basis but on a broader balanced test, the balance of convenience must be that it would be best to give such a direction. 
<P>
This is not intended to circumscribe the director general's powers to an extent that he would find excessive. A director general operating under those circumstances may conclude that he would apply such tests. If he fails to do that he might, in any case, find that he would subject to challenge in the courts. 
<P>
However, I think that the Bill should reflect the tests that the director general should apply; they should not be determined at a later stage. I hope that the Government will regard the amendment as valuable for its focus on competition and for setting out in detail the tests that the director general should apply. 
<P>
<B> Dr. Starkey:</B> I have one or two brief comments to make. I remind the Committee that clause 36 is meant to protect businesses from serious or irreparable damage by actions that the director general reasonably suspects of being anti-competitive. The amendments tabled by the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley) seem to water that provision down to an unacceptable degree. 
<P>
I was not convinced by the discussion about the difference between "and" and "or", which seemed to go round in circles. If I understand the hon. Gentleman correctly, if amendment No. 171 were accepted, clause 36(2)(a) would be wrapped up in clause 36(2)(b). So 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"serious, irreparable damage to a particular person"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
would satisfy the condition of protecting competition. 
<P>
That seems ridiculous to me and would make subsection 2(b) unnecessary. If that is not so, the hon. Gentleman is putting himself in a position  
<P>
<B> Mr. Lansley:</B> Will the hon. Lady give way? 
<P>
<B> Dr. Starkey:</B> I will give way when I finish my sentence. The hon. Gentleman is putting himself in a position where an action may cause "serious, irreparable damage" to a person or to a business, but does not, according to him, protect competition. Such an action would not give the director general reason to believe that it was anti-competitive. 
<P>
The amendment goes round in circles and contains redundancies, so I cannot accept it. 
<P>
<B> Mr. Lansley:</B> I am sorry to have interrupted the hon. Lady I was not sure when she was going to finish her sentence. 
<P>
It is not the case that if subsection 2(a) is satisfied, subsection 2(b) has no purpose. On the contrary, if paragraph (a) is satisfied, paragraph (b) is likely to be satisfied as well. However, in certain circumstances the director general should act to protect competition, even though he may not be in a position to demonstrate "serious, irreparable damage" to a person or to a class of persons. That may be because he is unable to attribute damage to a person to give rise to interim measures. 
<P>
Set terms are at stake. It is essential that the director general should be able to assess whether he needs to act to protect competition. He needs to examine whether particular damage gives rise to interim measures.

<P>

<B> Dr. Starkey:</B> I understand the hon. Gentleman's point. I do not accept it, and I think that it contains a great deal of ambiguity. The use of "and" instead of "or" leads to that ambiguity, and I believe that the hon. Gentleman's phrasing could give rise to a situation in which as I have explained a business could be irreparably damaged. That business would not be covered by the proposed amendment because it would not be fulfilling paragraph (b). 
<P>
I wish to make another point about the drawbacks you have described. 
<P>
<B> The Chairman:</B> Order. I remind the hon. Lady that I have not said anything. 
<P>
<B> Dr. Starkey:</B> Indeed not. I shall get better at this as I go along. 
<P>
I turn to the second part of the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire. My attention is particularly drawn to the proposed subsection (2A)(c), which provides for the director general to have regard to 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"whether theaward of damages would provide an adequate remedy for that alleged infringement".<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
That seems to me directly to contradict subsection (2)(a) which provides for the director general to take action for the purpose 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"of preventing serious, irreparable damage to a particular person",<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
since if damage is irreparable, ipso facto no award of damages can constitute an adequate remedy. I point that out merely to demonstrate that the amendment is not internally consistent. 
<P>
<B> Mr. John Hayes </B>(South Holland and the Deepings): I do not want to get into detailed semantics, but would not the hon. Lady accept that the fact that a wrong is irreparable does not necessarily mean that there should not be a degree of remedy? There is a difference between something being irreparable and something being impossible to remedy. 
<P>
<B> Dr. Starkey:</B> I can see that a partial remedy might exist, but I do not think that there can be a complete remedy for irreparable damage. 
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
Clause 36 would at last provide a remedy for businesses it would mostly be small ones that were driven out of business by anti-competitive action on the part of another concern. Most hon. Members will, in calling such activities to mind, think of bus companies that have made a fine art of driving smaller competitors out of business. The clause would allow action to stop the damage during the inquiry into the behaviour that would eventually be ruled anti-competitive. It would allow the competitor who would otherwise be put out of business and be in no way placed to find any damages an adequate remedy to continue. The clause is incredibly important, to small businesses in particular, and I am surprised that the Conservative party, which pretends to be the friend of small businesses, has tabled such an amendment. 
<P>
<B> Mr. Tim Boswell </B>(Daventry): My hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire has explained the amendment pretty extensively and the hon. Member for Milton Keynes, South-West (Dr. Starkey) has performed a service in responding to it. Given that it concerns a deeply legalistic area, the Under-Secretary's response would be helpful. I wait for that, as do the hon. Lady and my hon. Friend. 
<P>
With respect to the first point that the hon. Lady made I hope that she will not try to suggest an Aunt Sally in the Committee we understand that, if we are moving towards the world of chapter I and chapter II prohibition, there is an advantage in some kind of interim measure. I do not find that problematic. However, it should be properly applied and to a manifest ill. My hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire is right to say that the clause is about anti-competitive action, or an aspect of chapter II abuse prohibition not the public interest in general; it does not concern morality or public decency. Perhaps the Minister will confirm that those considerations should not be imported into the relevant test. 
<P>
I must pause slightly over subsection (2)(a) and (b). It is relatively easy to consider a test such as 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"serious, irreparable damage to a particular person or category of person",<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
Which is clearly what the hon. Member for Milton Keynes, South-West had in mind in referring to certain bus companies. On the other hand the test of the public interest is more general, albeit in the context of competition policy. Perhaps the Under-Secretary would say more about what might give rise to those public interest considerations, other than the obvious damage to a limited number of finite companies, which would clearly be embraced by subsection (2)(a). 
<P>
My only other observation is that my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire has again, characteristically, performed a service to the Committee in floating the idea of some matching of damage and consequences. The possible danger with the clause is that, while it is not inherently unreasonable to want to take interim measures to remedy an ill, there would be no matching proportionality as to the nature of measures to be taken. Clearly, they should be keyed to anti-competitive policy and to a purpose, and proper notice should be given. They could eventually be tested and compensation paid if the director general had acted perversely at the expense of the company on which the notice was served. 
<P>
My hon. Friend, in the example that he cited, made a sincere effort to offer the Committee a balancing scheme that should be in the director general's mind when he acts. He should not think, "Something's wrong; it's causing irreparable damage to a company, so we must take interim measure", but, "We have identified a problem, so we must take reasonable measures that are proportionate to the problem". The amendment would provide the clause with the balance that it currently lacks. 
<P>
<B> The Minister for Competition and Consumer Affairs (Mr. Nigel Griffiths):</B> Welcome back, Mr. Maxton. 
<P>
One of the failings of the current competition regime is that serious damage can be inflicted on a company before the authorities can intervene. The director general's ability under the clause to take interim measures pending his final decision will remedy that, and is an important plank in our reform of the current law. We cannot allow the Opposition to weaken or wreck that. 
<P>
We have already provided safeguards against taking interim measures too hastily. We have struck a balance between the alleged perpetrator and the alleged victim. The director general must have a reasonable suspicion that a prohibition has been infringed and that it is necessary for him to act urgently to prevent serious irreparable damage to a particular person or category of person, or to protect the public interest. He must give written notice of his proposed actions and his reasons for them, and take account of representations. The decisions will be appealable; an appeal tribunal's rules allow it to suspend the interim measures while it considers the case. 
<P>
Replacing "the public interest" with "competition" ignores the extent to which chapter II and article 86 provisions cover exploitative as well as anti-competitive conduct. It is important to protect consumers as well as competitors. 
<P>
The requirements that amendment No. 171 sets out are all factors that the director general might take into account. Setting them out in the Bill risks limiting his consideration to them. 
<P>
Amendment Nos. 171 and 174 would replace the public interest criterion with a provision to protect competition. That would make the test narrower; it implies that there are circumstances in which it is necessary for the director general to act urgently to protect the public interest, but that the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire would like to prevent him from acting. Therefore, it is hard to make a case for the amendment. 
<P>
<B> Mr. John Redwood </B>(Wokingham): The Under-Secretary said that spelling out specific examples would be limiting. Yet he told the Committee something different when we asked about the limitations of the main prohibition in clause 2. Will he explain that anomaly? 
<P>
<B> Mr. Griffiths:</B> The right hon. Gentleman, as usual, is wrong. 
<P>
There are two further objections to the change that amendment No. 174 proposes. First, it would move the domestic test away from that which the European Court of Justice has established at European level, and from which the domestic test is drawn. Secondly, it does not recognise that the chapter II prohibition is about more than competition. There is clear authority from its European counterpart, article 86, that it prohibits exploitative pricing by a dominant undertaking. High prices are not in themselves anti-competitive indeed, in so far as they encourage new entrants to a market, they are pro-competitive. So the director general may need to take action against exploitation as well as anti-competitive conduct. More generally, we need to protect consumers, not just competitors. 
<P>
As I said earlier, amendment No. 171 sets out several requirements that the director general must take into account when he decides whether to act. We reject that. 
<P>
<B> Mr. Lansley:</B> Rather than debate whether the chapter II prohibition is intended to protect competition or something that goes beyond competition, will the Under-Secretary at least offer the guarantee that interim measures will not be applied to protect the public interest when the public interest is defined as going beyond the purposes for which the chapter II prohibition is applied in the first instance? 
<P>
<B> Mr. Griffiths:</B> When the director general considers the public interest, I expect that he will take into account such factors for which there has been case law in Europe over the past 25 years. It will be possible to go beyond an anti-competitive measure and take the public interest into account in so far as that ensures that exploitation and anti-competitive conduct are tackled. The hon. Gentleman's amendment would narrow the factors considered so that only anti-competitive conduct could be taken in account. It would not allow exploitation to be taken into account even though the director general may not consider it to be in the public interest.

<P>

<B> Mr. Lansley:</B> I hope that the Under-Secretary will accept that the intention behind the use of the word "competition" was to bring the protection that the director general seeks into line with the two prohibitions. I may be wrong, but I understand that the Commission applies interim measures in pursuance of articles 85 and 86. By extension, it can not use interim measures to go beyond the purposes for which articles 85 and 86 are intended. They do not provide a broader public interest test. 
<P>
<B> Mr. Griffiths:</B> Article 86 prohibits exploitative pricing by a dominant undertaking. There is adequate evidence of that. The restrictions that the hon. Gentleman would introduce through amendment No. 174 and the concept of "anti-competitive" would undermine the principles behind the translation of article 86 into future United Kingdom law. 
<P>
<B> Mr. Boswell:</B> I wish to pick up on the point that my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire made about interim measures not going beyond those that are required to satisfy action under the chapter I and chapter II prohibitions. My reading of the clause, however, may be slightly at odds with my hon Friend's understanding of the clause. I understand that, as the whole clause is keyed into the existence of those prohibitions, the director general will be acting ultra vires if he applies any other public interest test that goes beyond the two prohibitions and not just the one that the Under-Secretary thinks that we have identified. It is not right for the director general to go beyond the prohibitions, so will the Minister give us the assurance that my hon. Friend sought? 
<P>
<B> Mr. Griffiths:</B> The imposition of interim measures is subject to the director general having reasonable suspicion that either of the prohibitions is being infringed and it is limited to the purposes of the Bill. I hope that that provides the hon. Member for Daventry with the assurance that he seeks. 
<P>
<B> Mr. Lansley:</B> It has been an interesting debate. I hope that the Under-Secretary will not think that we have delayed the Committee unduly, because an important point arose. 
<P>
One point remains open to discussion. The Under-Secretary has told us I confess that I had not entirely understood it earlier that the promotion of competition and the use of the two prohibitions to stem anti-competitive activity is not the sum total of the chapter II prohibition; it is intended to go beyond that. In particular, I was interested in the Under-Secretary's assertion that exploitative pricing by a dominant  undertaking is not necessarily anti-competitive. I should have thought that the test of abuse of a dominant position that the director general will apply is whether exploitative pricing is intended to force competitors out of the marketplace. Exploitative pricing is anti-competitive in its effects. I hope that the Under-Secretary will not dispute that, under the Bill and like the chapter I prohibition, the chapter II prohibition will essentially have an anti-competitive effect. 
<P>
<B> Mr. Redwood:</B> I, too, am disturbed. Does my hon. Friend think that if, because of the high level of sterling, a steel company in a competitive market cut prices to well below cost, it would be guilty of predatory pricing under the definition of the relationship between costs and revenues, whereas, if a water company put up its prices because it needed the money for environmental matters, that would not be predatory pricing because it would not face any losses? 
<P>
<H5>5 pm </H5>
</P>
{**p544**} Mr. Lansley: I agree with my right hon. Friend. The provision raises some interesting questions. It would help the Committee and those who read our deliberations if the Under-Secretary made it clear that the Bill will not introduce a broader public interest test into the chapter II prohibition. His interpretation is that the chapter II prohibition goes further than the protection of competition and dealing with anti-competitive effects. 
<P>
Delicate issues are involved and boundaries must be assessed. The amendment was designed to make it clear that the Bill is designed to promote competition and stem anti-competitive activity. It should not reintroduce the difficulties that those who work in the Department and I have experienced in trying to interpret the public interest. It should provide certainty and consistency by locating decisions with reference to competition. 
<P>
It has been an interesting, but not entirely satisfactory, debate. The Under-Secretary did not explain how the director general will apply the test of whether he should introduce interim measures. He did not say whether the test would consider issues of proportionality or take account of the reasonable likelihood that an infringement can be proved. It is likely that the director general will apply such tests by reference to previous court judgments, but it would have helped if the Minister had said how the tests will be put into practice. The Under-Secretary continues to say, "It'll be all right on the night because it will be done how the European Community does it." However, the European Community's procedural rules do not necessarily have the same transparency because it does not use the same tests of proportionality that a British court would. The Under-Secretary should tell us on what basis the director general will proceed. 
<P>
Rather than press the amendment and delay the Committee, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment. 
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. 
<P>
<B> Mr. Lansley:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 175, in page 18, line 30, leave out `and'. 
<P>
<B> The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 176 in page 18, line 32, at end insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and 
<P>
(c) take account of any such representations.'<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
<B> Mr. Lansley:</B> The amendments are simple. Before giving a direction under subsection (3), 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the Director must  
<P>
(a) give written notice. 
<P>
(b) give that person.an opportunity to make representations."<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
However, subsection (3) does not contain a requirement that the director general should take account of such representations. 
<P>
When my right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood) made an interesting intervention earlier, he thought that he might be accused of being a pedant. I may also be accused of being a pedant, but I wish to consider an important point. 
<P>
I know that the Under-Secretary is keen to bring the Bill as close as he possibly can to the manner in which European Community regulations and jurisprudence are applied. These amendments relate to tests used in the case of Camera Care Ltd. v. the Commission, by which the Commission was able to take interim measures indispensable for the effective exercise of its functions. In that case, the courts set out the limits of that power. That is reflected in the clause. 
<P>
Two elements are not dealt with in the clause. In my obviously inadequate way, I tried to bring one of them into the debate by way of amendment No. 177, but I was unsuccessful that amendment was not selected. That would have dealt with whether the interim measure is 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"of a temporary and conservatory nature"<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
 that is, whether it conserves the position without being intended to provide a permanent remedy. I shall leave that on one side. 
<P>
The second requirement that is not directly reflected in the clause is that such powers must be exercised, having regard 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"to the legitimate interests of the undertaking concerned."<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
For that to be the case, it will be necessary not only for the undertaking to have had an opportunity to make representations but for the director general to have taken account of them and, therefore, of the undertaking's legitimate interests. 
<P>
<B> Mr. John Bercow </B>(Buckingham): My hon. Friend is making an entirely reasonable point. Does he agree that in normal circumstances, under Governments whose tendencies are predictable, one should be able to assume that the criterion that my hon. Friend suggests that reasons be given, having taken account of representations would be satisfied under subsection (4)? In other words, if reasons must be given under subsection (4), one would assume that the authorities have taken account of the representations. Under this Administration, one cannot be sure of that and, therefore, it makes sense to impose a requirement, which is consistent with subsection (4), to take account of the representations. 
<P>
<B> Mr. Lansley:</B> I think that my hon. Friend has it the wrong way round. I understand that the notice that might be provided to a person will state why the director general proposes to take interim measures. Presumably, it will state why those measures are thought proportionate, relevant to the investigation and, indeed, necessary to enable the director general to pursue his investigations while no serious or irreparable damage is being done or the public interest is not being compromised. 
<P>
Between the director general providing written notice and the implementation of the direction, there must be an opportunity not only for the person affected to make representations but for the director general to take account of them before finalising the direction. I understand that that is how the provision should apply. 
<P>
As with previous amendments, the amendment has a probing character it gives the Under-Secretary an opportunity to give us the necessary assurances. However, if he is unclear about the extent to which the director general will take account of such representations formally before completing the direction, the amendment is intended to be substantive. It could be added to the Bill to reflect the intention, without diminishing the director general's powers of their proper application. 
<P>
<B> Mr. Nigel Griffiths:</B> I assure the Committee that the Bill requires the director general to give people an opportunity to make representations, so the director general is obliged to take account of any such representation. The Bill will have that effect and, therefore, the amendments are unnecessary. With that assurance, I hope that the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire will withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B> Mr. David Chidgey </B>(Eastleigh): I beg to move amendment No. 191, in page 18, line 36, after `applies', insert `subject to subsection (5A)'. 
<P>
<B> The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 192, in page 18, line 37, at end insert  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(5A) Three months after giving a direction under this section and every subsequent three months during the period in which the direction remains in force, the Director must  
<P>
(a) review the nature of that direction, in consultation with the person (or persons) to whom the direction has been given, to determine whether such direction remains appropriate for the purpose; and 
<P>
(b) provide guidance to the person (or persons) to whom the direction has been given on when he expects to complete his investigation into the matter in question.'.<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
<B> Mr. Chidgey:</B> I need not delay the Committee long on these amendments, which, I hope, will be welcomed. However, they are worth debating to try to probe exactly how much progress the Bill will make. 
<P>
The Bill allows the Director General of Fair Trading and the sector regulators to issue interim measures for proceedings to prevent abuse while an issue is being investigated. The amendments are intended not to prevent the use of such interim measures, but merely to ensure that they are consistent. The Bill as drafted does not limit the period during which interim measures can be imposed. By definition, interim measures should be temporary. 
<P>
The Committee may recall that a somewhat similar amendment was tabled on Report in the House of Lords, when an attempt was made to introduce a maximum time limit of three months. As I recall, while that would have been in line with current utility legislation in respect of enforcement orders, it was rejected on the grounds that complex investigations may take longer than three months. 
<P>
The amendments would not impose a maximum time limit, but would require the director general and sector regulators to review interim measures once imposed to ensure that they are still appropriate. That appears reasonable. They would also require the director general and the sector regulators to estimate when an investigation is likely to be completed. 
<P>
The amendments are important, because there may be serious financial implications for companies that have not breached the prohibitions. Given that companies are not assured of compensation if interim measures have been wrongly imposed on them, it appears appropriate for a review to be undertaken to ensure that companies are not being financially damaged by the Bill's provisions. The main objective of the Bill is surely to promote fair competition, and we believe that the amendment would help achieve that objective. 
<P>
<B> Mr. Nigel Griffiths:</B> As I have already explained, interim measures are subject to strict tests. I think that I satisfied the Committee on that point, as the previous amendment was withdrawn. I also said that an interim measures decision could be appealed to an appeal tribunal of the Competition Commission under clause 47(3). An important protection is that the tribunal rules may make provision for a tribunal to suspend the effect of an interim measure imposed by the director general before taking a final decision on whether the interim measure should be upheld. 
<P>
Those provisions provide better protection than would the amendments, which would add an unnecessary further layer of bureaucracy. The director general will no doubt want to determine the substance of cases as speedily as he can, and a further layer of procedure might distract him and his case officers from that task. 
<P>
It is not clear how the director is to know in advance how long an investigation will take or what consequences will flow if he is wrong in his estimate. For those reasons, I cannot accept the amendments. 
<P>
<B> Mr. Chidgey:</B> I listened carefully to what the Under-Secretary said, and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment. 
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(4A) In determining whether to impose a penalty, or the amount of any such penalty, under subsection (1) or (2) the Director shall not have regard to any act or omission by an undertaking which occurred and was lawful before the commencement of this Part.'.<P>

<P>
No. 157, in page 19, line 22, at end insert  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(9) the Director shall not impose a penalty on an undertaking if his investigation commenced more than 3 years after the date of the infringement.'.<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
<B> Mr. Griffiths:</B> Clause 37 empowers the director general to impose financial penalties when a decision has been made about a breach of either of the prohibitions. It is obviously an important feature of the new regime, not least for its deterrent effect. The European Commission has the same powers under articles 85 and 86, but we all accept that there must be proper safeguards. In another place, and in this Committee concern has been expressed that undertakings might be subject to a penalty, even though they have acted anti-competitively, but without deliberate intent. I do not believe that penalties should be imposed by the director general without good reason. 
<P>
However, the concern expressed is entirely proper and the Government have accepted that it should be made clear in the Bill that penalties cannot be imposed unless the undertaking has committed an infringement intentionally or through negligence. That is what amendment No. 38 will achieve, and I hope that it will be welcomed by the Committee. 
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
<B> Mr. Lansley:</B> I want to speak to amendment No. 178, which is in this group of amendments, and to explain why I tabled it. 
<P>
Amendment No. 178 is a probing amendment that is intended to clarify the Government's position. Do they intend that penalties applied under the chapter I and II prohibitions, in so far as an infringement is proven, will be retrospective going back to before the commencement of the Act? Will the agreement or the conduct, under the chapter II prohibition, continue following the commencement of the Act? 
<P>
It would be a retrograde step to impose penalties retrospectively. Perhaps I am not reading the Bill carefully enough to see whether it states that penalties will not be imposed retrospectively. The people operating on what they regard as lawful activity at present, who have no reason to think otherwise, should not be caught by this clause. There may be an inter-relationship between the two amendments, such that the intentional infringement or negligent infringement will apply to all retrospective activity, agreements or conduct, prior to the commencement of the Act, but which was lawful at this time. If that is so, it would be useful to have clarification. 
<P>
If the Minister were to reject amendment No. 178, I suppose that we could argue that the Bill is intended to act on agreements or conduct that have had an anti-competitive effect under existing legislation, which has not bit sufficiently. But that is not the same as the proposal in amendment No. 178. Agreements that were made before the commencement of the Act might be voided by reference to an investigation and an assertion that they are an infringement of either of the prohibitions. If such agreements were to continue after the commencement of the Act, it would expose the parties to them to a risk of penalty, the voiding of the agreements and damages actions. 
<P>
It does not follow that if we accept that there should be retrospection, we shall give licence to anti-competitive activity after the commencement of the Act, if such activity were proven to have infringed the prohibitions. We should protect those who have hitherto behaved in what they regard as a lawful manner, and should not impose penalties under the Bill on that prior activity. 
<P>
<B> Mr. Chidgey:</B> As the hon. member for South Cambridgeshire said, the Bill does not contain a limitation period for the imposition of fines. Anxiety has been expressed, especially by the Confederation of British Industry, to the effect that we should rely entirely on EC law and its high principles in this regard. 
<P>
Before 1974, when the Council passed legislation dealing with limitation, the European Court was asked to annul fines on the grounds of excessive delay between the violation and the commission's investigation the Quinine case was the issue at point. The European Court of Justice said that the limitation period was necessary to provide proper legal security. However, in order to provide legal security, I argue that the limitation period needs to be fixed in advance, which would, effectively, require Community legislation. Accordingly, as the amendment suggests, there is a corresponding need for the issue to be dealt with in the Bill. This is a probing amendment; I should like to hear the Under-Secretary's response to it. Industry and commerce have genuine anxieties about the matter. 
<P>
<B> Mr. Redwood:</B> The official Opposition support all three amendments. I welcome amendment No. 38, which was tabled in the name of the Minister of State. It shows that, on this occasion, the Minister has listened to our representations and arguments and is trying to make some movement in the right direction on the imposition of these tough penalties. 
<P>
However, there was a slight difference between what the Under-Secretary said in moving the amendment and the exact words of the amendment that he moved. He said that the intention was to let a company off the heavy penalties if its action was not deliberate, but the amendment includes the concept of negligence, so it is not quite as lax as the Under-Secretary's statement implied. 
<P>
We have suggested a modest move in the right direction. The Under-Secretary knows that the Opposition are keen to ensure that proper penalties are imposed when there is a flagrant violation of the spirit of the Bill when there is a clear case of anti-competitive practice. However, there will be many grey areas and difficult cases for example, a business or group of businesses may behave as they had always behaved, in the belief that the previous competition authorities knew of their practices and were perfectly happy with them, but subsequently discover that under the new legislation things have changed, and that they are deemed to be anti-competitive. They could face a large, retrospective fine. 
<P>
We welcome the fact that the infringement must be intentional and we welcome the introduction of the concept of negligence. The courts may have to spend a little time sorting out what the concept of negligence means in that connection, but there is case law on negligence generally, on which they can draw to help them to flesh that out. 
<P>
I therefore welcome the amendment; it moves in the right direction, and we are happy to give it our full support. However, I hope that the Minister will recognise that the amendment would be much better if it were buttressed by the amendments tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire and by the hon. Member for Eastleigh (Mr. Chidgey). They add to the limitation imposed on the power to impose penalties two important safeguards that are not present in the Ministers amendment No. 38.

<P>

<B> Dr. Stephen Ladyman </B>(South Thanet): Will the right hon. Gentleman clarify his position? The Government believe that , by applying a mechanistic test, the Bill makes proving an offence more easy. If they are right in that supposition, and someone is currently engaged in a practice that he knows to be anti-competitive and which he believes cannot be proved to be anti-competitive, but which is proved to be anti-competitive once the Bill is enacted, where would the right hon. Gentleman draw the line on what period the penalty should cover? 
<P>
<B> Mr. Redwood:</B> I was about to answer that, while proposing the Opposition's support for the other amendments. I shall briefly answer the hon. Gentleman's intervention. If a business is proceeding with a practice that has been examined and found to be perfectly reasonable under the existing regime, there should be no retrospection. If the new competition authority wishes to be tougher than the old one, a new inquiry should have the power to order the business to desist from that practice in future, but it should not have the power to unpick what has happened in the past. That can be achieved through amendment No. 178. 
<P>
It would be quite wrong if retrospection was the result of the sort of legislation that the House of Commons and Parliament in general does not usually pass, which says that one was not committing an offence under the law that is being replaced but that the new law is tougher and that one will therefore be deemed to have committed an offence before the new law came in. That is unreasonable, and the Under-Secretary must give people and businesses protection from the toughening of the law it has been toughened having a retrospective impact on their practices. 
<P>
<B> Mr Hayes:</B> Will my right hon. Friend concede that the question is not where those who wish to impose no retrospection should draw the line, for that is self-evident, but where those who wish to take retrospective action will draw the line? The question posed by the hon. Member for South Thanet was misplaced. It should have been addressed to the Under-Secretary. 
<P>
<B> Mr. Redwood:</B> My hon. Friend makes a strong point. 
<P>
The second part of my answer to the hon. Member for South Thanet is that, when a practice has been going on that the competition authorities find to be anti-competitive and which it could argue had been anti-competitive under the old law as well as the new, it is perfectly reasonable to go back to the time before the enactment of the new legislation. In such cases, I am persuaded that a time limitation is a good idea. I hope that the hon. Member for Eastleigh will not regard amendment No. 157 as merely a probing amendment. If the Under-Secretary does not immediately agree with the proposals, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will wish to see it tested. 
<P>
<B> Mr. Bercow:</B> Further to the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for South Holland and the Deepings (Mr. Hayes), does my right hon. Friend agree that if arrangements that are the subject of contractual agreements between different businesses, which at present are entirely legal, are to become illegal under the Bill, Some tolerance is required before the full force of the new law is applied against those businesses, for they will be obliged to unpick existing arrangements? Some flexibility is required if the Bill is meant to assist business, not clobber it. 
<P>
<B> Mr. Redwood:</B> There are two answers to that question. There should be no retrospection at all if the only reason that something is now deemed to be anti-competitive is that the law has changed. If it was not anti-competitive before, changing that would be against the spirit of parliamentary legislation. I trust that the Under-Secretary accepts that. If an investigation proves that something has gone wrong, as I said, there should be some time limitation. Three years seems a reasonable time. 
<P>
The Under-Secretary should understand that there comes a point when practically all the shareholders of a company have changed,when the management and the customer groups have changed, when perhaps even the nature and style of the business has changed Mergers and demerges will have taken place and the nature of the ownership may have changed quite dramatically and rapidly. There must be a limit on how far back the authorities should be able to go to find that a company was behaving anti-competitively. 
<P>
It is rather odd to think that something flagrantly anti-competitive could have been missed for four years and that no complaints had been made; and then suddenly, four years later, someone comes along with a complaint that he did not have at the time. It is investigated and it is found to be anti-competitive. I am persuaded that amendment No. 157 would provide a rather useful time limit and an encouragement to an active and sensible director general I am sure that we will be told that the Under-Secretary has such a person in mind to get on with the job and investigate any rackets in reasonable time to protect customers and to protect the public interest. 
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
The hon. Member for Eastleigh said that the law would surely be stronger with a mechanistic test. One of the points that the Opposition make is that a mechanistic test in the context of the Bill does not, in all respects, make the law stronger. I fear that the Bill will be far too weak when it comes to revenue producing monopolies and businesses governed by the public policy provision. The Government have managed to dilute powers in the old regime that were not that strong against the very rackets and monopoly activities that are most disagreeable to customers and the public. 
<P>
Conversely, there is still a danger, and I have not been persuaded otherwise by the Under-Secretary, that the mechanistic test could be too tough on highly competitive businesses living through extremely difficult market circumstances. It could misinterpret weak pricing behaviour as predatory when it is market driven and the business has no choice but to cut its prices. There were times today when the Under-Secretary seemed to invert the normal logic and purpose of more competition. I want more competition in various markets in the United Kingdom because it brings lower prices and better services. It produces what every politician wants to see the offer to the public of something better at a lower price. 
<P>
The Under-Secretary seemed to have reversed that. He said that there are often occasions when high prices were evidence of a very competitive market. He wished to defend the right of people and businesses to charge high prices but was much more worried about cut prices because he felt that lower prices are predatory on more occasions than I believe they are. 
<P>
<B> Mr. Bercow:</B> My right hon. Friend makes a sensible point which somewhat counterbalances what the Under-Secretary said earlier. Does he agree that in most cases when businesses cut prices, it is not because they are seeking to drive others out of business but because they are anxiously seeking to avoid being driven out of businesses themselves? 
<P>
<B> Mr. Redwood:</B> Indeed, that is the Opposition's case. It relates as well to the definition of the market. It is possible for a company to look big, and in the Under-Secretary's view dominant within the UK market, but because it is now a European or global market it will derive its prices from global competition and will therefore cut its prices from a position of weakness. Sterling may be strong, leading to a tidal wave of Asian competition at much cheaper prices. It would be quite wrong for the Under-Secretary's words or those in the Bill to be used by the competition authorities to hit businesses when they are down. The last thing they want to do is cut their prices but they are forced to do so by those market circumstances. 
<P>
I fear that the Bill is weak on monopolies and rather too tough on actual and potentially very competitive marketplaces. Our purposes in either moving or supporting the amendments is to make sure that there is some protection from the imposition of tough penalties in three circumstances where it would be rough justice or no justice at all for the penalties to be imposed. In summary, it is most welcome that the conduct now has to be deliberate or negligent. That is progress in response to our case. We accept that change. 
<P>
We would not like retrospection to be applied prior to enactment of the Bill if the matter is only anti-competitive because the law has changed. I do not see how the Under-Secretary could deny us the justice of that case. We agree with the hon. Member for Eastleigh that even where something that is finally deemed to be anti-competitive is going on, there should be a limit on it because if it were a serious problem, people would have reported it. It would have been investigated and it would be a disgrace to take longer than three years to sort it out. 
<P>
<B> Mr. Nigel Griffiths:</B> Amendment No. 178 would add a provision to clause 37 to prevent the director general from taking account of any act or omission by the undertaking that was lawful before the Bill comes into force when he is deciding whether to impose a penalty, or deciding the amount of a penalty. 
<P>
The Bill will not be retrospective. Past behaviour, which took place before the new prohibitions come into force and was lawful, cannot therefore be penalised. I believe that that assurance meets much of the concern expressed. 
<P>
However, the amendment goes further by preventing the director general from having any regard to past behaviour. Such behaviour may be relevant to considering whether, as regards subsequent behaviour under the prohibition, an undertaking was acting in full knowledge that its course of conduct was anti-competitive. That could be a factor in determining whether to impose a penalty. 
<P>
Amendment No. 157 would mean that for a continuing infringement the director could take into account only a period of three years before he started his investigation. If the infringement had ceased three years before, and the undertaking had been able to evade detection during that period, it would get away without penalty. That is not acceptable. 
<P>
A period of three years is too short. It might take time for evidence to be unearthed. There is no justification for protecting the guilty in that way. The right hon. Member for Wokingham made some dismissive remarks about how unacceptable it would be to have to wait for three years. That shows his lack of knowledge of cases that have lasted, three, five, seven and even eight years, in the case of concrete, as they dragged on. On behalf of the Government, I ask what about the victims of these crimes? They are entitled to some protection. 
<P>
The Government are happy to respond to valid concerns. We want to ensure that there are adequate safeguards and that is why we have tabled amendment No. 38. However, we are not prepared to weaken the regime for dealing with serious anti-competitive behaviour. Amendments Nos. 178 and 157 would do that and for that reason I ask the Committee to reject them. 
<P>
I urge hon. Members to support amendment No. 38.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B> Mr. Redwood:</B> I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for tabling one helpful amendment and for saying clearly that he does not wish the Bill to be retrospective. The Opposition are not sure that the Bill achieves that. Will the Under-Secretary reassure us that there will be no retrospection of penalties if the amendment is accepted? 
<P>
The Under-Secretary has misunderstood the point about the three-year time limitation in amendment No. 157. The time limitation is proposed on the imposition of the penalty. In a complicated case, which is not clear at the beginning, that does not mean that the director general must desist from pursuing the case after three years, or that he is unable subsequently to find that it is anti-competitive. He could continue his investigation; he could find that the case was anti-competitive and make the necessary orders to prevent any such action occurring in the future. He could still impose a penalty for the recent experience. 
<P>
Surely, it is not reasonable for cases to be reopened many years after the conduct has ceased, when the shareholders and managers have changed and the profitability of the group or company might be different. If three years had elapsed and everything had changed, the conduct had ceased and the company was in a downturn making no money, it would be especially cruel if it was charged 10 per cent. of its turnover for some past transgression of a long-gone management. 
<P>
The Opposition believe that it would help the Committee if the matter could be tested by putting the amendment to a vote. 
<P>
<B> Mr. Griffiths:</B> It is the right hon. Gentleman who has misunderstood. The facts are clear. No retrospective penalty is to be levied. The penalty would be levied on prohibitions under the Bill, but in assessing the penalty, it is quite right that the director general should be able to look back over the record. That is what we are seeking to provide, but there is no intention to levy a penalty retrospectively; the Bill is not retrospective. 
<P>
<B> Mr. Chidgey:</B> As hon. Members have made contributions to the debate, I should like to respond to them. It has been interesting to listen to the debate, but I remain unconvinced by the Under-Secretary's argument, so if I may, I shall press the amendment to a Division. 
<P>
<B> The Chairman:</B> We are at present debating a Government amendment, not the hon. Member's amendment. 
<P>
<B> Mr. Chidgey:</B> My apologies, Mr. Maxton; I was carried away by the quality of the debate or something. 
<P>
Amendment agreed to. 
<P>
<B> The Chairman:</B> If the hon. Member for Eastleigh wants to move amendment No. 157, he can do so formally after the next group of amendments. 
<P>
<B> Mr. Redwood:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 10, in page 19, line 18, leave out `10' and insert `5'. 
<P>
<B> The Chairman:</B> With this we may take amendment No. 195, in page 19, line 22, at end insert  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(9) In subsection (7) "turnover" means the sales revenue accruing to that undertaking in respect of the market, or connected markets, in respect of which the infringement occurs.'.<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
<B> Mr. Redwood:</B> The amendment is intended to test the severity of the penalties that the Under-Secretary has in mind for businesses that are found to be in violation. One amendment has been tabled in my name and that of my hon. Friends, and one in that of my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire. They approach the problem in two different ways; both have merit, and we will be interested to hear the Under-Secretary's response to them. 
<P>
As the Committee will be aware, under the Bill the director general can impose a penalty of up to 10 per cent. of the turnover of the undertaking. We are told in the Bill that the turnover will be 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"determined in accordance with such provisions as may be specified in an order made by the Secretary of State."<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
When the Bill was launched, it was generally understood that the penalty could be up to 10 per cent. of worldwide group turnover, which could be an enormous sum compared to the cash value of the infringements within the United Kingdom market, which is the province of the director general and the Bill. 
<P>
Subsequently, the Government have let it be known that they had in mind 10 per cent. of United Kingdom turnover, but I believe that they still have in mind 10 per cent. of group turnover in the United Kingdom, even where the infringement is committed by one subsidiary of a complex group that may operate in many different market areas and product ranges. The suggestion is that the group should stand forfeit for 10 per cent. of all of its United Kingdom turnover, however Balkanised its subsidiary structure may be, to ensure that directors at group holding level understand that an offence by any subsidiary is serious and will be duly penalised at group level. 
<P>
<B> Mr. Bercow:</B> I am sorry to interrupt the eloquence of my right hon. Friend's flow, but does he think that there is any compelling reason why turnover should be the criterion? I ask that because a number of business people in my constituency to whom I have spoken during the past fortnight who are aware of the provision have argued that turnover is not the proper basis on which the percentage fines should be calculated, and have suggested a variety of other criteria. 
<P>
<B> Mr. Redwood:</B> Given what the Under-Secretary has been saying about the kind of conduct that he would regard as predatory, perhaps my hon. Friend has in mind a percentage of the losses. A percentage of the profits would clearly not be satisfactory in the Under-Secretary's terms, because he envisages loss-making businesses being found guilty of unreasonable practices. 
<P>
<B> Mr. Boswell:</B> To reinforce my right hon. Friend's argument, and because characteristically, he would be too modest to do so, I remind the Committee that he was the chairman of a public company that had exactly the character of having a variety of different businesses it was a holding company. Whether or not such a company's activities are grouped under one ownership and legal form is entirely contingent. 
<P>
Given that the implication of the offence is the destruction of competition, with the inference that some people are gaining an unfair advantage, could it not be argued that opting for profit rather than turnover is the more principled choice? 
<P>
<B> Mr. Redwood:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend and I reassure the Committee that I have had no such interest for a long time so my argument is not based on that. However, this sort of penalty could encourage demerger rather than concentration. That might be the purpose that the Under-Secretary has in mind, but he should be aware of the greatly increased risk at the corporate level. The unlicensed or unreasonable activities of a minor subsidiary could result in the imposition of such a large fine on the group that it would come as a shock to many decent law-abiding group directors. They would be shocked enough at the misbehaviour of their subsidiary and would then discover that group shareholders were also going to suffer dramatically from the levy. 
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
I accept, as I am sure the Under-Secretary will say, that the penalty must be severe enough to deal with bad conduct, to frighten directors into understanding the seriousness of the misdemeanour, to ensure that their systems are as strong as possible and to catch all but the most difficult cases. 
<P>
When a case slips through there must be penalties. The Opposition do not want to abolish penalties and we do not want to water them down so much that they administer no shock to the system. Nevertheless, the proposed level of penalty could be disproportionate to the typical run-of-the-mill offence that might be caught by the provisions. 
<P>
We have two suggestions to make the penalty more proportionate. Could not the Minister welcome a proposal along the lines of amendment No. 10, which suggests a maximum penalty of 5 per cent. of turnover rather than 10 per cent.? Were the 5 per cent. figure to apply, a better case could be made for basing it on complete group turnover; the 10 per cent. penalty could be disproportionate if the problems had occurred in a minor subsidiary in a small marketplace. 
<P>
The alternative means is that proposed by my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire narrowing the definition of turnover so that the penalty relates more directly to the offence. It is sensible to suggest that any revenue accruing to the group or to the undertaking, in my hon. Friend's words should be in relation to the market or group of markets in which the infringement occurs. That would be eminently reasonable for a diversified group. One might want the director general to take a generous view of the group of markets in which the subsidiary had offended to ensure that the penalty was large in relation to the offending subsidiary. I am sure that that would be sufficient to result in the desired action in such a group. 
<P>
When a subsidiary has offended against the wishes of the group, clearly the subsidiary chairman and/or chief executive would be fired. Prosecutions might also follow if they had behaved inexcusably. On top of that would be the fine on group shareholders, but I believe that there should be limitations on the amount of fine imposed. 
<P>
In attempting to decide what is reasonable, I would be happy with either of those two approaches. I certainly welcome the Under-Secretary's confirmation that we are talking about UK not worldwide turnover, which will provide some relief for large groups trading internationally that are trying to police their British subsidiaries against this specific British law. However, it would be helpful if the Minister would either narrow the definition further to relate it more directly to the offence or place an upper limit on the fine below 10 per cent. of turnover. 
<P>
In good times, 10 per cent. of turnover might well be a typical one year's profits for the group as a whole a large penalty. My 5 per cent. preference would still mean the whole group losing half its annual profits for one infringement by one subsidiary in one marketplace. Group directors would certainly understand that that was a severe penalty and it would redouble their efforts to ensure that such offences were rare. I hope that the Under-Secretary will respond in a generous spirit to one or other of the amendments.

<P>

<B> Mr. Lansley:</B> I am grateful to you, Mr. Maxton, for this opportunity to express my agreement with my right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham and to say that I used the word "turnover" in amendment No. 195 because notwithstanding the points made by my right hon. Friend it is difficult to construe a penalty limit by reference to something other than turnover, which might be a variable positive or negative sum. Turnover should be related to the market or connected markets. I deliberately used the phrase "connected markets", because abuse of dominant position might occur in a connected market and influence another market. 
<P>
It is important that we introduce an element of proportionality into the structure of the penalties, and we could do so by construing turnover in that way. The Government might consider varying the percentage figure to give rise to the level of penalty that the Government contemplate they want the penalties to have a deterrent and punitive effect. 
<P>
<B> Mr. Hayes:</B> In addition to proportionality, does my hon. Friend accept that accountability is implicit in his amendment? He is relating the infringement to the penalty in a way that the Bill does not do. The Government's proposal is imprecise; my hon. Friend's amendment is much more specific and relates the infringement to the penalty. The amendment offers not only proportionality, but a direct link. 
<P>
<B> Mr. Lansley:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend. I hope that the amendment is reasonably self-explanatory, as are the arguments to sustain it. As my hon. Friend says, it contains not only proportionality but a degree of relevance. I suspect that the Under-Secretary will say that precisely those criteria will be applied and that those factors might be brought into play in the director general's rules. However, it would be much more preferable if the general position was stated in the Bill. 
<P>
My right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham made it clear that serious implications might arise from the use of an undertaking's turnover without regard to the market or connected markets within which the infringement occurs. That might have distortion effects on the structure of businesses and on how they manage their affairs. If the Under-Secretary is not prepared to circumscribe turnover as proposed in amendment No. 195, I commend amendment No. 10. However, if he is not prepared to accept amendment No. 10, amendment No. 195 would represent a substantial move in the right direction. 
<P>
<B> Mr. Nigel Beard </B>(Bexleyheath and Crayford): I have listened to the debates on the clauses on enforcement and penalties, and they remind me of something akin to St. Augustine's prayer for virtue: let us take steps to enforce fair competition, but may they not be too effective. 
<P>
The Conservative party underestimates the strength of the forces that are ranged against the Bill. The hon. Member for Buckingham (Mr. Bercow) has mentioned the amount of lobby material that suggests that the penalties are excessive. However, it will be in no one's interest if the Bill is rendered ineffective or inoperable because it cannot be enforced as the penalties are too weak. If that were to happen, the small and medium-sized companies, such as those typically found in my constituency, would suffer. 
<P>
We have heard much about the penalties visited on the transgressors. However, the small entrepreneurs, technologically based companies and traders are vulnerable. They will suffer if the legislation does not work. 
<P>
<B> Mr. Bercow rose </B><P>
 
<P>
<B> Mr. Hayes rose </B><P>
 
<P>
<B> Mr. Beard:</B> I give way to the hon. Member for Buckingham. 
<P>
<B> Mr. Bercow:</B> I should remember the hon. Gentleman in my will, for no other reason than that he decided to give way to me in preference to my hon. Friend the Member for South Holland and The Deepings. 
<P>
Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the need for effective legislation does not obviate the equally important need for checks and balances? In view of his statement about the forces that are ranged against the Bill, will he give the Committee examples of the terrible abuses of competitive positioning in the private economy? 
<P>
<B> Mr. Beard:</B> There have been recent cases involving bus companies, which have already been mentioned. The concrete company Redland Readymix is another case. In implementing the Bill, the director general will be adjudicating matters involving greater sums than are likely to arise from a civil action. In such instances, people will take avoiding action. Penalties will be treated as a licence for malpractice if they are not strong enough. That must be avoided at all costs if the Bill is to be respected. 
<P>
<B> Mr. Hayes:</B> The hon. Gentleman talks about companies in his constituency and about proportionality. However, the penalty that is proposed for companies with a turnover of 25 million plus would be more than their entire profit for one or two years. My experience is that such sums are realistic. That is not proportionate for companies in the hon. Gentleman's constituency or for any others. 
<P>
<B> Mr. Beard:</B> The Bill is worded to make 10 per cent. the maximum penalty. We are not suggesting that that will be the penalty on every occasion. However, in certain cases the maximum penalty is likely to be the only way to penalise malpractice. 
<P>
We want to establish a set of circumstances in which people do not undertake the malpractices that are defined in chapters I and II. Therefore, the penalties must act as a deterrent. That point has been missed in our debate. People need to know that strong powers of investigation exist and that the truth will out. When that happens, those who are found to be guilty of malpractice will be penalised. The deterrent is probably more powerful than the penalty imposed on those whose wrongdoing has been discovered. 
<P>
<B> Mr. Nigel Griffiths:</B> With that excellent contribution from my hon. Friend, let me explain why we reject amendments Nos. 10 and 95. Subsection (7) follows the Community competition regime in restricting the penalty that can be imposed for the infringement of a prohibition to 10 per cent. of an undertaking's turnover. That is to ensure that penalties are not disproportionate to the size of the undertaking. We will confine the turnover to that which arises in the UK. The right hon. Member for Wokingham was a little confused turnover that arises world-wide is taken into account at Community level. 
<P>
Apart from that change, we are happy with the figure of 10 per cent. Penalties imposed by the director general must be appropriate to the circumstances. The power to penalise an undertaking by up to 10 per cent. of its UK turnover will give the new prohibition regime real teeth. 
<P>
<B> Mr. Lansley:</B> In not accepting amendment No. 195, will the Under-Secretary say whether the size of the market and the extent to which an undertaking has a turnover within a given market are relevant factors in assessing the penalty? 
<P>
<B> Mr. Griffiths:</B> That is one of the Opposition's more sensible statements this afternoon. 
<P>
I cannot accept amendment No. 195, and I hope that my reasons will be persuasive. If a successful bus company decides to diversify into garage services and uses its war chest to subsidise anti-competitive behaviour in the garage services market in a little local area, it is right to take the company's entire turnover into account. Consideration should not be limited to the garage services business that the director general is investigating for anti-competitive behaviour. 
<P>
<H5>6 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
<B> Mr. Hayes:</B> Amendment No. 195 relates to connected markets. The Under-Secretary's example is of a such a market. The connection between the two businesses justifies consideration of both when investigating an infringement, but we could all name many companies that own businesses that are very different from one another. Surely it would be unjust to consider their entire turnover. 
<P>
<B> Mr. Griffiths:</B> The hon. Gentleman leads me to my next example, which is of a bus company that diversifies into printing. The markets are unconnected, but the income from the initial core business has enabled the company to move into another market in an anti-competitive way, and perhaps to drive out local printers. Although the markets are not connected, the Director General of Fair Trading should be able to view all the company's businesses and practices, and determine the proportionate penalty. 
<P>
<B> Mr. Boswell:</B> Can the Under-Secretary see a difference between a bus company that enriches itself and moves into printing and is examined on the whole of its turnover, and a private individual who invests the same sum of money in printing, does not have a separate business and is thus immune to penalties on other activities because there are none? 
<P>
<B> Mr. Griffiths:</B> If the individual indulges in anti-competitive behaviour, he could be subject to a penalty of up to 10 per cent. of turnover. The thrust of the Opposition's argument is that a small company, such as that postulated by the hon. Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell), should not be subject to disproportionate penalties. Ten per cent. is intended to be a strong deterrent against the sort of anti-competitive behaviour that the hon. Gentleman described. 
<P>
<B> Mr. Hayes:</B> I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for giving way again. Let us consider the examples that he provided. If a bus company moves into garages, the second business would probably be organised along similar lines to the first, possibly from the same location. Both businesses would use the same skills and experience. However, if a bus company uses its capital to diversify into printing, the second business is likely to be run separately, by different people from a different place. The rule of accountability that I tried to establish when I intervened on my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire would not be made. The Under-Secretary presents a crude and blunt instrument to the Committee.

<P>

<B> Mr. Griffiths:</B> Yet again, the hon. Gentleman is trying first of all by amendment No. 10, which would cut the possible penalty from 10 per cent. to 5 per cent. of turnover to tie the hands of the director general. [Hon. Members: "Yes, he is."] I am glad that Opposition Members acknowledge that. For ideological reasons, they take a very different view from ours. Their view, exemplified over two decades, is that all is fair in the marketplace. The victims of anti-competitive practice need not and did not look to them for support or succour. 
<P>
We take a different view, and that is why we reject the amendments, which would cut the relevant percentage of turnover from 10 per cent. to 5 per cent. That would fly in the face of the Community competition regime. We do not want to dilute the Bill by making the penalties half as effective as the penalties under European legislation. Penalties up to 10 per cent. of turnover would be an effective deterrent, and we hope that that would result in anyone who was abusing a position in the marketplace ceasing to do so very quickly. 
<P>
We are sensitive to the points that the Confederation of British Industry made about amendment No. 195 and we want to think about what the relevant market is likely to be. However, those matters should not be primarily specified in primary legislation; they should be provided for in secondary legislation and subject to consultation with interested parties. The Bill does not provide for methods of determining turnover. Following consultation, it will be necessary to adopt a practical definition. The definition used in the amendment could be restrictive, and I urge hon. Gentlemen  
<P>
<B> Mr. Bercow:</B> And hon. Ladies. 
<P>
<B> Mr. Griffiths:</B> I mean hon. Members on the Opposition Benches; they are all hon. Gentlemen. That is a sensitive subject and I am surprised that the hon. Gentleman should want to raise it in a sedentary intervention. 
<P>
I urge the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire not to press amendment No. 195, in view of my assurance that we are considering the arguments for limiting the turnover to be taken into account under the clause to that arising in the relevant market. 
<P>
<B> Mr. Peter Brooke </B>(Cities of London and Westminster): I shall be extremely brief. I recall Professor Parkinson saying that he would always sell shares in a company that built a new corporate headquarters. I should hesitate to invest in a company of which the Under-Secretary was the chairman, if he determined his move into a different market by the level of turnover previously secured rather than by profitability. It is unlikely that turnover would enable him to do what he wanted. 
<P>
I want to draw on the intervention by the hon. Member for Bexleyheath and Crayford (Mr. Beard) and put a question to the Under-Secretary because Opposition Members were gratified by what he said in response to the CBI's comments. The hon. Gentleman was previously an employee of ICI when it still included a pharmaceutical business. He became an employee of Zeneca when it was separated. ICI was classically I do not say that this is true now, but then the hon. Gentleman is no longer its employee a company with commodity products and highly specialised products. The turnover to generate a particular level of profitability varied enormously between those two segments. I want to satisfy myself the Under-Secretary can answer by a nod of the head that such considerations will be taken into account in the Government's consideration of the market. 
<P>
<B> Mr. Redwood:</B> I am grateful for the Under-Secretary's closing remarks, in which he began to move in our direction on amendment No. 195. Amendment No. 10, to which he was hostile, is, as I explained, one way to limit unfair and unreasonable impositions on wrongdoers, given the complexity of group structures and the likelihood that the incident might be confined to one or two markets within a group that operated in many markets. 
<P>
The Under-Secretary should take into account the fact that there are many purposes for profits, and that most of the profit does not go into the shareholders' pockets, directly or indirectly. Most of the profit does not go to the board, either. When a company has misbehaved, it is right that the authorities should want to penalise the board and the shareholders if they are guilty of the malpractice. It is reasonable to set a fine that wipes out or perhaps, even two years' dividend. 
<P>
However, the prime purpose of profits is to pay Her Majesty's Treasury the profits tax, and companies must pay for future investment to secure the jobs of those in the business. If the Under-Secretary takes away too much of that money, there will be unforeseen consequences from the penalty regime, which will affect not only the shareholders who deserve what is coming to them for having a management that was unable to control the business correctly but will start to affect those working in the business and the customers of that business. There must, therefore, be some proportionality. 
<P>
I realise that I am not going to persuade the Under-Secretary that it is right to cut the maximum penalty from 10 per cent. of turnover to 5 per cent. of turnover, even though such a penalty would do much damage to the shareholders and the directors which is, presumably, the intention. I shall therefore not press amendment No. 10. 
<P>
I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire will press amendment No. 195, because I have much sympathy with what he has said as, it seems, does the Under-Secretary. It would be helpful to ensure that the definition of "turnover" means the market or connected markets where the offence has occurred. 
<P>
The Under-Secretary raised an interesting example. It would help the Committee if it considered that example and discovered whether there was any agreement. I agree with the hon. Gentleman that if a bus company moved into garage services and started to use its position of strength in a local or regional market as a bus company to behave anti-competitively in the garage or servicing business, that would be an offence, and the combined turnovers should be taken into account. That is exactly what should be done, and the Under-Secretary would find me the first to say so and to want to ensure that that bus company was well and truly fined. 
<P>
I have great difficulties when, as in the hon. Gentleman's example, the bus company decides to plough some of its profits into an investment in the printing industry. It is a highly competitive industry. People in it say that it is too competitive because they do not have the freedom to price up as they would like, which means that good deals are available for customers. The arrival of a local or regional bus company in the printing business would not make a huge difference to the total market, and there is no way that such a bus company could, in my view, behave anti-competitively. 
<P>
The Under-Secretary seems to define anti-competitive behaviour almost solely as entering a business with a competitive intent and for a period of time running at a loss. Does he understand that that is how competitive markets work? People often enter markets and run at a loss in order to get started and to attract customers. Surely it is pro-competitive to allow such conduct and we should not try to stop it. I hope that he will reconsider that example. If he thinks that we need to stop that it shows me that we need even more to have an amendment such as that tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire, to make it clear that penalties will be imposed on those indulging in what everyone else thinks is anti-competitive conduct namely, undermining the customer's interest by trying to damage the market, rather than being a new competitive force in the market, which, certainly in the short term, wil help customers, because it offers them more choice and lower prices. I trust that, with your leave, Mr. Maxton, my hon. Friend the Minister for South Cambridgeshire will pursue his amendment. He will have the full force of the Opposition behind him. 
<P>
<B> Mr. Lansley:</B> I concur with my right hon. Friend. Although the Under-Secretary tried to respond rather more positively to amendment No. 195 than to amendment No 10, he demonstrated with his examples and arguments why we must include the definition in the Bill to make explicit that which was previously not clear. In bringing together the examples of a bus company investing in garage services as distinct from investing in printing services, as though both of those circumstances were justifiable, the Under-Secretary illustrated the need to make clear the difference between those two circumstances. Connected markets are legitimately to be taken into account when setting the size of the penalty, but if there is a break in causation, the difference needs to be established. 
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
The argument of the hon. Member for Bexleyheath and Crayford was far from correct; the position is the other way round. If we were to put it in the Bill that large undertakings with quite disparate and disconnected activities were at risk of a penalty of 10 per cent. of turnover in relation to any one of their activities, which might be a modest sum in relation to their total activity, we would bring the deterrent effect into disrepute. People will have to look through the Bill to find out what penalties realistically would be applied under the rules to be set by the director general. Rather than waiting for th edirector general to say what will happen, it would be better for the Bill to contain a realistic expression of penalty with a genuine deterrent effect, and for the director general then to add details. 
<P>
<B> Mr. Nigel Griffiths:</B> Perhaps I can help the hon. Gentleman. The Bill provides that no order specifying how turnover is to be determined may be made unless a draft of it is laid before Parliament and approved by resolution of each House. We shall obviously resist that question. I hope that I have given the hon. Gentleman the assurance that he seeks.

<P>

<B> Mr. Lansley:</B> I am grateful to the Under-Secretary. However, I have heard no argument detracting from the words in amendment No. 195, nor has anyone said that the amendment is technically deficient, that it would be better for a further amendment to be brought forward on Report, or that the matter would be expressed more clearly in a subsequent statutory instrument. On that basis, we should give effect to our intention in the Bill. 
<P>
<B> Dr. Ladyman:</B> After the previous two Opposition contributions, I am motivated to give an example of why the sort of precision that the Opposition ask for is not a good idea. In a well-publicised case in the United States, Microsoft has been accused of trying to distort the market in network browsers by giving away a free browser with each operating system. Taking away the burden of proof I do not suggest that Microsoft is guilty we can consider what would happen if what they are accused of is true. If the amendment was accepted, how would we define the relevant market? 
<P>
<B> Mr. Hayes rose </B><P>
 
<P>
<B> Dr. Ladyman:</B> Let me develop my argument; I shall then give way. 
<P>
Microsoft is not accused of trying to make more profit now. By trying to distort the market, it is accused of preventing small companies from growing into large companies able to challenge its future position in the marketplace. It is not a matter of how much money Microsoft is making now. 
<P>
If the amendment was accepted, how would the Opposition assess the value of the market? Would they say that it was a proportion of the revenue that Microsoft was making from network browsers, which is nil? Would they say that the market was the operating system market, which is a much larger market, but still very limited? Or would they say that the market was the whole of the software market that runs on the operating systems, which is a huge market? 
<P>
As the Opposition cannot define Microsoft's actual intention, in that what it is accused of is trying to prevent future companies growing into potential competitors, it is surely much better to give the Secretary of State the flexibility to take the big picture into account, rather than being too tied down. 
<P>
<B> Mr. Hayes:</B> Perhaps I should declare an interest, Mr. Maxton. I was with representatives of Microsoft between the morning and afternoon sittings of the Committee  
<P>
<B> Mr. Boswell:</B> Browsing. 
<P>
<B> Mr. Hayes:</B> I do not use Microsoft on my computer; it was a more personal contact. 
<P>
No one in the information systems industry would claim that the markets that the hon. Member for South Thanet (Dr. Ladyman) identified were not connected markets. That is the phrase used in the amendment. One can have semantic arguments about this, but in practice no one would make that claim. 
<P>
<B> Dr. Ladyman:</B> I am grateful for that intervention. The lawyers involved in the case claim that the markets are not connected. That is why I argue that the Secretary of State should have flexibility to determine what is relevant in a case and what should be taken into account. She should also look at the complex motives that may have led someone to take anti-competitive behaviour, as in the Microsoft case it has been suggested that it did so not to make money now, but to protect its future position. That requires different factors to be taken into consideration when determining the penalties involved. I do not believe that the precision being requested by the Opposition is relevant. The Secretary of State's powers are appropriate. 
<P>
<B> Mr. Brooks:</B> I have in my hand the Director General of Fair Trading's guide to the provision of the legislation in relation to market definition, which obviously the hon. Gentleman will have read. Why is he content for the director general to exercise decisions about market decisions in terms of examining infringements if he is not prepared to do so in respect of penalties? 
<P>
<B> Dr. Ladyman:</B> In this area of high technology and information technology, none of us has a clue what the marketplace will look like in five or 10 years' time when the Bill will still have an effect. Technology changes continuously. The Secretary of State must be given the flexibility to recognise that markets are changing and to change the guidelines as she goes along. 
<P>

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(1A) In determining the appropriate amount of any penalty under this Part, the Director must  
<P>
(a) have regard both to the gravity of the infringement of the prohibition and its duration, 
<P>

<P>
(c) treat the presence or otherwise of a compliance programme within the undertaking and the extent to which the undertakings have assisted the Director in his investigation as a mitigating factor.'.<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
I am grateful for the opportunity to move this amendment. The clause is relatively opaque on the nature of the guidance that the director general will publish about the appropriate level of a penalty within the limit set in clause 37. The purpose of the amendment is not to interfere with the process of making the guidance, but to have within such guidance reference to some factors to which the director general must have regard in determining an appropriate penalty. 
<P>
There are three parts to proposed new subsection (1A). The first and second parts paragraphs (a) and (b) relate to article 15(2) of EC council regulation 17, with which I am sure the Under-Secretary is familiar. That will bring into the thinking behind an appropriate penalty the same features of intent, recklessness and so on that apply to the EC regulations, so excluding the penalty for innocent breach. The penalty should have regard to the gravity and duration of the infringement. 
<P>
The Committee accepted Government amendment No. 38 earlier, which at the time of drafting this amendment I did not contemplate. I have, therefore, looked carefully to see whether the necessity for proposed new subsection (1A)(b) will disappear by virtue of Government amendment No. 38, but I suspect that it will not. It is possible that although penalties will not be applied for those who engage without intention or not negligently, none the less there is a modest possibility that someone may infringe the effects of an agreement or its conduct without intent. I shall take the Under-Secretary's advice on paragraph (b) in that it may duplicate Government amendment No. 38, because it would also have the effect of excluding those who have no intent or who are not negligently giving rise to an anti-competitive effect or an effect under the chapter II prohibition. 
<P>
The third party of proposed new subsection paragraph (c) is of my own devising, and it is not intended to translate into this legislation something that has arisen in EC regulations. It is intended to have a positive effect. There should be a mitigating effect for companies seeking to ensure compliance in their procedures. By not giving rise to anti-competitive agreements or an abuse of a dominant position, and in so far as the companies help the director general by complying fully and doing everything to assist the investigation, there should be a mitigating effect on the penalty that is applied to them. 
<P>
As in our recent debate, the Under-Secretary may say that there may be other factors and that the director general will have the opportunity to set things out in the guidance that he will publish. However, the debate it necessary so that the Under-Secretary can tell what is intended by the granting of power under clause 39 and so that we can discuss whether it would be desirable to specify certain other circumstances in the Bill.

<P>

<B> Mr. Nigel Griffiths:</B> Our amendment No. 38 goes further than amendment No. 194 in that penalties cannot be imposed unless there is intent or negligence. The other factors mentioned in amendment No. 194 are important, but the Bill properly leaves them to the director general's discretion. It is important that industry is clear about what factors may affect penalties. Therefore, the Bill requires the director general to publish guidance on penalties. He has already said that it is highly likely that the guidance will provide for compliance procedures to be taken into account and it is inconceivable that regard will not be had to the gravity and duration of the infringement. Of course, the guidance must be approved by the Secretary of State. 
<P>
<B> Mr. Lansley:</B> I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for his reply. I hope that he will accept that the extent to which a company co-operates with the director general in the pursuit of an investigation might be a mitigating factor that the director general can take into account. However, on the basis of the hon. Gentleman's assurance, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment. 
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<B> The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendment No. 143. 
<P>
<B> Mr. Griffiths:</B> The amendments would require the director general to prepare and publish guidance on the appropriate level of any penalty. Amendment No. 96 would remove the obligation on a court or an appeal tribunal to have regard to the director general's guidance. Amendment No. 143 is consequential on that. 
<P>
We want to underpin the requirement on the director general to have regard to guidance when he sets a penalty. There is concern that, as currently drafted, the clause would require an appeal tribunal also to have regard to the director general's guidance, which might limit the independence of the appeal process from the director general. To put the matter beyond doubt, amendment No. 96 removes the obligation on a tribunal and a court to have regard to such guidance.

</UL></FONT> 
<P>
<B> Mr. Chidgey:</B> I want to speak to amendments Nos. 105, 115 and 106, which stand in my name and that of my hon. Friends. 
<P>
It will be clear that we support the Government's desire to harmonise United Kingdom and European legislation in order to reduce the administrative burden on British business. The European Commission has recently issued documentation that states that, in the event that a member state has incorporated articles 85 and 86 tests into national law, if the member state investigates a potential infringement using those tests, the Commission will not pursue a parallel investigation. 
<P>
It would seem logical that, in the interests of certainty, a reciprocal arrangement should exist to cater for cases in which the Commission has already been notified of an agreement. Clause 42 provides limited assurances in relation to the suspension of penalties, should it be decided than an agreement infringes article 85. The current wording of those assurances needs to be clarified if they are not to create uncertainty for businesses. More significantly, subsection (4) permits national bodies to conduct an investigation simultaneous to one conducted by the Commission. If the bill is in line with EC law, as intended, such a provision is superfluous, and could put businesses at risk of double jeopardy. 
<P>
Amendment No. 115 deals with comfort letters. The Committee will be aware that a vast number of agreements notified to the European Commission are not subject to formal decision, but receive only an administrative letter saying that the Commission intends to take no further action under regulation 17/62, which is generally known as a comfort letter. The Commission regards a comfort letter as sufficient assurance for the parties to an agreement to continue their normal business, as is right and proper. 
<P>
It may be argued that the Bill cannot truly reflect article 85, and therefore reduce the uncertainty for and administrative burden on businesses, unless the recipients of comfort letters from the European Commission can rely on those letters for immunity from UK penalties or compensation. 
<P>
I have tabled my three amendments because it should be clear in the Bill, not just in the guidelines, that the director general will not investigate an arrangement already notified to the Commission. There should be certainty of compliance for businesses that have already notified an agreement to the Commission. 
<P>
Such a provision will mirror a parallel ruling by the Commission, which has agreed not to investigate arrangements already notified to member states. Should the European Commission and the United Kingdom undertake a simultaneous investigation, the cost burden should not be placed on small business. 
<P>
I have given the Committee enough information for an understanding of why the amendments are important. I await the Minister's response. 
<P>
<B> Mr. Boswell:</B> I have much sympathy with the remarks of the hon. Member for Eastleigh. The concept behind his remarks is enshrined in the amendment tabled by my right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham and me. That concept is also enshrined in the clause. There is a need for harmonisation of the two jurisdictions; we all agree about that. Our amendment would provide that investigations should not be pursued at times when matters are being notified to the Commission. That is broadly similar to the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Eastleigh. 
<P>
New clause 12 refers to enforcement. The chapter I and II prohibitions should not be enforced either when the Commission is investigating the same, allegedly anti-competitive agreements, or when it has taken a decision that would close the process. The matter has more than purely technical implications. Businesses, and especially the CBI, are worried about the possible clash between the two bodies with jurisdiction. Indeed, I shall complicate matters further in my subsequent remarks. 
<P>
The CBI has pointed out that the director general and the Commission both have jurisdiction. The CBI calls for what it describes as a bright-line divide between two jurisdictions, so that a business should know who is responsible for looking into a particular agreement or an alleged abuse. That is entirely reasonable. It should be one or other of the authorities, but not both simultaneously. 
<P>
There is a danger of a turf war between the competition authorities in London and Brussels. In the absence of an explicit bright-line divide in the Bill, or of clear guidance from the director general explaining the different roles of the different competition authorities, there is certainly a precedent in the field of merger control. Merger control regulations provide a one-stop-shop approach: Brussels has jurisdiction if, in the words of article 1(2) of the regulations, 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"combined aggregate worldwide turnover of all the undertakings exceeds 5 million ecu"<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
and the 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"aggregate Community-wide turnover of each of at least two of the undertakings concerned is more than 250 million ecu" <P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
that is, unless each of the undertakings concerned achieves more than two thirds of its aggregate Community-wide turnover within the same member state. 
<P>
That is a turnover test and it attempts to provide a one-stop shop. The Minister likes such tests. It may not be so easy to read it across into guidance by the director general, let alone to make precise specifications in the Bill. However, the matter should be addressed and the Under-Secretary owes the Committee an explanation of how it will work in practice. 
<P>
I have one further point, which is embedded in the Bill and I almost intervened during our debate on clause 39 to discuss it. There are not only two possible players in these matters, as clause 42 implies; there are three possible players, because an applicant can go straight to court for jurisdiction on a particular complaint. In certain cases, it may be in the applicant's interests to make the application through the director general, who will then carry out an investigation. However, under the Bill and in the absence of any rules under the schedules that preclude it, a company may go straight to the courts to do its own thing. Indeed, that is implied by clause 39, even as amended. 
<P>
For example, a largish, single undertaking, which did not constitute a scale monopoly, might be faced with a trade association of smaller heterogeneous companies which were competitors and the legislation might be used ad terrorem of the smaller undertakings. That might well happen. If I were a sharp competition lawyer, what would I do to advise that company? I would tell the company to put as many shots in its locker as it could. On the same day I would deliver a complaint to the Commission; I would deliver a complaint to the Director General of Fair Trading with a request that the alleged abuse be investigated, and I would slap a writ on the trade association involved, at the end of which that association could find itself suckered as we discussed earlier in Committee caught between three jurisdictions and almost certainly losing one if not all three of them. That is unfortunate. 
<P>
<H5>6.45 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the amendments is to clear up the relationship between the jurisdictions of the Commission and the UK. I hope that the Under-Secretary will also have regard to the fact that the direct and less trammelled operation of the courts will provide a further possible avenue. He may wish that that would work in favour of competition and justice. However, it is possible that in certain hands it could provide further embarrassment for the honest undertaking of business and cause considerably difficulty for the operation of the Bill.

<P>

<B> Mr. Nigel Griffiths:</B> Clause 42 provides immunity from penalties for breach of the chapter I prohibition where an agreement has been notified to the European Commission for an exemption from the EC prohibition under article 85(1). That is another example of the benefits of aligning our regime closely with that of the EU. If agreements affect trade between member states and have been notified to the Commission, they do not need to be notified as well to the Director of Fair Trading. Such agreements will automatically be immune from penalties regarding any infringement of the chapter I prohibition, until the Commission determines the matter. 
<P>
The protection from penalties under the clause ends when the Commission determines the matter. If an exemption is granted the agreement will then be exempt under the domestic regime as a parallel exemption under clause 10. The clause does not, however, prevent the director general from investigating an agreement that has been notified to the European Commission. That is intentional, and I am happy to explain why, in answering the amendments in more detail. 
<P>
Amendment No. 105 appears to be based on a misunderstanding. Substituting "shall" for "may" here does not affect the meaning of the provision. As it stands, clause 42(2) prevents the director general from requiring a penalty to be paid where an agreement has been notified to the Commission, but the Commission has not yet determined the matter. That is a clear protection, not a matter for the director general's discretion. 
<P>
Amendment No. 106 would prevent the director general from investigating an agreement that had been notified to the European Commission. However, giving absolute legal certainty by barring the director general from investigating while the Commission is considering a notification for exemption would leave loopholes that could easily be exploited. Most obviously, parties to agreements that had no effect on inter-state trade might be tempted to notify agreements to the Commission and thus evade any investigative action ny the director general in respect of the domestic prohibition. There may be agreements that are of little or no Community interest and the Community may not have the time or resources to deal with them, yet the director general might have grounds to investigate. For those reasons the amendment is not acceptable. 
<P>
<B> Mr. Redwood rose </B><P>
 
<P>
<B> Mr. Griffiths:</B> I will come to the right hon. Gentleman's other amendments in a minute  
<P>
<B> Mr. Redwood:</B> I am grateful to the Under-Secretary; part of what I want to say will help him. The Opposition agree that in some cases the agreement might have no impact on inter-state trade but be against intra-state trade. We have always said that there should be a separate jurisdiction to deal with intra-state trade. However, business surely expects the two jurisdictions to talk to each other and it might be worthwhile negotiating some hard and fast rules so that businesses can ascertain whether they need a Brussels exemption or permission, or British authority exemptions or permissions. The double jeopardy is unsatisfactory. I had hoped that the Bill would reduce it. 
<P>
<B> Mr. Griffiths:</B> Clearly, it would be a waste of regulatory resources and of business time if domestic and community procedures were to be applied simultaneously. We expect close co-operation. The Commission has issued a public notice on co-operation between it and national competition authorities in cases where both have jurisdiction. The notice contains extensive guidelines on the allocation of cases to which articles 85 and 86 apply to avoid unnecessary duplication. I hope that I have provided the right hon. Gentleman with the assurance that he seeks. I hope that he will acknowledge that amendments Nos. 106 and 123 would create loopholes. 
<P>
New clause 12 is equally unacceptable. It would allow some investigation of anti-competitive agreements, but it would prevent final decisions stopping those agreements. What is the use of having the power to investigate an anti-competitive agreement if the director general cannot take action against such an agreement? The Commissioner may not be quick to investigate agreements that are of no or very little Community interest. Why should the director general be stopped from enforcing the prohibition to end such agreements and from preventing the serious harm that may be done to the UK economy? 
<P>
When the Commission actively investigates an agreement of conduct, as a matter of practice it will be pointless for the director general to start a separate investigation. However, we do not believe that it is right to include in the Bill a rigid dividing line on matters actively investigated by the Commission. 
<P>
I have similar objections to amendment No. 123. I hope that the Opposition will not press their amendments, but I am happy to provide any further explanation that they may require. 
<P>
<B> Mr. Chidgey:</B> I have listened to the Under-Secretary's argument, but I am not entirely convinced by it. He has not addressed amendment No. 115 at all, although I may have missed it in passing. 
<P>
I would like to return to these matters on another occasion, so I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill. 
<P>
<B> Mr. Boswell:</B> I promise that I will not detain the Committee as I am mindful of business that hon. Members may have elsewhere. 
<P>
I want to speak about the destruction of documents. We understand, from the helpful exchanges that we have had today, the need for an enforcement procedure. Clearly, documents cannot be destroyed before officials' eyes if they are unable to get in to redeem those documents. The other side of that is a party that sets out to destroy documents, regardless of any official raids that may take place. I do not have a problem with conventional means of destruction, such as setting a match to documents or tampering with them. Sadly there have been cases where such destruction has occurred. I am concerned here simply to establish that documents may be in a non-material form, in the shape of computer records, and so forth. Again, I have no problem if the issue is simply one of setting to work on the computer with an axe or a sledgehammer. That is an act of wilful destruction that we cannot argue with. 
<P>
I am concerned that permitting under subsection (1)(b) the destruction, disposal, falsification or concealment of a document that is non-material could include the inadvertent destruction of a computer record. Wilful destruction is one case but thinking ahead to issues of millennium compliance, for example, how necessary will it be for the business to safeguard itself against the possible accidental or non-deliberate destruction of its computer records? It is a small point. If the Under-Secretary does not want to answer it tonight perhaps he will consider it further. 
<P>
<B> Mr. Nigel Griffiths:</B> It is one of those joyous moments in Committee when civil servants pass one a message saying, "You're on your own." 
<P>
<B> The Chairman:</B> Order. Civil servants do not exist. 
<P>
<B> Mr. Griffiths:</B> You wish, Mr. Maxton. 
<P>
The clause makes it clear that the person is required to produce a document within a time scale. If the destruction under subsection (1)(b) occurs before there is any requirement for an investigation and it occurs accidentally, one would not expect the person to be subject to any penalties. However, if someone is required to produce a document and gives an instruction which causes its destruction, that is clear cut. I hope that that satisfies the hon. Gentleman. This is naturally an important clause and we want to have strong deterrents against destroying or falsifying documents that are required. The offence is considered to be so serious that subsection (2)(b) provides for imprisonment.

Question put and agreed to.
