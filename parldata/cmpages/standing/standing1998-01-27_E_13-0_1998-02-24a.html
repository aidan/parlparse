<h5>10.30 am</h5>
<b>Mr. David Curry (Skipton and Ripon):</b> On a point of order, Mr. Benton. At our previous sitting, I quoted from a document produced by the Yorkshire and Humberside Development Agency_a slightly confusing title, as that body is, presumably, not the one that will come into existence. The document asked several questions about the Government's proposals, and implied that the agency was not clear about them. I was asked what date was on the document. I replied, accurately, that it was February 1997, and suggested that the date was wrong. I checked with the organisation, which told me that it had had a software problem, and that I was right_the paper dates from February 1998, so it is a contemporaneous document. It did not take a year to arrive in the post. I should like to make it absolutely clear to the Committee that the Yorkshire and Humberside Development Agency is still confused about the Government's proposals. It is not a year-old document; it is very recent indeed.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am sure that the Committee will note that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> Further to that point of order, Mr. Benton. In the House yesterday, the Deputy Prime Minister appeared to give a new role to English Partnerships, stating that it would be asked to seek sites similar to the millennium village to enable urban villages throughout the country to share the benefits. Given that large sections of English Partnerships will shortly be knocked on the head, have the Government had a major rethink on EP's role? Will it continue to exist? I hope that the Minister can explain what EP's role will be. The clauses that we are about to consider deal with its future role.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am sorry to say that that is not a point of order. If the Minister should choose at an appropriate time to refer to that matter, due allowance will be made.
<H4><center>Clause 39</center></H4>
<center>Powers in relation to the Commission</center>
<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Yeo </B>(South Suffolk): I beg to move amendment No. 151, in page 18, line 37, leave out from beginning to `and'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 152, in page 18, line 37, leave out from `affairs' to end of line 38.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> It is clear from what my right hon. Friend has said that not only is the Yorkshire and Humberside Development Agency confused about Government policy, but so are the Government themselves. In the past eight remarkable days, we have moved from denial through panic into sheer chaos. First, there was denial that there was a problem about taking planning powers away from elected local councillors and giving them to unelected bureaucrats operating hundreds of miles away from the land over which those planning powers might be exercised. Then there was panic as the Government saw what an appalling sense of outrage filled those who began to understand what was proposed. Now, there is total chaos as contradictory policies have been presented, one following another, one of which has just been highlighted by my right hon. Friend.
<P>
<B>The Minister for Regions, Regeneration and Planning (Mr. Richard Caborn)</b> rose_
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. May I anticipate the Minister? It is appropriate to suggest that we stick to the amendment, and that Mr Yeo speaks to it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> I shall return quickly to amendments Nos. 151 and 152, tabled in my name and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Cheadle (Mr. Day). The amendments highlight the Government's confusion even about the Rural Development Commission, the subject of clause 39.
<P>
Subsection (1)_<i>[Interruption.]</i>
<p>
<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I am having difficulty listening to the hon. Member for South Suffolk.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> It is always flattering to know that you at least, Mr. Benton, are interested in what I say. My hon. Friend the Member for Cheadle is sufficiently familiar with the general line of our attack.
<P>
Subsections (1) (e) and (f) make the Government's true intentions clear. Those intentions were just beginning to be exposed during our debate on previous amendments to the clause.
<P>
The first sentence of paragraph 4.23 on page 25 of the White Paper reads:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> "The Government are giving urgent consideration to the future of the national advisory role of the RDC and its other countrywide programmes, as part of the Government's Comprehensive Spending Review."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is clear that what is happening is not a careful consideration or review of Government strategy and the needs of rural areas but a process driven by spending cuts.
<p>The Government's consideration of the role of the Rural Development Commission is designed to swell the Chancellor's coffers still further. On top of the pensions tax last July, the massive increase in petrol tax, the huge increases in council tax and the prospect of the threatened retrospective tax on PEPs and TESSAs, the Government plan to abolish the Rural Development Commission because of the demands of the comprehensive spending review. That is not a great surprise. We have seen how the Department has been outgunned elsewhere in Whitehall. It has turned on its own agencies and is plundering the programmes of those very bodies which it should be promoting, not abolishing.
<p>The arguments advanced in our debate on amendment No. 148 still hold. Who will gain from the abolition of the Rural Development Commission? Certainly not the rural areas or the people who are benefiting from its advice. The Government's apparently wide consultation process produced little support for the abolition of the RDC. But abolition is made possible by clause 39(1)(e) and (f). Having secured powers to remove the functions of the RDC if the Secretary of State believes them to be better performed elsewhere, why is the Minister seeking further powers? The only answer can be that it is in the Government's mind to abolish the RDC once the Bill is enacted. Will the Minister come clean and tell the Committee that that is what the Government are going to do? When will he have the guts to tell the RDC staff?
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> I have been puzzling for some time as to why the Government chose to move the most substantive part of the RDC's work to the agencies but to leave outside what is possibly the least important part of its work. Why give 80 per cent. to another agency and leave the RDC_a national organisation with advisory functions_outside? I cannot see the logic of that. Why not give all its work to the RDAs? After all, the RDC's budget in toto is no more than that of a largish district council. It is not a gargantuan organisation. If most of its role is to be absorbed into the RDAs, why choose to leave a little bit outside?
<P>
The scales have fallen from my eyes and from those of my hon. Friend the Member for South Suffolk (Mr. Yeo) in the past few sittings. Clearly, a small part of the RDC's work has been left outside the RDAs so that the RDC can be quietly put to sleep once the RDAs are established, or as a result of the Government's spending review. The work has not been absorbed by the RDAs because it would have been embarrassing for the Government to set up a development agency and, as one of their first acts, to scrap some of its functions and take away part of its budget. That is what would have happened. This poor, miserable bit of the RDC's role has been left outside the RDAs so that it can be quietly eliminated during the spending review.
<P>
Quite frankly, that is rather dishonest. The Government should have said that they planned to absorb the RDC because that would be neater, tidier and make more sense, but that, as a result of their review of all functions, some functions might be carried out by the agency and might be given to a different agency. Had they said that, we would have known where we stood.
<P>
All Governments spend most of their lives reviewing expenditure. No one has the permanent right to existence. There is no such thing as eternity in politics. Curiously enough, rarely is there such a thing as absolute death in politics either. Most matters linger on half way between extinction and eternity, which I suppose is the human condition.
<P>
The RDC seems to have been treated particularly badly. If the Minister agrees to have a rethink and decides that it does not make sense to leave the tail end outside and that it should all be absorbed, but concludes that parts of it will have to be moved elsewhere or cannot be sustained, we shall understand. That often happens, but the pretence that there is some inner logic in the proposed division, with part of the RDC's role passing to the RDAs and part being left outside, and a strong autonomous case for maintaining one function in some nationwide independent form does not stand up. The Government are clearly trying to put up a smoke screen to hide their intention of getting rid of it altogether. That is not a worthy way of behaving and will not fool anyone. I hope that the Minister will decide that the subterfuge is not worth pursuing and call it off now.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> May I repeat what was said in the House of Lords on 17 February. Lord Beaumont of Whitley asked whether the Government would hold a public consultation before the announcement of any restructuring of the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions and the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food which would affect the countryside agencies. My colleague, Baroness Hayman responded:

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> "It was announced on 3 December that the Government were accelerating that part of the Government's Comprehensive Spending Review which was considering the institutional arrangements for delivering rural policy. The Rural Development Commission, the Countryside Commission, English Nature and the Farming and Rural Conservation Agency are being consulted about this work. Terms of reference for the Comprehensive Spending Review of rural and countryside policy were published on 24 July 1997, with comments invited. We shall be considering, in the light of the outcome of the specific work on institutions, whether any wider consultation would be appropriate._[Official Report, House of Lords, 17 February 1998; Vol. 586, c. WA 28.]"</ul></font>
<P>
The problem faced by the Government when they came to power on 1 May and started looking at the issues facing rural communities was a confused position. A proliferation of organisations were falling over themselves trying to deliver a comprehensive and coherent strategy for the rural communities and the countryside. Over the past nine months, we have, bit by bit, put together a more comprehensive, focused and manageable strategy for rural communities and the countryside in general. We took a further step yesterday when my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister announced his document,  Planning for communities for the future
<P>
The amendment reveals the Opposition's guilt complex. Their record on the rural communities is appalling and they are now having to scramble together a defence for what they have done in the past 18 years, which is not commendable. They have tabled amendments to leave the RDC a shell. That is the sum total of the amendments before us and those that we debated at our previous sitting. The Secretary of State would not be in a position to bring together bodies such as the Countryside Commission and the Rural Development Commission at national level and to give an overview from the national perspective if that was wanted after the comprehensive spending review. The amendments would make a shell of the RDC. That may be a monument to the Conservative Government and their poor efforts in rural areas_they were high on rhetoric and low on delivery, as the statistics on rural areas are proving without doubt.

<P>

<B>Mr. Curry:</B> Is the Minister saying that the Government may consider amalgamating various organisations_including the Countryside Commission, the residual RDC and English Nature_into one grand organisation? Is he aware that the previous Government contemplated bringing together the Countryside Commission and English Nature, but they concluded that those organisations' loads were sufficiently different for them to maintain separate identities? Is the idea of a grand consolidation in the Government's mind? If so, how will targeting be ensured? Will we start disaggregating again five years hence?
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr Caborn:</B> The right hon. Gentleman has every right to that opinion. Practice over the past 18 years has not been good for rural communities_the delivery mechanisms that central Government put in place have been pretty poor by any standards.
<P>
Our debate in Committee involves regeneration and a wider discussion about rural communities. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions has tackled the problem of household growth. We shall serve rural communities better if we ensure that there is coherence. We do not believe in departmentalisation or in the establishment of little fiefdoms all over the place, which is what the previous Government tried to put in place. The RDAs wil bring coherence, democracy and economic regeneration to regions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> The Minister should be cautious about assuming that coherence is simply another word for amalgamation. It is entirely possible to have coherent policies that are administered by different organisations. If he believes that coherence is achieved by the mere fact of amalgamation, he is heading for all sorts of problems. It is in everyone's interests, including his own, that he is warned about that at the outset.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> If that is the right hon. Gentleman's concern, he should consider the comments that Baroness Hayman made in the other place. She said that comments had been invited on the review, which is under way. The terms of reference were published on 24 July 1997. Consultations are taking place with the RDC, the Countryside Commission, English Nature and rural conservation agencies.
<P>
Real consultation_speaking to people who have something to add to the debate_is a foreign concept to the Opposition .It results in better and more acceptable decisions. The Opposition ridiculed the consultation process_the hon. Member for South Suffolk found one or two criticisms among the 1,500 responses, which gave him a small chink through which to attack the Government. When the Opposition were in government, they were simply unable to consult people.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> Before the Minister discusses consultation further, he should remember the Government's behaviour in banning beef on the bone. How many days did that consultation process last and what notice did the Government take of anyone?
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> I do not know what beef on the bone has to do with RDAs. The right hon. Gentleman raises it because he has no other significant objections to the Bill.

<P>
With regard to beef on the bone, we brought to the public's attention_
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. You were right the first time. Committee members must keep to the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> Since the Minister is so proud of his consultation execise, will he say which of the 1,500 respondents supported the abolition of the RDC?
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> As the hon. Gentleman knows, several organisations welcomed the review of delivery to rural areas. It is unfortunate that he has not read all of the responses, but if he had done_
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> I have read more than the Minister, whom I kept catching out.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> If the hon. Gentleman manages to catch me out, it will be for the first time. He got caught out yesterday about the 75 per cent. figure. That was excellent.
<P>
The amendments would remove the Secretary of State's powers to wind up and dissolve the RDC. The future of the RDC is being considered as part of the comprehensive spending review, which has been illustrated by an answer given in the House by my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister. No decisions have yet been taken, but in drafting the Bill we must allow for any number of options. The powers in clause 39 would not and could not be exercised arbitrarily. They could be exercised only by means of a statutory instrument, which would be subject to affirmative resolution by both Houses of Parliament. The amendments serve similar purposes to those of amendments numbers 148 to 150, which we have already debated. In view of my prior assurances about the Government's commitment to retain a national focus for expertise, advice and information on rural matters, and about the rural remit of RDAs, I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> I am disappointed by the Minister's answer, but at least we have clearly established that none of the 1,5000 consultees_a 100 per cent. record_supported the Government's policy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> May I quote the Consortium of Rural TECs, which stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>" The regional functions of the RDC should be incorporated into the RDA which should maintain a `Rural issues desk'."<P>
</UL></FONT><P>

<b>Mr. Yeo:</b> Even with his extraordinary ability to distort facts, the Minister cannot claim that that statement means that the RDC should be abolished. Not a single person supported the claim that the 1,500 consultees unanimously support the Government's policy; we now find that they unanimously disagree with that policy. We must therefore press the amendment to a vote.

<P>
</FONT><B>Mr. Yeo:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 153, in Clause 39, page 18, line 40, at end insert_
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>" (2A) Where the Secretary of State considers that any provision he proposes should be made under subsection (1) would have an effect upon one or more local authorities, that provision shall, not be made until he has consulted the local authority or local authorities concerned."<P>
</UL></FONT>.

<P>
Day after day in this Committee, the Government have rebuffed local authorities. Perhaps the clearest conclusion to be drawn from our debates over the past five weeks is that the Government are determined to impinge on the role and the resources of local councils at every opportunity. The Bill takes power and money away from elected councils and gives it to unelected bureaucrats appointed by the Secretary of State and operating from urban offices, in some cases hundreds of miles from the communities over which control will be exercised.
<P>
It has been confirmed during our debates that the regional development agencies will be funded by means of cuts in the English revenue support grant. The Government have attempted to remove the planning powers of local councils, which was prevented only by the Opposition's insistence that the Government drop that centralising provision. The Government have consistently refused to give any statutory backing to the process of consultation with local authorities. Amendment No. 153 gives the Government a final opportunity to redeem themselves because it would enable the local authorities that are affected by the threats to the Rural Development Commission to express their views before those threats are implemented.
<P>
I can guess why the Minister may not like the amendment. Local authorities in rural areas share my concerns about the proposed destruction of the RDC because they can already see what is happening to their position and their finances. Contrary to the Minister's remarks at the end of the previous debate about the record of the previous Administration, does he imagine that the 100,000, 150,000 or even 200,000 people who are coming to the capital next Sunday are doing so as a spontaneous demonstration of their enthusiastic support for the Government's attitude to the countryside?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Jackie Ballard </B>(Taunton): How spontaneous does the hon. Gentleman believe is the support of those people who have been told that they may not have a job if they do not support the countryside march?
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> I am glad to see that the coalition is alive and well. Those who voted Liberal Democrat in counties such as the one that I represent will now hear the true voice of the Liberal party pouring scorn on the countryside march. I do not know whether that remark was cleared by the office of the right hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Ashdown), but I shall be happy to give wide publicity to the hon. Lady's remarks, which are an interesting slur on the views of the many thousands of people who are travelling to London on Sunday, at their own expense, to demonstrate their concern about the threat to the rural way of life_a threat that is clearly not recognised by the Liberal party and which may be a threat that the hon. Lady actively supports.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Ballard:</B> It is because of the actions of the Conservative Government that people are threatened.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> If the marches are in protest against the actions of the previous Government, they are a year too late.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> Rural transport can be very slow.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> As my right hon. Friend says, many will not be able to travel in a gas-guzzling, chauffeur-driven Jaguar of the sort favoured by the Secretary of State.
<P>
As the Government ram home, with the active support of the Liberal party, their attack on rural communities, our attempts to protect what is left of the English countryside from the ravages of a planning Minister whose contempt for the views of local councils and planning inspectors is matched only by his determination to bulldoze and concrete over more green fields_

<B>Mrs. Ballard:</B> The hon. Gentleman has not answered my question.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am sorry to intervene again, but we are straying from the amendment. Will the hon. Member for South Suffolk keep to the amendment?
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> I am most grateful to you, Mr. Benton.
<P>
Clearly, many local authorities would like to take advantage of the right to consultation that amendment No. 153 would give them. The Minister is not in favour of that because his time would be taken up listening to their criticisms and concerns, an inconvenience for a Minister who has already shown the Committee that he does not like to be troubled by details such as getting the Bill right. Local authorities are entitled to this right to consultation. I hope that the Minister will say that the proposals to destroy the Rural Development Commission will be discussed with the local authorities in rural areas that are likely to be affected by them. I commend the amendment to the Committee.

<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> We have just heard the ranting and raving of someone who has no argument for his amendment. The hon. Gentleman has gone down all sorts of avenues to try to justify an extremely weak amendment. To give him the benefit of the doubt, I assume that it was a probing amendment.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I should remind the Committee of the press release issued yesterday by the Council for the Protection of Rural England, which, though not absolutely germane to the Bill, said that we are approaching a watershed in the way in which we plan new housing and in our attitude to city living. CPRE was vociferous about our housing approach during our consultation. Clearly, our policies command tremendous respect all over the country.
<P>
I was interested in what the hon. Member for Taunton (Mrs. Ballard) said about people being threatened into joining the march that will take place at the weekend. I hope that that is not so. That is no way for anyone to express a view. We would all defend the rights to march and protest but I hope that no one is being threatened, as that would be a retrograde step.
<P>
The amendment is not needed. Clause 39 contains provision for the Secretary of State's powers in relation to the Rural Development Commission. Amendment No. 153 would require the Secretary of State to consult local authorities affected by the exercise of those powers. I am not clear why the hon. Member for South Suffolk wants that. Why, for example, has he not tabled an amendment that would require the Secretary of State to consult a public body to which the EDC's functions will be transferred? His amendment shows some naivety in that sense, but we have seen that throughout the Committee's proceedings.
<P>
Such amendments are not needed. The Secretary of State would, naturally, consult those who had a direct interest in any measures which he proposes to take under clause 39. The woolliness of the amendment surprises me, as it suggests that there may be circumstances in which an individual authority might be uniquely affected by the exercise of powers to transfer functions from the RDC, which is a national organisation. The amendment adds nothing to the Bill; I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> I got the answer I expected. It was necessary to confirm yet again that the Government have no intention of involving local authorities in discussions about policies that will affect them. I understand why the Government do not wish to do so. To save the Committee's time this morning. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ben Chapman </B>((Wirral, South)): I wish to make some points about English Partnerships, to which the clause refers. English Partnerships on the Wirral has done extremely valuable work in terms of economic development, job creation, business growth and, in particular, the attraction of inward investment. It has done so through schemes such as the Wirral International business park, the Tranmere urban village, the Laird Foundation, the Vauxhall supplier park and many others. The work has been greatly welcomed by people on the Wirral peninsula, as has the approved investment programme of £28.7 million.
<P>
There is concern that the assets of English Partnerships will be transferred to the RDA. I should like assurances from the Minister on that. My constituents greatly look forward to the establishment of the RDA and to the transfer of EP's assets to it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> Thank you, Mr. Benton. May I crave your indulgence to answer the question raised by the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon on the national role of English Partnerships?
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> Next clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> Fine, if the right hon. Gentleman is happy to wait. I thought that he might have wanted to nip out and phone the BBC, in which case I wanted to answer the question while he was in the Room. However, I shall wait until we discuss the next clause.
<P>
I wish that the Liberal Democrats were more consistent in their opposition, because I am getting confused. It would make life much easier if they could say whether they are with us or against us.
<P>
What my hon. Friend the Member for Wirral, South (Mr. Chapman) said about English Partnerships is true. He has given me the opportunity to put the purpose of clause 40 on the record. It enables provisions to be made for the transfers of property, rights and liabilities from EP to RDAs. Subsection (1) provides that the Secretary of State may, by direction, require EP to make one or more schemes transferring such property rights and liabilities to an RDA for carrying out transfer activities as appropriate. Subsection (2) allows for specific details on the transfer schemes set out in schedule 9 to have effect for the clause.
<P>
I should like to put on record the thinking behind our decisions affecting EP assets. I hope to reassure those people who have been circulating the rumour that the assets will be transferred to the centre for redistribution. The bulk of assets will transfer with the work from EP regional offices to RDAs, so that the RDAs can continue the work which they take over.
<P>
We made it clear in the White paper that the RDAs will take on the role of EP regional offices to promote physical regeneration. With a few exceptions, which I shall mention in a moment, they will take on existing projects and take forward the task of identifying and preparing sites for business expansion and investment.
<P>
The existing network of EP regional offices is being reorganised to match the nine RDAs to which they will be transferred. The assets associated with those regional offices will also be transferred by virtue of a transfer schedule which will be drawn up initially by EP and approved by the Secretary of State. The transfer schedule will cover development schemes, the rights and liabilities arising from continuing EP projects, property, premises, furniture and equipment, intellectual property, guidance notes and records on the rights and liabilities associated with contracts for the provision of services. I expect the bulk of EP's portfolio of assets to be clearly associated with the work being undertaken by EP regional offices. The projects will transfer on vesting day to the RDAs to enable a seamless continuation of that work.

<P>
As we made clear when the White Paper was published, a limited number of projects of national importance or which cross regional boundaries will remain with EP in the interests of ensuring uninterrupted completion. They are: regeneration of the Greenwich peninsula; and coalfield initiatives. In April 2000, EP will merge with the Commission for the New Towns. We intend the role and functions of EP to move to the RDAs. Any assets remaining with EP after vesting date will transfer to the RDAs in due course. We are working closely with EP to identify the assets that will be transferred.

Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> I should like to explore the role that the Minister envisages for EP. The White Paper specifies that EP will continue to manage two schemes on the grounds that they are of national importance or that they cross regional boundaries. The schemes involve the Greenwich peninsula, and coalfield communities. I want to examine whether those two cases justify the continuation of EP.
<P>
I would have preferred EP to continue in any case. It is an outstandingly good body and would have provided a check on competitive subsidy. We await the famous concordat of which we have heard much mention. EP admits that its offices have been in occasional subsidy competition for projects, and that competition is a real problem.
<P>
EP owns the 180-acre Greenwich site, which will include the dome and its immediate hinterland and which has been much in the news lately. I shall not make a speech about the merits of the millennium project. I want to talk about the real estate, not the project. Roughly 50 acres of the site will be a coach park and back-up areas. The central part will cover 40 acres. A couple of days ago, the millennium village was announced. It will try to bring people into the peninsula, continuing the project to develop the Thames gateway area embarked on by the previous Government.
<P>
The main problem is remedial work. British Gas has spent £22 million on statutory remediation. EP is charged with bringing the site into development condition and putting in services and highways. EP will then hand over the site for the millennium experience which will be built under licence with a lease of 18 months, probably starting on the last day of 1999. The lease will be extendable by one year, making a maximum of two and a half years. The site will then revert to EP and could be retained for other use provided that commercial rent is paid.
<P>
EP will become the proud owner of the dome_or whatever is there_either on 1 July 2001 or 1 July 2002. EP is putting aside a dedicated, cash-limited £110 million to do all that. Some £37 million is coming from the Millennium Commission.

<P>
The site is within a single RDA area. There is no cross-border argument and no reason why the site should not be considered as falling within the purview of one RDA. What will the RDAs be for if not to develop sites such as Greenwich? The Government are fighting shy of entrusting the touchstone sites, on which judgments will be made and which are more challenging, to their new brainchild. It seems that the RDAs will not be entrusted with such projects, even where considerable commercial rents may eventually flow from them. What is the RDA for, if not to develop this site? I leave aside the fact that many people have not yet been persuaded that the millennium project is of national importance, although I hope that it will turn out to be. In Sheffield, no doubt, people will flock to their soccer museum rather than to the millennium experience, despite the fact that their two football teams are both sitting mid-table in their respective leagues.

<P>

<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> Four from the top?
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> That is mid-table. At least, it is outside the promotion spot, but it might be in the play-offs.
<P>
If the site is eventually rented, why should the RDA not benefit from the rent? What will English Partnerships do with the site if it reverts to that residuary body, as has been said? Will English Partnerships receive rent in respect of its continuing use? I accept that the whole of the Greenwich peninsula is a large and especially difficult job due to the legacy of contaminated land. Indeed, when the Deputy Prime Minister mentioned the subject in his statement yesterday, he did not tackle the problem of the additional cost of remediating the land. It is not good enough to say that the money will come from capital receipts. At some stage, he will have to tackle the issue of the significant cost of developing urban land with which many problems may be associated, as we discovered when the urban development corporation tackled some of the work. If the Government have confidence in the concept of the development agency, I fail to see why the millennium project and the Greenwich peninsula, a much wider and longer^term project, cannot be entrusted to it.
<P>
We then come to the coalfield communities project, which raises a different set of issues. It is curious that the two should be coupled because a better case can be made for the coalfield communities project than for the millennium project. At privatisation, British Coal owned about 120,000 acres of land and significant assets, including the chairman's flat in Mayfair and a significant amount of housing and green-field sites, but the core of the assets were coking works, tips and mine platforms. British Coal wanted to lock together the good and bad sites. There was much argument about the value of assets, with which I was involved. Finally, the English Partnerships took, on transfer, 5,700 acres of the most difficult sites, which I suspect represents the largest regeneration challenge in Europe. I would link that with some of the Thames Gateway projects_Stratford and Ebbsfleet, for example_over which an enormous question mark hangs because of the uncertainty of the channel tunnel rail link.
<P>
Fifty-six sites were transferred to English Partnerships in December 1986. It received no more money for taking over those sites, although it was estimated that expenditure of £350 million was necessary, and there was a problem over the cost of the enforceable environmental obligations. English Partnerships accepted British Coal's estimates after a long  how's your father<P>
, but if they turn out to be wrong, it must call against the Department of Trade and Industry.
<P>
To avoid swamping other programmes, the money is being ring-fenced and receipts from one area are to used for the subsequent regeneration of other areas. Work has begun on 12 sites, which represents about 24 per cent. of present acreage. Spending so far is about £20 million to £25 million. The big receipts are not expected to start flowing in until the next financial year. That covers five regional development agency or government office for the region areas. Two are overwhelmingly involved_
Yorkshire and the east midlands. Yorkshire has 2,800 acres and the west midlands and the east midlands regions combined have 1,500 acres, most of which are in the east midlands region. The north-east has 800 acres and the north-west has 300 acres. The scheme involves a 10-year programme and a national business plan, and the money goes into a central kitty, which permits cross^subsidy from one site to another.

<P>
One could argue that transferring to five separate agencies involves such dislocation that it is not worth while and that English Partnerships or an agency should finish the job, although that also involves difficulties. The Minister made great play of saying that all sorts of sub-flora would flourish under the agencies in his new world and that there was no reason why they should not co-ordinate. I understand the Minister's affection for the coalfield communities, and the role that they play in the Labour party's psyche, but I find it hard to understand why their regeneration was not entrusted to the Government's brainchild. perhaps the RDAs were not deemed worthy of such an important matter, which has a strong emotional pull. One can argue that it is better for the project to be kept under one body.
<P>
English Partnerships handles Footloose Inward Investment, which goes into the sites. The one thing that investors do not want is nine ports of call. The Yorkshire office of English Partnerships bid against the north-west office and the south-west office. How will that problem be regulated? Will English Partnerships continue to negotiate funding packages at a national level?
<P>
The two examples that are cited in the White Paper are opposing cases. The Greenwich peninsula falls squarely under a single development agency. Although that project involves a difficult and complex task, it is not different in degree from many of the other tasks that RDAs will have to carry out. Why cannot the relevant agencies take on that project lock, stock and barrel? I fail to see an intellectually coherent case for insisting that English Partnerships should do the millennium job. One might say that the project is of national interest, but that simply means that people will visit if from different parts of the country; it does not mean that the process of regeneration is itself diffused_it is all carried on in a rather small spot in east London. There is no reason why the RDA cannot take on the task_assuming that it is up to the job, which the Minister says it is.
<P>
The argument is different for the coalfield communities projects, which involves five development agencies and some 50-odd sites that must be developed in a phased process so that investment can gradually be nourished. Being divided between different authorities might involve much dislocation and interruption, and much co-ordination is necessary to overcome those problems. Given that an appropriate mechanism for doing so is already in place, it might be wise not to embark on that process.
<P>
Will the Minister explain why he lumped the two examples together_unless the Government want to retain credit for the eventual outcomes, assuming that they are satisfactory? I see no logic in lumping them together.
<P>
Finally, Mr. Benton, you invited me to revert to the Deputy Prime Minister's announcement yesterday. He said that we must identify the relevant sites for development, which we now have to call used sites; we are not allowed to call them brownfield sites, although the right hon. Gentleman did so throughout his statement. It makes sense to develop on used sites to the maximum. However, the Deputy Prime Minister failed to deal with two matters. First, the expense of such development is significant because the cost of remediation work is substantial. Unless money is directed to, RDAs_if they are to be given the job_to EP_if it is to have a residual role_or to local authorities_if they are to put such development alongside the capital receipts programmes_
the cost of development programmes on used sites will be high.
<P>
Secondly, there is a mismatch between the areas where sites are available and the areas where most people want to settle. Industrial sites are widely available in the north and the midlands, as we all know. However, areas where the greatest numbers of people want to settle are in the south, around the M25 ring. There is therefore dislocation between the sites where people are supposed to want to live, and the areas where the pressures of population in fact are. Must we implicitly or inferentially say that people cannot live where employment is, or where they want to, and that they must live somewhere else? Must we say that another 50,000 people must live in for example, Merseyside_which is now shedding population, not gaining it? The implications for the direction of human activities are important.


<P>
Those issues must be addressed if the Government are to uphold a policy that most of us want to support with intellectually substantial arguments, and to demonstrate that they are capable of delivering it. That was not the case yesterday. Whether Lord Rogers' team will be involved or not, I do not know, but EP will now be involved in the identification of new sites. Is that a new role for English Partnerships? Why should EP do that? I understood that RDAs were supposed to do it. I cannot see why EP in a national role, which is presumably what the Deputy Prime Minister was talking about, should identify sites when he has just created RDAs with the job of regeneration. That does not make sense. Why remove regeneration functions from EP and give them to RDAs, and then proceed to say that EP  will none the less go trainspotting, looking for sites for development? I cannot see the intellectual coherence of that. Will the Minister elucidate and explain not merely what he intends to do, but the intellectually substantial case for the continuing role of EP? What is the logic of its continued involvement in the Greenwich project? We must recognise that the project is much wider than the millennium. How long will that role continue? The clauses are exactly the equivalent of those for the RDC; they allow for the eventual extinction of EP . What time scale do the Government envisage? Under what circumstances would it happen? What are the implications for EP's residual role of the fundamental spending review about which we have heard so much_the Banquo's ghost at the feast of the Committee?
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> The clause is another that goes to the heart of the Bill. I shall not reiterate all our objections of principle to the proposal effectively to transfer much of the work that has been done by EP to RDAs.
<P>
However, it is an opportunity to pay tribute to the work that EP has done over recent years. That work is widely respected by all hon. Members and has contributed substantially to the regeneration process in many parts of England. I should also like to pay tribute to the retiring chairman, my noble Friend Lord Walker, to whose work I draw attention. He has served without any of the remuneration, pensions or pay-offs for which the Bill is making provision for the future. I also pay tribute to the staff of EP.
<P>
Does the Minister understand that one of the strengths of EP was its national focus? Its ability to attract high calibre staff resulted in part from the national focus. Clearly, it will be difficult, if not impossible, to recruit similar high calibre staff to nine separate agencies with much narrower focus. Therefore the agencies will start with a weaker range of human resource assets.

<P>

<B>Mr. Curry:</B> The concordat.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> My right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon refers to the concordat, about which we have heard a great deal. I understand that the concordat is designed to prevent the wasteful competition at the taxpayer's expense that the activities of nine RDAs_
which will operate simultaneously and perhaps aim for the same pool of investment_are likely to cause.
I wonder whether they delay in producing the concordat reflects growing recognition within the Government that wasteful competition between the nine RDAs is inevitable. Indeed, the Bill will set up a mechanism that guarantees that taxpayers' money will be wasted.

<P>
My right hon. Friend also referred to the role for English Partnerships_outlined yesterday by the Deputy Prime Minister_in finding sites. That, as my right hon. Friend says, is evidence of yet more confusion in the Government's mind as they make policy on the hoof. As they realise that one planning policy has proved disastrous they hastily replace it with another without thinking the consequences through. This particular policy illustrates confusions of all kinds.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Dr. Doug Naysmith </B>(Bristol, North-West): Does the hon. Gentleman recognise that, under the previous Administration, encouraging different local authorities_
never mind regional organisations_to jump through hoops to compete and bid for different projects was made into a fine art? One of the Ministers responsible for that is sitting in the Committee. In places like Bristol, Plymouth, Exeter_in fact, all over the south-west_competition and bidding took place left, right and centre. Trying to find out why one bid was successful and another failed was almost impossible. I went with a number of delegations to the relevant Minister when I was a Bristol councillor to try to find the answers to some of those questions.
<P>
Will the hon. Gentleman accept that the whole procedure for which he criticises the present Government was developed into a fine art over 18 years of Conservative Government?
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> I am not sure whether the hon. Gentleman is really arguing that the kind of large-scale projects that English Partnerships has been involved in were those which caused the competition that he alleges existed. if he really believes, however, that councillors in Plymouth and places further west will happily fold their tents and make no effort to attract inward investment because some bureaucrat sitting in Bristol says it will go to Swindon instead_which is what the Bill envisages_then he is living in a strange world. Such councillors will feel just as strongly that they deserve a better crack of the whip. As they have been lumped in with the region_part of which they have little in common with_they may intensify the wasteful use of resources to try to defend their interests within that region, which the Government are determined shall remain unaltered for all time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> Does my hon. Friend recognise that the fact that many partnerships which did not win regeneration funding in round one were successful in round two shows that the competitive process consistently improved the quality of bids? The fact that some partnerships that failed in the first two rounds succeeded in round three shows how effective that process was. Many Labour local leaders would say_certainly in private and increasingly in public_how useful that process was. Would my hon. Friend also agree that, when trying to obtain investment to aid a region, it would be hopeless to go to a Member of the European Parliament, as so many of them try to represent the same region that it would be impossible to find out who was supposed to be doing what?
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> My right hon. Friend has skilfully linked the deliberations of the Committee with his preoccupations with the BBC, relating to business that will come before the House later. He was right to draw attention to the beneficial consequences of competition. Enormous improvements took place in the quality of the bids made under a number of different schemes, and those improvements resulted directly from the competition process.
<P>
<B>Dr. Naysmith:</B> If it was right_which I do not necessarily concede_for dozens of local authorities to compete for the same pocket money, why is it wrong for regional organisations to do so Why will competition not work for regional organisations if it worked so well for local authorities?
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> We are talking about chalk and cheese here. The projects that local authorities competed for were extremely local and were designed in part to try to encourage local authorities, some of which had been less enthusiastic than others about partnerships between the private and public sectors. In this case, the functions of an existing national body are being removed and given to nine regional bodies, whose accountability is rather less than that of the local authorities to which the hon. Member for Bristol, North-West (Dr. Naysmith) referred. Instead of a national body which has been successful in attracting investment to help the regeneration process, we shall invite more competition. The inevitable consequence will be that taxpayers' money will be wasted in efforts that are unnecessarily duplicated. The Government's inability to produce their long promised concordat suggests that they are having trouble reconciling a number of different objectives.

<P>
I am not sure that the work of English Partnerships in finding sites will produce much in the way of a positive outcome when there is evidence of the Governments reluctance to approve schemes on sites that are clearly in the right place. One site is visible almost from the window of the Committee Room. A little further along the river on the other side of Vauxhall bridge is a site on which a development with a substantial housing component has been proposed. I have been told that it would meet one tenth of the whole housing needs of the London borough of Lambeth.
<P>
The Secretary of State, in the previous Government was minded to accept the proposal, but it has been turned down by the present Secretary of State, so a site that has been blighted for years because of planning difficulties will remain empty. It is in the centre of London; it is available for housing; a distinguished architect drew up the scheme; it is in a place where homes are needed and where jobs are available_but the Secretary of State has turned it down. English Partnerships might do some excellent work in finding sites, but if they fall foul of the sort of housing that the Secretary of State thinks his Back Benchers need to preserve Labour party support in a particular constituency the scheme will be blocked at source.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> During our previous debate on English Partnerships I said that EP and the Commission for New Towns would be brought together by the year 2000 and that I intend to appoint a new chairman of the CNT and EP later this year. I want to put on record the fact that I agree with what the hon. Member for South Suffolk said about the chairman of English Partnerships. Lord Walker has played an important role in setting up English Partnerships and we hope that we shall be able to continue that tradition in the regional development agencies.
<P>
We shall bring CNT and EP together and I shall ensure that the boards have at least some joint members. As we move towards the year 2000 I hope that they will merge and become one body.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon
(Mr. Curry) made a number of points, but he omitted to say that, on 31 March this year, nine urban development corporations will cease to operate and their liabilities and assets will be transferred to EP, CNT or local authorities. The position is uncertain at the moment and we are working through the considerable task of bringing those nine UDCs into various organisations. When that has been digested, we must move forward because we do not want to stop the momentum that has been gained in those projects and we want to help them to go forward. It was always the intention, as the hon. Gentleman knows, to wind up the UDCs.
<P>
One interesting point raised in consultation_I am not agreeing with it but merely sharing it with the Committee_was that we could run CNT and EP as a body owned by the regions. The nine members of the board of what is now CNT and EP would prevent conflict between national and regional objectives. That point was made in consultation by people who are deeply involved in these issues and who genuinely want the RDAs to work on what needs to be done in the regions. If one allows the mind to wander a little, one can see an arguable case for that.
<P>
Specific points were raised about EP. First, we want to maintain momentum on the millennium site. A White Paper on the government of London will come out during the next few weeks. The Government's position on the economic regeneration of London and the other parts of the city's government will then be made clear.
<P>
It is good news that the Conservative party is campaigning officially for a yes vote on the London assembly and mayor. The Leader of the Opposition's weekend U-turn is welcome. The Conservatives are coming round to our way of devolving powers and bringing back democracy and consultation. We are pleased about that, and hope that the hon. Member for South Suffolk will pass on our thanks to the Leader of the Opposition. The hon. Gentleman can tell his leader that the road to Damascus is open and that he can continue to tread it. We shall probably meet him at the end of it.

<P>
The Greenwich site will remain with EP. We believe that momentum needs to be maintained. In the longer term, our options remain open.
<P>
Secondly, the 56 coalfield sites need overall co-ordination, as hon. Members have accepted. I agree that the incoming Labour Government believed that they had a debt to the mining communities following the ravages that took place there. Many of those coalfield communities are in the middle of the green belt and it is difficult to develop them.
<P>
As the Opposition know, my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister unveiled the millennium village concept for the Greenwich peninsula last week. That is an exciting project which has brought together designers and engineers_{**[Interruption.] The right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon is mumbling in his seat, but he will appreciate that we should develop ideas by bringing together the best architects and the best conservation. Greenwich is a test bed of British ingenuity in creating an urban village.
<p4**}The right hon. Gentleman asked earlier how we could move 50,000 people to Merseyside. We should reflect on that question. Not so many years ago, Lord Tebbit told people to get on their bikes and come to the south-east. The problem of the get-on-your-bike syndrome now is that we are trying to ship them back to Merseyside. However, the Government have a progressive policy of taking back our cities and our towns so that people can live, work and play in them. <P>
We want to deal not only with the symptoms left by the previous Government but with the causes of problems. As my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister said yesterday, one cause of pressure on the green belt and on green-field sites is that 5,000 people a week are being driven out of the cities. They do not want to live in them because of poor education facilities, crime, the infrastructure and the environment. We are going to improve those problems, slowly but surely, in spite of Tory cynicism, and do what we believe the British people want.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Curry:</B> The hon. Gentleman is enjoying himself, but he is not talking much sense. The concept of development in areas such as Greenwich, through the millennium village and the Thames gateway, to provide accessible houses and to get rid of the traditional problems of an area that was downwind of London, originated with the previous Government. We have no quarrel with that concept because we promoted it. I hope that the Government will remain as committed to the Thames gateway as a strategic concept_to use one of the Minister's favourite adjectives_as we were. Much of its success will hinge on the decision on the channel tunnel rail link and its intermediate stations. The Minister must be aware of that.
<P>
It is all very well to talk about taking back the cities. The problem is that a large number of people want to migrate to the south-west or to counties around the M25. They are leaving places like Merseyside. Some migration may be caused because people are dissatisfied with schools and facilities, but some migration may be part of a sociological phenomenon. When people start to do slightly better in life or they feel more comfortable, they want to live somewhere else. It is part of social progress, which I assume that the Labour party favours.
<P>
Will the policy proceed by providing positive incentives for people to live in cities, or will it be linked with positive disincentives for people to meet their natural aspiration to live in, for example, Berkshire or Buckinghamshire? The Minister is in danger of having only half a policy. That is why I asked whether the policy would involve changing people's attitudes to the traditional liberty that allows them to settle where they want and to determine their own lives. Is there an element of determinism, or does the Minister intend to recapture the cities by providing incentives so that people make a voluntary choice to live there? If they do not make a voluntary choice, what happens to the policy?
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> That is wide of EP, and I disagree with the fundamental point on which the argument is predicated_that people's aspiration is always to move out of cities to the countryside.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> Not always.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> The argument is predicated on the fact that people want to move out of cities. I think that the opposite is true. When cities and town offer a reasonable environment, education facilities and physical infrastructure, and have a low level of crime, people in general will want to stay in them. According to the Council for the Protection of Rural England, 5,000 people a week are moving out. We want to reverse that trend. Analysis shows that they are leaving not because they want to move out but because the prevailing conditions in the cities and towns are forcing them out.
<P>
We were talking to journalists the other day in the Lobby. It was interesting. Two of them were deciding whether to leave London on the basis of one consideration, namely, their young children's education. Their commute here would greatly inconvenience them and they would probably not be able to use public transport to go home because of the hours that they work. They would prefer to stay in the city, but the lack of education facilities was taking them out. They could not afford to pay for private education and their partners were putting them under pressure to move.
<P>
Those considerations need to be addressed. [<i>Interruption.</i>] Conservatives can laugh. They usually have plenty of money to send their kids to private schools. My right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister has set out a raft of policies to address those issues. We expect to remove the pressure on green-field sites.

<p>Some hon. Members mentioned the channel tunnel rail link. I accept that it is important not only to London, the east and the Thames gateway. I assure the Committee that we fully support the Thames gateway concept, and are trying to liberate much of the under-utilisation of the eastern part of London. Hon. Members come to the Committee and talk about the channel tunnel rail link. If ever there was a mishandling of a contract, the previous Administration must put up their hands and say  guilty<P>
. What has happened is disgraceful. To come back and ask for a further £1.2 billion_
<P>
<B>Mr. Stephen Day </B>(Cheadle): What has that got to do with it?
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> I was asked about CTRL; I am merely answering the question. Brown-field sites, in which EP is involved_I see you moving in your seat, Mr. Benton. Perhaps I should quickly return to EP and the brown-field sites initiative. I am sure that the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon would agree that the channel tunnel rail link is not only about the east of London; it is very much about the north of England and the need for access to Europe.
<P>
I should like briefly to discuss Lord Roger's role. EP will be involved in the committee that has been set up; Lord Rogers has agreed to be the chairman. We shall examine how to bring back into play brown-field sites_
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> That will cost you a bob or two.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> It will not cost us a bob or two; it will cost the nation. If we want to ensure that the pressure is taken off green-field and green belt sites, such questions must be addressed. It does no good to run away from them. We have run away from them for the past 18 years. This Government will confront them honestly. As it progresses, EP will be one of the organisations that we shall use to do so.
<P>
The concordat is one of many issues that have been left on the Government's desk in a state of total confusion as a result of the past 18 years' administration by the previous Conservative Government. We shall eventually examine it, reintroduce value for money and ensure that it works much more effectively and efficiently in terms of inward investment than it did when the previous Administration had responsibility.
<P>
I have dealt with coalfield communities, a matter that is very important to us. Through the committees that have been set up by my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister, in which EP is deeply involved, I hope that we shall produce resolutions that will be presented over the next five, 10 or 15 years.

<P>Brought up, and read the First time.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Ballard:</B> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take new clause 3_{**Addition to Race Relations Act 1976_
<ul><font size=-1>`._In section 71 (local authority general statutory duty) of the Race Relations Act 1976, there shall be added_</ul></font>
<P>
<ul><UL><FONT SIZE=-1>" A regional development agency established under the Regional Development Agencies Act 1998 shall be a local authority for the purposes of this section.".'.<P>
</UL></ul></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Ballard:</B> I have carefully examined the Bill, especially clause 4, which deals with RDAs' purposes.
I can find nothing about equal opportunities. However, I_and, I am sure, the Government_believe that equality should be mainstream, to use the new jargon, from the start of RDAs' operation. TECs and SRB-funded projects, for example, have ethnic monitoring requirements, and TECs also have to incorporate performance reviews and target-setting about equal opportunities in contracts.
<P>
The new clause would require an RDA to have regard to equality of opportunity in its business and in carrying out its functions. It would be required to report annually on the arrangements that it made to promote equality of opportunity and on their effectiveness. The wording of the new clause derives from almost identically worded provisions in the Government of Wales Bill.
<P>
With regard to new clause 3, all local authorities have the statutory duty to ensure that their functions are carried out with due regard to the need to eliminate racial discrimination and to promote equality of opportunity and good relations between persons of different racial groups. The new clause would give the same duty to RDAs.
<P>
I am sure that the Minister will be sympathetic in principle to the new clauses and to the aims that lie behind them. I am anxious to learn his views.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> I welcome the new clauses and the opportunity to put the Government's position on the record.

<P>
New clauses 1 and 3 would require the RDAs to promote the principle of equality of opportunity for all people. Specifically, new clause 1 would require RDAs to make arrangements to ensure that their business was conducted and functions exercised with regard to the principle of equal opportunity. They would also be required to include in their annual report an assessment of how effective those arrangements had been. Similarly, new clause 3 would require RDAs to make arrangements to ensure that their functions were carried out with due regard to the need to eliminate unlawful racial discrimination and to promote equal opportunities and good relations between different racial groups.
<P>
I fully sympathise with what the hon. Lady is seeking to achieve in the new clauses. It is important to ensure that the RDAs promote equality of opportunity in the conduct of their business and when exercising their functions. However, I do not accept that it is necessary to add those provisions to the Bill in order to do that.
<P>
The Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions, my hon. Friend the Member for Wallasey (Angela Eagle) and I have said on many occasions that the Bill provides a framework for the creation of the RDAs. It is important to bear in mind the fact that a key objective of the Government's policy for the regions is the decentralisation of decision-making. In many respect, it will be for the RDAs to consider how they will organise themselves within their region and how they should deliver their remit to the Government.
<P>
We have a real commitment to equal opportunities for all and we want to see that reflected in the work of the RDAs. it is likely that that is one of the issues that RDAs will want to cover tin their regional strategies. We expect the RDAs to promote equal opportunities and to see that as an important element of their work in enhancing economic activity and regeneration in the regions. If they fail to do that, the Bill allows us to issue guidance or directions on the matter.
<P>
The hon. Lady may know that I have been contacted by the Commission for Racial Equality, and that my officials have offered to have a meeting with it to discuss how to make progress. As I said, if RDAs do not act appropriately, we will be able to issue a direction.
<P>
RDAs will have a broad remit and they will need to take account of all regional interests in taking that forward. They will take an integrated approach, bringing together economic, social and environmental goals, and they will work in partnership with many groups and organisations. One of the keys to success in that regard will be the membership of the RDA board. The Government are committed to ensuring that as wide a range of people as possible apply for membership. We are particularly keen for nominations from ethnic minorities and women, who are currently woefully under-represented on such boards.
<P>
We also want to ensure that the principle of equality of opportunity is reflected in the way in which RDAs conduct their business. RDAs will be non-departmental public bodies accountable to Parliament through Ministers and subject to the normal arrangements governing the conduct of NDPBs. For example, they will be expected to have in place conditions of service covering equal opportunities. Such conditions are often based on the civil service management code and the sponsoring Department's staff handbook which gives a strong lead on equal opportunities. NDPBs' annual reports generally include material on equal opportunity matters. The Bill empowers us to ensure that that is the case for RDAs by issuing guidance or directions.
<P>
Finally, it has been argued that RDAs, like local authorities, should be subject to section 71 of the Race Relations Act 1976. That would be the effect of new clause 3, but we do not accept that approach. Local authorities are independent, democratically elected bodies which operate within the framework of local government legislation and are responsible to their electorate for the way in which they carry out their duties. RDAs, on the other hand, are NDPBs responsible through Ministers to Parliament. The accountability arrangements set out in the Bill provide a framework for Ministers to influence the way in which RDAs carry out their functions using guidance or directions as appropriate. Thus we can ensure that RDAs comply with the spirit of section 71 of the 1976 Act. It is not necessary to make specific provision in the Bill.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
I hope that the hon. Member accepts my assurance that the Government is committed to the principle of equality and opportunity for all, and will withdraw the new clause.

<P>

<B>Mrs. Ballard:</B> I could have predicted the Minister's speech. I was sure that he would say that he has full sympathy with the principle of the new clauses and that he would finish by saying that it was not necessary to put them in the Bill.
<P>
He said that local authorities are independent. They are not independent; they are creatures of statute and can do only what they are specifically permitted to do by central Government. If the Minister was flagging the Government's future intention to give local authorities the power of general competence, we would greatly welcome that.
<P>
<B>Dr. Naysmith:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Ballard:</B> I am sure that other Labour Members agree. The only way to give local authorities genuine independence is to allow them to set and control their own resources.
<P>
The Committee has debated a number of times what matters should be in the Bill and what matters the RDAs should decide. That goes to the heart of the issues surrounding devolution. Before I came to the House, one of my jobs was to advise local councils on devolving decision-making. I always thought it was important for them to be quite clear about which issues were so fundamental to central Government thinking and ways of working that they should remain at the centre, and which issues could be decided by devolved authorities. I would have thought that equal opportunities and openness in decision-making were the two most fundamental matters which central Government would wish to see carried out by any devolved authority such as RDA boards. That is the core of my disagreement with the Minister. However, I note his comment that he expects RDAs to promote equal opportunities and that if they do not do so, guidance will be issued to that effect. With that assurance, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.
<P>
Motion and clause, by leave withdrawn.
<H4><center>New clause 4</center></H4>
<center>Transfer of property, rights and liabilities to agencies</center>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> "_Within six months of the designation of a regional chamber, within the area of a regional development agency, under section 8, the Secretary of State shall by directions require the transfer of responsibility for Training and Enterprise Councils in the region from the Department of Education and Employment to the development agency."
-[Mr. Breed.]</ul></font>
<P>
Brought up, and read the First time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Colin Breed </B>(South-East Cornwall): I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<P>
The new clause would ensure that control of training and enterprise councils was given to RDAs within six months of democratic accountability being achieved through the institution of a regional chamber. We are promoting the principle of passing control of TECs to RDAs.
Scottish Enterprise has already said that it was singularly beneficial for it to have control of training. Other aspects of the role carried out by TECs during the past few years chime with the future role of RDAs. Indeed, other organisations, such as the British Chambers of Commerce, have expressed concern that control of TECs has not been given to RDAs. That organisation was concerned that, without sufficient power, it would be difficult to recruit the best people to RDA boards. It wanted to ensure that RDAs had the right powers and resources to enable them to make a real difference to regeneration in the regions.
<P>
Eric Dancer of the west country development corporation, whom I know well, wanted business links to be transferred from TECs to RDAs, and for TECs to be subsumed by RDAs at a later date. Mr. Dancer was the first chairman of the Devon and Cornwall Training and Enterprise Council and has wide experience of TECs. That is an evolutionary approach, of which I am sure the Minister would approve.
<P>
I understand that the Scottish Development Agency was not given control of training straight away, although that did ultimately happen and has proved to be a great success. We should like to know that the Government's thinking is and what must be in place before responsibility for TECs can pass to RDAs. What is the evolutionary process? How can RDA boards prove that they deserve to have that control and need the resources that are currently directed to TECs? Will there be any review of the way in which RDAs operate, perhaps after a year, as was suggested in Select Committee evidence?
<P>
It has been suggested that the Secretary of State for Education and Employment will have to decide whether to hand over responsibility for TECs to RDAs. How will the Minister encourage him to let go of those powers so that RDAs can receive the real resources they need?

<P>
The Select Committee also asked what would happen if RDAs produced a regional strategy that was at variance with the regional strategy developed by TECs. It is obviously important that strategies at least complement each other, but if they are at variance, some overriding force would need to ensure that the objectives were not disparate, but worked together for the good of the region.
<P>
It seems entirely logical that TECs should ultimately be subsumed into RDAs. We recognise that that is not the initial intention, but believe that the principle should be adopted at some stage. The new clause would at least give some framework to that principle, and I shall be interested to hear the Minister's views on the current and future relationships between TECs and RDAs when they are introduced in a year or so.
<P>
<B>Ms Rosie Winterton </B>(Doncaster, Central): Yesterday, the regional assembly for Yorkshire and Humberside put the final touches to its plan to establish a regional chamber. It was a historic event, which I was delighted to attend, and which was attended by representatives from all parties_Labour, Liberal Democrat, Conservative and Independent_who are all so enthusiastic about the establishment of the chamber and RDAs that they want to ensure that Yorkshire and Humberside has the first regional chamber. They believe that the proposals offer many opportunities. Councillor Brian Walker, who chairs the regional assembly, said that they believe_
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am afraid that the hon. Lady is not being very relevant. Could she please keep to new clause 4?
<P>
<B>Ms Winterton:</B> Yes, Mr. Benton. There is much enthusiasm for establishment of a regional chamber.
I hope that the Minister will ensure us that that will be taken into account if there are further moves towards TECs falling under the control of the chambers of the RDAs.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> My hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster, Central (Ms Winterton) is right that the bringing together of all three political parties was historic. the Conservatives led the charge for regional devolution, and I note that the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon is not raising his eyes at that point. He will acknowledge that his colleagues out in the sticks were fighting the good fight on behalf of the Conservative party in the great regional coalition between the Conservative and Labour parties and the Liberal Democrats. As I have said before, I met a lone Conservative in Manchester and said that he was unfortunate. However, he replied,  I am a new Conservative while the old Conservatives are still the Opposition at Westminster.<P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Day:</B> We have heard this one before.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> The old ones are the best so I keep recycling them. The Committee has not much longer to go, so the hon. Gentleman will not be hearing that one any more. It has hurt Opposition Members that there is a new Conservative party out there in the real world, as we saw in Yorkshire yesterday when the Conservatives joined Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
<P>
The new clause would compel the Secretary of State to transfer responsibility for TECs in a region to the RDAs and to do so within six months of the regional chambers being designated. That would not be sensible or, in the Government's view, desirable. I do not know whether six months is an arbitrary figure; perhaps the Liberals threw a dart into a board and came up with that.
<P>
I was interested by what the hon. Member for South-East Cornwall said about Scotland. Let me remind him that the Labour Government put the Scottish Development Agency_now Scottish Enterprise_on the statute book in 1975. Only since the early 1990s has trading through the local enterprise companies come under Scottish Enterprise. It has been argued that training while part of the overall economic situation in Scotland_
has been dealt with separately. People such as my good friend Bruce Millan, who was a Member of Parliament and who was an EC Commissioner, take the view that there is an argument for a skills agency beyond the main development agency, as happened in Scotland.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Ballard:</B> Last week in Brussels I spoke to the heads of a number of government offices who were concerned that training would be separated from RDAs. [{**ep<cf5**}Hon. Members:  Swanning around.<P>
] Going to Brussels to talk about regional development in the south-west is not swanning around. It is an important role. Those officers were anxious that training should be linked closely with economic regeneration and felt that separation was one flaw in a Bill that they otherwise supported. I understand from press reports over the weekend that that the Government may have it in mind to subsume TECs in RDAs.

<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> We will be linking TECs to RDAs, but the hon. Lady raises the question whether they will come under the control of the RDAs. There are different views on that. I read an article about Scottish Enterprise_I cannot remember which publication it was in_by an educationalist who believed that the skills focused on by Scottish Enterprise had been downgraded since it had ceased to be outside the Scottish Development Agency. When it was outside it was a bigger priority, and worked in further and higher education as well as in the tertiary sector. In the case of Scotland, the jury is still out on this question.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
It is not clear why the responsibility for TECs should be transferred when a regional chamber is designated. That assumes some kind of link between the existence of a regional chamber and the functions of the RDA. The responsibility for TECs, however, is a function of the DFEE_Ministers would decide whether or not to delegate responsibility to RDAs. We do not consider it appropriate to do so, for the time being at least. We believe that we are giving the RDAs the right package of functions; it provides the right critical mass.
<P>
It is important to be realistic about the package of functions to be given to the RDAs. They will be new bodies and will have much to do to establish themselves and to develop their work programmes. As their experience develops, scope will exist to extend their role, and further functions will be delegated to them if that is desirable. The Government consider the package of functions to be given to RDAs at the outset to strike the right balance and to provide the right critical mass. If the Committee reflects on the past 20 years_or as far back as 1975_and considers the activities of the SDA and WDA at that time, it will find that they have similar powers.
<P>
The functions of the RDAs will afford them considerable influence at the regional level. Their influence will not be limited to areas and organisations for which the RDAs are directly responsible, or for which they control the budgets.
<P>
As we have made clear on a number of occasions, education, skills and employability are critical to economic performance and will be central to the regional strategies of RDAs. RDAs will have a crucial role in developing and planning a regional skills strategy in co-operation with all the partners_including business, industry, trade unions, TECs local authorities and further and higher education.
<P>
The way in which the responsibilities for all of these functions have been divided is entirely in keeping with the RDA's role as a provider of a strategic overview and its focus on bringing together the work and views of regional partners.
<P>
We also want RDAs to play a big part in monitoring and improving the performance of TECs. The Government want to drive the performance of all TECs up to the standard of the best. The details of the role of RDAs in this respect are still to be worked out, but we expect them to take a hard look at the performance of TECs in their region and to recommend how they might make a greater contribution to regional objectives.
<P>
The package of functions to be given to RDAs is challenging but realistic. RDAs will develop a strategic approach to meeting the skill needs of their areas and will monitor the performance of TECs to ensure that they contribute fully to regional economic objectives. In managing TEC contracts, government offices will take account of the strategic framework developed by RDAs. Scope will exist to add to the remit of RDAs as their experience grows.
<P>
One effect of the new clause is that certain RDAs might take on responsibility for TECs before others; indeed, some might not inherit the responsibility at all. Although the English regions are all different and have different needs, there must be a limit to the amount of regional
variation in the system. Otherwise, we could be faced with an administrative mess. In the case of TECs, and the need for the DFEE to oversee different arrangements in different parts of the country, excessive regional variation would be likely to add to bureaucracy and therefore to costs.
<p4>he hon. Member for South-East Cornwall raised the issue of Business Links. The position of Business Links will be similar to that of TECs, and the vast majority of funding for Business Links comes from TECs anyway. The RDAs will play a role in developing local business support services by providing a strategic context for the work of Business Links. Government offices will take account of the regional strategies of RDAs when contracted with Business Links. With those assurances about how we hope that the RDAs will evolve, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the new clause.

<b>Mr. Breed:</b> I thank the Minister for his response. I was somewhat puzzled by the RDAs' proposed remit to drive up the standards of the TECs. I am not quite certain how the Bill provides for that and do not know what the TECs will have to say.
<P>
The six-month period mentioned in the new clause is arbitrary. We sought to set a reasonable period after the regional chambers are democratically accountable. The six months could as well be 12 months, but there should be a clear period.
<P>
I will not press the new clause to a vote. It is important that the relationship of the TECs with the RDAs in both the short and medium term be clarified_I may return to the point at a later stage. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.
<P>
Motion and clause, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> May I, on behalf of Dr. Michael Clark, place on the record his great pleasure at chairing the Committee? He enjoyed its courtesy and good-natured attitude. He also enjoyed getting to know some new Members. I gladly associate myself with his sentiments and would like to thank Ministers, Opposition Members and all Members for their courtesy, co-operation and, at times, understanding. I hope that it will not be too long before we are all together again. I should also offer a word of thanks to the Clerk.
<P>
The question is, That I do report the Bill, as amended, to the House.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> On behalf of all the Committee, I want to thank you, Mr. Benton, and Dr. Clark for the efficient way in which you each conducted the Committee. On occasion, we have strayed from the subject of a clause or an amendment and you have courteously guided us back to the straight and narrow.
<P>
I should also thank the staff of the {**Official Report who have a difficult job, particularly when I go off my script. Sometimes I do not know quite how they follow my logic, but they make some sense of it so that even the Opposition can sometimes take me to task.
<p4**}I thank, too, my civil servants, in spite of the criticism by the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon of the explanatory notes; we have told him that the same was true when he was in office. The same notes caused problems in his day. My staff have conducted themselves in a way that shows their professionalism. Many of us are extremely proud of our civil service. <P>
I also thank my colleagues, many of whom are new to Standing Committees. In their usual robust way, they have put their case forcefully, and have sometimes rocked the hon. Member for South Suffolk with killer punches.
<P>
I was about to thank the journalists, but I do not think that any of them have been here, so I shall not bother. I am grateful to the Opposition for the press reports that they issued.
<P>
As for the Opposition_their performance was patchy. The vast majority of Conservative Members were great_
it is just the odd one or two who were a problem!
<P>
The Bill has been scrutinised properly, which is the Opposition's job. I sat for many years on the Opposition side, and I know that their job is not easy. When I was in opposition I said that the lack of staff and the way that our democracy is funded cause problems. The Opposition have a major role to play in the democratic process. I have served in government and in opposition, and I can compare the two. The under-resourcing of the Opposition should be reconsidered. I have had disagreements with the hon. Member for South Suffolk, but it is hard for the Opposition_they have to do their own research, draft their own amendments and produce arguments for them. Those of us who are interested in the democratic process should consider that matter_I hope to do so, but only when I have stopped being a Minister, when the demands on me will not be so great.

<P>
I thank the Opposition for scrutinising the Bill, which is an important piece of legislation. It is part of our devolution package, and we want to get it right. It is right for the Opposition to give the Bill proper and objective scrutiny_that keeps us on our toes and it forces us to answer questions. I invite them, and you, Mr. Benton, to the bar, where I want to buy you all a drink in about
10  minutes' time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> On behalf of the Opposition I add our thanks to you, Mr. Benton, for your courteous and skilful chairmanship of the Committee. I know that once or twice in our enthusiasm to develop an argument we may have strayed marginally beyond the subject before us, but we were promptly recalled to order by your wise and courteous interjections. I hope that you will also convey our thanks to your co-Chairman, Dr. Clark.
<P>
I must also thank the Clerk of the Committee_I have discovered that in opposition I have tended to work more closely with the Clerk than I did when I was in government. I am grateful to the Clerk for his help in drafting several amendments.
<P>
I thank my hon. Friends for their energetic, vigorous and extremely effective scrutiny of the Bill_we have also been aided by the periodic appearance of the Liberal Democrats. As I said before, I am happy to move their amendments while they are away on some taxpayer-funded jaunt to visit a European institution.
<P>
The Minister has done something that I never had to do when I was a Minister_he had to withdraw four key clauses, but he retained his good humour, at least for most of our proceedings. I am delighted about that. I am sure that we shall debate these matters again on Report.
<P>
I have enjoyed getting to know some of the Government Back Benchers_my only regret is that I did not get to know them rather better. I am sure that had they wished to take part more wholeheartedly, my hon. Friend the Member for Cheadle would have been happy to negotiate an extension of our proceedings for several weeks. I hope that they will play a greater role when they next appear on a Standing Committee. I assure them, as Back Benchers, that in a Parliament in which the Government have a large majority, the one person to whom one should pay absolutely no attention is the Government Whip.
<P>
If we had completed all our business as efficiently as we have done this morning, our debate would have been concluded some weeks ago. We have had a productive and pleasant debate, and I am most grateful to you,
Mr. Benton.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
