<a name="10020443000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before we
begin our deliberations, I wish to draw the attention of hon. Members
to the fact that, as Chairman, I have a duty to ensure that as much
progress as possible has been made in our consideration of the Bill by
the time we conclude our business at 5 pm today. I therefore 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column430" />Column number: 430</div>urge members of the Committee to be succinct, and I shall be listening
carefully to ensure that all contributions are relevant to the
amendments under
consideration.</div><a name="10020443000034"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10020443000240"></a><b class="B">Annette
Brooke</b> (Mid-Dorset and North Poole) (LD): I belatedly
welcome you to the Chair, Mrs. Anderson. We had an
interesting debate up to 10 o&#146;clock on Tuesday, in which we
heard many weasel words but, in reality, nothing has changed for the
Conservatives. In supporting compulsory personal, social, health and
economic education, I wish to make the point that all the major
children&#146;s organisations support the provision, including the
National Children&#146;s Bureau. The National Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Children also supports it, as does UNICEF,
which has provided briefings for me in the past. We should operate from
such a background. There has been a strong call for the move for a long
time; it is
critical.</div><a name="10020443000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause allows us to deal with the opt-outs. I have tabled four
amendments, two of which propose the age of 14 instead of 15. They are
probing amendments to find out why the Minister favours the age of 15.
There are strong arguments for making sure that all children have
education about sex and relationships earlier than at the age of 15. My
personal view is that there should not be opt-outs. I accept that the
Government agree, but I am interested in why they favour the age of
15.</div><a name="10020443000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
other amendments relate to my concern that  the age of 15 is
late for many pupils. I suggest in amendment 163 that the curriculum
for children and young people should still have a relationships part.
That is important. It should cover not only sexual relationships but
getting on with one another, not bullying and confidence and
self-esteem. Important education centres on the whole issue of
relationships.</div><a name="10020443000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
the opt-out remains, amendment 164 suggests that it should apply only
if the parent has met the head teacher of the school or the relevant
teacher to discuss their concerns and to establish the nature of what
is to be taught. There are many misconceptions&#151;sorry about
that&#151;about what sex and relationships education involves. I have
received a letter from a parent begging me not to take the innocence
away from their child. If I thought that such education was taking
innocence away from children, would I support it?
No.</div><a name="10020443000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham challenged me on the subject
of children being allowed to opt out. He needs to take on board the
views of the very organisations that always ask us to put forward the
rights, wishes and feelings of children. They are 100 per cent. behind
this approach, particularly the Children&#146;s Rights Alliance,
which does not support an opt-out. It sees matters in terms of the
rights of the child and says that
the</div><a name="10020443000195"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;state
has the duty to ensure children and young people receive a good, broad
and balanced
education&#148;&#151;</div><a name="10020443000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">we
have discussed that
before&#151;</div><a name="10020443000196"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;which
develops their personality, talents and physical and mental ability.
SRE education is part of this
duty.&#148;</div><a name="10020443000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
does not see sex and relationships education as any different from
history, citizenship or science. No one would want to suggest that a
child should have the right to withdraw from history or science; that
would not fit in with the vision of the curriculum objectives.
Currently, parents can withdraw their children from sex education, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column431" />Column number: 431</div>but not from the parts of the science curriculum that teach the
biological aspects of human growth and reproduction. What nonsense. To
teach children about the mechanics in the abstract and without
providing the important relationships education that goes with it would
be a disaster. People who argue against this are living in the past.
There is no modernisation at
all.</div><a name="10020443000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is clear that children and young people want to receive high-quality
sex and relationships education. We have already mentioned the United
Kingdom Youth Parliament. The state has a duty to educate children on
health. The UN Committee on the Rights of the Child, which monitors
Government implementation of children&#146;s rights, including the
right to express their views, is clear that all children and young
people should receive good-quality, age-appropriate health education,
which includes sex and relationships education. That is
important.</div><a name="10020443000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
the England submission to the Committee  on the Rights of the
Child in 2008, more than  100 non-governmental
organisations endorsed a report recommending that the Government remove
parents&#146; right to withdraw children from sex and relationships
education in school. The case for compulsory PSHE is well
made.</div>
<a name="10020443000043"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10020443000241"></a><b class="B">Tim
Loughton</b> (East Worthing and Shoreham) (Con): The hon. Lady
started by saying that one of her amendments was a probing amendment to
find out the Government&#146;s justification for 15. Her amendment
reduces the age to 14. She has said nothing to justify why 14 rather
than 13, 12 or whatever age. Will she address the reason for her
amendment?</div>
<a name="10020443000044"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020443000242"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman for his intervention.
It is pretty obvious that I am simply asking the question, &#147;Why
15?&#148; The easiest way to probe that was to table an amendment. I
am sure that the Minister understands the reasoning behind it.
&#147;Why not 12?&#148; is a perfectly reasonable question. There
should not be an opt-out at all. I want to hear from the Minister why
15. Organisations consider this to be so important that they reached a
consensus around the age of 15. I am not sure that that is right, but I
know that we must get this on the curriculum. We must have high quality
PSHE and sex and relationships education, in
particular.</div><a name="10020443000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">With
those words, Mrs. Anderson, and bearing in mind what you
said earlier, I beg to move the amendments tabled in my name and that
of my hon. Friend the Member for Yeovil.</div>
<a name="10020443000046"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10020443000243"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Ken Purchase</b> (Wolverhampton, North-East) (Lab/Co-op): The
question is, &#147;What message are we sending out?&#148; It is
perfectly clear that there is overwhelming support in the country for
properly structured, well-delivered, high quality sex and relationships
education. When a poll is taken on such matters, more than 80 per cent.
of people approve. They wish it to remain compulsory and on the
curriculum for all children. I move that section 405 from the Education
Act 1996 is removed, which would render the new
clause&#151;&#147;Exemption from sex and relationships
education&#148;&#151;redundant.</div>
<a name="10020443000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand
the arguments with regard to &#147;Why 16 or 15?&#148; &#147;Why
35?&#148;, as I mentioned the other day. There is no logic in any of
the answers. The other day, we had an exchange about the works of
Piaget, the child psychologist. He identified differences between the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column432" />Column number: 432</div>maturation rates of boys and girls and between each boy and girl. We
know that girls in particular are entering puberty at an earlier age.
Many girls need help and often that is not
forthcoming.</div><a name="10020443000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
argument here is not about the quality of sex education or whether it
should be taught&#151;we all agree on those things&#151;but about
the messages we are sending out. I share the view of my hon. Friend the
Minister for Europe
that:</div><a name="10020443000197"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Britain
has the highest rate of teenage pregnancy in Western Europe and the
second highest, after the USA, in the world. Depressingly, the map of
teenage pregnancy is the map of British
deprivation.&#148;</div><a name="10020443000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have no argument with people who decide that the way in which a school
delivers sex education does not suit them and so take their children
elsewhere. However, in Wolverhampton and another 300 or 400
constituencies, that choice does not
exist.</div><a name="10020443000050"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020443000244"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> Although there are close links between
deprivation and teenage pregnancy levels, it is not exclusively so.
Last year or the year before, the highest increase in teenage pregnancy
levels was in the royal borough of Windsor and Maidenhead&#151;hardly
a ghetto of
poverty.</div><a name="10020443000051"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020443000245"></a>Mr.
Purchase:</b> I accept the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point. Of
course the levels can be quite random. However, when mapped across
Britain, the picture is as the Minister for Europe described it last
year.</div><a name="10020443000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
message is all important. As far as we know, only a small number of
children are withdrawn from sex education; about 40 children in every
10,000. That is almost too small to measure. Why do we make this fuss?
Is it really about parental choice, or is it about parental prejudice?
When the matter was challenged in the European Court, there was an
unequivocal ruling that it was an infringement of a child&#146;s
rights to take them out of sex education
lessons.</div><a name="10020443000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
me make it clear that I think it is the right of the child to withdraw
from Christian prayers or those of other religions, but not to withdraw
from religious education. I do not believe a parent should be able to
withdraw a child from religious education. Without a good knowledge of
the King James Bible, the whole world of English literature is probably
closed off for many children. Education must be seen in a broad sense.
There must be consensus about what should be in the curriculum. Sex
education is
included.</div><a name="10020443000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are talking about a tiny minority of people who insist that this matter
is very personal to them and that in the broad sweep of education, they
must be an exception and be able to deny their children the right and
opportunity to have good-quality sex education. I agree with the hon.
Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole that quality is at the heart of
this
issue.</div><a name="10020443000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
believe that there is no age at which withdrawal from SRE can be
justified. As Opposition Members said, why is it 15? Why should it not
be 16, 19, 12 or 14? We do not include this equivocation in any other
subject in the curriculum. Children in my constituency learn their sex
in the playground, in dirty books and from TV. The other night in
&#147;EastEnders&#148;, two younger people were clearly having sex
in a cabin. It was aired just after 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column433" />Column number: 433</div>8 o&#146;clock. These people were virtually stripped off. In my
opinion, the 9 o&#146;clock watershed is sensible and should
apply.</div><a name="10020443000214"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.15
am</div><a name="10020443000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">Children
are so far down the road of knowledge that it is vital that they get
advice from expert teachers in the calm atmosphere of a classroom. The
TUC argues that health workers should be involved so that they can
support teachers who do not have the wide experience that is necessary
to deliver the subject in a top-quality way. I argue that clause 14 is
redundant and out of date, that it sends the wrong message, is an
infringement of children&#146;s rights and a sop to prejudice that we
should not be considering in
2010.</div><a name="10020443000057"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10020443000246"></a><b class="B">Mrs.
Ann Cryer</b> (Keighley) (Lab): I assure you, Mrs.
Anderson, that I will be as brief as I can. I agree with much of what
has been said, and there is no point in repeating it because we want to
finish this
matter.</div><a name="10020443000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">Over
the weekend, I was fortunate enough to address two meetings. One was a
group of Asian women between the ages of 30 and 40 who were discussing
problems with divorce, and the other was a group of people who were
concerned with health matters. I took the advantage of the two
gatherings to ask for people&#146;s opinion on this clause. The view,
by and large, was that those parents who wish to withdraw their
children from sex and relationship lessons are very likely to be the
same parents who will not broach the subject themselves at home.
Therefore, their children will be completely deprived and very
vulnerable. The other view was that 16 is  far too old, and
most thought that the age should  be brought down to 12 or 13,
but I will not go down  that
path.</div><a name="10020443000059"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020443000247"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Children, Schools and
Families (Ms Diana R. Johnson):</b> Welcome back to the Chair,
Mrs. Anderson. This group of amendments deals with a
parental right of withdrawal from SRE. Amendments 63, 64 and 65 put
forward the argument that pupils should be excused until they attain
the age of 16. Amendments 162 and 112 propose that there should be a
right to withdraw up to the age of 14. Amendment 163 would substitute
references to sex and relationship education with references to sex
education only. Amendment 164 would qualify the parental right to
withdraw their child from sex and relationship lessons by making it a
requirement on parents to talk to the school about any of their
concerns. Amendment 195 would give a child over the age of 15 the right
to withdraw from SRE, and new clause 7 would remove  a parental
right completely to withdraw their child  from SRE.</div>
<a name="10020443000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">Late on
Tuesday evening, I was very interested to hear the hon. Member for East
Worthing and Shoreham. His comments on the high rates of chlamydia and
teenage pregnancy, and his acceptance of the need for good-quality PSHE
and sex and relationship education were very welcome. I am sure that
all parts of the Committee are in agreement on that today. Moreover, in
an article in <i class="I">The Daily Telegraph, </i>the right hon. Member for
Witney (Mr. Cameron) said that we needed good sex and
relationship education, so that is all very 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column434" />Column number: 434</div>positive. I was astonished, therefore, when the hon. Member for East
Worthing and Shoreham confirmed late on Tuesday evening that
Conservative policy was to retain the right of parental withdrawal for
any pupil in compulsory education, and those in further education up to
the age of 19, from SRE. That approach seems most illogical when we all
know that the age of consent is 16. It means that 16, 17 and
18-year-olds, who can quite legally be having sex, can be withdrawn
from any sex and relationship education. That is an untenable position,
and it also prompts a question about the modern face of the
Conservative party, because it is failing to look at the realities of
life and listen to what key stakeholders, parents, young people, faith
groups and the third sector are saying to us about this particular
issue. It is not defensible to continue to allow parents to determine
whether or not their children receive SRE potentially up to the age of
19 when the age of consent is
16.</div><a name="10020443000061"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10020443000248"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Nick Gibb</b> (Bognor Regis and Littlehampton) (Con): Will the
hon. Lady tell the Committee what responsibilities parents have to
enforce the duty to participate in education or training until the age
of
18?</div><a name="10020443000062"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020443000249"></a>Ms
Johnson:</b> Just on the point of parents&#146; involvement,
what we would say and what has been said by all members of the
Committee, is that we are absolutely clear that parents have a positive
role to play with their children and young people not only in sex and
relationship education, but generally in the whole of area of PSHE, and
that they should make sure that the values relating to the importance
of education are instilled in young people. We want children and young
people to reach their full potential in education, so parents
absolutely have that role to
play.</div><a name="10020443000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will come on to talk about why the Government initially took the view
that we should accept Sir Alasdair Macdonald&#146;s recommendations
in full. I know that, on Tuesday night, the hon. Gentleman wanted a
response to that particular issue. The reason why we have changed our
position is that we started to have in-depth discussions with experts
and interested parties, including representatives of faith groups. We
looked at research findings from samples of parents and adults who were
concerned about that issue, and we concluded that it was right to say
that there should be a right of withdrawal from sex and relationship
education, but only to the age of 15.</div>
<a name="10020443000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">We believe
that is right because it is balanced, deliverable and legally
enforceable, and it maintains the right of that small number of parents
who wish to exercise the right of withdrawal. We also believe that
setting the age limit at 15 offers the best chance of building a strong
consensus on the subject. We have consulted with  Sir Alasdair
on that decision and he has supported  it as a way forward. The
trend in English law over the past 20 to 30 years has been to afford
young people the right to make decisions for themselves, when they have
the maturity to understand the implications of those decisions. That
sits very well with international law and the development of human
rights law.</div>
<a name="10020443000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">The measure
would bring together and balance the range of perspectives on an
important and sensitive issue. The age of 15 is an age that key
stakeholders&#151;parents, professionals, young people and most faith
groups&#151;accept as a sensible compromise. That means that every
young 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column435" />Column number: 435</div>person will receive a minimum of one year&#146;s sex and relationship
education before they reach the age of 16. Also, those parents who wish
to withdraw their children from sex and relationships education will be
able to see that their child is withdrawn throughout primary school and
well into their child&#146;s teenage
years.</div><a name="10020443000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
think that most 15-year-old children have already been introduced to
the issues around sex and relationships through their friends and the
media. My hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, North-East talked a
few moments ago about what was on the TV this week. Young people at 15
are well aware of such issues, so it is vital that all children have
access to this education for that final year in
school.</div><a name="10020443000067"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020443000250"></a>Mr.
Purchase:</b> This 15 business defies logic. Although my hon.
Friend wants to argue that it is a matter of balance and we can agree
it, we are agreeing with people who are way off the pace with these
matters. I used the illustration of the TV soap for the effect of
pointing out what was on TV at 8 o&#146;clock in the evening. The
truth is that the points she makes about a playground education, the TV
and so on are the very reason why compromise on the matter is foolish,
childish and not grown-up politics. Such an approach completely fails
to recognise the realities of today. I cannot go into that now because
I know the Chairman wants to move on, but the fact is trying to decide
between 12, 15 and 19 is a ludicrous position. There is no logic, sense
or reality to that. We get to a point in our lives when we ought to
recognise for once that it is time to stop the hypocrisy and get on
with a proper
job.</div><a name="10020443000068"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020443000251"></a>Ms
Johnson:</b> I note my hon. Friend&#146;s passion on the
subject. We are very much talking about grown-up politics and making
sure that we get compulsory sex and relationship education into our
schools. We have to accept that a small number of parents want to
retain the right to withdraw. If we are going to have the bigger prize
of making sure of at least one year of compulsory sex and relationship
education, for grown-up politics we have to agree the compromise. That
is my answer, but my hon. Friend makes a persuasive case and a lot of
hon. Members agree with
him.</div><a name="10020443000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
answer to the question asked by hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North
Poole, the view is that 14 is a little too young and 16 would mean that
some young people received no sex and relationship education before
they reached the age at which they are legally able to have sex. Having
talked to key stakeholders&#151;parents, faith groups&#151;14 is
not something that we can get agreement on, but we can with
15.</div><a name="10020443000070"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10020443000252"></a><b class="B">Mr.
David Laws</b> (Yeovil) (LD): The Minister says that 14 is too
young. On what basis is 14 too young?</div>
<a name="10020443000071"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020443000253"></a>Ms
Johnson:</b> What I have been trying to express throughout is
that we have reached the age of 15 as a compromise, balancing different
clear views: no right of withdrawal or keeping the age at 19. We think
15 is the compromise that the majority of people can coalesce around
and say, &#147;That&#146;s workable, we are willing to accept
that.&#148; Fourteen was not an age that the majority of
stakeholders, parents and faith groups were willing to accept. For the
sake of grown-up politics, it is much 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column436" />Column number: 436</div>more important to get the compromise of 15 on to the statute books than
not to have anything at all or, as the hon. Member for East Worthing
and Shoreham would like, to keep the age at 19, which is completely
ridiculous.</div><a name="10020443000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment to give a young person over the age of 15 the right to be
excused from SRE if they express such a wish would give a child a right
of veto. That would also give the right of veto over the wishes of the
vast majority of parents who support the teaching of sex and
relationship education in schools. The right of withdrawal would
effectively pass from the parent to the child once they reached the age
of 15. The starting point has to be the extreme importance of pupils
receiving at least some of that education about sex and relationships
to keep them safe from harm and provide them with essential health
information.</div><a name="10020443000073"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10020443000254"></a><b class="B">Martin
Linton</b> (Battersea) (Lab): May I ask the Minister about the
0.04 per cent. of parents who withdraw their children from sex and
relationship education? Is that done on any promise that they will
provide their children with sex and relationship education? If so, is
there any check on whether they have done so or not? After all, when
parents withdraw their children from school education, as we shall hear
in the clauses on home education, there is strict control on whether
they provide the
equivalent.</div><a name="10020443000074"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020443000255"></a>Ms
Johnson:</b> I understand that there is
not.</div><a name="10020443000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to move on to the issue about 15-year-olds being able to decide
for themselves. We do not think that we should pass that right to a
15-year-old. We are concerned that from no other area of the national
curriculum can a pupil withdraw themselves. I agree with the hon.
Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole. Although saying that a
15-year-old should be able to decide on withdrawal for themselves is
superficially attractive, it is difficult to determine whether that is
the wish of the young person or whether they are saying what their
parents want them to
say.</div><a name="10020443000076"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10020443000256"></a><b class="B">Caroline
Flint</b> (Don Valley) (Lab): I, like other colleagues on
Committee, have some sympathy with the view about children and young
people continuing to have access at whatever age to sex and
relationship education. Can the Minister confirm that we are not in an
ideal world? If we are to have the chance to put sex and relationship
education on the statute book as a compulsory part of the curriculum,
even with the proviso of 15, unfortunately we sometimes have to have
trade-offs in the real world to move forward. I would hate for us and
the other place&#151;which personally I voted to abolish some years
ago&#151;to lose the opportunity to stop it getting on to the statute
books.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020443000257"></a>Ms
Johnson:</b> My right hon. Friend makes a valid contribution
to the debate, about making the measure through with
agreement.</div><a name="10020443000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
believe that the Liberal Democrat amendment about requiring parents to
talk to the school first, if they are concerned and want to withdraw
their child from SRE, is too much of a burden. There would be pressure
on parents to debate and propose arguments in an inappropriate way. We
think that schools should have an ongoing dialogue with parents about
SRE, and it would not be appropriate to accept the
amendment.</div>

<a name="10020443000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause 7
was tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, North-East.
He spoke to it passionately and persuasively, and we have some sympathy
with the new clause, in as much as we would prefer no parent to
withdraw their child from SRE. However, as I have been saying
throughout my speech, we recognise that, for some parents, the teaching
of SRE can conflict with their sincerely held views and religious
beliefs. As a consequence, we believe that we should preserve the
right, but with the limit at age
15.</div><a name="10020443000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
urge the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham to withdraw his
amendment.</div><a name="10020443000081"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020443000258"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> We have had an interesting debate, both on
Tuesday and tonight&#151;<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> This
morning; it seems to have been going on for so long.</div>
<a name="10020443000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">Returning to
where we started this debate, I absolutely want to see better quality
sex and relationships education in and out of our schools, with more
imaginative ways of getting the message across to children and young
people so that they will listen to, understand and act on it. I spent a
fascinating fact-finding day working in <i class="I">CosmoGirl</i> magazine
before it went out of business. The problems page dealt with amazingly
serious and distressing problems about sex and other things from
young  girls, which were handled intelligently by the magazine.
A number of other magazines handle such problems intelligently too,
despite some of the criticism that they get for talking about
sex.</div><a name="10020443000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
problem is that there is no equivalent for teenage boys. Magazines such
as <i class="I">Zoo</i> and <i class="I">Nuts</i> are all about fast cars and fast women,
rather than responsible sex and relationship advice. There is a huge
vacuum out there, particularly for young boys. We need to consider how
we get the message across in an environment in which boys will listen
and take note, so we desperately need better quality sex and
relationships education in whatever forum we can have it. The quality
is absolutely key. As I pointed out when I challenged the Minister
before, nothing that she has said, and nothing contained in the
arrangements, guarantees an improvement in quality. The second
consideration is that SRE should not compete with the already highly
stretched curriculum time within our schools, thus having a diluting
effect on other subjects. The third consideration is about parental
choice.</div><a name="10020443000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
agreed with much of what the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, North-East
said. Interestingly, both this week&#146;s episodes of
&#147;EastEnders&#148; so far have involved sex scenes between
various characters in Portacabins and
bathrooms&#151;<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> I have been a
devotee of &#147;EastEnders&#148; ever since the first episode.
What is interesting is the big impression that soaps such as
&#147;EastEnders&#148;, of which I am a big fan, can make,
particularly on young people. Some of the messages that they teach can
be a great force for good. Storylines on &#147;EastEnders&#148;
have included children in care, gay relations and HIV, which are
tremendously educational for and influential on people who watch
it.</div><a name="10020443000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
if one looks at the relationships within &#147;EastEnders&#148;,
one can hardly count the number of children living in stable families
with married parents&#151;it is not the norm in that soap. There have
been a disproportionate number of children born to teenage or 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column438" />Column number: 438</div>single mothers compared with the rest of the population, and that can
create the impression that that is the way things are
done.</div><a name="10020443000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am not criticising that particular programme. What I am saying is that
that programme, similar soaps and the media have huge influences on our
young people. If they run responsible messages, that can be good, but
when they do not run responsible messages, and if there is a skewed
image society, that can give rise to some of the copycat behaviour that
we see.</div>
<a name="10020443000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">A while ago,
when I visited a school not far from me in a deprived area of Brighton,
a teacher made the interesting comment that because the soap opera of
choice in that area was mostly &#147;EastEnders&#148;, teachers
knew the storyline because it could reflect the way in which parents
would respond to the teachers. The programme is hugely
influential.</div><a name="10020443000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
must ensure that kids are getting the right message in a way that they
will listen to. However, taking away parental choice is not the way to
do that. I thought that it was rather patronising of the Minister to
say that parents have a big and positive role to play in their
children&#146;s life. Parents have the biggest and the most
responsible role to play. They are the most important people in the
lives of their children. This approach takes away the rights and
choices of those parents to do what they think is best by their
children, without taking away any of the responsibilities&#151;it
still loads those responsibilities on them. I have no problem about
teaching sex and relationships education to children in school with the
safeguards that I have mentioned, and particularly with the safeguard
of parental choice and the ability to withdraw their children from
it.</div>
<a name="10020443000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">Why is that a
problem? As we have seen, the only existing statistical evidence shows
that a tiny number&#151; 0.04 per cent.&#151;are affected,
which represents fewer than 3,000 children in this country. There is no
evidence that those children are more susceptible to immature sexual
relationships or sexually transmitted diseases than those who have sex
and relationships education. That might or might not be the case, but
there is no evidence for it. As we heard from Gill Frances, one of our
witnesses, the whole age thing is a complete red herring. I would like
good quality sex and relationships education that is well communicated
to kids. Its purpose should be well communicated and consulted on with
the parents so that that 0.04 per cent. of children becomes even lower
without having to introduce compulsion.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020443000259"></a>Martin
Linton:</b> May I ask the hon. Gentleman the same question
that I asked the Minister? Should there be any check on whether the
small group of parents who withdraw their children from sex and
relationships education provide that education themselves? Is it enough
to let them watch
&#147;EastEnders&#148;?</div>
<a name="10020443000091"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020443000260"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> It is not enough to let them watch
&#147;EastEnders&#148;, but I would like to see some empirical
evidence from a survey of the parents of those 3,000 children. If that
showed that those 3,000 children had a much higher tendency to teenage
pregnancy or everything else that we are trying to
avoid&#151;<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i><i class="I"> </i>Hold on. If
that was the case, there would be a stronger case for amending the law.
However, no empirical evidence 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column439" />Column number: 439</div>exists, and no evidence has been put forward by the Government to
support making this change. No convincing case has been made by the
Minister as to why the Macdonald report has gone out of the window nine
months on.</div>
<a name="10020443000092"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020443000261"></a>Mrs.
Cryer:</b> I want to point out briefly that, in going along
this path, the Opposition are withdrawing the rights of children. Some
of those children will be vulnerable. As I said earlier, the parents
who withdraw children from these classes are likely to be the very
parents who will not discuss such matters with their children.
Therefore, they will be going out into the world without any
enlightened knowledge.</div>
<a name="10020443000093"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020443000262"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> Well, by the same token, there is no evidence to
back up the hon. Lady&#146;s claim. There is no evidence to suggest
that the 3,000 children involved are not acting much more sexually
responsibly than those who are left to have the compulsory lessons in
school. We need legislation that is based on empirical evidence,
particularly in these sensitive areas, and the Minister has failed to
produce that.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020443000266"></a>Martin
Linton:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman, but is he not
waiting for research that cannot be conducted? Are the names of the
3,000 parents who withdraw their children not protected by the Data
Protection Act? Is it not impossible to conduct the research that he
thinks would be necessary?</div>
<a name="10020443000098"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020443000267"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> In which case the status quo should be kept.
Until it can be shown that there is a problem that would be undermined
by not allowing parents the right of choice about whether their
children remain, the legislation should not be
changed.</div><a name="10020443000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
all want to achieve what I set out at the beginning: much better
quality sex and relationships education. We think that can be done
without removing the rights of parents, and that more children could be
involved and exposed to higher quality sex and relationships education
without making it a compulsory subject. Making it compulsory has
knock-on effects and potentially undermines the relationship&#151;I
cited quotes about this&#151;between parents, communities and
schools, which have no choice about how this is taught to their
children.</div><a name="10020443000100"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020443000268"></a>Caroline
Flint:</b> Obviously the debate always comes back to the point
that the issue is about having sex. For those young people who have
withdrawn from sex education, it is not necessarily about whether they
are having sex or not, but about giving them information to assert
themselves at some point in their young adulthood with knowledge that
is non-biased and helps them to make choices. It is about talking about
their rights in marriage, domestic violence and other issues. We have a
terrible problem with discussing sex and relationships in this country,
but that is what this matter is about. If the Dutch or people from
other countries with far more successful outcomes on the issue were
looking at us, they would think we were mad.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column440" />Column number: 440</div><a name="10020443000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman talks about quality, but he does not will the means. What
does he say to all the children&#146;s charities that think that
making this area of education statutory will, in some small way, help
to raise the quality levels and consistency of what needs to be
delivered for our
children?</div><a name="10020443000102"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020443000269"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> If that were the case, there would be a stronger
reason for these changes, but the right hon. Lady and her hon. Friends
have not made the case for how the proposal will automatically lead to
better quality. The reason we are talking purely about sex is because
we are on clause 14, which is purely about sex and relationships
education. We discussed the merits of the other elements of PSHE in our
consideration of earlier clauses. I wholly agree with the points that
the right hon. Lady makes. The subject should be taught in schools. It
is being taught in schools, and it needs to be taught better. However,
there is no need to make this so prescriptive and
compulsory.</div><a name="10020443000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
will not reach an agreement on the proposal but, before we get to the
debate on Report, we need the Minister to make a more convincing case
for why she is going to take away the rights of many parents, in
relation to whom there is no empirical evidence to suggest there is a
problem. How will she deal with the subject of quality, because she has
not done so by purely describing the mechanics of how the subject will
have a different status within schools? How will it fit with the other
pressures on the curriculum, and why has the arbitrary figure of 15
been plucked out of nowhere? I do not think there should be any such
figure.</div><a name="10020443000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
right hon. Member for Don Valley accused us of undermining
children&#146;s rights, but one of our probing amendments refers to
giving extra rights to children to make that choice. That might be
workable or not, but we cannot be accused of doing one thing when we
are trying to do exactly the opposite. The Liberal Democrats have not
made a cogent case for why the age should be 14. We should do away with
the reference to age, which is why we have said all the time that there
must be a compulsory aspect. However, there should be a safeguard so
that a tiny and, hopefully, diminishing number of parents can opt out
their children when they have a particular case and want to do so. If
we then concentrate on the quality, that would get the message across
more effectively to a broader number of people without undermining the
relationship between parents, the communities and their schools, which
I fear the clause will
do.</div><a name="10020443000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
do not want to press the amendment to a Division at this stage because
we need to move on to other important matters. However, I make a plea
for the Minister to do more homework and to prepare a much more cogent
case before we get to the debate on Report, if she wants there to be
such a big change to the status quo that has been in place for many
years. For 13 years under her Government, it was perfectly tenable for
parents apparently to have the choice to remove their children from sex
and relationships education. She needs to make the case why&#151;13
years on, and after an expert report that disagrees with her&#151;now
and only now she thinks that all that should be changed. That case has
not been made, although I hope that it will be on Report. In the
meantime, however, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="10020443000106"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020443000270"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> On a point of order, Mrs. Anderson. I do
not want to detain the Committee, given how much we have to do, but can
I raise one issue of concern with you? In a spirit of helpfulness on 28
January the Minister raised on a point of order a correction of some
statements that he had made to the Committee that morning, about the
powers of the ombudsman to award financial compensation.</div>
<a name="10020443000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Committee
will be aware that we have now received a letter, which I have only
this morning seen, from the local government ombudsman, saying that in
his view the corrected information that the Minister supplied us with
was wrong. I am concerned that people who read the record of the
sittings may draw the wrong conclusions from the Minister&#146;s
point of order. Have you, Mrs. Anderson, received any
request to correct the
record?</div><a name="10020443000109"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020443000271"></a>The
Minister for Schools and Learners (Mr. Vernon
Coaker):</b> Further to that point of order, Mrs.
Anderson. It may be helpful if I clarify
matters.</div><a name="10020443000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have of course, seen the letter sent by the local government ombudsman,
Tony Redmond, to the Committee on 2 February, to which the hon.
Gentleman referred. I think it right to say immediately that the
essential point on which we agree is that neither a school governing
body nor a local authority can be compelled to pay financial
compensation to a parent or pupil as a result of a complaint to the LGO
under the guarantees. That was the point that the hon. Member for
Yeovil was concerned about during our exchanges on this point on
Tuesday 28
January.</div><a name="10020443000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">Both
the Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Act 2009 and the
Local Government Act 1974 require schools or local authorities, as
appropriate, to decide whether to make a financial payment to a
complainant after considering a report or statement. That remains the
position. Whether that is called a recommendation or not is something
on which we can agree to differ. We are in discussion with the LGO on
those
matters.</div><a name="10020443000112"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020443000272"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Thank you. May I, before we proceed, urge
members of the Committee to exercise some restraint. We have had many
sedentary contributions, and background conversations. It is important
that all members of the Committee can be heard.</div>
<a name="10020443000113"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Clause 14

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020443000273"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I beg to move amendment 234, in clause 15,
page 16, line 20, at end
add&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(5) The Secretary of
State shall publish guidance for schools on how they should respond to
applications to provide community facilities including applications
about which the governing body has
concerns.&#146;.</div><a name="10020443000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
welcome you to the Chair, this morning, Mrs. Anderson, and
thank the Minister for the statement that he made a moment ago. I do
not want to detain the Committee on the clause for too long, given the
other matters that we must get through. My intention, as I believe that
the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column442" />Column number: 442</div>Conservatives do not intend to speak on the matter, is to raise both the
amendment and a wider issue on the clause without the need for a stand
part debate, unless you correct me and feel that it would be
appropriate to deal with the two
separately.</div><a name="10020443000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
15 deals with the power of schools to provide community facilities. The
clause would amend section 27 of the Education Act 2002, so
as to require governing bodies in England to give consideration, at
least once in every school year, to whether to use the powers to
provide facilities for community use. I hope that the Minister can deal
with two
issues.</div><a name="10020443000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">First,
many of the representations that we have received expressed the view
that it would be helpful, as set out in amendment 234, to have clear
guidance. <i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i></div>
<a name="10020443000118"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020443000274"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. I apologise to the hon. Gentleman, but I
am afraid some of the background conversations are making things very
difficult for the <i class="I">Hansard</i> writers. I once again urge restraint
on members of the
Committee.</div><a name="10020443000119"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020443000275"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I am grateful, Mrs.
Anderson.</div><a name="10020443000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
purpose of the amendment is to obtain clarification about whether
guidance will be given to governing bodies in exercising their freedoms
and responsibilities under clause 15. In particular, what guidance will
they be given about dealing with applications from certain groups in
the wider community, when a school might have concerns about granting
them access to its facilities? Those might include extremist political
parties, or other groups that promote views that lead the governing
body to think it inappropriate to welcome them on to school
property.</div>
<a name="10020443000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">The other
issue that I want to raise, Mrs. Anderson, to avoid a stand
part debate, is the intention behind the clause. I should also like to
put it on the record how such freedoms are to be used. In paragraph 27
of a memorandum submitted to the Committee, the NASUWT
said:</div><a name="10020443000198"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Significant
caution must be exercised in taking this proposal forward. The money
delegated to governing bodies is intended to ensure that they are able
to undertake their core responsibilities for the provision of high
quality teaching and
learning&#148;.</div><a name="10020443000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
other words, it is concerned that money should not be diverted from
educational purposes into community and other
activities.</div><a name="10020443000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
impact assessment says
that</div><a name="10020443000199"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;schools
are limited to spending their budgets on the purposes of the
school.&#148;</div><a name="10020443000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
goes on to
say:</div><a name="10020443000200"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
objective of this clause is to include community facilities explicitly
within the definition of purposes of the school, for spending
purposes&#148;.</div><a name="10020443000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">Interestingly,
it goes on to
say:</div><a name="10020443000201"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;This
is to support closer partnership working between schools and to enrich
provision - and thus outcomes - within an
area.&#148;</div><a name="10020443000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
leaves me rather unclear whether the purpose of the clause is to allow
partnership working between schools, or whether it is to facilitate
groups outside education using the facilities of the school for
community purposes. Those are two very different things, and it might
be considered appropriate to spend money on one and not another.
Subsection (2), which deals with the additional flexibility that the
Government want to grant, says:</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column443" />Column number: 443</div><a name="10020443000202"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Subject
to regulations under paragraph (b), subsection (3)(a) has effect as if
amounts spent on providing facilities or services under section 27 of
the Education Act 2002...were spent for purposes of the
school.&#148;</div>
<a name="10020443000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">I find that confusing,
because it appears to redefine any expenditure on community facilities
as school-related expenditure. My concern, and I expect that of the
NASUWT, is whether it is possible for expenditure that has nothing to
do with education or school provision to be hidden by this particular
amendment, which seeks to redefine more or less anything that the
school is spending money on, including in the community, as for a
school and educational purpose. I hope that the Minister can clarify
that
point.</div><a name="10020443000128"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020443000276"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> Good morning, Mrs. Anderson, and good
morning to the Committee. It is nice to be back here; I felt a bit
strange sitting on the Bench behind. The hon. Gentleman raised a couple
of very important points, but the power for governing bodies to provide
community facilities is not new. In the clause, we are asking governing
bodies to consider each year whether they should use the power. So the
clause does not provide a new power. It simply requires them to
consider whether it is appropriate for them to use the
power.</div><a name="10020443000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">Alongside
that, non-statutory guidance is given to governing bodies, advising
them how to use that power. It deals with some of the important issues
that the hon. Gentleman raises, such as what sorts of community groups
can use school facilities. It is my understanding that very little
concern has been expressed about the matter to the Department, and that
governing bodies have felt confident about using that power when they
feel that it is appropriate. Having said that, we can look at the
non-statutory guidance to ensure that it is as it should be, but we do
not think that it will be necessary to make any changes with respect to
that, although the amendment raises an important
point.</div><a name="10020443000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are trying to focus on the way in which schools are becoming a bigger
part of the community. We want to draw out that purpose and say that it
might include working with parent groups and other youth groups outside
the traditional school environment. There is still a school purpose in
trying to build aspiration within a community. Another aspect may be
schools work with other schools to provide a facility. Two secondary
schools half a mile apart may work together to provide a joint
opportunity for young people or parents in the area that would benefit
both schools. That would fit the purpose. The hon. Gentleman raises
some important points, but I hope that with
that&#151;</div><a name="10020443000131"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020443000277"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I am grateful to the Minister. He has, I think, been
helpful, but can he give an assurance, in relation to the NASUWT
representations that we have received, that this measure does not
ultimately mean the diversion of money for education to non-educational
purposes?</div><a name="10020443000132"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020443000278"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> My last point was to be that there are of course
limits on the exercise of the power to provide community facilities and
those limits are already set out in legislation. The governing body
cannot do anything that detracts from its core purpose of ensuring the
quality and standard of education in the
school.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column444" />Column number: 444</div><a name="10020443000133"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020443000279"></a>Martin
Linton:</b> I am a governor of a nursery school and
children&#146;s centre and we have a budget covering both educational
and community facilities, so many governors already have a budget for
community facilities. Obviously, the children&#146;s centre has to be
opened up to general community use as well as the parents of pupils at
the nursery
school.</div><a name="10020443000134"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020443000280"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> That is a helpful comment. Again, to reassure the
hon. Member for Yeovil, there is a duty on the governing body to ensure
that its primary function is the quality and standard of education in
the school. It cannot do anything that detracts from that, so if it was
spending money in a way that did, the legislation says that it should
not be doing
that.</div><a name="10020443000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are saying that the governing body should consider whether it could use
some of its budget to provide community facilities that in the broader
sense of education and community, to which my hon. Friend the Member
for Battersea referred, could contribute to the quality and standard of
education in the school by supporting activities outside the school
that would impact on what happened inside the school. With those
comments, I hope that the hon. Member for Yeovil will withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="10020443000136"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020443000281"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020443000282"></a>Mr.
Purchase:</b> I want the clause withdrawn. I shall go into a
little detail, but I will try to take full note of what you have said,
Mrs. Anderson. First, it is necessary to understand what we
mean by a company limited by guarantee. What it does not mean is that
no one ever makes any money out of it. A company limited by guarantee
is not a not-for-profit organisation. Often, we find members of
organisations who adopt this method&#151;a company limited by
guarantee&#151;who say that of course they have no ability to
distribute profits to shareholders, because the shareholders are
limited to a share of the value of &#163;1 each and there is no
dividend payable on that share. That is what they mean by not for
profit. They mean not for the profit of the shareholders, but of course
we find that that is a very convenient position when we start to
examine some of the salary structures involved in companies limited by
guarantee.</div><a name="10020443000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">Many
housing associations, arm&#146;s length housing companies and other
organisations adopt the company limited by guarantee approach. Of
itself, it is of course harmless, but it can be used in a certain way.
We may find that the chief executive of a company limited by guarantee
that provides services previously provided  by the local
authority earns more&#151;often considerably 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column445" />Column number: 445</div>more&#151;than the chief executive of the local authority. It becomes
a way of obfuscating a nice money-making
venture.</div><a name="10020443000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government, in their wisdom&#151;or naivety, in my
opinion&#151;propose to allow schools that want to establish
academies to form companies limited by guarantee. We know what is going
on. Often, people who have set up academies palm off an otherwise
useless, finished, worked-out, down-at-heel executive from their
company on to a school and pay his salary&#151;it is usually a
man&#151;from school funds. That is how we get into the position we
have in London, where head teachers in academies are paying themselves
&#163;200,000 a year. Recently, <i class="I">The Sunday Times</i> reported that
the head teachers or principals of at least 11 academies are paid more
than &#163;150,000 per annum. That is more than some directors of
education who run 40, 50, 60, 70 or 100 schools. It is simply a way of
putting money into the back pockets of people who would otherwise be
working in education for salaries on the scale that everyone else works
for.</div><a name="10020443000217"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10
am</div><a name="10020443000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
proposal that
the</div><a name="10020443000203"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;governing
body of a maintained school in England may...form, or participate
in forming, a company to enter into an
agreement&#148;</div><a name="10020443000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">is
simply another way of allowing public funds to be put into private
pockets. We have seen quite enough of that over the past 20 to 30
years. People have been able to enrich themselves from the public
purse. Whether academies are good or bad in educational terms is not
the point. The point is whether we want people to enrich themselves at
the cost of taxpayers through the obfuscation of forming a company
limited by guarantee. The answer has to be, &#147;No we do
not.&#148;</div><a name="10020443000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">Where
does the money come from? I have some figures from the north of the
country, which is not known for having an embarrassment of riches in
education. Sir Peter Vardy writes to complain that his academies in
Northumberland get about &#163;1,000 per pupil less than his
academies down the road in Middlesbrough. He quoted figures showing
that the amount per pupil for Emmanuel college was &#163;5,900 and
for the King&#146;s academy was &#163;7,463. His complaint was that
Middlesbrough received about &#163;1,000 per pupil more. So we are
talking about &#163;8,500 per
pupil.</div><a name="10020443000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to tell the Committee what grants schools that are not academies
in the same area receive. Cramlington high school receives
&#163;3,628 per pupil, Astley community high school receives
&#163;3,924 per pupil and Blyth community college receives a bit more
at &#163;4,413 per pupil. None of those grants approach even the
lowest amount received by the academies. That is where the academies
get their money; the Government have filled up their pockets. We need
to know what they are doing with the money. We do not know that any
more because academies are outside the Freedom of Information Act in
any
event.</div><a name="10020443000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
proposal will allow them to obfuscate even further. The Government must
think carefully. I know that the Opposition would put as many such
measures in place as they could. They would probably privatise the
whole education system. We all know where the so-called Swedish
business is heading. We all know  it is about enriching
privateers at the expense of the public purse.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column446" />Column number: 446</div><a name="10020443000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">Mrs.
Anderson, I am trying hard to obey your missive to be brief. There is
so much more to say. It is an utter disgrace. I wish that my Government
would recognise that the track that they have gone down in this regard,
including further measures being taken now, are not in the interests of
schooling generally. There is a similar measure on the next page, but I
shall not bother to mention it because I think I am making the point
with this one. Further assistance to academies and those who are
enriching themselves is unnecessary. If academies are to play any part
in the serious education of people in this country we need to get rid
of this enrichment culture and get down to the brass tacks
again.</div><a name="10020443000149"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020443000283"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> May I say to my hon. Friend the Member for
Wolverhampton, North-East that there is clearly a difference of view?
He is right to ask all of us questions all the time and to challenge
all of us all the time and, where there is a policy difference, to try
to get the Government to justify what we are doing. By reiterating the
points that he has made passionately, forcefully and clearly, he
reminds us that those of us who think that academies have a role to
play should justify that thinking. It is right that he does
that.</div><a name="10020443000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
respond to my hon. Friend, we have tried to see that academies play a
part over the past year or two. He knows that many clauses apply to
academies and that they challenge us about that, saying, &#147;Why
are you making this apply to us?&#148; We say, &#147;Because
you&#146;re state schools.&#148; Academies have certain freedoms,
which I know that my hon. Friend disagrees with, but they are state
schools, and that places certain obligations on them. However, they
have a role to play in certain circumstances to try to help raise
achievement, alongside other types of schools. We do not regard them as
the only answer. The Opposition want every school, both secondary and
primary to be an academy&#151;the &#147;let the market rip&#148;
approach&#151;whereas we believe that differences in schools, and
different types of schools, help raise achievement. That is a point of
difference between my hon. Friend and me. We do not disagree on many
things, but we disagree on this matter. I respect my hon. Friend for
making that point, because he passionately wants to raise
achievement.</div><a name="10020443000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
should like to reassure my hon. Friend on two points that he
specifically raised. Academy trusts cannot make a profit, although I
know that he was making a point about the diversion of funds into some
of the companies, and so on, which he feels should be spent on the
front
line.</div><a name="10020443000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
my hon. Friend&#146;s point about freedom of information, I
understand that that matter is under consideration at the moment. He
might be interested to know that there is discussion in the Ministry of
Justice about the extension of freedom of information and whether that
should include
academies.</div><a name="10020443000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
16 will give maintained school governing bodies in England the power to
form an academy trust to enter into a funding agreement with the
Secretary of State to establish an academy. Currently, maintained
school governing bodies do not have the power to set up an academy
trust directly; they must first set up a school company. The clause
allows them to form an academy trust, should they wish to do so, to try
to help with the general improvement in secondary education that we 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column447" />Column number: 447</div>are seeing, and where appropriate to establish an academy, if that fits
in with the general secondary school provision in a particular
area.</div><a name="10020443000154"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020443000284"></a>Mr.
Purchase:</b> The point is that this power will allow schools
to become trading entities. Telford College of Arts and Technology
already does that, although under what guise I am not sure. It sells
educational materials and lectures to schools in the rest of the area
and makes a tidy little sum, which all goes back to Telford, where the
head teacher is paid far more than the chief executive of Shropshire
council, who runs the whole county. This is what happens. My hon.
Friend the Minister must see that the trading-company approach to
education is an &#147;open sesame&#148;&#151;an open
door&#151;to those who would enrich themselves at the expense of the
public. He mentions freedoms, such as they might be, but if he thinks
they are so good and so essential to education, why not give them to
every
school?</div><a name="10020443000155"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020443000285"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> Part of setting up academy trusts is about trying
to share good practice. In the example he uses, the head teacher and
services from one school go to another school to share that good
practice and to help it develop its own good practice. Yes, this may
add a cost in terms of teacher time or resources and materials, but
that is not used as a profit in the traditional sense of the word. It
is then reinvested into educational services either in that school or
in the general educational
provision.</div><a name="10020443000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
know that my hon. Friend and I disagree on this point. I think that
academies make an important contribution to secondary school standards.
I want every secondary school, whether academy, national challenge
trust, local authority maintained school or whatever, to achieve the
very best. We are seeking to help those governing bodies who would want
to establish academy trusts to do so in a controlled and collaborative
way. By sharing that experience and expertise, hopefully we can raise
standards across every
school.</div><a name="10020443000157"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

Chairman:</b> With this it will be convenient to discuss
amendment 66, in
clause 18, page 17, line 24, leave
out from &#145;State&#146; to end of line
26.</div><a name="10020443000162"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020443000288"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> Welcome to the chair, Mrs. Anderson. I
will be brief. According to the impact assessment, the policy behind
the clause and the preceding clauses is to
make</div><a name="10020443000204"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;it
easier for maintained schools that have the right combination of
educational excellence, capacity and track record and are therefore
accredited to be brought in to lead school improvement interventions in
weak schools through Academies, majority Trusts and federations and
also to propose to establish new maintained
schools.&#148;</div><a name="10020443000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
appears to be some question about whether governing bodies of
maintained schools already have this power to establish new schools.
But the Government&#146;s view is  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column448" />Column number: 448</div>that they do. It would be helpful, therefore, if the Minister could
expand further on whether maintained schools already have this
power.</div>
<a name="10020443000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">The purpose
of amendment 67 is to probe this issue further and to ask how the
clause ties in with the policy behind section 8(1)(b) of the Education
and Inspections Act 2006. Under that provision, LEAs can publish
proposals for a new school under the competition procedures of section
7 only if certain conditions prevail and only with the consent of the
Secretary of State. Those conditions relate to the track record of the
education authority concerned. The Minister will recall how
controversial that measure was and why those safeguards were inserted
into the Bill. Originally the intention was that local authorities
could not propose any school under the competition
rules.</div><a name="10020443000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
impact assessment says that since 2006 there have been 31 new school
competitions, of which 11 have been won by existing schools which have
been or formed part of a trust. Could the Minister expand on the
details of those 11 schools? Were they schools in local education
authorities with a proven track record, for example? What does he mean
by maintained schools that have the right combination of educational
excellence, capacity and track record? Can he define which schools will
meet that threshold? Amendment 66 simply removes from the Secretary of
State the ability to pass decisions over whether a school can have
these powers to another person or body. These are important judgments
and ought to be made by someone who is directly accountable to
Parliament. We have debated this issue on a previous clause, but the
principles apply equally to this
clause.</div><a name="10020443000218"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.15

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020443000289"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> Under clause 18, new schools can be proposed by a
governing body. We are trying to make it clear that governing bodies
have that power&#151;it is currently unclear. That goes to the heart
of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s comments about the clause. We want to
ensure that governing bodies have that
power.</div><a name="10020443000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman talked about the accreditation process. He will know
that we have consulted on that process, which has just finished, taking
into account what we believe about accredited school providers and
groups. He asked what we mean by &#147;excellence&#148;. That is
the point of the consultation. We do not want new governing bodies to
have the power to create new schools or join other schools if we are
not certain of their quality. Clearly, there must be some assurance and
certainty. We must have some criteria by which we judge whether an
institution has the capacity, educational talent and ability and
quality in itself to share with others. That will be a part of the
accreditation process. As I said, we are consulting on that, and we
hope to publish the first list in the next two or three
weeks&#151;perhaps it might interest the hon.
Gentleman.</div><a name="10020443000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">Only
the Secretary of State will be able to designate other people who can
allow governing bodies to act. Again, we think that that is right.
There may be other bodies to which it would be appropriate for the
Secretary of State to give the authority to designate or accredit a
particular governing body. We are trying to ensure that those who
propose new schools&#151;if they are to share them with other
schools&#151;have the ability, talent, expertise, experience and
standards that we want.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column449" />Column number: 449</div><a name="10020443000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">With those
assurances, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw his
amendments.</div><a name="10020443000170"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020443000290"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b><b class="B"> </b>I am grateful to the Minister for his
response. He has confirmed that the purpose of the clause is to firm up
the vagaries of the law. I am grateful to him for spelling out that
there is a consultation process in play to determine what is meant by
educational excellence, capacity and track record. It would have been
helpful to have an indication of whether it means a proportion of GCSE
grades or an Ofsted judgment of outstanding leadership, management or
something else.</div>
<a name="10020443000171"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020443000291"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> All those things&#151;the standard and quality
of education, extra-curricular activities and Ofsted
inspections&#151;will be taken into account. The weight that we give
to each of them is also important.</div>
<a name="10020443000172"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020443000292"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> I am grateful for that further clarification. I look
forward to seeing the first list of schools that are regarded as having
educational excellence, capacity and track record in the next two to
three weeks, and I will look at that list
carefully.</div><a name="10020443000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
was disappointed in the Minister&#146;s response about other bodies.
It is important that such important judgments are taken by Ministers
who are accountable to this place, and not by quangos and other
non-departmental public bodies that are not directly accountable for
their decisions to this place. In the current atmosphere of trying to
make politics more transparent and accountable, I do not think that it
is right that we start to devolve decisions to such bodies. It
undermines confidence in the parliamentary system and the purpose of
elections if decisions are ultimately taken by people who are not
subject to elections and parliamentary accountability. I beg to ask
leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="10020443000174"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020443000295"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> Clause 19 extends the role of SIPs from that of
improving standards at a school to that of improving the well-being of
pupils. It is odd that the Government want to widen the role of SIPs
beyond that of education when they were established only in
2006.  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column450" />Column number: 450</div>There has been no proper evaluation of whether they are a useful
development and provide value for money. I have spoken to heads
throughout the country about SIPs, and I have found mixed views. Some
see them as an expensive distraction. The NASUWT shares that
perception, and
states:</div><a name="10020443000205"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
NASUWT already has concerns about the effectiveness of the SIP
programme and whether it does provide appropriate support and challenge
to head teachers and governing bodies on school
standards.&#148;</div>
<a name="10020443000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">On clause 19, it
says:</div><a name="10020443000206"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
NASUWT remains unconvinced that it is necessary to widen the scope of
the role of School Improvement Partners...so that they provide not
only advice...for the purpose of improving standards at the school
but also other prescribed services to improve the wellbeing of pupils
in the
school.&#148;</div><a name="10020443000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
General Teaching Council appears concerned and says that
there</div><a name="10020443000207"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;are
risks associated with this
development.&#148;</div><a name="10020443000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
fears that enhancing the role might restrict the ability to
recruit</div><a name="10020443000208"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;if
the SIP role became onerous for many serving head teachers, there would
be a loss to the system in terms of knowledge
transfer.&#148;</div><a name="10020443000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
goes
on:</div><a name="10020443000209"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
GTC is also concerned about the local authority being over-reliant on
the SIP for evidence of school performance, given its responsibility to
intervene in underperforming
schools.&#148;</div><a name="10020443000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
seems that the role of a SIP is transforming and has transformed over
the past three years from one of providing advice to more of an
accountability mechanism. Amendment 68 would insert the word
&#147;educational&#148; into the clause before
&#147;services&#148; to confine the advice that SIPs offer to
educational matters. The key role of SIPs should be to help raise
educational standards. If they are meant to give both educational
advice and advice about well-being, we move beyond the expertise of any
one person into the realm of poor quality either of educational advice
or advice on well-being. It is easier to be an amateur in someone
else&#146;s field than a professional in our own. The danger with the
policy is that we would be encouraging
amateurism.</div><a name="10020443000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
194 was inspired by the worries of the NUT, which
states:</div><a name="10020443000210"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
NUT believes that it would be desirable for this clause to be amended
to introduce an appeals process for governing bodies, in the event that
they consider a designated SIP to be unsuitable.&#148;</div>
<a name="10020443000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment requires
the approval of both the head teacher and the governing body of a
school before a SIP is appointed. As the purpose of a SIP is to help
and advise rather than to inspect or criticise, I cannot see why the
amendment would be a problem for the Government. A SIP need not be
somehow independent, like some form of inspector. A SIP is meant to be
a critical friend, so schools should have a say in who that critical
friend ends up
being.</div><a name="10020443000189"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020443000296"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I should like to talk to the amendments we have
tabled on the clause. Although we are all conscious of the limited time
left for scrutinising the Bill, the clause is important. According to
the Government&#146;s impact assessment, the clause is the most
expensive part of what is quite an expensive and bureaucratic Bill,
with an estimated cost of some &#163;325 million, in net present
value terms, for the school improvement partners.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column451" />Column number: 451</div><a name="10020443000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">As ever, the
impact assessment gives us an interesting insight into the
Government&#146;s present view of the role of SIPs. Yet again, the
individual writing those frank impact assessments is to be commended
for their clarity in describing and criticising existing Government
policy. The impact assessment says that the</div>
<a name="10020443000211"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;current role of
the SIP in schools is an inefficient use of resources as the role of
the SIP is too heavily focused on educational attainment, where schools
could better benefit from challenge&#148;,</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column452" />Column number: 452</div><a name="10020443000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">and
that</div><a name="10020443000212"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
role of the SIP is often duplicated by other LA
staff.&#148;</div><a name="10020443000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">Inevitably,
for the Government, it says that government intervention is necessary
to correct the
inefficiency.</div><a name="10020443000219"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.25
