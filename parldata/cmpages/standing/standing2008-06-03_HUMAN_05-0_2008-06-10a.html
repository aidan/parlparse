of
information</div><a name="080610108000022"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question
proposed, </i>That the clause, as amended, stand part of the
Bill.</div><a name="080610108000023"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="080610108000331"></a><b class="B">Dr.
Evan Harris</b> (Oxford, West and Abingdon) (LD): I take this
opportunity to welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Hood. We have
made excellent progress and I am sure that we shall do so today. As I
said during the debate on the amendments to the clause, I have a couple
of brief questions to ask. What is the basis for the current amount of
data that is collected? The main problem that has been raised with me
is the regulatory burden of a full amount of information given in the
register of information for all treatment cycles, the majority of which
do not result in a
pregnancy.</div><a name="080610108000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have debated why it is necessary to maintain a register of information
in respect of the treatments that produce a pregnancy and a child.
There are at least two main reasons. The first is to enable contact to
be made in the future, if requested by a child born through in vitro
fertilisation, particularly in respect of donor gametes and
non-identifying or identifying information about the genetic parent
when the person is not the legal or social parent. The second reason is
to ensure that the data is accurate on the outcomes of IVF clinics,
given the nature of the business and the relatively high stakes
involved compared with other businesses, and thus the potential
vulnerabilities of the patients, who are the consumers of the business.
The clinicians understand those two reasons, but they ask why it is
necessary to have identifying information in such great detail about
all patients even when a pregnancy does not result or is not known to
result. I imagine that reasons will be given for such action, but I
just want to deal with them in advance.</div>
<a name="080610108000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
necessary to retain information in case of adverse effects of some
treatment. However, in that sense, it is not different from any other
treatment. It is necessary for medical records to include information
so that it is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column162" />Column number: 162</div>possible to track any potential problems caused by drugs. The potential
for risks would be the same as that posed by full medical treatment,
but for no other full medical treatment is there a central database,
especially on treatment that does not result in pregnancy on which a
huge amount of information is collected with patients&#146; names
attached. The clinics that have contacted me about such matters
understand that it might be necessary to provide information centrally
and use patient numbers, but identifying patients would provide an
additional burden that they consider unnecessary unless pregnancy
results, in which case such a situation should be possible. I have
dealt with the second argument for the need to collect the data and
information about outcomes so that success rates are recorded. However,
that can be done without the need for detailed, identifying information
as set out under the
Bill.</div><a name="080610108000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will
the Minister say whether the Human Fertilisation and Embryology
Authority has received the same representations as I have about the
extent to which the regulatory burden of the register of information
and requirements will be onerous? Does it recognise that there might be
scope for reducing the amount of information, particularly identifying
information, that is held on a central database for no good reason over
and above the reason that such information is available in medical
notes on safety and outcome measures, when no child is produced or
known to have been produced? If it recognises that that is a regulatory
burden, has any consideration been given to how it could be reduced?
While that might have been appropriate in 1990, standard IVF and
insemination, particularly where, sadly, it does not result in a
pregnancy, are now routine medical techniques and
interventions.</div>
<a name="080610108000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
peculiar that for those routine medical interventions, a great amount
of information must be submitted to a central database which has not as
yet been used for any research purpose. Without having a central
database of identified patients, it is still possible to do research
where non-licensed treatments&#151;which could be more extensive in
terms of drugs and surgery&#151;are not subject to such requirements.
It is a valid point, and I would be interested to hear the
Minister&#146;s response.</div>
<a name="080610108000028"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="080610108000332"></a><b class="B">Mark
Simmonds</b> (Boston and Skegness) (Con): I join the hon.
Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon in welcoming you to the Chair,
Mr. Hood, and let me say how much I am looking forward to
serving under your guidance and chairmanship. I have three quick
questions for the Minister on clause 24 stand part that we did not
manage to cover in the debate on the amendments.</div>
<a name="080610108000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">The first
point is about counselling. Under the clause, the donor is informed
when a request has been made for information about them. In most
circumstances, there will be many years between the donation that leads
to the genetic offspring and the genetic offspring asking for
information about the donor. It is a minimum of 18 years, but it could
be much longer. Clearly, I welcome the stipulations in schedule 4 that
relate to counselling for the person requesting the information, but
what about counselling for the original donor? Obviously, it should not
be compulsory or mandatory, but there may be significant changes of
circumstances&#151;the donor&#146;s life may have changed
dramatically, they may be in a marriage or another relationship and it
could be extremely 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column163" />Column number: 163</div>traumatic to bring such a new piece of information into their life. I
wonder why no counselling is offered in the Bill for the original
donor.</div>
<a name="080610108000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second
point is about the disparity in ability to request information at
different ages. As I understand it, the donor-conceived person is able
to request non-identifiable information at 16, but other information is
available only at 18. Perhaps the Minister could put on the record the
logic behind that particular difference. It may be simply that people
are legally allowed to be in sexual relationships at the age of 16,
while 18 is the general cut-off point for moving into
adulthood.</div>
<a name="080610108000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">The third
point is about proposed new section 31ZB, which deals with checking
whether people in intimate relationships are genetically related. It is
about getting the permission of the other party in that intimate
relationship. What happens if both parties in that intimate
relationship are under the age of 18, and therefore only able to
receive non-identifying information, when the point of getting that
information is specifically to identify whether the partner in that
intimate relationship is related to them?</div>
<a name="080610108000032"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610108000333"></a>The
Minister of State, Department of Health (Dawn Primarolo):</b>
Good morning, Mr. Hood; I welcome you to the Chair. I will
deal first with the questions raised by the hon. Member for Oxford,
West and Abingdon. I wish to make a request to help me focus on
answering the points raised. I say now that there is absolutely no
criticism implied, bit it is difficult when the hon. Gentleman puts the
case and then put the Government&#146;s case as well. He answers his
own questions and ends with a series of questions that he has already
answered in the course of what he has said. I will repeat them on this
occasion as the Government&#146;s position as well, but we need to
try to focus.</div>
<a name="080610108000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman asked specifically about the disclosure of information
regarding patients, particularly where there have been unsuccessful
cycles of IVF. He went on to give the answer. As he pointed out, the
answer is, first, that the information has to be collected because at
the beginning of the cycle it cannot be known that the cycle is going
to be unsuccessful&#151;that there will not be a resultant child.
Secondly, the information could be relevant to subsequent courses of
treatment and follow-up cycles for the individual. Thirdly, the
collection of information clearly provides for long-term consideration
and research into fertility drugs and comparing the effects on women,
whether there is a pregnancy or not. The information provides the basis
for further research. Finally, there may be other important areas in
the consideration of treatment&#151;that links back to the question
of identifying information, particularly follow-up information.
Therefore, the hon. Gentleman put the case for why the proposals are as
they are, and he answered on behalf of the Government&#146;s position
as
well.</div><a name="080610108000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman asked two further questions. The first was about
representations that he had received. He asked whether the Government
had received the representations that he had received about the
collection of information and asked what was our response? Yes, we did
receive those representations. It was not a majority view that the
requirements were onerous&#151;there were a few of that view. We
considered the information powers, because we appreciated the comments.
However, we 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column164" />Column number: 164</div>remained of the view that it was important for the HFEA to collect data
for all licensed treatments and that we were striking the correct
balance between protecting the confidentiality of patients and allowing
disclosure under justifiable circumstances. The BMA supported us in
that approach. The hon. Gentleman&#146;s second question was
specifically geared to how the provision might create regulatory
burdens. My response is that the HFEA&#146;s new electronic data
interchange system with clinics should certainly help to ease any
feelings that the there is an undue burden of collection of
information.</div><a name="080610108000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
putting all of those points together, the hon. Gentleman clearly
justified the system. We considered some of the views put before us and
discussed the matter further. We came to the conclusion that we had
struck the right balance. We were supported in that by other
stakeholders. We believe that the regulatory burden will be
considerably alleviated by the system of electronic
exchange.</div><a name="080610108000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Boston and Skegness asked a series of questions,
particularly about the disparity&#151;which I will deal with
first&#151;between the information to which people are given access
at 16 and 18. Again, he touched on the answer in his remarks. We have
spoken to all of the stakeholders and, of course, the Committee does
not come cold to the discussion. We are talking about a consultation of
more than a year, with the consultation results published, followed by
draft legislation and the pre-scrutiny stage, and then consideration in
another place, before the proposals get here. We have had the
opportunity for consideration a number of times. The view was that 18
was the suitable age&#151;in terms of other legal requirements and
maturity&#151;to give people access to identifying information about
donors. This is, of course, significant personal information that could
have a dramatic impact. We cannot be sure that the individual knows
already that they are the result of a donation of either sperm or egg.
We are relying on the parents to have had discussions with their son or
daughter. It was agreed that in extreme cases where the individual has
not been informed, 18 is the sensible point for access to
information.</div><a name="080610108000301"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.45
am</div><a name="080610108000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Boston and Skegness also asked why we set the age for
access to non-identifying information at 16. I am assured that access
at that point is sufficient to ensure that within the records there is
no family connection. At that point it is not necessary to know the
identity; it is enough to be assured. I am not clear whether in extreme
circumstances there would need to be a loop back into the information,
and the HFEA would need to consider whether or not identifying
information was in the best interests of the individual. I will check
that matter and come back to the hon. Gentleman. There are two steps.
One applies to, for instance, an individual who at age 16, with
consent, is going to get married. It also applies where the parents
know that their son or daughter is planning to live with or, as the
hon. Gentleman said, be sexually active with a partner, and they want
to make sure of the information.</div>
<a name="080610108000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">Then the
hon. Gentleman asked about counselling for the donor. That was covered
in previous debates about counselling when the donor becomes involved
in the IVF programme. Of course, an individual has to be aware that the
request for information could happen 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column165" />Column number: 165</div>rather a long time ahead and their circumstances could be different by
then. That is part of the complexity of counselling when an individual
is considering being a donor; it must be thorough. It might be the case
that the donor would have access to counselling information at the time
that the request for identification was made, just in case. That is not
an absolute condition, but it would have to come back round the loop.
Counselling would be part of their preparation at the very beginning,
as they took the decision to be a donor, but would be accessible again
at the time when identifying information could be made available. I
understand that there is provision for that. These are delicate
points.</div>
<a name="080610108000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Boston and Skegness asked a question about new section 31ZB
and the fact that it does not enable the applicant to find out
identification. It does, however, provide access to the information to
ensure that there is not an issue that would lead to the need to
identify the donor. Should, for some reason, the result that came back
from the HFEA raise an issue of concern, that would open up the debate
automatically, regardless of age, because the individual would need to
know why. Imagining all the circumstances, it is difficult to see that
there would not be some pressure on the system at that point. The HFEA
would have to deal with that. I hope that I have dealt with the points
that were raised by both the hon. Member for Boston and Skegness and
the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon. On the question of
consent and information, they have tabled amendments to the next clause
that specifically focus on those issues and when consent is needed for
the passing on of information. Perhaps some of the other points will be
picked up again then.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610108000334"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I am grateful to have the opportunity to respond
to the Minister. I was listening carefully to what she said. In my
opening remarks, I did not answer my own question or put the
Government&#146;s case. I raised two points that I thought that the
Minister might use in her response and raised further points on them to
save time. I thought that that would be easier than seeking to
intervene on the Minister, which might not be her preference, during
her response.</div>
<a name="080610108000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">In respect
of her second point about the need to have this information for
follow-up, even for unsuccessful treatment cycles, that follow-up is
done by the doctor and the clinic. That is the same with any medical
treatment. There are often follow-up treatments in medicine. It is not
usual to be required to record all the details, including identifying
information, on the central database in order for there to be an
appropriate follow-up. Because of the stringent confidentiality
requirements, which we are about to discuss, it might be difficult for
one doctor to pass on to another doctor information about previous
treatments. I am not sure whether the matter will be helped by this
form of national database. I do not believe that future doctors would
use the resource to check what existing treatments someone has had;
they would normally ask the patient. I do not understand why the issue
of follow-up is a good reason to hold this information about
unsuccessful treatment cycles.</div>
<a name="080610108000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
also argued in respect of long-term research. I said that I did not see
how that was different from any other form of medical treatment in
which there is a research interest. I said that research can be done
through the usual consent arrangements prospectively or even
retrospectively, again with the appropriate consents 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column166" />Column number: 166</div>and ethical approval. My understanding is that there has not been any
useful research based on all the information on the database by the
HFEA. I know that amendments have been tabled to make such research
easier in the future, but it did not seem to be a good argument. That
was why I raised my points in advance. It was not to answer my own
question, but to help move forward the debate by asking whether they
could be addressed. The Minister may feel that she has done that, but I
do not feel that there has been sufficient justification. However, I
understand her point about not knowing whether there is going to be a
pregnancy and therefore needing to collect the information in advance.
If people from abroad, or in this country, do not opt to go back for a
post-natal follow-up, that data set is incomplete. In the end, we rely
on patients coming back for
follow-up.</div>
<a name="080610108000043"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610108000335"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> The hon. Gentleman will concede, I hope, that I
also made the point that follow-up was much wider than on the
individual patient&#146;s cycles. There is also follow-up about the
impact of drugs and incidents of cancer 20 years on. It is about access
to information from longer term studies and to understand why one cycle
was not unsuccessful and another one was. That may be something that
needs to be studied over time. The information was necessary for that
type of follow-up as
well.</div><a name="080610108000044"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610108000336"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I understand that justification. As I said
earlier, I would argue that it is not necessary to have a national
database to do that. We do not have a national database in any other
form of medicine, but prospective, case-controlled, and retrospective
epidemiological trials are done. Also, no useful data have been
gathered from this database in the nearly 20 years that it has been
going. I accept, however, that the Bill changes provisions to allow
more research. I guess we will know in the future whether that is
possible, not only prospectively for new patients, but for all the
patients that have been
treated.</div><a name="080610108000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
understand what the Minister is saying about motives. I am not arguing
that this is some form of malevolent intervention. I happen to be of
the view&#151;I accept what she says about the consultation and that
this is not a majority view&#151;that the benefits of this type of
central database for the treatment of donor cells from pregnancy are
not worth the regulatory burden. However, I was pleased to hear what
she said about the fact that the data collection and entry may be made
easier due to technological advances. I think that we all have our
fingers crossed on that, given the possibility of these things going
wrong. I think that I have made my case, and the Minister has put the
Government&#146;s case, and on that basis, I shall
finish.</div><a name="080610108000046"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610108000339"></a>Mark
Simmonds:</b> Clause 25 relates to the sharing of
information&#151;between and with whom&#151;the restrictions on
disclosure, and the exceptions to those restrictions. I shall speak
specifically to amendment No.
38.</div><a name="080610108000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
proposed new section 33C to the 1990 Act, the Bill provides for
consultation and regulations to be made to allow the disclosure of
identifying information without consent for the purposes of medical or
other research that
is</div><a name="080610108000056"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;necessary
or expedient in the public interest or in the interests of improving
patient
care&#148;.</div><a name="080610108000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
as the Minister and many members of the Committee will be aware, this
was debated at some length in the House of Lords. Members of the Lords
believed that the confidentiality provisions of the Bill were too
tight, thus preventing sufficient research on children born by IVF. In
situations in which women conceive through IVF, there is no procedure
for the woman&#146;s obstetrician to be told about the method of
conception. Clearly, this must be looked at in the context of patient
confidentiality. Obviously, if a woman does not want that information
to be passed on, her privacy should be protected.</div>
<a name="080610108000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
there are cases in which sharing such information would be beneficial,
and there seems to be a presumption against that information flow,
although perhaps the presumption should be in favour of it, even though
I do not think that it is relevant that obstetricians need to know who
the donor was, or whether it was the partner&#146;s sperm or a donor
sperm that fertilised the egg. Clearly, with IVF, women undergo
treatment and complex procedures that change the body. Such a thing
would, in some circumstances, enhance patient care in the context of
strict confidentiality, which does not apply to other sensitive or
personal conditions, such as considerations of mental health. The
amendment would allow for the sharing of information between medical
practitioners, which could improve patient care, in the context of
confidentiality. The woman&#146;s privacy would be respected, and
consent for that information to be passed on could be withdrawn, if she
wished.</div>
<a name="080610108000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 37 would remove the regulation-making power in proposed new section
33B of the 1990 Act. My understanding is that the power enables future
additional exceptions to be made on who can request information, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column168" />Column number: 168</div>who must be informed, and with whom it can be shared. However, if
consent is the cornerstone of the Bill, such issues should be debated
and put on the face of primary legislation. Members of the Committee
will see a very comprehensive list of exemptions on the main thrust of
the clause in paragraphs (a) to (u) of proposed new section 33A(2). The
matter has obviously been thought through very carefully, but will
Minister put on record why she feels that it might be necessary to
amend the list, given that it has clearly been thought through in great
detail? Can she give the Committee an example of an amendment that
might occur in future, although I understand that it might be difficult
to find an additional category that is not covered in paragraphs (a) to
(u)?</div>
<a name="080610108000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">My final
point about the clause concerns proposed new section 33A(3)(a), which
details the interrelationship between the Bill and the Congenital
Disabilities (Civil Liability) Act 1976? Will the Minister explain how
the measures work
together?</div><a name="080610108000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
would be helpful if the Minister could clarify whether the Government
amendments are all tidying-up provisions, or whether they would
actually change the meaning of the clause. They seem to remove certain
provisions, but that could just be tidying-up
drafting.</div><a name="080610108000302"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11
am</div><a name="080610108000062"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610108000340"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I tabled a couple of the amendments in the group,
but it might be best to hear the Minister&#146;s description of the
effects of the Government amendments. They are better drafted than
those in my name and, if I may say so, those tabled by the hon. Member
for Boston and Skegness. The right hon. Lady&#146;s amendments are
comprehensive and complex, and if she is willing to accept questions
after she has explained them, that might speed things
along.</div><a name="080610108000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 151 states that an exception would be made for disclosure on
clinical
grounds</div><a name="080610108000288"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;as
part of the patient&#146;s medical care, to a practitioner who is
bound by the ordinary duty of patient
confidentiality.&#148;</div><a name="080610108000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those
of us who want the rules on confidentiality to be loosened are not
talking about a free-for-all. We just want to bring the provisions
more, albeit not totally, in line with standard medical care rules
under which medical notes are confidential. There are significant
professional and, indeed, possibly criminal consequences from a breach
of medical confidentiality, which is something that I feel strongly
about. I have argued that the same procedure should apply to
politicians and their children in respect of vaccinations, given that
many in the media think that that should be a free-for-all, although I
disagree.</div><a name="080610108000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">Nevertheless,
several clinicians have raised a problem with me. I shall not repeat
what Lord Patel and Lord Winston said in the other place because that
can be read, but scientists from Newcastle have explained that when a
treatment is provided in a separate tertiary clinic, there is a clear
distinction between the initial investigation of the problem and the
subsequent provision of treatment. In a tertiary NHS referral centre,
it is likely that the initial investigations and counselling will be
carried out in a general infertility clinic. That might also occur a
long time from the possible treatment. For instance, an unmarried
18-year-old with a severe pelvic infection will be counselled about the
potential impact on fertility and the need to consider IVF. Such
records&#151;I 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column169" />Column number: 169</div>guess because this is a carried out in a licensed centre by a licensed
person&#151;are currently included in law under strict
confidentiality regulations because they refer to IVF, and that is
inappropriate.</div><a name="080610108000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are two ways in which to tackle the problem. We could argue that only
limited information should be included in the provisions and that they
should be loosened to enable communication between doctors in the best
interests of the patients in good faith. Doctors should always be
answerable in respect of complaints to medical regulators and the
professional regulator, the General Medical
Council.</div><a name="080610108000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government have heard such concerns in the House of Lords on several
occasions and I note that their amendments represent a response to
that. I look forward to hearing the right hon. Lady explain their
effect in detail. I hope that the clinicians who have contacted me will
be satisfied by what she says, as well as the potential of the
regulation-making power. I share the view of any Opposition
parliamentarian that wide-ranging, regulation-making powers are
questionable, but I feel more comfortable with the inclusion of the
provision, given that I do not think that this debate has
ended.</div><a name="080610108000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">IVF
still has a cachet, which makes it sensitive, but as its special status
becomes less special, and as it becomes more routine, for many
patients&#151;it will always be their decision&#151;it might well
become appropriate to change the provisions to ensure that we keep up
to date with what is practical and appropriate, rather than stick to
what was felt to be appropriate in
1990.</div><a name="080610108000069"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="080610108000341"></a><b class="B">Dr.
Ian Gibson</b> (Norwich, North) (Lab): I wonder,
Mr. Hood, whether I could have your view on an issue about
the running of this Committee that is beginning to bother me. Several
documents are being floated by people who have tabled amendments.
During my time in Parliament, I have sat on several such Committees,
and when documents are received from experts, it is important that
every Committee member sees them so that we can come to a balanced
judgment. Could you rule, Mr. Hood, that if people read from
documents from eminent professionals, they be made available to the
whole Committee? I say that because, advisably, I challenged a document
before, and within an hour, I was being challenged by those who put the
document in. My answer to them was, &#147;Why didn&#146;t you send
it to all of us? How do I know whether what you are saying is true?
Give us the evidence so that we can see.&#148; I think that we are
getting restrictive readings from different documents and that the
Committee is hearing only half the story. We all feel passionately
about this issue and want to get seriously
involved.</div><a name="080610108000070"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610108000342"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman for his point, but
that is not a matter for the Chair. If Members receive information from
other sources, it is for them to deal with that as they see fit. If
evidence was given to the Committee per se, all members of the
Committee would have that information, so that would not be a matter
for the
Chair.</div><a name="080610108000071"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610108000343"></a>Dr.
Gibson:</b> Perhaps the organisations or individuals that send
in such information are not aware of Committee procedure. By floating
it to one Committee member, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column170" />Column number: 170</div>they restrict other&#146;s involvement in the debate. When something
is put forward, perhaps it should be presented by the individual to the
Clerks so that they can judge whether it should be
distributed.</div><a name="080610108000072"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610108000344"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Again, the hon. Gentleman makes his point, but I
reiterate that that a matter for not the Chair, but those supplying the
information to Members and, indeed, the Members
themselves.</div><a name="080610108000073"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610108000345"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> The HFEA is required to collect details of
licensed treatments for its register of information, which contains
identifying information about everyone who has received treatment,
including IVF or donor insemination. The 1990 Act prohibits the
disclosure of such information by either the HFEA or a licensed
practitioner, and that is subject to a criminal offence, as the hon.
Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon reminded the Committee. The Bill
provides for exceptions to be made to that provision, so we have moved
from the requirements of the 1990 Act to the exceptions, some of which
we have dealt with this morning. Such exceptions are when a person
identified in the information to be released has consented to its
release, with the exception, of course, of donor information&#151;we
covered this in the previous clause&#151;which is protected to a
particular age; when the information would not identify any individual;
or in an emergency, when a woman who has received treatment or services
is in imminent danger that makes it necessary for information to be
released. The list of exceptions consolidates those already permitted
under the 1990 Act, as well as introducing some new ones. Furthermore,
as the hon. Member for Boston and Skegness mentioned, the Bill contains
a regulatory power that enables additional exceptions to be
made.</div>
<a name="080610108000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">When the
hon. Member for Boston and Skegness referred to amendment No. 37, he
asked me specifically why we need the regulatory measure. He referred
to paragraphs (a) to (u) of proposed new section 33A(2). To be frank,
the answer is that every exception that we can think of is already
there, although we cannot think into the future in terms of
future-proofing. The regulation-making power was in the 1990 Act.
Measures would be subject to the affirmative procedure and the power
would be a method of future-proofing the Bill, just in case. The hon.
Gentleman is right to say that we made every attempt to put everything
in the Bill, but we still believe that this measure is necessary in
case&#151;as has happened in the past&#151;we need further
exemptions. The regulations would not change the principles within
which the exemptions work. He asked whether I could name any; I am
afraid that I cannot because we think that we have been quite
thorough.</div>
<a name="080610108000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall deal
with amendments Nos. 38, 150 and 151 and respond to the questions asked
by both hon. Gentlemen before moving on to the Government amendments.
The amendments would provide additional exceptions for the disclosure
of information. Specifically, they relate to the situation if the
disclosure is made on clinical grounds as part of the patient&#146;s
medical care to a practitioner who is bound by the ordinary duty of
patient confidentiality, or if it is necessary to ensure the safety of
medical treatment that the patient is to receive outside licensed
premises. Again, the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon drew
comparisons with what happens elsewhere in medicine with regard to the
exchange of information.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column171" />Column number: 171</div><a name="080610108000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government&#146;s view is that consent on disclosure should always be
obtained when possible, and that doing so need not necessarily be
burdensome. We appreciate that there are occasions when, during the
course of treatment, it would be necessary for clinicians to share
information with other health professionals. However, because of the
consent arrangements in the Bill&#151;I will go on to make further
points&#151;we feel that it is more appropriate to provide for the
obtaining of general consent from the patient for that purpose at the
beginning of treatment. That would enable clinicians to be confident
that they were not acting outside the patient&#146;s wishes, while
also allowing them to share appropriate information regarding the
treatment of the
patient.</div><a name="080610108000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are circumstances in which patients would perhaps want to limit the
people who could be told about their treatment&#151;perhaps they
would not want such information to go to a GP who is a relative or a
friend. By consenting at the beginning of treatment, the extent of
information sharing could be limited accordingly. Again, that echoes
back to a theme that we have discussed in previous clauses about the
importance of clear explanation to the patient and clear adherence to
consent.</div>
<a name="080610108000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">Even after
amendment, the provision would not provide scope for clinicians to
disclose confidential patient information without the patient&#146;s
consent. I am not referring to drafting; I will reference other
requirements. I should say something to the hon. Member for Oxford,
West and Abingdon as a caveat because I have been a Member of the House
for 21 years&#151;quite a long time in opposition, although not
recently, thank goodness. It is hard to draft amendments because
parliamentary counsel are highly skilled. His amendments are about
making progress on the principle, and I understand entirely what he
wants to
do.</div><a name="080610108000303"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.15
am</div><a name="080610108000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments would not provide for that because before information was
disclosed to the health care professionals involved in a
person&#146;s treatment, the doctor would still need to consider
whether disclosure was compatible with the Data Protection Act 1998,
common law and any other relevant law where consent is generally
required. Therefore, requiring the consent right at the beginning, and
allowing that general disclosure, is in our view much more secure for
the clinicians as well. They would have to satisfy themselves in all
those other areas that they were disclosing information in the correct
way. It is the Government&#146;s view that the Bill strikes the right
balance in respect of requiring consent to be obtained before
identifying information is disclosed, even when that is to other health
care professionals, with the exception of emergency situations. Consent
to such disclosure in the course of treatment can be obtained, as I
said, prior to the initiation of treatment, when the patient is
consenting to that
treatment.</div><a name="080610108000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments that would introduce an exception to the disclosure are, in
the Government&#146;s view, inappropriate. The disclosure of
identifying information without consent should be permitted only where
there is good justification. There was a lot of discussion about that
between the Government and stakeholders. The British Medical
Association supported the Bill&#146;s position. Obtaining consent for
disclosure to health care professionals is possible. Therefore, the
exception proposed by the amendments is not justified.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column172" />Column number: 172</div><a name="080610108000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon made a point about the problems of
disparity between different medical professions and that we are setting
a higher level. I hope that I have dealt with that point, because a
general consent at the beginning gives greater certainty and clarity to
clinicians than having to satisfy themselves subsequently about data
protection, common law and other law relating to confidential
information, which is what the amendments would
require.</div><a name="080610108000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Boston and Skegness asked about the Congenital
Disabilities (Civil Liability) Act 1976. That did not trip off my
tongue&#151;I was prompted on the exact date, I hasten to add. The
1990 Act extended the reach of that legislation to cover infertility
treatments. Basically, the Bill does not alter that position. The 1976
legislation was carried over to the 1990 Act, which made the
cross-reference and put infertility in, but the Bill, as it amends the
1990 Act, is silent on that, because it does not alter the positions. I
hope that that deals with his
point.</div><a name="080610108000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the Government amendments, I suppose the quick response, although I
might have to give a little more detail, is yes, they mostly tidy up
the consent exceptions, following discussion in another place. The
changes are tidying-up measures. However, there is one instance in
which we need to be absolutely clear with regard to the interaction of
the exceptions. We have to ensure that we do not inadvertently open up
the consent to disclosure of non-identifying information or cause some
difficulties in that regard. We are managing two types of
information&#151;the identifying and non-identifying&#151;and under
what basis it can be disclosed.</div>
<a name="080610108000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">We recognise
that it is very important that the 1990 Act and the Bill strike the
right balance between safeguarding the confidential information of
patients, their partner, donors and children held by the HFEA and
clinics while, at the same time, allowing information to be disclosed
by the HFEA and clinics in circumstances that warrant it. However, the
1990 Act is not always as conducive as it could be in that regard. For
example, it prohibits the HFEA from disclosing identifying information
about patients, even in cases in which the patient consents to such
disclosure. That is one issue that needs to be addressed.</div>
<a name="080610108000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will go
through the Government amendments very quickly and return to them if
Members have further questions. Amendment No. 45 amends and simplifies
the wording in new section 33A(2)(g) to (j) and clarifies it to strike
the important balance on consent, including identifying information as
long as individuals have given their
consent.</div><a name="080610108000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 46 is consequential to the new wording in proposed new section 33A
about the disclosure of information, and replaces wording removed by
amendment No. 50. It clarifies that the HFEA can disclose identifying
information from its register to avoid imminent danger to a
person&#146;s
health.</div><a name="080610108000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 47 removes wording from proposed new section 33A about consent to
disclosure when treatment services are provided to two people together
and both are identifiable. It recognises the provisions in proposed new
section 33AB whereby the consent of each individual identified must be
obtained.</div><a name="080610108000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 48 removes wording that is consequential and replaces it with
wording that will be introduced by amendment No. 54. Amendment No. 49 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column173" />Column number: 173</div>clarifies that the disclosure of information for the purpose of
investigating an offence or suspected offence, or in connection with
legal proceedings, does not apply to identifying donor
information.</div>
<a name="080610108000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 50 removes wording from new section 33A consequential to the
replacement wording that is introduced by amendment No. 46. Amendment
No. 51 reflects the fact that the Bill introduces provisions for
fatherhood agreements for unmarried couples in which donor sperm is
used. Amendment No. 52 is consequential on amendment No. 45. Amendment
No. 53 defines what the term &#147;identifying donor
information&#148; means with regard to new section 33A(2), which is a
consequence of amendment No. 45. Amendment No. 54 applies in
conjunction with amendment No. 45.</div>
<a name="080610108000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">Therefore,
without going into any detail, I am trying to indicate to the hon.
Member for Boston and Skegness that we are cross-referencing and making
it absolutely clear that the exemptions fit together and do not breach
any of the principles. Overall, the Government amendments provide
clarification rather than a change of policy by continuing to strike
the balance between disclosure of identifying information, particularly
that which might be helpful for follow-up research into the health of
patients and their children, and ensuring that consent is properly and
rightly obtained.</div>
<a name="080610108000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">If I have
not covered any of the points, Mr. Hood, I would be happy to
catch your eye and return to them.</div>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column174" />Column number: 174</div>watching carefully throughout our proceedings to see whether the
individual views of scientists or others are available to all hon.
Member, in terms of the whole context of what they have given to
him.</div><a name="080610108000100"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610108000354"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I object to that. If the hon. Gentleman used the
term lobbyist as a smear, I object to it, and I object to the assertion
that when I and, for that matter, Lord Patel and Lord Turnberg meet any
scientist to express concerns about the Bill, we are somehow not doing
our job. It is reasonable to do that and we have been diverted in a
peculiar way, Mr. Hood. I am happy to hand the hon.
Gentleman a copy of the e-mail that was sent to me by Alison Murdoch
last
night.</div><a name="080610108000101"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610108000355"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will
get back to the
debate.</div><a name="080610108000102"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610108000356"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I am keen to do so, but I thought it was right to
defend the normal activities of Opposition Members. For 10 years I have
been meeting people who are concerned about legislation, and I will
continue to do so despite the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
admonitions.</div>
<a name="080610108000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to
make two points on the Government&#146;s provisions. Am I correct in
understanding that amendment No. 45 does two things, which are brought
together in one amendment because proposed new (h) follows on from
proposed new paragraph (g)? New paragraph (g) is an important amendment
because it makes it clear that the disclosure that would not be
permitted is where any individual can be identified from the
information, rather than a disclosure whereby no individual to whom the
information relates could be identified. That is a separate and helpful
amendment, and proposed new paragraph (h) is much more in keeping with
the rest of the amendments. They are simply brought together by a good
fortune of drafting, that (h) follows (g).</div>
<a name="080610108000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand
the Minister&#146;s specific point about getting general consent at
the beginning. I think that the problem is merely one of interpretation
by the HFEA, and what she said will be helpful. In normal clinical
practice, information is not divulged without consent; it is divulged
with implied consent. When people see a GP they do not have to sign
anything to say, &#147;You have my permission to send the information
on to a consultant&#148;, because when someone seeks a referral from
a GP, it is implied that that information will be transmitted. When the
medical or surgical team want to write to GPs to explain that someone
is in hospital and has received treatment, that is not done without
consent, because it is implied.</div>
<a name="080610108000105"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610108000357"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> I hope that the hon. Gentleman forgives me, but
I forgot to cover that point. I absolutely accept what he says about
data protection and general confidentiality, but I remind him that the
EU tissues and cell directive sets standards of safety and quality for
human tissue intended for human application, which includes areas that
we are discussing, and goes further than the Data Protection Act. When
I alluded to other legislation that would impinge on confidentiality, I
had not meant to be more specific than that. It explains why there is a
higher
hurdle.</div>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column175" />Column number: 175</div><a name="080610108000304"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.30
am</div><a name="080610108000106"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610108000358"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> The Minister has no need to apologise, because I
assumed that that was what she meant, and I was going to raise that in
my points at the beginning. I thought, given what she had said
previously, that I would not raise it in advance. I have a question
about it, so it is useful that she has raised
it.</div>
<a name="080610108000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">Coming back
to what I was saying, there is implied consent; treatment is not done
without consent. Because of the nature of this treatment, and because
of the complication of identifying donor information, there needs to be
a process. Otherwise relying on implied consent can lead people to fall
into traps of not knowing where the division goes. I understand the
reason why there is a need for an explicit or written consent. Consent
is a process, and written consent is a sign that there has been a
process and it is useful. However, there is a problem with
interpretation by the HFEA, because clinicians tell me&#151;I believe
that this is on the record in the House of Lords debates as
well&#151;that they are required, or feel that they are required, by
the HFEA, whether in their code of practice, in their inspection system
or by some other means, to get a consent form filled in for every
visit, every procedure and every test, even when the general consent
form has been filled in at the beginning.</div>
<a name="080610108000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">There may be
scope here not for legislation, but for it to be made clear to the
authority, which may feel that it is doing its job and playing safe,
that the requirements of the tissues and cells directive, 2004/23 EC,
particularly article 14, can be met by a written general consent at the
beginning, and that specific consent is unnecessary as long as patients
are made aware that they can at any point change the terms of that
consent. That should be straightforward to do, and specific requests
can be made for certain information not to be provided. I think that
requiring a form each time is
unnecessary.</div><a name="080610108000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am hoping that the Minister can assure me that the extra requirements
created by the directive would not prevent a general consent at the
beginning as long as the patient knows
that.</div><a name="080610108000110"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610108000359"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> I am happy to confirm that to the hon.
Gentleman. When we were discussing consent at the beginning of our
proceedings, we noted that discussions are taking place between the
Department and the HFEA, and the HFEA is considering the whole question
of consent, the exceptions, and how it is provided. That point might
have been raised by the hon. Gentleman. Some of the things that he is
saying now would need to be clarified within that discussion. The HFEA
would need to take forward those discussions and the support and advice
given to clinics.</div>
<a name="080610108000111"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610108000360"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> That is good news indeed. The Government
amendments are an improvement on the existing situation. Using the
Minister&#146;s words today&#151;I hope that I have got this
right&#151;a general, specific consent at the beginning does not have
to be augmented, although it can be resiled from at any point by a
patient; they must have the right to change their mind in respect of
future disclosures or for new
treatments.</div><a name="080610108000112"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610108000361"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> Just to put a qualification in there: of
course, that should be within the limitations of the 1990 Act. It is
about identifying and non-identifying information about the donor. For
example, the identifying 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column176" />Column number: 176</div>information cannot be made available until the child reaches 18; that
cannot be the case, and nobody can vary
that.</div><a name="080610108000113"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610108000362"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I completely accept that, and I have had no
representations from clinicians questioning the need for such clear
separation. They understood that part of being licensed was to
understand the sensitivity of that. I welcome the fact that there are
ongoing discussions and note that the Government amendments are an
improvement. It should be possible to reduce the pressure. The criminal
offence worries clinicians, and perhaps they are also playing safe. If
the HFEA could make it clear that if they fulfil certain
requirements&#151;particularly for patients who give the general
consent at the beginning that is not retracted at some point&#151;it
should be
reasonable.</div><a name="080610108000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
only other point to bear in mind is that there is a continuing concern
about the differentiation between licensed and non-licensed
individuals, licensed and non-licensed treatments, licensed clinics and
non-licensed premises. Some of that is inevitable. We cannot have a
licence and say that there should not be a difference. The fact that
one has to have a licence is because there is a difference, and that
creates a difference. The Minister should have a discussion with the
HFEA&#151;I emphasise that for the columns of
<i class="I">Hansard</i>&#151;about making sure that there is not what seems to
be an unfair burden on someone doing normal work who happens to be
licensed, or on someone doing work that could take place in an
unlicensed place, but who happens to have a licence because they do
other work. If it can be shown that they are not unfairly at risk, or
facing unfair or unreasonable burdens, people will welcome the progress
made, both in the legislation and in our
debates.</div><a name="080610108000115"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610108000363"></a>Mark
Simmonds:</b> I thank the Minister for her response to my
amendments and for her explanation of the Government
amendments.</div><a name="080610108000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
accept what the Minister says about amendment No. 37. The list is
clearly comprehensive and well thought through. It is correct that if
there are to be regulations, or there is a necessity for them, they are
subject to the affirmative procedure so that they have to be discussed
in Parliament. Everyone on the Committee wants to see the Bill, when it
becomes an Act, to last effectively at least as long as its
predecessor, the 1990 Act. That is the whole purpose, so regulations
can keep up to date with scientific advances as the years go
by.</div><a name="080610108000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
amendment No. 38, again I thank the Minister. I understand what she
says. It is right that there is general consent at the beginning of
treatment, within the limitations of the Act, but she seemed to suggest
that there was an ability for conditional consent&#151;for
information to be passed on. Her example was if the GP might be a
family member. Is the Minister saying that exclusions can be specified
on the consent form about whom is not able to receive that information,
or, as I suspected originally, will there be generic
consent?</div><a name="080610108000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the implied consent argument and the exchange that has just taken place
between the Minister and the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon,
it is quite right that there is a higher hurdle when we are talking
about such issues, as well as about human tissues. I am pleased that
there are ongoing discussions with the HFEA and licensed premises,
because I am 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column177" />Column number: 177</div>concerned, like the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon, about the
potential to put unreasonable bureaucratic burdens on licensed
premises. I hope that those ongoing discussions will facilitate such a
situation not
occurring.</div><a name="080610108000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">With
regard to the Government amendments, I have one question for the
Minister relating to amendment No. 54, which I am not clear about.
Proposed new subsection (3) of that amendment
reads:</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#147;Consent in respect of a
person who has not attained the age of 18
years&#148;&#151;</div><a name="080610108000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">referred
to in the amendment as
&#147;C&#148;&#151;</div><a name="080610108000289"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;may
be given...by C, in a case where C is competent to deal with the
issue of
consent&#148;.</div><a name="080610108000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
I read that correctly, that implies that someone below the age of 18
could give consent. How young could that person be to give consent?
Would they have to be above the age of 16 but below 18? Could they be
12? Could they be eight? There does not seem to be any clarification
elsewhere in the Bill or anywhere in the group of
amendments.</div><a name="080610108000122"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610108000364"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> The hon. Member for Boston and Skegness asked
about consent. What I described as general consent is the position that
all the consent works from for disclosure of information. The patient
is able to put exceptions into that. If the hon. Gentleman recalls the
exchange between myself and my right hon. Friend the Member for
Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill in last Thursday&#146;s sitting,
my right hon. Friend said that he might be prepared to give consent for
certain types of research, but that he would want to make exceptions in
other areas. We were talking about cases in which the donor was
deceased. However, that starts from a general consent in which patients
have the option to put in exceptions.</div>
<a name="080610108000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although we
are talking about general consent, patients should have the ability to
make explicit exceptions to their consent for the disclosure of that
information if those exceptions are not overridden by any of the other
exceptions. It would be much too complex to have the two consents
working in different ways against different principles. I understand
that matters would proceed in very much the same way, but it is crucial
that the HFEA examines the issue very carefully when it takes on new
considerations of consent. There will clearly be active discussion of
those particular considerations with stakeholders and the individuals
and organisations that have made representations on this part of the
Bill. I hope that I have made clear how the process will
operate.</div><a name="080610108000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
other question that the hon. Member for Boston and Skegness asked was
how old a person needed to be for the purposes of consent. The system
does not work on the basis of age, but on whether an individual has
sufficient understanding of the implications of the decision. That is
obviously a fine judgment that needs to be made. I do not think that we
can take that away from clinicians because individuals vary in their
understanding. That is why there is not a specific age. I do not think
that that is at odds with how we test competency elsewhere. Everybody
has to be satisfied that an individual understands the
implications.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column178" />Column number: 178</div><a name="080610108000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon asked me a question about
Government amendment No. 45, and I think that I answered it. The
amendment specifically ensures that the provisions cannot be used to
require the HFEA to disclose identifying information about donors for
which specific provision is made elsewhere in the 1990 Act and the
Bill. The amendment is constraining in that it reflects the wish to
keep the measure very tight to the specific purpose. It was a result of
clarification and tidying up following the very extensive debate on
these measures that was held in another
place.</div><a name="080610108000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
think that I have answered all of the questions that I was asked. If I
have not, the hon. Gentleman needs to say now. I hope that the
Committee will support the Government amendments, which I shall move
formally at the appropriate
time.</div><a name="080610108000127"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610108000366"></a>Mark
Simmonds:</b> There may be a logical reason for it, but why is
such a clause placed at this part of the Bill and not sequential to
clause 3, because that was when we discussed mitochondrial donors? It
does not seem to fit
here.</div><a name="080610108000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to ensure that I, as well as other members of the Committee,
understand the clause correctly. It deals with proposed new sections
31ZA to 31ZE. Will the Minister confirm that that means that the
offspring has the right to find out about the mitochondrial donor and
the donor&#146;s children? Does the mitochondrial donor have the
right to find out about the ensuing offspring, despite the fact that
only 0.5 per cent. of their genetic material is in the child and does
not have any defining characteristics
whatever?</div><a name="080610108000143"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610108000367"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> I can answer the second question; I do not know
about the first. The hon. Gentleman might recall that we had an
extensive discussion on the right to know and information about
mitochondrial donations. The hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon
asked whether there would really be a need for the mitochondrial donor
to be identified. We agreed at the time that, because regulations are
connected with such information, such issues were exactly the type that
would need to be consulted on, and that the regulations would need to
be seen in draft.</div>
<a name="080610108000144"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610108000368"></a>Mark
Simmonds:</b> I have a clear recollection of that discussion,
but my reading of the Bill is that proposed sections 31ZA to 31ZE give
the offspring the right to find out about the mitochondrial donor and
the donor&#146;s children. The Minister is suggesting that that is
not the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column180" />Column number: 180</div>case and that, subject to consultation, such matters will be dealt with
in subsequent regulations. I accept that I might have misinterpreted
the Bill, but I should be grateful if she could clarify
matters.</div><a name="080610108000145"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610108000369"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> I can clarify that that is the case. The
regulations deal with that entire part, so it will be possible to take
it forward. The requirement is not
linked.</div><a name="080610108000146"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610108000370"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> Proposed new section 35A(1) states that
regulations</div><a name="080610108000290"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;may
provide for any of the relevant
provisions&#148;,</div><a name="080610108000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">and
the hon. Gentleman has described some of the provisions. As I have
said, I am dubious whether a system needs to be set up for a healthy
child who has no relevant genetic parentage&#151;in my
opinion&#151;to be invited to consult a register and so on. Arguably,
it is part of the private medical history of the parent even though it
impacts on the child, but children do not have the right to know that
their mothers had tubal surgery, for example. Such matters will need to

Primarolo:</b> I absolutely agree. When the hon. Gentleman
made that point, with justifications that he felt supported that view
on access to information, he put it clearly. At the time I also said
that in my view&#151;this is certainly provided for as regards
regulations&#151;the issue is a matter for debate and consultation,
which would need to take place before the regulations are drafted.
There would then be consultation on the draft regulations before they
went through the affirmative procedure in both Houses.</div>
<a name="080610108000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">The measure
appears where it does in the Bill because it contains regulation-making
powers, and they tend to be placed at the back of an Act, in relation
to the points that they connect to, so it is about drafting
legislation. I say in all honesty to the hon. Member for Boston and
Skegness that that is the advice from advisers, parliamentary counsel
and all those who regularly write legislation. I tend to worry about
the bigger issues of principle, rather than the consequential
sequencing of the clauses. I hope he accepts that.</div>

Simmonds:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 155, in
clause 27, page 31, line 13, leave
out &#145;revocation
or&#146;.</div><a name="080610108000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
is a probing amendment to elicit from the Minister an explanation of
why the authority has the power to charge for a revocation of a
licence, and what happens in circumstances where the licensee who has
had his or her licence revoked refuses to pay, or their business is
wound up and no longer exists. Is it right that the licence is revoked
at the discretion of the authority and that therefore the licensee is
charged&#151;the authority can both revoke the licence and make a
charge&#151;particularly since the Bill does not state that the
charge may only cover costs and not generate revenue for the
authority?</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610108000373"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> The hon. Gentleman raised points earlier about
the responsible person if a licence were revoked or a request to revoke
a licence were made by the clinic. He made specific reference to the
provisions for patients who might already be having treatment, and to
ensuring that the storage of embryos, material and information is done
in the proper way. I made it clear to him that those matters were
requirements of the licence. The payment of the fee is to ensure that
those arrangements can be made, and it may be that it is transferred to
another clinic for treatment, for instance, or for
maintenance.</div>
<a name="080610108000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
circumstances for a clinic that was closing down and submitted that it
wished to have its licence revoked would be rather different to cases
where the HFEA was revoking a licence for its own reasons, but none the
less, administrative expenses would occur both for the HFEA and for
patients going to other areas. It is not about income generation for
the HFEA. As was said in our earlier discussion about fees charged by
the HFEA, it may charge a fee, but it does not have to do so. Specific
provision is not made in the Bill for such charges, but it is envisaged
that they would be covered, because there would be consequential
expenses. I assure the hon. Gentleman that it is not about income
generation for the authority. I hope that that covers his
questions.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610108000374"></a>Mark
Simmonds:</b> I am grateful for the Minister&#146;s
clarification that total revocation of the licence and charges related
to that are not temporarily&#151;essentially&#151;income
generating. Has any thought been given to a charge that might have been
made to a licence holder who has had the licence revoked and who
refuses to pay? Would that bar, for example, somebody from getting a
licence in the future?</div>
<a name="080610108000157"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610108000375"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> That would clearly reflect on the responsible
person, and whether they were responsible enough to have a future
licence, bearing in mind how they discharged their responsibilities for
a licence that they no longer have. Either they revoked it themselves
by wishing to withdraw from the licence, or the HFEA revoked it because
of breach of licence. It comes back to that debate about responsible
people.</div><a name="080610108000158"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610108000376"></a>Mark

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610108000379"></a>Mark
Simmonds:</b> The amendments relate again to the fees that the
HFEA can charge. I will detail what they would do, and then I want to
talk a little more, if I may, Mr. Hood, and ask the Minister
to provide information about the charging structure and the
HFEA&#146;s fees.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column182" />Column number: 182</div><a name="080610108000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill as
drafted allows for the fees to be fixed by the authority with the
approval of the Secretary of State and the Treasury. Amendment No. 156
would ensure that the fee is fixed in Parliament through regulations,
which would go some way to ensuring that the fee is fair and
proportionate and would not necessarily be passed on disproportionately
to the patients by the clinics. The Minister will be aware of the
enormous concern about that within both main political
parties.</div><a name="080610108000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
amendment No. 157, the Bill as drafted says that any fee charged for
the provision of information about genetic offspring, siblings or a
potential partner, may have regard to the costs incurred, which clearly
also implies that it may not have regard to the costs incurred. The
amendment would change that &#147;may&#148; to
&#147;must&#148;, which would therefore mean that fee charging must
not be a revenue-raising exercise. I was grateful for the
Minister&#146;s confirmation that the fees charged for the revocation
of a licence would not be a revenue-raising exercise and that the
charges must be in direct proportion to the costs incurred in providing
that information. The amendment would ensure that the fee charged is
proportionate to the costs incurred in obtaining and providing that
information.</div><a name="080610108000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">With

Key</b> (Salisbury) (Con): It is a pleasure to serve under
your chairmanship, Mr. Hood. I support amendment No. 156,
and if this Bill is sublime, then I should like to introduce the
Committee to the ridiculous. First, I want to consider the principle
behind the charging
regime.</div><a name="080610108000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">Several
years ago, on behalf of a constituent, I challenged the HFEA on the
fees that it was charging for in vitro fertilisation treatment, and I
was told that the Treasury insists on the fees being charged. Indeed,
clause 27 inserts proposed new section 35B(2), which, as my hon. Friend
said, gives the Treasury the final word on these fees.</div>
<a name="080610108000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Treasury
does not object to NHS dentists charging for certain procedures and
contraptions, and it seems that it does not object to NHS eye tests
that result in contact lenses being purchased by patients. On the other
hand, the NHS does not allow people to buy drugs that have not been
approved for NHS use by the National Institute for Health and Clinical
Excellence. It says&#151;entirely out of spite, it seems&#151;that
the whole course of treatment might be jeopardised if additional drugs
are purchased. The Department of Health therefore seems to be in a
complete muddle about charging
structures.</div>

noon</div><a name="080610108000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
my second point, proposed new section 35B(5)
says:</div><a name="080610108000291"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
Authority may have regard to the costs incurred&#148;.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column183" />Column number: 183</div><a name="080610108000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is often said that
this is all about legal fees, which might be huge. However, if legal
fees are incurred in the health service&#151;for example because an
orthopaedic procedure goes wrong and results in litigation&#151;the
hospital or department concerned does not have to pay the legal costs
involved in meeting that challenge. How, therefore, can it be justified
to reflect legal costs in the fees charged to clients and patients
under the HFEA regime?</div>
<a name="080610108000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">Proposed new
section 35B(6) says that the HFEA</div>

different fees for different
circumstances.&#148;</div><a name="080610108000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will
the Minister clarify that? Does that mean that the authority can charge
different fees for the same HFEA functions under different
circumstances? If so, who will make the decision? What will the
criteria be? Will the Minister give us examples of what is meant by new
section
35B(6)?</div><a name="080610108000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">How
are our constituents affected by this regime? The cost of each IVF

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610108000383"></a>The

a wee bit away from the amendment. Again, the issue could be raised in
the clause stand part debate, not on this group of
amendments.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610108000384"></a>Robert

proceed?</div><a name="080610108000178"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610108000385"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. I tell the hon. Gentleman that clause 6
is not being amended, but he is speaking to it as if it
is.</div>
<a name="080610108000179"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610108000386"></a>Robert

156 to clause 27, which was moved by my hon. Friend the Member for
Boston and Skegness.</div>
<a name="080610108000180"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610108000387"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. My guidance to the hon. Gentleman is to
look to the clause stand part debate and to speak specifically to the
amendment. That is in line with my earlier advice to the hon. Member
for Boston and Skegness.</div>
<a name="080610108000181"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610108000388"></a>Robert
Key:</b> Of course, I accept your ruling, Mr. Hood.
If I may, I will speak to clause 27, page 31, line 26&#151;to
amendment No. 156.</div>
<a name="080610108000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the fees
that are charged for cycles, NHS trusts will not pay for frozen cycles,
and I wonder who made that ruling. An application for a separate
licence must be made for each and every cycle, and that must be granted
by the HFEA. The authority charges &#163;104.50 per licence. That
means that the Salisbury fertility clinic, which treats about 200
patients a year with fresh or frozen cycles, pays about &#163;200,000
a year in fees. There are more than 100 IVF clinics in the UK, so our
constituents pay about &#163;2 million a
year.</div>
<a name="080610108000183"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610108000389"></a>Mark
Simmonds:</b> It might help my hon. Friend if I give him the
exact figures. In the 2006-07 financial year, HFEA income was
&#163;6.7 million, of which grant aid&#151;I assume that it came
from the Department of Health&#151;was &#163;1.95 million. That
means that the authority got &#163;4.8 million in fee
income from our constituents.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column184" />Column number: 184</div><a name="080610108000184"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610108000390"></a>Robert
Key:</b> That is absolutely right. The IVF cycles paid for by
our constituents represent a significant proportion of that
income.</div>
<a name="080610108000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
proportion of private and NHS patients being charged is about half and
half. In half the cases, therefore, the HFEA fee is paid by the
patients, while in the other half, it is paid by the primary care
trusts. However, the primary care trusts are simply transferring money
from one part of the NHS to the other, with all the concomitant
bureaucracy involved in the procedure. That, in itself, must cost a
substantial
amount.</div><a name="080610108000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is another unfairness for our constituents in the charging structure.
If, in an IVF cycle, there were some spare gametes for a patient, some
of them would routinely be frozen in case they were needed in the event
of failure. If the fresh cycle fails, believe it or not a new licence
costing another &#163;104.50 has to be applied for and
granted&#151;for the same gametes. The patient is therefore paying
twice yet the clinic incurs no extra cost, apart from the cost of the
storage of spare gametes. How can the whole bureaucracy and fee
structure be justified for what is now a routine
procedure?</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610108000391"></a>Mark
Simmonds:</b> Is my hon. Friend aware that financial
implications arise from the Bill? He has suggested that the
expectations of increased expenditure by the HFEA will be met not by
additional resources from the Department of Health, but only by
additional fees being
charged.</div><a name="080610108000188"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610108000392"></a>Robert

again into the personal lives of our constituents. I entirely support
my hon. Friend&#146;s amendment. On behalf of our constituents, it
should be Parliament, not the Treasury, that decides whether the

justified.</div><a name="080610108000189"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610108000396"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> It is a little strange that Conservative
Members wanted the regulation that was accepted when the 1990
legislation went through under their Government, whereby there should
be a fee structure to recoup the costs of the regulation, yet they now
consider that that principle should be broken in respect of what the
fees are charged for and how they are arrived
at.</div><a name="080610108000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 156 would provide for the fees to be set out in regulations to be
approved by both Houses. The HFEA undertakes consultation on its fee
scheme and levels involving the public and stakeholders. That is
similar to provisions under the 1990 Act. The Bill provides that the
HFEA can set its fees in accordance with the scheme approved by the
Secretary of State and the Treasury, and I see no reason to change
that. At present, the HFEA makes a recommendation, having discussed
with stakeholders what they believe the fee levels should be. A review
is undertaken every two years, and it is not the case that fees always
increase.</div><a name="080610108000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
is not about the Treasury saying what will be charged, but the HFEA
asking for endorsement. That ties in with the fact that the HFEA is a
quasi-independent body. We made the important decision recommended by
the Warnock report so that matters relating to the function of the
authority, including how it carries out 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column185" />Column number: 185</div>its functions in respect of fees, are properly the business of the
authority to determine and justify. That was where the authority was in
1990. That was recommended in the discussions on the independence of
the HFEA in discharging its regulatory functions as determined by
Parliament, and the fees are about recouping its
costs.</div><a name="080610108000195"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610108000397"></a>Robert

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610108000398"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> I am happy to give way. I will answer in detail
the points that the hon. Gentleman has already made. I accept that he
has changed his mind since 1990, but the Government have
not.</div><a name="080610108000197"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610108000399"></a>Robert
Key:</b> Eighteen years ago, when the Minister and I were
fresh young things on the Standing Committee that considered the 1990
Bill, the HFEA was a new institution and nobody knew how much it would
cost to run. The procedures for IVF were novel and nobody knew how they
would be taken up or what that would cost the NHS. Caution, therefore,
was entirely sensible. The point that I have already made, which the
Minister has failed to acknowledge, is that these are now routine
procedures and routine parts of NHS performance, and that we need to
change our minds. Parliament needs to change its mind. We no longer
insist on people walking in front of cars with red flags, and we should
not insist on this charging
regime.</div>
<a name="080610108000198"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610108000400"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. That was a rather long
intervention.</div><a name="080610108000199"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610108000401"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> I understand the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point.
We continue to regulate the system. Some argue that there should be no
regulation on IVF because it is so mainstream. They say that we should
not have the regulation that is provided in the Bill and that the
matter should be removed entirely from the auspices of the HFEA.
However, that is not the view endorsed by Parliament, nor is it the
view of the Government. The HFEA&#146;s independence would be eroded
and undermined by the amendment, yet it has to have independence. The
other question is where we would draw the line on the HFEA&#146;s
independence. Would we allow it to determine its own procedures for
using its regulation powers, regulating according to the wishes of
Parliament, and the costs for that? It may also be considered that
removing from the authority the responsibility for setting such
procedures will work against better regulation. We need to ensure that
the authority has an incentive to reduce the regulatory burden and
improve its procedures, that it regulates according to the wishes of
Parliament and that it does so in dialogue with its stakeholders, and
takes into consideration what they think. The first implication of
amendment No. 156 is that it should not be the function of the HFEA to
set its own fees. That is something with which the Government and I do
not agree. It is appropriate that the HFEA seeks to recoup the cost of
regulating
clinics.</div><a name="080610108000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">Other
costs that the HFEA might incur, such as legal fees, are met by the
Department as part of the HFEA&#146;s grant. Members of this
Committee and of the House expect the Government to be concerned to
ensure that the HFEA is fulfilling its functions in an efficient and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column186" />Column number: 186</div>cost-effective way. That would always be part of the discussions about
the rest of the running, not the regulation of the licences.</div>
<a name="080610108000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hear what
the hon. Member for Salisbury says about the level of fees, but I think
that that is a separate issue. It is entirely appropriate that the HFEA
intends to review its fee structure as part of the major project to
consider how it operates and how it is undertaking its role. It must
take into consideration the implications of the Bill, when it is
approved by Parliament, and reflect on the points made by the hon.
Member for Salisbury&#151;whether it is timely to revisit when fees
are applied, at what level and for what
purpose.</div><a name="080610108000307"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.15
pm</div><a name="080610108000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
remind the Committee that the fees are paid by clinics and research
centres towards the HFEA&#146;s operating costs, including the
continuing work to improve and strengthen regulation. The fees cover,
for example, the cost of licensing and inspecting clinics to ensure
that they are complying with the HFEA code. The authority reviews its
fees annually and makes a recommendation to the Secretary of State, who
agrees them. They are approved by the Treasury as well. As I said, they
are not increased every
year.</div><a name="080610108000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
current fees were referred to by the hon. Member for Salisbury, so I do
not need to touch on them. The fees paid for costs depend on the type
of treatment carried out or the complexity of the research, but, as I
said, the HFEA is reviewing its fee structure. It is important that
there is transparency on the level of the fees, why they are set at
those levels, the costs that they are intended to cover, and that
everyone understands that clearly. I do not accept that amendment No.
156 would improve how fees are set or take us any further forward. In
fact, it would be in danger of questioning the independence of the
HFEA.</div><a name="080610108000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 157 relates to the authority&#146;s ability to charge a fee to
people making an application for information from the register or for
providing the information. Clause 27 is intended to enable the HFEA
only to cover the costs of doing so and, as I have said repeatedly when
the question of HFEA fees has been raised in Committee, it is not about
income generation. The effect of amendment No. 157 would be that the
authority &#147;must&#148;, rather than &#147;may&#148;, have
regard to the costs incurred by it when dealing with an application or
the provision of information about genetic parentage. On a
straightforward technical point, the use of &#147;may&#148; is
common in legal drafting and is appropriate in cases in which there is
no obligation. That is clearly the point that we are trying to get
across. The HFEA does not necessarily have to charge a fee for requests
for such information as are proposed, and therefore &#147;may&#148;
is entirely appropriate in such
circumstances.</div><a name="080610108000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">While
I understand the points made by the hon. Members for Boston and
Skegness and for Salisbury, and the force with they are making them, I
hope that they agree that a more sensible way to proceed would be to
allow the HFEA to continue to be accountable, to review its fees, to be
in discussion with its stakeholders and then to make recommendations to
the Secretary of State and the Treasury for approval, once those
increases, decreases or no increase are decided. If the authority does
that annually, it is entirely appropriate for that to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column187" />Column number: 187</div>continue. If the hon. Member for Boston and Skegness feels that he needs
to press his amendment to a Division on that principle, I will ask my
hon. Friends to resist
it.</div><a name="080610108000206"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610108000402"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> Since there may well be a vote on the amendment, I
ought to say one or two paragraphs on it. The Minister is absolutely
right that if we believe that IVF has to be regulated, there must be
fees to pay for it&#151;that is if we agree that the regulator should
be funded at least partly by the people whom it regulates, which is a
common model.</div>
<a name="080610108000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have long
argued a point that I think the Select Committee report of 2005 made:
now that we are 15 years on from the halcyon days of the fresh youth
described by the hon. Member for Salisbury&#151;perhaps others might
argue that he and the Minister are still both fresh young
things&#151;IVF is just as routine, after the initial concerns about
safety, as some unlicensed treatments involving drugs and surgery.
Although there is an ongoing requirement of registration for the
purposes of donor information and so on, I hope that it will be
accepted that there is an argument for deregulation. That does not mean
that there does not need to be quality assurance by the Healthcare
Commission, involvement by the General Medical Council, or even close
scrutiny of claimed success rates, because IVF is relevant to a
particularly desperate population. However, should that mean licensing
every routine IVF cycle? No, although I would still argue that some of
the newer approaches should be licensed and that there should be no
diminution of the regulation of
research.</div><a name="080610108000208"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610108000403"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> The hon. Gentleman is making a respectable case
for having no regulation. I do not happen to agree with him, but surely
the hon. Members for Boston and Skegness and for Salisbury need to
address the point that the principle of regulation is that its costs
are recouped from those who are regulated. That has been an absolute
principle of all the relevant legislation since 1990. Not liking the
fees is one thing, but a case has not been made for why we should
deviate from the principle of
regulation.</div><a name="080610108000209"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610108000404"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I made that point at the beginning. If we believe
that IVF should be regulated, we must have a way of paying for it. I am
making the point that it should be deregulated. However, given that
there is regulation, and that the Select Committee did not win the
argument on that point, the Government&#146;s structure is a
reasonable approach. That is the only reason why I do not plan to
support the amendment. A better approach would be to deregulate.
Although there will, of course, be sensitive issues and a need for
special provisions when we discuss the next Bill, I hope that this
medical treatment, which is now routine and, as far as we know,
safe&#151;no less safe than many other medical treatments&#151;will
be
deregulated.</div><a name="080610108000210"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610108000405"></a>Mark
Simmonds:</b> I am delighted that the amendments have
stimulated such a detailed and comprehensive discussion. As my hon.
Friend the Member for Salisbury said, there is concern about the issue
and the possibility of fees being charged that will impinge on all our
constituents.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column188" />Column number: 188</div><a name="080610108000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">The point of
amendment No. 156 is not to remove the independence of the HFEA but to
ensure that there is sufficient scrutiny by those who represent
constituents, on whom the level of fees will have an impact. The
Minister is not correct to say&#151;I may have misheard
her&#151;that all HFEA income is recouped through recharging. It is
not. There is a grant aid system, which pays some of the cost. There is
no doubt that the Bill has the potential to increase the HFEA&#146;s
level of activity and its size. My understanding is that there is no
proposal to increase the grant aid from the Department of Health, so
the additional income will come from the charging of additional
fees.</div><a name="080610108000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of
course, I acknowledge that while the Minister is in situ, she will
consult the Secretary of State and the Treasury and will not allow the
fees to be a revenue-generating exercise, but that may not always be
the case. If I were a Minister rather than a shadow Minister, I would
ensure that they only covered the costs rather than raised revenue. We
must ensure that that happens as part of the Bill, because the 1990
Act, which we are amending, has been in place for 18 years, and we hope
that this Bill will be as well. I do not think that the HFEA would have
a rigorous and detailed charging regime imposed on it by Parliament,
but is right that the HFEA should come to Parliament to justify its
fees and the impact that they would
have.</div><a name="080610108000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
I withdrew the amendment, it would be with some reluctance, so I am not
going to do so.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610108000422"></a>Mark

amendment No. 157 formally?</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610108000424"></a>Mark
Simmonds:</b> I do not wish to detain the Committee by getting
the Minister to tell us verbally what the answers are, but it would
help if she could furnish the Committee with the relevant information.
Clearly, as we have said, there is concern about the HFEA charging
regime and how it might grow. I imagine that people in the HFEA have
done projections for the next three years about how they imagine the
fee income will grow, how they imagine their expenditure and cost base
will 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column189" />Column number: 189</div>expand, and what those additional costs and expenditures will be spent
on. Will the Minister put that information in the public domain,
because financial implications clearly arise from the changes proposed
in the Bill&#151;particularly if birth registration is changed. As
the HFEA grows in its remit, the expectation is that increasing
expenditure will be met by fee income. It would be helpful if the
Minister could write a letter to members of the Committee or place
something in the House of Commons Library on that matter. Doing so
would ensure that both the Committee and the wider public have detailed
financial information about the proposals on the financing of the
HFEA.</div><a name="080610108000238"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610108000425"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> I am not quite sure how I can help the hon.
Gentleman any further than I already have. The agreements in terms of
finances for the HFEA are subject to public scrutiny through the
information that it provides. I have said that the HFEA will consult on
the level of fees. In addition, the Department would expect the
enactment of the Bill to result in the HFEA reflecting on its future
requirements and submitting a business case to us on the additional
grant aid it might need to deal with the Bill&#146;s implications. A
letter would say no more than that until the Government are in a
position to say more publicly, because all these matters are about to
be consulted on. The fees and the future liabilities will need to be
considered in the context of the Bill, which is not yet an
Act.</div><a name="080610108000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hear what the hon. Gentleman is saying and I will keep him informed of
developments once the Bill is enacted. Until then, I am not able to say
a great deal more because the HFEA will have to reflect on the
matter.</div><a name="080610108000240"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610108000426"></a>Mark
Simmonds:</b> Will the Minister help the Committee by saying
how many times the powers of entry, search and seizure under warrant
have been used between 1990 and the present time, and how many times
they have resulted in prosecutions, if any? I think that the powers
were granted under section 38 of the 1990
Act.</div><a name="080610108000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
understanding is that the clause allows for members of the authority to
be in possession of embryos, gametes or human admixed embryos in the
course of their employment. I just wondered what that means. Does it
mean that members of the authority are allowed to seize embryos,
gametes or human admixed embryos from licensed premises as part of
their employment or that they can hold them separately in a different
function? Will the Minister also confirm that this is only the case if
the cells have been seized?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column190" />Column number: 190</div><a name="080610108000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">It would also
be helpful if the Minister explained, in the context of the clause, the
procedure for informing donors and owners of these embryos and gametes
that they have been seized, and if she described the methods and places
for their storage to prevent degeneration and loss. As well as seizing
property, gametes and embryos from licensed premises, can the authority
take control of a facility where it believes somebody has broken the
clauses of the
licence?</div><a name="080610108000246"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610108000427"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I want to raise the unfortunate recent case of Dr.
Taranissi&#146;s clinic and the HFEA. My understanding of the clause
and new schedule 3B is that this is a significant move. It must be done
carefully and not carelessly. In the Taranissi case, the appropriate
steps were not taken when a sudden inspection entry involving search
and seizure took place. It was unfortunate that it happened with
television cameras from &#147;Panorama&#148; present down the
street.</div><a name="080610108000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am sure the Minister would agree that the clause covers a serious
business and that inspections should not be carried out for the implied
benefit of the media. The HFEA, which gets a lot of unfair criticism,
should not be using its powers to have a public relations exercise to
show &#147;Panorama&#148;, the BBC or any other broadcaster or
media that it is being tough. The powers that it has speak for
themselves. Implemented responsibly, they can do the job. I hope that
the Committee agrees that there should be no repetition of that media
circus in these matters. The HFEA was in court and had to settle a
significant sum of money at the public expense for using the powers
inappropriately.</div><a name="080610108000248"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610108000428"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> Two sets of questions have been raised. The
hon. Gentleman raised the Taranissi case and whether the current powers
are being used correctly. The hon. Member for Boston and Skegness asked
for clarification.</div>
<a name="080610108000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
clearly not appropriate for me to comment on the case to which the hon.
Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon referred. He speculates&#151;I
put it delicately&#151;as have others, as to whether the powers of
the HFEA, which I think he accepts are appropriate in the
circumstances, were used appropriately in that case. That continues to
be debated. The hon. Gentleman does not raise questions about the
inappropriateness of the 1990 Act, as amended by this Bill, but he does
raise issues that the HFEA needs to reflect on. The HFEA is following
these proceedings carefully, and I am sure that it will note the points
raised.</div><a name="080610108000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
requirement to inspect licensed premises at least every two years was
set out in regulations under a European Union directive. Previously,
the 1990 Act had provided for inspection every year, although that
requirement could be waived by a licence committee, if the authority
considered an inspection in that year to be unnecessary. All this
clause does is bring those requirements for inspection, entry, search
and seizure in line with the changes that the Bill makes regarding
electronic records. It means that there is a regulating power to ensure
that the legislation is future-proof. That power will enable the
Secretary of State to specify what information should be contained in
the appropriate statement given to a person on the premises during the
execution of a warrant. The requirements and what actually happens are
not being varied from the principle.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column191" />Column number: 191</div><a name="080610108000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Boston and Skegness asked for details of specific seizures
or cases&#151;how many times and where. I cannot remember what time
period he asked about. I am afraid that I will have to write to the
Committee with those statistics, as I do not have them to hand. He then
asked what the possession of gametes means. It means that in the course
of duty, HFEA staff could seize embryos but would not be exempt from
needing a licence in other circumstances. As I tried to explain, we are
bringing the new provisions in line with the existing
framework.</div><a name="080610108000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon raised questions on a
particular case, and while it is entirely inappropriate for me to
comment on it, I will perhaps see, having consulted the HFEA, whether I
can put in writing to the Committee something helpful with regard to
the interpretation of its
powers.</div><a name="080610108000253"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610108000429"></a>Mark
Simmonds:</b> I have a couple of questions about the schedule,
which provides detail on inspection, entry, search and seizure. First,
are the premises searched and the dates on which they are searched
publicised? Is it public information? Is compensation paid if search
and seizure has taken place but there was no prosecution or variation
in licence? That is one reason why I asked a little earlier&#151;a
question that the Minister could not today answer&#151;how many
seizures have taken place since the 1990 Act came into
force.</div><a name="080610108000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
how much notice, if any, needs to be given for entry under the
schedule, or is it merely random, with those doing the inspection
turning up as and when they see fit? Indeed, it may be sensible for
someone to be there to demonstrate that there is nothing wrong or
untoward with the licence.</div>
<a name="080610108000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">If my
understanding is correct, provisions in earlier parts of the Bill allow
third parties to be contracted by the HFEA to enter and inspect
premises under the schedule. Will permission need to be granted by the
authority for those arm&#146;s length bodies to undertake that work
in individual cases, or will it be a block contract, with the bodies
inspecting on behalf of the HFEA acting on their own
discretion?</div>
<a name="080610108000259"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
answered my question about two years, but I want clarification of a
further matter in relation to paragraph 7(1)(a) to proposed schedule 3B
about seizure in the course of inspection. I am puzzled as to why the
HFEA or a body acting on its behalf would want seize anything when
granting a licence or varying a licence at the request of a person who
already has one. I understand why seizure might be applicable in
revocation or suspension cases, particularly if it is to be used for
evidence for the proceedings detailed in paragraph 7(2) to proposed
schedule 3B.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column192" />Column number: 192</div><a name="080610108000260"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610108000430"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> We covered the question of qualified inspectors
not directly employed by the HFEA in a previous debate, and what they
would inspect&#151;the laboratories and equipment, rather than some
of the other issues. It would be necessary for that person to be a
qualified inspector.</div>
<a name="080610108000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">As for
periods of inspection and notice of inspection, I do not have
information to hand on that; it operates at present, and as far as I
know we have not had any problems. However, if the evidence justifies
it, we need to allow for spot inspections. I shall need to include that
in the letter that I have written to the hon. Gentleman; it will be a
subset. He asked whether details of seizures will be made
public&#151;perhaps on the HFEA website&#151;and if there is no
such obligation, why not. There may be some caveats, so I shall
certainly write to him on that.</div>
<a name="080610108000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">The last
point raised by the hon. Gentleman was about compensation when a search
has taken place. No provision has been made for compensation. The whole
point is that those making inspections and seizures under the 1990 Act
should act reasonably. That means within a certain time, and it also
requires a reason for the inspection. All that would have to be
demonstrated, and I will put that into the letter
too.</div>
<a name="080610108000309"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.45
pm</div><a name="080610108000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
regime has worked well. The hon. Gentleman will need to be satisfied
when I give him the details of how many revocations there have been and
how many inspections have resulted in revocation, but I say to him that
the whole point of the regime is that it does not need to be used often
and in the period since 1990&#151;apart from the required
inspections&#151;those spot inspections or seizures have not been
used often. I hope that I will be able to reassure him and other
members of the Committee on that in
writing.</div>
<a name="080610108000264"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610108000431"></a>Mark
Simmonds:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for that answer.
Perhaps she could add to that list of paragraphs in the letter that she
is going to write a brief explanation of the last point that I made
regarding paragraph 7(1)(a). In other words, why is it necessary to
have as grounds for the seizure the purposes of the authority&#146;s
functions relating to the granting or variation of a licence, which
would include the variation of a licence at the behest of a licensee? I
cannot think of any situation where anything would be seized in those
circumstances.</div>

under the 1990

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610108000433"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 173, in
clause 29, page 33, line 20, at
end insert&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(10B) It is a
defence for a person (&#147;the defendant&#148;) charged with an
offence of doing anything which, under section 3(1) or (1A), 4(1)(a) or
4A(2), cannot be done other than in pursuance of a licence, to prove
that at the material time the defendant believed on reasonable grounds
that what they did was not something to which the Act
applied.&#146;.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column193" />Column number: 193</div><a name="080610108000269"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
amendment, which deals with a potential new defence under the clause,
is a probing one that tries to clarify what will happen in the new
situation. The problem is caused by the new definition of an embryo,
which clearly has been decided already during the procedure and has
been debated in this Committee. It is now accepted that that issue will
not be re-opened, and that an embryo is as defined at the beginning of
the Bill, in clause 1. It must be recognised that that is a new
definition that, from enactment, will capture issues that are not
currently captured, and which are therefore not subject to regulation
and do not require licences. As a consequence, the criminal law will be
brought into new areas.</div>
<a name="080610108000270"></a><div class="hs_Para">That creates
a new problem: due to the nature of science, it is not entirely clear
when something might be defined as an embryo under the Bill. We touched
on that problem when we debated the clause in question, and following
an exchange that I had with the Minister, it was covered in a letter
that was sent to you, Mr. Hood, your co-Chairman and members
of the Committee. That letter makes it clear that there is, as far as
researchers are concerned, a particular problem.</div>
<a name="080610108000271"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall set
out briefly the problem that might require defence. I draw attention to
the fact that it was first raised in the House of Lords, following
representations made in a briefing to all relevant peers by the Academy
of Medical Sciences, the Medical Research Council, the Law Society, the
Wellcome Trust and the Association of Medical Research Charities. That
briefing set out the problem in relation to the amendment, which I have
re-tabled to try to take the debate on. The briefing
states:</div><a name="080610108000293"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Embryos
are broadly defined under the Bill to include &#145;an egg that is in
the process of fertilisation or is undergoing any other process capable
of resulting in an embryo&#146;. Gametes are also broadly defined to
include germ line cells at any stage of maturity. Our
understanding&#148;&#151;</div><a name="080610108000272"></a><div class="hs_Para">that
is, the scientists&#146; or science&#146;s
understanding&#151;</div><a name="080610108000294"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;of
the processes by which eggs develop into embryos and cells develop into
germ line cells is incomplete. It is therefore possible that a
researcher could store or carry out research on cells that are not
currently known to be or destined to become germ line cells, or could
carry out research on eggs that are (unknown to current science)
capable of resulting in an
embryo.&#148;</div><a name="080610108000273"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
argument&#151;the thrust of the amendment&#151;is that it should be
a defence for a researcher if they can prove that they reasonably
believed that what they stored or were creating was not a gamete,
embryo or interspecies embryo as defined in the Bill. Of course, the
researcher would have to cease their activity, seek a licence or
destroy the material as soon as it became reasonably clear that that
was
necessary.</div><a name="080610108000274"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is an analogous defence in the Human Tissue Act 2004, which the
Minister in the other place mentioned in the debate on the amendment.
She
said:</div><a name="080610108000295"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
noble Lord, Lord Patel, said that the Human Tissue Act had a similar
defence and asked why it was not appropriate for the Human
Fertilisation and Embryology Bill also to have a similar defence.
Although this is a defence under the Human Tissue Act, the activities
that require a licence under the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act
1990 relate to the handling of human embryos and gametes, and the
sensitivity of these activities means that it is imperative that
scientists are aware of whether their activities require a licence
under the Act.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, House of Lords,</i>
28 January 2008; Vol. 698, c. 469.]</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column194" />Column number: 194</div><a name="080610108000275"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is true, but I do
not believe that it answers my point. We are not talking about a
defence based on ignorance of the law, and it is unfortunate that that
did not come across clearly in the Lords debate. Unquestionably,
researchers in the field know what the law is and that an embryo that
is created&#151;that outcome is likely or at least
possible&#151;predictably and reasonably comes under the Act. This is
about the uncertainty of the law, not the science.</div>
<a name="080610108000276"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clearly,
such a defence was felt necessary for inclusion in the 2004 Act, which
also dealt with sensitive matters. It therefore seems reasonable to
include a similar, if narrower, defence in the Bill if we accept that
there is a
problem.</div><a name="080610108000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
should set out the circumstances in which such a defence could be
required. Again, I am grateful to the Newcastle scientists for meeting
me last night to provide me with more specific information. They said
that several centres in the UK&#151;the problem is not
rare&#151;are carrying out in vitro research on human eggs with the
approval of a research ethics committee but not under an HFE licence,
which is unnecessary because regulations under the HFEA exempt such
research unless the eggs are fertilised or stimulated specifically to
develop into an embryo. Lord Patel pointed that out in the Lords
debate, and Mary Herbert, who is an expert in meiosis at the North East
England Stem Cell Institute, has confirmed that although it is rare,
the division of an egg cannot be ruled out because it may occur
spontaneously and unexpectedly. There is no intention to create an
embryo, but it is possible that any cultured egg may divide
parthenogenetically; very occasionally&#151;this is the
point&#151;the cell may continue to divide to a two-cell stage with a
full set of
chromosomes.</div><a name="080610108000278"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is the view of those scientists and the Government that such an entity
would be covered by the definition in clause 1. Therefore, an offence
would in theory have been committed if such a thing occurs in an
unlicensed laboratory. Will all research on eggs in vitro require a
licence to avoid the problem? Are we unravelling the whole point of the
regulations made under the 1990 Act shortly after it was passed that
allowed gamete research to continue without a licence, as it
does?</div>
<a name="080610108000279"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
important to give one example of the work specifically concerning the
investigation of the meiosis process, because it is ongoing. Meiosis is
the division of chromosomes in the egg immediately before
fertilisation, so that the number of chromosomes is reduced by half.
Errors occurring during meiosis result in miscarriage and cause
congenital abnormalities such as Down&#146;s syndrome. The studies
involve measuring proteins and other molecular signals within an egg as
it undergoes meiosis. Research on how to store the eggs of young women
to preserve their fertility before chemotherapy is another
example.</div>
<a name="080610108000280"></a><div class="hs_Para">In our
exchange, which I shall not repeat, the Minister said that either
embryos should be licensed or that the eggs that this might happen to
should be destroyed, but her letter was clear. It is important that we
recognise what it said. The Government&#146;s letter to the Committee
said
that</div><a name="080610108000296"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;eggs
can spontaneously activate and begin to divide without having been
fertilised...It is highly unlikely that a human parthenote could
implant and/or develop into a baby. However they do divide for several
days in vitro allowing some research to be carried out on
them.&#148;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column195" />Column number: 195</div><a name="080610108000281"></a><div class="hs_Para">That would be research
under a licence, because it would involve a parthenogenetic embryo.
However:</div><a name="080610108000297"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;As
well as occurring spontaneously, it is possible to stimulate
parthenogenesis by exposing eggs to a specific chemical or by
stimulating them with an electric
shock.&#148;</div><a name="080610108000282"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again,
that would require a licence under the Bill, which is fair enough,
because one anticipates that that sort of thing will continue. The
letter said that such embryos would be covered by the definition, and
went on to
say:</div><a name="080610108000298"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;As
far as we understand, there are very few research projects involving
human eggs which do not involve fertilisation of the eggs. The majority
of research on eggs would involve creating an embryo, and therefore
would require a license from the HFEA. However, we accept that where
there was non-licensed research on eggs being carried out, there is a
possibility that an egg may spontaneously begin to
divide.</div><a name="080610108000299"></a><div class="hs_brev">The
Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990 states that you cannot
bring about the creation of an embryo in vitro without a license from
the HFEA. Therefore, if a researcher were concerned that this might not
be the case, they would need to obtain a license. The Bill does not
change this
position.&#148;</div><a name="080610108000283"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
do not seek to argue with the letter; I am just setting it out to save
time. The Bill changes the position. There was some doubt before, but
now it is clear that spontaneous parthenogenesis, because it involves
the creation of an embryo, albeit not deliberately, would require a
licence. Is it the Department&#146;s advice and the HFEA&#146;s
likely advice that anyone culturing eggs in vitro, even if there is no
intention of stimulating them or creating embryos, will require a
licence?</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column196" />Column number: 196</div><a name="080610108000284"></a><div class="hs_Para">If that is
the case, certainty is needed about it, or researchers may believe that
even if it is not their intention, the research ethics committee does
not feel that it is a possibility and they do not publish anything
about parthenogenetic embryos, they may still be liable for a criminal
offence. Although they may be able to &#147;not have a
problem&#148;, as it were, now that the matter has been raised in the
House of Lords and here, it is important to be absolutely clear for
those researchers and to realise that there will be more research
licences&#151;and, pursuant to previous debates, more income for the
HFEA&#151;and an increase in regulation. I look forward to the
Minister&#146;s
response.</div><a name="080610108000285"></a>

Primarolo:</b> I find it somewhat difficult to accept that
although the very best scientists in the world, at the forefront of
this science, know exactly what to do in order to progress that
science, the hon. Gentleman seeks none the less to move an amendment to
give them the defence that they did not know that they were doing
something that the legislation applied to. We need to be very clear,
and being very clear about what the offence is means that the
scientists concerned must know the exact parameters within which they
are working. There should not be an ambiguous judgment to be made about
what a particular scientist may or may not have known at the point when
they breached the legislation. There is no defence in the 1990
Act&#151;</div><a name="080610108000286"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">It
