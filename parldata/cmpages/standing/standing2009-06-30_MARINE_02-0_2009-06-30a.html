14, in

scientific basis behind the designation (including local conservation,
environmental and global science) and confirmation that it has been
accepted as valid by the Marine Management Organisation&#146;s Chief
Scientific Adviser and the Science Advisory
Panel.&#146;.</div><a name="0907011000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">Good
afternoon, Mr. Pope. It is a great pleasure to be under your
watchful eye this afternoon, as it will be in many sittings in the
coming two or three weeks.</div>
<a name="0907011000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">In considering
clause 117 we come to the heart of the Bill and an issue that a large
number of organisations have a particular interest in: marine
conservation zones. This morning we were talking about the term
&#147;best science&#148;, which is particularly relevant to this
area. Clause 117 outlines</div>
<a name="0907011000283"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Grounds
for designation of MCZs&#148;.</div>
<a name="0907011000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our amendment would
insert a paragraph to expand on the scientific element of the
designation of MCZs, and ensure that we meet two key objectives. The
first objective is, in the designation of MCZs, to secure the inclusion
of all types of science in the process of consideration by the four
regional MCZ projects, the statutory nature conservation bodies, the
Marine Management Organisation and the Secretary of State. The second
objective is to ensure the validity of what constitutes &#147;best
available science&#148;.</div>
<a name="0907011000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
designation of MCZs will be based, as we know, on the &#147;best
available science&#148;. However, currently there is neither a
definition of that term nor any safeguard to ensure that such science
is widely recognised as being valid and a meaningful
contribution.</div>
<a name="0907011000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">One of the
biggest threats to the marine environment is of course climate change.
However, when the Government refer to &#147;best available
science&#148; it is unclear whether 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column44" />Column number: 44</div>they are including climate change science or what some people refer to
as global science. Given the importance of minimising the impact of
climate change, we believe the Bill should be amended to include
consideration of global science matters such as climate change and
other recognised global or international science, in order better to
inform the MCZ designation process.</div>
<a name="0907011000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">Lord Hunt of
Kings Heath, the Minister in the other place, has given verbal
assurances that &#147;best available science&#148; means science
that is, as he put
it,</div><a name="0907011000284"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;peer-reviewed
in the normal way&#148;.</div>
<a name="0907011000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, it would be
helpful if the Committee received the same assurance from the Minister
today.</div><a name="0907011000033"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907011000354"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural
Affairs (Huw Irranca-Davies):</b> I echo the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s remarks about you, Mr. Pope; it will be
very good to serve under you today and in the coming weeks.</div>
<a name="0907011000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 14,
which has been tabled in the names of the hon. Members for Newbury, for
Upminster, for East Devon, for Clwyd, West and for Broxbourne, relates
to MCZs and examines the important issue of science and how it is
recognised within the clause. As the hon. Member for Newbury rightly
said, for many people the clause is the Bill in many ways. The
amendment also recommends that the MMO&#146;s chief scientific
adviser validate the science involved in each designation
decision.</div>
<a name="0907011000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are
absolutely and entirely in agreement with the hon. Member for Newbury
on the importance of the science, and I echo the comments of Lord Hunt
of Kings Heath. Science is absolutely fundamental in determining where
we will designate sites for MCZs. The drafting of clause 117 (1)
ensures that scientific criteria form the basis of site proposals. It
sets out specific grounds for designating MCZs, including the number
and diversity
of</div><a name="0907011000285"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;(a)
marine flora or
fauna;</div><a name="0907011000286"></a><div class="hs_brev">(b)
marine habitats or types of marine habitat;</div>
<a name="0907011000287"></a><div class="hs_brev">(c) features of
geological or geomorphological
interest.&#148;</div><a name="0907011000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
would like to make it clear, given that this is an important issue for
the Committee, that clause 117 has been so drafted to ensure that
science must, by necessity, form the basis of site proposals. In fact,
the number and diversity of marine fauna and flora could not be
determined without scientific evidence. Failure to make a designation
decision on the basis of scientific evidence would mean, first, that
the designating authority did not take account of reasonable
considerations; secondly, that it would therefore have acted
unreasonably; and thirdly, that the decision could then be considered
for judicial
review.</div><a name="0907011000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although
the science is imperative&#151;it is so stated in clause 117&#151;I
do not think that the clause needs to include a specific reference to
science. It is shot through the clause. Lord Greaves, in the other
place, made a pertinent point on a similar Conservative
amendment:</div><a name="0907011000288"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I
suspect, although it is normal for opposition parties generally to want
more in Bills rather than less, that the Government are trying to be
minimalist about what is in it. Nevertheless, I am not sure why the
Conservative amendment&#148;,&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, House of
Lords,</i> 12 May 2009; Vol. 710, c.
1028.]</div><a name="0907011000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">to
ensure that the grounds for designating MCZs are based on science, is
necessary, in the light of the provisions in the Bill.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column45" />Column number: 45</div><a name="0907011000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
is well intentioned; we completely agree on the importance of science
in making these conservation-based decisions. However, I do not think
that including in the definition of science the
words</div><a name="0907011000289"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;including
local conservation, environmental and global
science&#148;</div><a name="0907011000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">would
add anything to our understanding. It merely suggests that science
should include local and global evidence. I believe that the hon.
Member for Newbury is seeking a reassurance on our understanding and
intentions regarding scientific evidence. I can reassure hon. Members
that we fully expect to consider all relevant science, be it global or
local, when designating MCZs. I am pleased that this amendment has
highlighted the importance of keeping our definition of science
flexible enough to allow for future developments in scientific
knowledge and techniques. He rightly referred to climate change. We are
facing ocean acidification and will face many other challenges over the
next four, five or 10
years.</div><a name="0907011000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall deal now with the second aim of the amendment. Although I
understand the desire for transparent assurances that MCZs have been
designated in line with valid science, that is not a role for MMO
scientific advisers. MCZs will be designated by the Secretary of State
on advice and recommendations from Natural England and the Joint Nature
Conservation Committee. They are our scientific and conservation
advisers. They are the Government&#146;s statutory nature
conservation bodies and have the necessary nature conservation
expertise. We want part 5 of the Bill to have a conservation focus to
ensure that the environment is adequately considered. It is therefore
vital that the advice comes from the conservation bodies set up to do
that. The Bill will ensure that the science is given the consideration
desired, and as intended by the first part of the
amendment.</div><a name="0907011000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
MMO, its chief scientific adviser or the Science Advisory Panel can, of
course, make representations during consultation on proposed MCZs, and
I fully expect them to do so. The appropriate authority&#151;the
Secretary of State, the Welsh Assembly Government and so
on&#151;would take such representations into account. We fully expect
a transparent process in which the public too can view the scientific
advice on MCZ designations. For example, Natural England will publish
its advice to the Secretary of State setting out the results of
regional projects as well as its own scientific recommendations.
Consultation comments on potential MCZ sites and the
Government&#146;s responses will also be made public, as they should
be. We want this to be
transparent.</div><a name="0907011000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Bill ensures that science will form the basis, as it should, of MCZ
designation.</div><a name="0907011000044"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0907011000355"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Roger Williams</b> (Brecon and Radnorshire) (LD): I think that
everybody here today supports this element of the Bill, but would like
to get it right. Of course, science is key, and the Minister says that
without it a decision could be open to judicial review. Has he any
estimate of the amount of sea bed that has attached to it sufficient
scientific evidence and knowledge to make these
designations?</div><a name="0907011000045"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907011000356"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> I cannot give the hon. Gentleman an exact
figure, but I can tell him that our knowledge today has significantly
advanced from what it was a year or two ago. There is not only the work
that the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column46" />Column number: 46</div>Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science is carrying
out; many marine agencies, including academic institutions, are mapping
the sea bed and bringing forward science that is surprising and
challenging us. That is the way it should be. Regional projects will
have the science put in front of them, and they will work through it
and take matters forward. The MMO chief scientific adviser undoubtedly
has a role in that, as he has a role to input upwards to the Secretary
of State. The definitive guidance has to be that of the nature
conservation advisers, which are JNCC and Natural England. Putting the
focus on science is absolutely right, and it is there in clause
117.</div>
<a name="0907011000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I have
stated, if these decisions were not based on good science, they would
be wide open to judicial review. On that basis, while empathising with
the thrust of the amendment, I urge the hon. Member for Newbury to
withdraw it, because his first criterion is satisfied and as for the
second, the chief scientist can have an input but is not the
appropriate person to sign this
off.</div><a name="0907011000047"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907011000357"></a>Mr.
Benyon:</b> I am always in favour of the &#147;less is
more&#148; argument and if that is the case, I may have been given
some assurance by the Minister. I am reassured that all science would
be covered under the provision. I would like to see a bit more
compulsion on the JNCC and Natural England to adopt that approach in
the Bill. If the Minister is assuring me, as I think he is, that that
is in the guidance or the schedule, I can live with that. I put down as
a marker that a lot depends on the nature of the chief scientist at the
MMO and the board over which he will sit. If it is to be the body that
we want, they will make sure that their interests and those of the
marine environment are represented from a scientific perspective, which
is what we want to achieve.</div>
<a name="0907011000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Brecon and Radnorshire made an interesting intervention on
issues such as sea bed mapping. I have looked closely at the processes
involved and the methodology of CEFAS. I have discovered through
research that it should be possible to fill in the gaps in sea bed
mapping, certainly in our inshore waters. Towards the end of 2010 we
should be in a position to know what is
there.</div><a name="0907011000049"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907011000358"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> The hon. Gentleman is right. Many
colleagues attended when we recently brought RMS Endeavour from CEFAS
up the Thames through the raised Tower bridge and showed them some of
the science that is going on. His colleagues from the other place also
came to see what we are doing with the science and what inroads we are
making. By the time we bring forward an ecologically coherent network,
our knowledge could be sufficient to make good decisions that will
satisfy conservation criteria and others who use the sea and want to
know where they can safely carry out their activity for the benefit of
conservation.</div><a name="0907011000050"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907011000359"></a>Mr.
Benyon:</b> I am grateful for those remarks. I, too, saw
Endeavour when it was here and saw the methodology on my visit to
Lowestoft. Given the Minister&#146;s assurances, I beg to ask leave

amendment.</div><a name="0907011000051"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907011000361"></a>The

amendment 16, in
clause 119, page 80, line 41, at
end insert&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(c) the Marine
Management Organisation on social and economic factors regarding the
designation of MCZ
sites.&#146;.</div><a name="0907011000054"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907011000362"></a>Mr.
Benyon:</b> We seek to clarify the process of designation,
which is one of the most important parts of the Bill. The first part of
the process should be to identify which sites could qualify on the
basis of pure science. That should be the first criterion. The next
stage should be to pare those down&#151;using socio-economic factors,
if required, at that point in the process. Those factors need not
mitigate against designation as there will be plenty of examples in
which science-based conservation factors will live happily with
socio-economic requirements, not least elements of tourism such as
eco-tourism. Taking socio-economic factors into account at the start of
the process would or could restrict the ability to secure an
ecologically coherent network of marine conservation zones. The problem
with seeking marine sanctuaries under existing legislation, principally
the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, has been that very few sites
have been designated purely because socio-economic considerations were
applied too early in the
process.</div>
<a name="0907011000321"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.15
pm</div><a name="0907011000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are also concerned about how the Bill will sit with the Marine
(Scotland) Bill, which states that socio-economic factors will be
considered only when choosing between two sites of equal value. Our
amendment would make the UK Bill reflect the position in the Scottish
Bill. In our debates this morning, the Minister said that there should
be coherence between England and Scotland in terms of the MMO, so
surely that principle should apply across the designation process. The
socio-economic consequences of designation should not compromise the
desirability of designating two or more areas of equal status, or the
ability to achieve an ecologically coherent network of sites.
Socio-economic factors should be considered in the management of a
site, and therefore every MCZ will need a management plan.</div>
<a name="0907011000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 16
is designed to place a duty on the MMO to provide advice on social and
economic matters directly to the Secretary of State to ensure that
there is balanced consideration of the three pillars of sustainable
development during the MCZ designation process. That process commences
with four regional MCZ projects, which involve a range of interested
parties assessing options for MCZs within their region, having taken a
range of evidence to assist their analysis. Their proposals then go to
Natural England, which rationalises the lists and forwards proposals to
the Secretary of State with its own advice and supplementary
information. The Secretary of State will then consider and decide how
to designate the proposed MCZs&#151;or not.</div>
<a name="0907011000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given the
statutory conservation duties and ethos of Natural England, it will not
have all the required skills and expertise properly to assess the
social and economic 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column48" />Column number: 48</div>factors, and neither is it likely to consider such matters to be of
equal importance. Given the recent Government amendment in clause 2(2),
strengthening the MMO&#146;s role to allow it to</div>
<a name="0907011000290"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;take any action
which it considers necessary or expedient for the purpose of furthering
any social, economic or environmental
purposes&#148;,</div><a name="0907011000282"></a><div class="hs_Para">and
provided that the MMO has the right balance of skills and expertise, it
could play a meaningful role in advising the Secretary of State on the
economic and social implications of designating individual MCZs. That
would ensure that there was balanced consideration of all key factors
when deciding whether proposed areas are suitable for designation as
marine conservation
zones.</div><a name="0907011000058"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0907011000363"></a><b class="B">Martin
Salter</b> (Reading, West) (Lab): As I said this morning, it
is worth looking back at the extensive scrutiny undertaken by the Joint
Committee, on which at least four hon. Members in this Committee
served. I am pleased that the hon. Member for Newbury has not gone down
the road urged by some non-governmental organisations. The amendment
that was listed but not selected would delete all reference to
socio-economic activity, and was based on flawed thinking. There are
socio-economic activities and there are socio-economic
activities&#151;some activities are entirely cognisant of good
environmental practice. Creating MCZs can create jobs and environmental
opportunities. Wind power can create jobs, as can fishing opportunities
that were hitherto unavailable due to the pillaging of our coastline by
the commercial sector. It is therefore good that, collectively, we have
backed away from that and stood firm on the principle that
socio-economic factors have a role to play.</div>
<a name="0907011000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a
danger that we could be making the detail a point of principle when it
is not. I am slightly uncomfortable with amendment 16, which creates a
requirement to advise of socio-economic activities, and the way in
which it fits with amendment 15, which tells the authority to take
socio-economic activities into account only where MCZs are of equal
value. I was initially attracted to the idea, but there is a danger
that we could constrain decisions that we might wish the MMO and the
Secretary of State to enact.</div>
<a name="0907011000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Joint
Committee said in paragraph 115:</div>
<a name="0907011000291"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
recommend that the scoping of potential locations for Marine
Conservation Zones should be based on the best scientific evidence,
taking into account their representative nature, uniqueness, threat and
sensitivity.&#148;</div><a name="0907011000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is fine&#151;and there is no disagreement with that&#151;but we
went on to say:</div>
<a name="0907011000292"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
also emphasise the need to pay regard to existing international
obligations...the socio-economic costs and benefits of MCZs, and
the ability of zones to accommodate other forms of use without harming
their integrity, once the potential sites have been
identified.&#148;</div><a name="0907011000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
firm position was not taken; there was a recognition that
socio-economic factors had to be weighed in the balance. I think that
the Minister can avoid the confrontation that was evident this morning
in the robustness of his response. We want to be assured that good
science is the primary consideration when designating MCZs, and that
other factors follow. There may be socio-economic factors that make
good environmental sense, are of primary importance, and apply to two 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column49" />Column number: 49</div>MCZs of equal value, but do we really want to inhibit what we can do in
circumstances that are not very remote? The Minister needs to address
that
problem.</div><a name="0907011000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
pay tribute to the Government for moving their position from the one
that they took in the original Bill. Hon. Members will remember that it
said that socio-economic factors &#147;shall&#148; be taken into
account. We are now in a different place. We are where the Joint
Committee wanted us to be, as we are saying that they
&#147;may&#148; be taken into account. It is not the function of
this scrutiny&#151;and my goodness the Bill has been
scrutinized&#151;to restrict the opportunity to do the right thing
further down the road. My message to Opposition Members&#151;if the
Minister is able to answer the legitimate concerns and points that have
been raised&#151;is that we may be able to keep the consensus that, I
hope, will run through the rest of the
debate.</div>
<a name="0907011000064"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0907011000364"></a><b class="B">Andrew
George</b> (St. Ives) (LD): As other hon. Member&#146;s have
said, it is pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr.
Pope. May I explain to the hon. Member for Reading, West the purpose of
the amendment that I tabled but which was not selected? On Second
Reading, in column 719, I argued that socio-economics should be taken
into account, but should not contradict the fundamentals of sound
science, because that is the basis of recognising the need to protect
something particularly fragile and unique. However, at the point where
one is implementing a plan to protect a said site, socio-economics need
to be considered. The voices and considerations of the users of the
marine resource should at least be heard at that stage, to see whether
there are ways in which their activity operates that are not damaging;
we want to find out whether they can amend the way in which they go
about their occupation so that there is less damage. The designation
should fundamentally be based on sound science and as many objective
measurements as possible, and we should not be diverted from that
aim.</div>
<a name="0907011000065"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0907011000365"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Hugo Swire</b> (East Devon) (Con): Is the hon. Gentleman
satisfied that there is enough protection in the Bill for a place such
as Lyme bay, in my own constituency? It is often used as a safe haven,
most recently by the Napoli, and there is some economic benefit in
that. However, the adverse environmental impact from a spillage of
oil&#151;such events used to occur when there were ship-to-ship oil
transfers&#151;on what is a UNESCO world heritage site must be
balanced against such activity. Is he satisfied that the checks and
balances are there, and that places such as a UNESCO world heritage
site can be factored in, rather than just the marine-based
environment?</div><a name="0907011000066"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907011000366"></a>Andrew
George:</b> I do not have the hon. Gentleman&#146;s intimate
knowledge of the particular circumstances of Lyme bay, on which I am
sure he is articulate. Am I satisfied that the balance has been struck?
The answer is that I am not certain, but I should have thought that
that was the purpose of the
clause.</div><a name="0907011000067"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907011000367"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> Perhaps I may assist by clarifying the
position. While much of the focus is understandably on marine
conservation zones, as part of the ecologically coherent network that
we are talking about, we will ensure that we will include Lyme bay, the
Natura 2000 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column50" />Column number: 50</div>sites and other locations that may come along. MCZs do not stand
entirely alone as an entity&#151;they will take into account sites of
special scientific interest, estuarine environments and so on. Indeed,
that is a coherent way to manage the different interests in the marine
environment, and to recognise that where we have special habitats, we
protect them very carefully
indeed.</div><a name="0907011000068"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907011000368"></a>Andrew
George:</b> Certainly, the question of European designations
and coastline UNESCO sites is relevant. One of the points that I had
made in this morning&#146;s sitting was about terrestrial planning
and the relationship between that and the designations and protections
that are available on the coastline. They are within the provenance of
democratically elected local authorities either to protect, or to
ensure that they take measures to respect the integrity of the kind of
sites that the hon. Gentleman is talking about. It is important that
local authorities and the locality are able to engage in the process
itself. That is the aspect that, with regard to the arguments that I
was advancing this morning, needs to be further
developed.</div><a name="0907011000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
primary point advanced by amendment 15 is something that I raised on
Second Reading. There are two types of marine conservation zones.
First, there are MCZs that have a unique feature that is not replicable
anywhere else; they are fragile marine sites that justify their
designation as MCZs in their own right. Some such areas will coincide
with or complement the sites mentioned by the Minister a moment ago in
terms of their Ramsar, or other European or international, designation
and protection. Such sites should be given special protection and we
should go to great lengths to achieve
that.</div><a name="0907011000322"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.30
pm</div><a name="0907011000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
second group of sites are part of a network, and their purpose, as I
understand it, is that they are representative of a particular type of
marine habitat and biodiversity. Amendment 15 relates to such sites. If
we are to consider socio-economic factors at the designation stage, it
would be appropriate for them to be brought to bear on such sites. I
also believe that socio-economic considerations need to be brought to
bear at the implementation stage, which comes after the designation
stage, and relates to the application of the individual protection
programme, as well as the measures proposed by the MMO and other bodies
to advance the protection of marine conservation zones. The designation
stage is simply one factor in the process; it is the measures taken
within each marine conservation zones that will be relevant to the
affected industries and coastal
communities.</div><a name="0907011000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Reading, West queried whether amendment 16 was
necessary. If amendment 15, which I support, is successful, I do not
think that amendment 16 would be necessary and it would be curious for
us to continue to debate it. The issue under discussion is important
and is very much the nub of the issue if we want to achieve a
confluence between ensuring that we maintain economically sustainable
coastal communities on the one hand, and ensuring that we, as an island
nation state, tackle environmental challenges on the other. Getting the
balance right between all of those interests is important, and it very
much focuses on this clause. I hope that the Minister will take into
account a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column51" />Column number: 51</div>measured amendment that would clearly improve and clarify the nature of
how socio-economic considerations will be
addressed.</div><a name="0907011000072"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0907011000369"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Charles Walker</b> (Broxbourne) (Con): I will make a very
short contribution. The Bill is in danger of being subsumed by jargon.
I do not really know what &#147;socio-economic&#148; means, to be
perfectly honest. Is it possible to have marine conservation and create
jobs? Of course it is. It is possible to have increased recreational
fishing opportunities, increased diving opportunities and increased
tourism in conservation areas, so of course conservation is compatible
with creating sustainable employment. I become concerned, however, when
&#147;socio-economic&#148; strays into the area of big
infrastructure
projects.</div><a name="0907011000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">Over
the next three weeks, I am going to bore the Committee tirelessly with
my concerns about the Severn estuary. The Minister said that things
will be based on good science. There is virtually no more important
ecological site in Europe or the world than the Severn estuary, but I
am concerned that socio-economic considerations will be used as a
Trojan horse to overturn all the good science relating to the Severn
estuary and to ensure that a dam is built across it, with all the
damage that that will cause the natural marine environment.</div>
<a name="0907011000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">If I could ask
one thing of the Minister it is that he break down what the word
&#147;socio-economic&#148; means. Does it mean that marine
conservation takes a back seat when that is in the national interest?
Alternatively, does it mean that we will have a brave Bill and that
future Governments will be brave, do the right thing by the marine
environment and sometimes say no to major infrastructure projects of
national importance?</div>
<a name="0907011000075"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0907011000370"></a><b class="B">Nick
Ainger</b> (Carmarthen, West and South Pembrokeshire) (Lab):
It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Pope.
I want to comment on a couple of the points that have been made and I
look forward to hearing what the Minister says in response.</div>
<a name="0907011000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">First, the
hon. Member for St. Ives was absolutely right to talk about the need to
establish a balance. All colleagues have been contacted by
non-governmental organisations that are concerned that the inclusion of
socio-economic issues will be used to overturn the conservation
elements. That is the issue, and that is why those organisations are
concerned.</div>
<a name="0907011000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">As someone
whose constituency has some of the most precious habitats and special
areas of conservation, as well as major energy developments and huge
volumes of shipping, I understand those concerns. However, the fact
remains that despite the accidents and incidents, and despite the
intense industrial activity on that part of the coast and the seas
immediately offshore, we still have these precious areas, and they are
still protected. There is therefore no question but that a balance can
be struck.</div>
<a name="0907011000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
needs to give those who have raised such concerns with us an assurance
that conservation is the No. 1 issue, but there will be
circumstances&#151;we have to be clear about this&#151;where
important socio-economic issues will have to be addressed.</div>
<a name="0907011000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">For example,
there is a range of issues in Cardigan bay, which has a major school of
common dolphins. There is a clash with the scallop dredging there,
which is substantially damaging the sea bed. Through the food 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column52" />Column number: 52</div>chain, that will undoubtedly have an effect on dolphins. That may well
be addressed. One way of addressing it&#151;I am not suggesting that
this is the solution&#151;involves offshore wind farms. There may be
pressures to introduce offshore wind farms, and a wind farm might
address some of the issues in the area.</div>
<a name="0907011000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">To return to
the point made by the hon. Member for East Devon, my constituency saw
the Sea Empress oil spill in 1996, when 72,000 tonnes of crude oil were
deposited on the coast of my constituency without my permission. Again,
we must be clear and honest with people that establishing marine
conservative zones will not prevent a Sea Empress or a Napoli, because
pollution travels. The Sea Empress was entering the Milford Haven
waterway when it ran aground, but the spill covered an area of hundreds
of square miles.. I am sure, knowing that area, that there is likely to
be an MCZ designation. However, that area is an awfully long way from
where the incident occurred, so we must make it clear that MCZ
designation will not prevent the impact of a Sea Empress, or even of a
Napoli.</div><a name="0907011000081"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907011000371"></a>Mr.
Swire:</b> I well remember the incident to which the hon.
Gentleman alludes. In my constituency, we were fortunate not to suffer
too much pollution from the Napoli incident. There was some pollution,
but it was not too bad. The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right that an
MCZ designation would not prevent pollution in such circumstances. What
would prevent it, and would be a preventive measure anyway, is the
creation of safe havens around the UK coast where ships in distress
could go, for which Brussels has been calling for some time. I would
argue that Lyme bay should not be one of those safe havens. That
measure would
help.</div><a name="0907011000082"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907011000372"></a>Nick
Ainger:</b> I accept that the trouble might be that as a safe
haven is presumably a relatively sheltered area, there might be the
unfortunate coincidence that it has protected species and one ends up
trying to make a sensible and balanced decision. I would be grateful to
hear how the Minister sees the balance being struck, because that is
the issue. People out there believe that purely because there is a
reference in the Bill to socio-economic issues, they will automatically
override the conservation issue. The Minister has to assure us on that
point.</div><a name="0907011000083"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907011000373"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> It is a great privilege to follow those
contributions, because this issue really goes to the heart of the Bill.
There has been a lot of concern about it and a lot of questions need
answering, which I will try to do now. It is also a privilege to follow
my hon. Friend the Member for Carmarthen, West and South Pembrokeshire,
whose constituency in many ways will have to be a model of how the
process works. With the intensity of oil and gas, and liquefied natural
gas coming in, together with the potential for renewables, the still
viable fisheries as far afield as Cardigan bay, and the sea fisheries,
sea angling and intense recreation in parts of my hon. Friend&#146;s
constituency&#151;we see these things around our coast&#151;what
better example is there of the way
forward?</div><a name="0907011000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
premise of the Bill is that first, we have the great win of a complete
marine planning system, and secondly, we have these jewels within it
that we call marine conservation zones. As has rightly been pointed
out, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column53" />Column number: 53</div>and as I hope I said earlier and will therefore reiterate now, these
zones are based on science. Science underpins MCZs. Those jewels are
multifaceted, multicoloured and of different shapes. My hon. Friend the
Member for Reading, West has quoted from the House of Lords Joint
Committee report on the draft Bill, so let me quote the
Government&#146;s response, which sums the issue up
well:</div><a name="0907011000293"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
agree that the designation of MCZs should be based on the best
scientific evidence, and this should take account of factors such as
representivity, uniqueness, vulnerability and sensitivity, but we need
to avoid having a strict set of criteria which requires Ministers to
designate MCZs purely on the basis of scientific considerations. In
addition this should be an opportunity for
stakeholders&#148;&#151;</div><a name="0907011000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">all

Gilroy</b> (Plymouth, Sutton) (Lab/Co-op): Does my hon. Friend
nevertheless understand the point made by many of the organisations he
has just mentioned? They worry that as set out, the Bill will have the
same result as the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981: only three small
sites have been designated in 25 years. That is the point made by the
hon. Member for Newbury. Can my hon. Friend tell those of us who share
those worries to some degree how many marine conservation zones he
would expect to see come about in the next five
years?</div><a name="0907011000091"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907011000375"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> I can tell my good and hon. Friend that we
intend to bring forward not just individual MCZs but our proposals for
a proper, ecologically coherent network by 2012. We said that on the
record in the other place. We have said it in guidance and we will
continue to say it. We want the momentum behind this to continue, so
that we do not simply have individual sites but sites where species can
spawn and reproduce. With climate change they can move from site to
site and so on. I could go further.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907011000377"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> I will give way in a moment but I want to
finish on one further sentence from the Government&#146;s
response:</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column54" />Column number: 54</div><a name="0907011000299"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;For
areas containing particularly rare, threatened or otherwise important
species or habitats, we would expect ecological considerations to carry
greater
weight.&#148;</div><a name="0907011000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">So
depending on the sensitivity and fragility, where it is not possible to
have replicated sites and there are only one or two sites, we would
expect the ecology to carry greater weight. However, in response to the
points made about the balance, where choices can be made the
socio-economics should be taken into
account.</div><a name="0907011000095"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907011000378"></a>Andrew
George:</b> A moment ago the Minister mentioned Finding
Sanctuary, whose representatives I have met on a couple of occasions.
It is a project partly or wholly funded by DEFRA to work with local
environmental organisations and to talk to other stakeholders about
introducing proposals for the future designation of marine conservation
zones or a zone around the coast of the south-west in Cornwall and the
Isles of Scilly. In doing so, it is engaging with the socio-economic
considerations at the stage of identifying the site. I am becoming
slightly confused as to whether the proposals themselves, as being
introduced under an initiative that the Government clearly support,
have integrated the consideration of socio-economic considerations at
the very earliest stage. When the project brings forward its own
proposals, will further socio-economic considerations be brought to
bear at that
stage?</div><a name="0907011000096"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907011000379"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> Finding Sanctuary is the most progressed
of all these projects. The critical thing with Finding Sanctuary has
been how well it has done in engaging a wide variety of stakeholders
with different interests and getting them together. It does not discuss
how it brings forward this ecologically coherent zone in its area until
it has the science in front of it. That science will be put to it by a
scientific panel, and then it will have to engage with us in some
detailed and difficult
choices.</div><a name="0907011000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to return to the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for
Plymouth, Sutton about the Wildlife and Countryside Act. I understand
her concern about our not delivering in that regard. Apart from our
commitment to introducing this ecologically coherent network by 2012,
the key difference between the Wildlife and Countryside Act and this
Bill is that the latter imposes a statutory duty to designate zones,
and a duty on the Secretary of State to get on with it and contribute
to this network. Anybody who tries to resile from that will see that
the Bill says that we will do it, and have a duty to do it. I challenge
anybody who follows me to say that we will not do so. There are other
issues, but I will turn to those in a
moment.</div>
<a name="0907011000098"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907011000380"></a>Linda
Gilroy:</b><b class="B"> </b>I think it fair to say that that is a
significant reassurance. Can the Minister, without giving a figure,
give some sense that there will be more than three small sites? We have
already mentioned Lyme bay, Carmarthen, the areas in Cardigan bay,
Lundy island and the sites off my own constituency for starters. Can he
say something a little more robust about what he expects to happen in,
say, the next five
years?</div><a name="0907011000099"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907011000381"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> Yes, I can, and I am glad to see the
support generally in the Committee for making the right decisions in
the right areas. I hope that that view is shared more widely in
Parliament, because we will 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column55" />Column number: 55</div>undoubtedly bring forward other sites similar to Lyme bay. We cannot get
away from that fact. We have sites that are so fragile, special and
irreplaceable that they will have to be protected to that degree. There
will be sites that will, in effect, be highly restricted. We had a
debate in the other place on highly protected areas. The Bill provides
the power to deal with a range of issues, including that level of
protection, but let us not let that detract from the
Government&#146;s other obligations that tie in to the marine
conservation zone network. Not least of those are our obligations under
the habitats directives to bring forward special protection areas and
special areas of conservation. I hope to be the Minister who introduces
such proposals, which will form part of this approach, very soon. There
will be overlaps with marine conservation zones, and there will be
difficult decisions to take. However, where we have special sites, they
will have to have a special level of protection as
well.</div><a name="0907011000100"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907011000382"></a>Martin
Salter:</b> Those of us who might see the inclusion of
phraseology such as &#147;socio-economic factors&#148; as a Trojan
horse and an excuse not to designate marine conservation zones can take
great comfort and reassurance from the Minister&#146;s words. May I
press him further? My name is attached to the amendment we are
discussing. I am minded to vote with the Government, but I could be
persuaded not to. I was encouraged when he quoted the very good
response of the Joint Committee on this point. It said that the
designation decision would be based on the best scientific factors.
That is excellent, but that will not appear in the Bill and that is
really the thrust of the amendment from the hon. Member for Newbury.
The Minister may need to take some advice on this, but could the
wording that is on the record as the Government&#146;s response and
view be built into guidance to reassure us all? If so, I suggest to the
Minister that we would then have earned our corn this
afternoon.</div><a name="0907011000101"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907011000383"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> Yes indeed. We have brought out a fair
degree of guidance already, but if we can go further we would certainly
be minded to do so. It is important to provide clarity and certainty
for people, so that they know that we mean it when we say we are going
to bring forward marine conservation zones. There is going to be a
variety of MCZs. There will be ones that replicate what goes on in
other zones. They will be able not only to protect on an individual
site basis, but to allow for the replenishment and regeneration of
species, and to have that network. I am more than happy to take that
point away and look at how we can strengthen the guidance we have
already introduced; but I think I can also turn to the amendments and
give some clarification.</div>
<a name="0907011000102"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907011000384"></a>Linda
Gilroy:</b> Before the Minister does that, can he continue
with the theme that he outlined&#151;that there is a duty in the Bill
that did not exist in the Wildlife and Countryside Act? Does that
therefore mean that if there were grounds to suggest that too few sites
coming forward and they were too thin, that would be judicially
reviewable?</div>
<a name="0907011000103"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907011000385"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> May I come back to my hon. Friend on that
in a moment while I seek some inspiration? I will not forget the point
and will return to it.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column56" />Column number: 56</div><a name="0907011000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me turn to
the nitty-gritty of the amendments. Amendment 15 would ensure that MCZs
are designated on scientific criteria alone, with the socio-economic
consequences of site designations being considered only when there is a
choice of two or more MCZ locations of equal scientific value. The
Government consider that existing conservation legislation has become a
constraint on our ambition for marine conservation. It does not give us
the scope to do all that we want to do, which is to create an
ecologically coherent network of marine protected areas. So the Bill in
its current format, including clause 117, provides the tools for
achieving an ecologically coherent network. That network will include
MCZs designated under the Bill, European and Ramsar sites and sites of
special scientific interest. Most importantly&#151;my hon. Friend the
Member for Plymouth, Sutton has just referred to this issue&#151;the
Bill will place a duty on Ministers to designate MCZs so as to
contribute to this ecologically coherent network. That will put in
place a network that works best for conservation based on science and,
where appropriate, socio-economic
needs.</div><a name="0907011000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
hon. Friend the Member for Reading, West rightly pointed out that the
original draft of the Bill stated that we &#147;shall&#148; take
socio-economic factors into account. But MCZs are different&#151;they
are the jewels. There &#147;may&#148;&#151;not
&#147;shall&#148;&#151;be occasions when we take those factors
into account. However, site designations will be based fundamentally on
scientific evidence. Science is the fundamental and first consideration
when sites are proposed. We expect that on a number of sites the need
for conservation will be clear, and such sites will be designated to
provide the required protection.</div>
<a name="0907011000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is also
clear to me, however, that the best protection will also be achieved
through consensus, and this is where stakeholder engagement comes in.
We must be able to take into account, when relevant, the impact of
designating MCZs on people&#146;s lives and livelihoods. That will be
crucial in assessing the longer-term effects of MCZ designations and
our wider renewable energy targets. For example, when a representative
site is designated, the Secretary of State will often have more choice
regarding potential locations, and a decision could therefore be made
that takes into account
socio-economics.</div><a name="0907011000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
me turns this on its head. Socio-economics  are often
considered in opposition to science and conservation&#151;as a
consideration undermining conservation &#151;but in some
cases, socio-economics will help and encourage designations. For
example, Blakeney Point, on the north Norfolk coast, has a large seal
population&#151;about 500&#151;that, in its own terms, is
important. However, it is also vital to the local tourist industry. The
science might suggest that such an area could benefit from designation
as an MCZ, and the socio-economics might point in the same direction
for the long-term stability of the tourism industry. They could really
underpin the designation. Like other hon. Members, I do not want to
pre-empt any decisions on regional work carried out around the
coastline, but it is important to make the point that we do not want to
lose the ability to factor in such positive socio-economic
considerations. I repeat that the Government, with the help of the
Committee, are determined to make a step change in the protection of
the marine environment. That is why we placed the duty on Ministers to
designate these MCZs. We believe that the approach in the Bill is the
right one, so I ask the hon. Member for Newbury not to press amendment
15.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column57" />Column number: 57</div><a name="0907011000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 16
highlights the value of the new MMO and the importance of taking
account of social and economic factors, where appropriate, in decisions
to designate MCZs. I share the sentiments behind the amendment, but the
Bill already achieves its desired effect. The power to take account of
social and economic factors when considering whether to designate MCZs
will enable us to achieve our conservation objectives in ways that
minimise the impact on sea users and maximise synergies, where they
exist.</div>
<a name="0907011000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon. Friend
the Member for Reading, West mentioned recreational sea angling and
MCZs. I can see MCZs and socio-economic interests working positively
together in that respect, because in many cases MCZs will benefit
anglers by providing new or improved opportunities to pursue their
sport in a way that does not impact on the biodiversity of the flora
and fauna; they can co-exist. Part of the essence of what we are
considering is areas where those uses are
compatible.</div><a name="0907011000324"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907011000386"></a>Martin
Salter:</b> Recreational sea anglers will be delighted with
the assurance that we now have on the record from the Minister that it
is not the intention of the Department or the Bill to exclude in almost
all cases recreational sea anglers from MCZs. Will the Minister reflect
further on the point raised on Second Reading that the presence of
recreational sea anglers in MCZs will in itself be of great use in
enforcing those MCZs and reporting on other activity that is
considerably less
welcome?</div><a name="0907011000111"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907011000387"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> I will indeed reflect on that point,
because one of the thrusts of the Bill is about sharing the ownership
of protecting our marine environment. It will not be a case of the man
or woman in Whitehall drawing an arbitrary list of lines on a map and
saying, &#147;This is where the science leads us.&#148; It will be
a case of getting local communities of stakeholders together in the
same way as the four regional projects and saying, &#147;Here is the
science. Work with it. We have to protect this environment properly for
the long-term future.&#148; There are players who may well have a
part in the long-term management by assisting in that long-term
process.</div>
<a name="0907011000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">Socio-economics
will be taken into account in the management of MCZs after designation,
but that is only one of the ways in which we will take that point into
account. The designation process must consider the onward management of
a site. That is what it is all
about.</div><a name="0907011000113"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907011000388"></a>Andrew
George:</b> On that point, will the Minister clarify what is
likely to happen following designation both within and beyond the
six-mile limit? Presuming that the MCZs will be designated within UK
territorial waters, let us say, for example, that one of the sites that
the MMO is keen to designate is a deep seabed area. I am thinking of
the coast off Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly, which are part of my
constituency. As the Minister knows, the seabed is as accessible to
foreign fishing vessels as it is to UK fishing vessels. With regard to
taking into account the socio-economic consequences of designation, I
presume&#151;this relates to a wider debate on the future of the
common fisheries policy&#151;that the Minister acknowledges that it
would clearly be inappropriate 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column58" />Column number: 58</div>to tie the hands of UK fishermen, unless the UK Government can achieve
an agreement either in Europe or bilaterally with all the fishing
nations that have access to that seabed in order to avoid a
socio-economic impact on coastal communities. I am talking about a
failure to provide any kind of protection, because other vessels were
getting in there to damage the
seabed.</div><a name="0907011000114"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907011000389"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes an important
point. I think that we are now pushing at an open door in relation to
CFP reform, which is long overdue and needs fundamentally to be done.
We also have the existing obligations under the European habitats
directive and what we are doing under other European regulations as
well. We are pushing at an open door, I believe, but he is right and I
will return to the issue in a later discussion. We do not want to see
MCZs purely in the inshore outer six miles or even in the outer 12. We
want to see them in all those areas in territorial waters that are most
special and require protection. I will return to that, because it is an
important
matter.</div><a name="0907011000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">Not
all MCZs will be vulnerable to fishing activities, as the hon.
Gentleman will understand, but where the conservation objectives for an
MCZ that is located in waters beyond six nautical miles depend on the
introduction of fisheries restrictions, the Government will
use&#151; I have phrased this in civil servant speak, but it
is very good civil servant speak that I can understand when I sit down
with people&#151;their best endeavours to seek the agreement of other
member states. As I have said, we are pushing an open door. The
European Union, the Commissioner and others are watching to see what we
do. Banging together fisheries and marine environment has to be part of
the long-term way forward both for the CFP and generally.</div>
<a name="0907011000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">We will use
our best endeavours to seek the agreement of other member states to
mergers through the CFP. In six-to-12 nautical mile zones, that will be
through negotiation with the Commission and affected member states, so
that domestic legislation under the Sea Fish (Conservation) Act 1967
can be extended to foreign vessels, as the hon. Gentleman has
discussed. Beyond 12 nautical miles, agreement for a merger under the
CFP will ultimately need to be reached through the Council of Fisheries
Ministers. There is almost a ranking of difficulty, but all those
things are achievable, and we certainly intend to do that, because it
would not be right if we simply tried to get the low-hanging fruit. We
need to ensure that MCZs are designated, where appropriate, based on
scientific evidence.</div>
<a name="0907011000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">Coming back to
amendment 16, clause 119(4) already requires Ministers to consult any
persons whom they think
are</div><a name="0907011000300"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;likely
to be interested in, or affected by, the making
of&#148;</div><a name="0907011000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">an
order to designate MCZs. That would involve consultation on not only
the social and economic implications of designation, but all relevant
issues. It is inconceivable that the MMO would not fall within that
definition given its planning, licensing and enforcement functions
under the Bill, so I reassure hon. Members that Ministers are obliged
to consult the MMO. That is in addition to the advice that Ministers
can expect to receive from a range of people and organisations with
interests in the sea. I am sure that, as we have heard today, we can
rely on all of them keenly promoting all  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column59" />Column number: 59</div>the benefits&#151;social, economic and environmental&#151;of what
they do. Ministers will not be short of advice on any aspect of the
consequences of designation. I therefore suggest that the amendment is
unnecessary, and I would be grateful if the hon. Member for Newbury
were to withdraw it. With those comments, I hope that hon. Members can
see that there is a good way forward in the
Bill.</div><a name="0907011000119"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907011000390"></a>Mr.
Benyon:</b> We have had a very useful debate, which has, if
nothing else, clarified the Government&#146;s intentions and how they
see the system working. The Minister has proved himself to be an
optimist, this afternoon, in believing that each tier of difficulty is
achievable, and so we must wish him well. He is also optimistic in that
he hopes to be the Minister who enacts the designations. I have news
for him&#151;so do I&#151;but that is a discussion for another
occasion.</div>
<a name="0907011000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Plymouth, Sutton rightly teased a very important point out
of the Minister about the level of ambition regarding marine
conservation zones. On Second Reading, I deliberately made the point
that we should not go down the path that some have tried to persuade us
to go down of saying that our ambition relates to a certain percentage
of the seas, because that would allow a path of least resistance that
might result in the designation of relatively benign and
uncontroversial areas of the sea in order to achieve a headline figure.
Let us face it, many controversial decisions will have to be taken,
although much of that controversy will be based on perception rather
than reality. Local communities will say, &#147;We are being
impoverished; our fishing and tourism industries are being
affected by the designation,&#148; but in most cases those
perceptions will be
groundless.</div><a name="0907011000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is important to stick hard and fast to the principle that designation
will be based on science. What I have sought to do in these amendments
is to tease out from the Government a process by which we will get to
that point. We have established that that process will be conducted,
first, on the basis of sound science, and then socio-economic factors
can be considered. As the hon. Member for Reading, West has pointed
out, very often those two factors will be entirely compatible; in fact,
they will mutually enhance each
other.</div><a name="0907011000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
take the point raised by the hon. Member for Reading, West about sea
anglers being an asset by reporting what is going on. There will not be
a line on the map or any buoys or markers to show where these zones
start and finish. The only people who will know them are those people
who know those waters and that locality. We will be relying, to large
measure, on such people.</div>
<a name="0907011000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">Where we are
yet to make progress is on the point that I raised with amendment 15
regarding the lack of compatibility with other regions going through
the same process. I have yet to hear from the Minister why there is a
difference in wording and in approach between what we are trying to
achieve and what the Scottish Parliament is trying to achieve in the
Scottish Marine Bill.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907011000391"></a>Huw

length&#151;</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907011000392"></a>The

mid-intervention.</div><a name="0907011000128"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907011000393"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> Indeed. To clarify, my intervention was to
deal with the issue of Scotland and why it has a slightly different way
forward. We have worked with Scotland and the other devolved
administrations on the UK Bill throughout the process. Scottish
Ministers know how the UK Bill works and have decided, after
consultation in Scotland, that a different approach is more appropriate
for their own Bill. Nevertheless, as Scotland is responsible for the
implementation of both its own Bill for inshore waters and the UK Bill
in offshore waters, they and we have the opportunity to ensure
consistency between inshore and offshore. Nothing in the Bill prevents
that and both Bills can support an ecologically coherent network of
protected areas.</div>
<a name="0907011000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me
clarify. The Scottish Bill considers only socio-economics where there
are two areas of equal ecological value. That reflects the consultation
carried out and it is for the Scottish Government to take that forward.
It is important to look within this Bill at the whole suite of
provisions to make a valid comparison. While the scope to consider
socio-economics is more limited in the Scottish Bill, there is, on the
other hand, no duty in that Bill to designate marine protected areas in
the first place.</div>
<a name="0907011000130"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907011000394"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. Before we go any further, some of the
interventions have been slightly longer than Standing Orders provide
for. Brevity is the soul of wit and also the soul of interventions. I
would gently remind the Committee of
that.</div><a name="0907011000131"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907011000395"></a>Mr.
Benyon:</b> I think the Minister just said that under the
Scottish Bill there will be no duty to designate but we do have a
duty.</div><a name="0907011000132"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907011000396"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b>
Indeed.</div><a name="0907011000133"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907011000397"></a>Mr.
Benyon:</b> The Minister is nodding his assurance.  I
believe the duties concerning MCZs are set out in clause
123. That is helpful. I cannot imagine that there would be a huge
difference between the two countries. Though our approach differs in
various ways, we ultimately want to achieve the same thing. I am
satisfied about that.</div>
<a name="0907011000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">I spoke
earlier about my concerns about Ministers or authorities being able to
follow the path of least resistance. It is important that the Bill is
constructed in a way to make that almost impossible, because people
have come at it in the right process. The hon. Member for St. Ives
spoke at the beginning about the programme of protection. I do believe
that process is important. We have set out in this debate a process
that we can all work with. A point was made by the hon. Member for
Reading, West that if we all dance on the head of a pin, the perfect
could become the enemy of the good. That is a real mangle of
clich(c)s. I understand the point he was
making&#151;</div><a name="0907011000135"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907011000399"></a>Mr.
Benyon:</b> &#151;that if we try too hard to tie the
legislation down to being too prescriptive we could end up not trying

that, I am prepared to beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="0907011000137"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907011000400"></a>Mr.
Benyon:</b> I beg to move amendment 13, in
clause 117, page 79, line 14, at
end add&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(9) The Secretary
of State must provide indicative guidance on the types of features to
be protected and the level of protection that would normally be applied
to each
feature.&#146;.</div><a name="09070125000001"></a><div class="hs_brev"><i class="I">This
amendment aims to establish the different types of features likely to

features.</i></div><a name="0907011000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
debate leads seamlessly on from what we have just been talking about
because what we hope to establish are the different types of features
likely to be protected within MCZs and what restrictions and conditions
they will attract. That means, what type of sustainable developments
can or cannot be built on or near various features. The level of
protection and, therefore, conditions and restrictions within MCZs will
inevitably be largely feature-driven. A feature-led approach is
sensible, because it will deliver appropriate and proportionate
protection. The renewable energy sector has some concerns that
essential energy infrastructure will be precluded from being built
across large areas of the marine environment. As has already been said,
one of the greatest environmental threats that we face is climate
change. A balance is needed between marine conservation and the
development of sustainable energy to ensure continued security of the
UK&#146;s energy supplies and the mitigation of climate
change.</div>
<a name="0907011000327"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.30
pm</div><a name="0907011000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">Guidance
providing indicative information on the types of features to be
protected and the likely conditions and restrictions that might
normally apply is vital for two main reasons&#151;first, to assuage
the industry&#146;s concerns and to reassure NGOs and conservation
bodies that the appropriate level of protection will be applied, and,
secondly, to assist the statutory consultees&#151;interest groups,
including developers and the wider general public&#151;in assessing
the likely impact of a marine conservation zone on existing or proposed
activities. Such guidance would not be preclusive and should be
provided on an indicative basis only, as a guide that recognises that
individual management plans will vary depending on the unique
circumstances of each
MCZ.</div><a name="0907011000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment would compel the Secretary of State to provide guidance on an
important matter. I also hope that the Minister will give examples of
the type of features and the likely level of protection, so that
members of the Committee can better understand how MCZs might work in
practice.</div><a name="0907011000142"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907011000401"></a>Andrew
George:</b> I rise in support of the amendment. There are good
reasons why clear advice is required  on both the designation
and the purpose of the designation. What we heard earlier, particularly
in relation to amendment 15, gave rise to
questions not only about the socio-economics, but also about the types
of protection required and the different types of economic activity
that might take place.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column62" />Column number: 62</div><a name="0907011000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member
for Carmarthen, West and South Pembrokeshire&#151;a beautiful
constituency&#151;made a point about the impact of scallop dredging
on flora and fauna on the seabed. If fishing gear is dragged on the
seabed, whether it be scallop dredgers, beam trawlers or other methods,
particularly these days when the power of such vessels is significantly
greater than it was 20 to 30 years ago, the impact on the seabed is
substantial. The matter is a topic of hot debate between not only
conservationists and fishermen, but also between&#151;this is my main
point&#151;different strands of the fishing
industry.</div><a name="0907011000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">Gear
conflict can occur in the 12-mile zone, where scallop dredging, for
instance, can often be in conflict with low-impact fishing techniques,
such as inshore crabbing and other activities. In the experience of
fishermen to whom I have spoken, such fishing activities are
significantly affected by activities such as scallop dredging. Inshore
crabbers often find that the productivity of the ground where they ply
their trade is affected after scallop dredgers have passed through
several times. Inshore crabbers are very selective: they take only
those crabs that have reached a level of maturity that can be landed
and throw back the juveniles to continue living&#151;it is not as if
these crabs suffer the bends and cannot survive afterwards. They return
to their habitat and continue living. So it is a selective method of
fishing.</div>
<a name="0907011000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">Often those in
the inshore crabbing industry&#151;certainly in my part of the
world&#151; fish sustainably in the sense that they are co-fishermen.
Their boats are only powerful enough to go out in relatively mild
conditions&#151;certainly not in treacherous conditions, although
some take the risk from time to time&#151;and they will only steam
out to about 5 or 6 miles from their cove. It is vital for these crab
fishermen, who work together, to maintain a sustainable industry. The
purpose is not to take too much, because the next generation of
fishermen will want a sustainable stock within catching distance of the
cove. However, scallop dredgers clearly have an impact on
that.</div>
<a name="0907011000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">The conflict
between scallop dredging and inshore crabbing has a significance in
many other areas of marine conservation and in other conflicts between
different fishing activities. The hon. Member for Carmarthen, West and
South Pembrokeshire mentioned the need to conserve certain species of
cetaceans. There is a potential conflict between declining numbers of,
for example, bottlenose dolphins and the activities of fishermen who
drop gill nets and fixed gear in inshore waters. That is an issue of
hot debate around the UK coastline. Bottlenose dolphins, which are
found off the south-west and Cornish coast, are now small in number,
despite having been established over many hundreds of years. To lose
one or two of those bottlenose dolphins would be significant. If the
Secretary of State sought to protect a particular species, he would
need to introduce a particular measure to do so. So there is an
importance in that
sense.</div><a name="0907011000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Newbury was right about the importance of requiring the
Secretary of State to establish the different features likely to be
protected within the MCZs, and to be clear about what restrictions and
conditions will be applied and about the types of sustainable
developments that could be built on, or near, these various features. I
shall not list any of the other examples. My point is that some
features deserve pure conservation. Some activities can be permitted
that still allow those 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column63" />Column number: 63</div>features to be protected that the Secretary of State recognises as
deserving. That is where the balance between socio-economics and
conservation can be drawn, and, at that point, to protect those
important features the Secretary of State is required to be clear about
the kinds of economic activity that can take place in certain

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907011000402"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Ann
McKechin):</b> It is a pleasure to serve under your
chairmanship, Mr Pope. As we debate this afternoon, we can all agree
that our seas are a varied and changing habitat and that our
understanding of them is changing rapidly. One aspect is the increasing
effects of climate change on our seas. For example, the temperature off
the west coast of Scotland has increased substantially over the past
few years and, as yet, we are unsure of the exact causes. Is it a
localised effect or related to the Atlantic drift? Only time and
further research will tell.</div>
<a name="0907011000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our network of
marine protected areas will have to include a range of protection
levels dependent upon individual conservation objectives for the area
and the sensitivity of the features being protected. We cannot give a
blanket indication of the levels of protection. It is not as simple as
saying that a certain feature will always need a given type of
protection regardless of where it arises in our seas. Sites with
similar features may have different objectives: we may want to protect
an eelgrass bed in one place as it is and to allow one to recover in
another place. Thus, the protection required would be different and so
it should be on a case-by-case basis. Trying to predict all the
restrictions for all the activities for all the habitats and objectives
would be disproportionate and not really helpful.</div>
<a name="0907011000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand
the aim behind the amendment of the hon. Member for Newbury. I
appreciate the importance for all those with an interest in the sea,
particularly for industries such as the renewables industry, of having
the clearest picture possible of the future shape and impact of our
network. I am also aware that many renewable companies are small and it
is important that we help them to know the costs of what, in many
cases, is a high-risk venture. Several elements of the Bill, primarily
the whole of part 3 on marine planning, aim at giving precisely such a
steer for the first
time,.</div><a name="0907011000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">Part
5 will also add clarity. It sets out the types of features to be
protected under clause 117,
stating:</div><a name="0907011000301"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;marine
flora or fauna;...marine habitats or types of marine
habitat;...features of geological or geomorphological
interest.&#148;</div><a name="0907011000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those
may be rare or threatened or representative species or habitats.
Although it is covered in the Bill, it may  be helpful for me
to expand with some examples. Representative sites such as mudflats,
which provide feeding grounds for animals and are vital for nutrient
recycling, are an example of the types of habitat or species that we
may want to protect. Species may include rarities such as the sunset
cup coral and the pink sea fan.</div>
<a name="0907011000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">We may also
designate breeding grounds as marine conservation zones. For vulnerable
species, such as sharks, skates and rays, seasonal restrictions could
apply during the breeding season. Designating orders themselves, and
any associated byelaws, will add further case-by-case 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column64" />Column number: 64</div>clarity on what conservation objectives have been set and about specific
restrictions in place. That will enable people to take a view on
whether a possible development could impact on an MCZ and on whether it
would be commercially viable.</div>
<a name="0907011000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">None of that
should come as a surprise. Stakeholders who engage in the regional
projects that we are setting up will not only have early warning of how
activities are likely to be regulated, but a hand in determining what
those regulations are. I do not want to give the Committee the
impression that MCZs will always be in opposition to
industry&#151;far from it. As we heard today, activities within an
MCZ will depend upon the conservation objectives. Many will be able to
co-exist in certain areas without any difficulty. There may even be
instances, and renewable energy installations seem a possible
candidate, where industry and MCZs can be mutually supportive over the
long term. I urge the Committee to resist the amendment. The Bill will
provide clarity about what people may do and where, both in the short
term and in the long term. The amendment would commit us to doing more
than we could reasonably
achieve.</div>
<a name="0907011000328"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.45
pm</div><a name="0907011000155"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907011000403"></a>Andrew
George:</b><b class="B"> </b>A moment ago, the Minister mentioned, as
one of her examples, the pink sea fan, which is extremely slow to grow
and can live for up to 100 years. It is found in rocky reef habitats as
well as in mud beds. Given that such sea flora are extremely slow to
grow, surely it is appropriate that an amendment such as this one be
made. If one of the purposes of the Bill is to protect particularly
vulnerable marine flora such as the slow-growing pink sea fan, that
should be made clear by the Secretary of State. It should also be made
clear that every effort must be made to ensure that there is not a
single trawl within a zone that would damage a very vulnerable marine
flora.</div>
<a name="0907011000156"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907011000404"></a>Ann
McKechin:</b> There will be a spectrum of different
protections in each conservation zone. As the hon. Gentleman said, some
flora and fauna will require very high levels of protection in the zone
concerned. We want to ensure that those flora and fauna are clearly
identified as soon as is reasonably possible. However, we also want
flexibility, so that if there is a change in the scientific evidence or
research&#151;there is research in our seas at all times&#151;the
appropriate authorities can react to that change. There must be a
degree of flexibility. That is why we are trying to build that
flexibility into the Bill, so that the regulations are proportionate,
based on hard scientific evidence and flexible, because we know that
our seas are changing and that we have to alter restrictions to fit
that change. If we gave a long list in the Bill itself, we would lack
the flexibility that we need if we want a comprehensive approach to the
protection of our seas. At the same time, including such a long list
would work against the partnership approach that we are trying to
create in our planning, whereby we involve the stakeholders and get
them to come together to work out a series of controls appropriate to
each area.</div>
<a name="0907011000157"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907011000405"></a>Mr.
Benyon:</b> The Minister&#146;s response has clarified a
number of points. The hon. Member for St. Ives made an important point
in talking about Carmarthen bay. We are all aware of some of the tragic
loss of environment in that
particular&#151;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column65" />Column number: 65</div><a name="0907011000158"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907011000406"></a>Andrew
George:</b> Cardigan
bay.</div><a name="0907011000159"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907011000407"></a>Mr.
Benyon:</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman for correcting me. In
Cardigan bay, there has been an appalling depletion of the marine
environment due to certain activities related to shellfish. We must
remember that in the context of this
debate.</div>
<a name="0907011000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
what we can draw out through this amendment and others is an
understanding that certain MCZs will differ vastly even within
themselves. The analogy given to me by Lord Taylor of Holbeach in our
discussions on the Bill is a very good one. He asked me to imagine an
MCZ the size of Devon&#151;I can feel two eyes boring into the back
of my head as I say this&#151;in the sea. There would be an area
within that MCZ that is, for example, Dartmoor and another that is
Exmoor. In the area that is Dartmoor, there could be a particularly
important area of coral reef. The area that is Exmoor could be
particularly important as a spawning ground. The remainder of the MCZ
could have a completely different designation. All those areas require
complex management objectives to be clearly set out in a way that all
interested parties can understand and adhere
to.</div><a name="0907011000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">By
tabling the amendment, I was seeking to create, through guidance,
greater understanding of what the indicative features were. I think
that the Minister has given me sufficient assurance about that, so I
beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div>
<a name="0907011000162"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,
by leave,
withdrawn.</i></div><a name="0907011000163"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question
proposed, </i>That the clause stand part of the
Bill.</div><a name="0907011000164"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907011000408"></a>Mr.
Williams:</b> I remember that, on Second Reading, the hon.
Member for Gower (Mr. Caton) proposed that marine
conservation zones should be designated not only according to the words
in the Bill relating to marine flora and fauna, types of marine
habitats and features of geological or geomorphological interest, but
on the basis of seascapes. He looked at that from the angle of chairman
of the all-party group on areas of outstanding natural beauty. He
represents the Gower, which is an area of outstanding natural beauty in
its own right. I believe that the Minister&#146;s uncle at one time
represented that area in the House.</div>
<a name="0907011000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is often
the seascape that the public cherish most about the sea. Indeed, the
European landscape convention, to which the United Kingdom is a
signatory, defines a seascape
as</div><a name="0907011000302"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;an
area of sea, coastline and land, as perceived by people, whose
character results from the actions and interactions of land and sea, by
natural and/or human
factors.&#148;</div><a name="0907011000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
constituency of the hon. Member for Carmarthen, West and South
Pembrokeshire is an example of an area where the land is designated as
a national park. There is sometimes a heritage coastline or an area of
outstanding national beauty, and the sea is an important part of that
designation.</div>
<a name="0907011000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">Several people
have proposed that we add another qualifying reason to those set out
for the designation of marine conservation zones: the quality of the
seascape itself, especially when it is associated with a coastline that
has already been designated. I know that we have not tabled an
amendment to that effect, but has the Minister reacted to the debate on
Second Reading? Might an amendment on Report produce an encouraging
response?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column66" />Column number: 66</div><a name="0907011000168"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907011000409"></a>Andrew
George:</b> I want to intervene briefly as we are having a
brief stand part debate. As I pointed out on Second Reading, the last
subsection of the clause refers to the remains of</div>
<a name="0907011000303"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;any vessel,
aircraft or marine installation...which are of historic or
archaeological interest.&#148;</div>
<a name="0907011000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">Are those words there
simply to pad the legislation? There is tremendous interest in
important historic features for many reasons, and particularly from
those who want to protect war graves, which are often on the seabed
where vessels have gone down following battles around the UK coast.
However, I do not see any mechanism in the Bill whereby those can be
identified, communicated to the MMO and given the proper protection, so
perhaps the Minister could reassure me on that. I can see how
environmental organisations such as Natural England will be able to
advise the MMO on designation, but I do not see a clear structure
whereby organisations concerned with marine archaeology or the
protection of war graves at sea could ensure that their concerns are
communicated,
too.</div><a name="0907011000170"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907011000410"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> I was originally from the Gower, where my
uncle was MP. I now live in Maesteg and my local beach is Aberavon. I
happen to think that the Gower coast and the marine environment off the
Gower is a superb example of excellence. My boys do surf life-saving at
Aberavon; it has some of the best surfing in Wales and the most
glorious beach as a backdrop. However, I also think that the two train
lines that run from the Port Talbot steelworks form another iconic
seascape.</div>
<a name="0907011000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">The problem is
defining seascape. It is almost like asking &#147;What is
art?&#148;. I know what it is, because I know what I like. Seascape
is important to us. As has been said, we published a definition of
seascape in the high-level objectives, which refers to</div>
<a name="0907011000304"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;An
area of sea, coastline and land whose character results from the
actions and interactions of land with sea by natural and/or human
factors.&#148;</div>
<a name="0907011000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">The problem is where to
stop. Let me elucidate.</div>
<a name="0907011000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">The question
was discussed at length in the other place and raised on Second
Reading. I assure the Committee that the Bill allows for the protection
of seascapes through marine planning and licensing provisions. However,
I do not want to include specific provision for protection of the
seascape in part 5, which deals with nature conservation. We are only
starting to understand what is meant by seascape. We do not yet have a
well-understood and agreed definition, particularly one that would
allow us to identify seascapes that deserved special protection. Would
it be Port Talbot, with those iconic towers in the background and
surfing on the beach or would it be the Gower, with Brandy cove, Fox
Hole, Caswell bay and Rhossili? Or would it be both? That is why I do
not want to include it in part 5.</div>
<a name="0907011000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our ideas on
the subject will evolve over time, as we come to understand more, so it
is vital that we do not enshrine early ideas in legislation. However,
there are many projects looking into the nature of seascapes. The
Government take the issue seriously. We are not there yet, but I assure
the Committee that we want to make progress. For example, English
Heritage is considering the characteristics of historical landscape in
those parts of the marine environment where aggregate
dredging  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column67" />Column number: 67</div>takes place, and Natural England recognises the need to develop a
seascape characterisation of the English coastline in its European
landscape convention action plan.</div>
<a name="0907011000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">I can show how
important a subject it is, but one that is not appropriate here, by
quoting a pertinent point made by Lord Greenaway. He
stated:</div><a name="0907011000305"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;This
is much too broad, at this stage. I appreciate that the Government are
looking at this in the longer term, but seascapes are something that we
did not look at in the pre-legislative scrutiny committee and it is too
early to get too involved in this at this moment in
time.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 12 May
2009; Vol. 710, c.
1020.]</div><a name="0907011000176"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907011000411"></a>Mr.
Swire:</b> I understand that only one coastline in the United
Kingdom has received UNESCO world heritage site status&#151;the
Jurassic and Triassic coastline from Dorset to Devon. Why cannot that
be taken into account in the Bill? Surely if it is good enough for
UNESCO, it is good enough for the
Government.</div>
<a name="0907011000177"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907011000412"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> Indeed. As we bring forward licensing and
development proposals; as we consider the interplay between the coast
and the marine environment, which is what the Bill is about; as we look
at the development of coastal paths, which we will come to later; and
as we consider the development of the marine planning system, only then
will interested bodies such as national parks and consortiums engaged
with special areas of designation, become involved and factor that in.
However, we are talking predominantly about marine conservation per
se.</div>
<a name="0907011000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to
speak briefly about heritage, which was the subject of a good
discussion in the other place. The Government remain committed to
heritage protection legislation. We require specific and comprehensive
heritage protection. We require one Bill to deal with terrestrial and
marine heritage, but we do not have that at the moment. I do not want
to widen the scope of this Bill, as I wish to maintain our focus on the
natural environment in part 5. However, we have worked closely with the
Department for Culture, Media and Sport to ensure that the Bill will
complement future heritage protection legislation, should there be an
opportunity.</div>
<a name="0907011000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">We published
the high-level marine objectives on 20 April. That document talks
specifically about the marine environment&#146;s &#147;natural and
cultural heritage&#148;. The high-level objectives will underpin the
development of the marine policy statement, which will then be applied
in more detail through marine
plans.</div><a name="0907011000329"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6
pm</div><a name="0907011000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government also included two amendments on Report in the other place to
clarify that historic and archaeological characteristics should be
considered in the marine planning process, and that the Secretary of
State may take those considerations into account when designating MCZs.
Those amendments were warmly welcomed in the other place as affording
the right level of protection in the Bill. I think that we all agree
that more comprehensive protection of the cultural marine heritage is
required, and we look longingly to see a heritage protection Bill being
brought forward as soon as parliamentary time allows. Meanwhile, we
have reached a very good conclusion on heritage in this Bill, and I am 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column68" />Column number: 68</div>very thankful to Lord Hunt of Kings Heath, Lord Davies of Oldham and
other peers for all their hard work on this
issue.</div><a name="0907011000181"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

David Jones</b> (Clwyd, West) (Con): I am sure that the
Minister can assist the Committee on a practical point about clause
118(1), which
provides:</div><a name="0907011000306"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;An
order under section 116 must identify the boundaries of the area
designated&#148;</div><a name="0907011000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">as
a marine conservation zone. Presumably, the designation, so far as the
order is concerned, will be by means of a map or plan attached to the
order. As my hon. Friend the Member for Newbury pointed out earlier,
MCZs might be enormous areas of sea, and it would be helpful if the
Minister were to indicate how those areas will be designated and
defined, if at all, on the water.</div>
<a name="0907011000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">This matter is
of some importance given that MCZs will, in many cases, be contiguous,
and it may be of further importance given that, in some cases, they may
be designated by different designating authorities. I have in mind the
Dee estuary, where the authority would be Welsh Ministers on one side
but not on the other, and I am sure that my hon. Friend the Member for
Broxbourne would make a similar, forceful point regarding the Severn
estuary. It would be helpful if the Minister explained how that
practical issue of designation will be tackled once the Bill has been
enacted.</div>
<a name="0907011000187"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907011000414"></a>Nick
Ainger:</b> Following on from that point, I tabled an
amendment to an earlier clause, which we have passed now. My amendment
was not selected because I was too late, and I assure you that I am not
going back to that debate, Mr. Pope. Following on from the
point of the hon. Member for Clwyd, West about estuaries that have
different authorities, particularly around the Welsh border, such as
the Dee and Severn estuaries, I should like to know whether the
different planning authorities will be required to produce a joint
plan. I know that the Government have tabled a relevant amendment. It
is pointless to have different regulation in estuaries such as the Dee,
although we have had that problem in the past, particularly in relation
to cockle fisheries. I would be grateful if the Minister commented on
that in his
response.</div><a name="0907011000188"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907011000415"></a>Mr.
Swire:</b> I want to return to something that we discussed
earlier, which also relates to this clause&#151;places of refuge.
Designating and identifying them, as my hon. Friend the Member for
Clwyd, West said, is one thing, particularly if they are areas the size
of Devon, but the Committee also needs to know what priorities there
are within them. In the United Kingdom system, the Marine Safety Act
2003 provides powers of intervention and direction to the Secretary of
State&#146;s representative for 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column69" />Column number: 69</div>maritime salvage and intervention, working with the Maritime and
Coastguard Agency&#146;s counter-pollution and response branch. The
SOSREP directs vessels to places of refuge when he judges it
appropriate. Anywhere around the UK's coast could be a place of refuge,
and we consider it unwise pre-emptively to rule anywhere in or
out.</div><a name="0907011000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister knows that EU member coastal states should be required to take
measures to receive ships in distress in ports of refuge. That has been
raised through the Erika II package and through the Castor and Prestige
incidents, for example. How will that fit in with marine policy
statements or marine conservation zones, particularly as most MCZs are
likely to be designated before marine planning takes place? Will the
need to find a place of refuge always overrule anything in this
legislation? In other words, should it have been possible to beach the
Napoli at a world heritage site or adjacent to one, or would that
simply have defeated the purpose of the Bill? The marine planning
system must be used to clearly identify places of refuge around our
coast for ships in distress. That could help to avoid stricken ships
being taken to environmentally sensitive
areas.</div><a name="0907011000190"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907011000416"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> I will try to deal with three different
issues, two of which overlap slightly. In another part of the Bill,
when we look at marine plans, we will deal in detail with joint or
cross-border work in, for example, the Severn, Deeside and Solway firth
areas. In the marine planning environment, the Bill provides a number
of obligations and incentives to ensure that marine plan authorities
co-operate and work together seamlessly. We are actively considering
other mechanisms. My hon. Friend the Member for Carmarthen, West and
South Pembrokeshire will know from his time as a Wales Office Minister
that much of the work that was done between Westminster and Wales was
underpinned by concordats and memorandums of understanding, and I fully
anticipate that those are probably the sort of mechanisms that will
underpin the working relationship between the different
Administrations.</div><a name="0907011000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">With
marine conservation zones&#151;a slightly different area to marine
planning&#151;there is an obligation on the different areas bringing
forward cross-border zones to work together. There cannot be an
ecologically coherent network of marine conservation zones in which one
area impacts negatively on another. Proposals cannot be introduced in
one area that lead to the displacement of activity into another, for
example, proposals for the south-west that are to the great benefit of
that area but to the great detriment of Cardigan bay, or vice versa.
The areas have to work together and the MMO has a role in overseeing,
as the projects bringing the marine conservation zones forward are
introduced, that they synchronise properly. That is important, and it
has to work around the UK. One of the big benefits of the Bill is that
it is a UK-wide approach. Even if individual areas introduce marine
conservation zones, what we do in Cornwall and Devon has to relate to
what is going on in Wales. What we are doing on Deeside and in the
north-west has to relate to what we are doing in north Wales, and so
on, all around the
coast.</div><a name="0907011000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am not sure whether the hon. Member for Clwyd, West was referring to
the marking of zones on the
water.</div><a name="0907011000193"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907011000417"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907011000418"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> That is possible; if necessary they can be
marked. To be honest, it will not always be necessary to show movement
from one zone to another, but when it is important, it can, and I am
sure that it will, be
done.</div><a name="0907011000195"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907011000419"></a>Mr.

he decide to go down the road of marking out designated

Irranca-Davies:</b> Indeed. It would certainly not be me who
decided that an area needed physical markers on the sea, but, if that
were the case, I would absolutely expect it to happen and I would
expect to engage with stakeholders. One of the fascinating aspects of
this role is the technology that is now seen onboard vessels and the
extensive science base that shows the mapping of the sea bed. It is
quite astonishing to see how that can be used to prevent vessels from
going into certain
areas.</div><a name="0907011000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for East Devon talked about places of refuse. When it comes
to saving vessels or human lives, there is an issue of priority but
wherever possible we would seek to avoid sensitive areas. This is part
of the balance that we are talking about. There are some very difficult
decisions. The essence of the Bill is to ensure that, where there are
compatible uses we can do that, but where there are not we try to work
around it and find alternative locations.</div>

George:</b> I seek the Minister&#146;s reassurance on an
issue here that is also relevant to clause 121. It comes back to a
theme that I have mentioned before regarding consultation, particularly
the requirement for consultation with coastal local authorities, which
I do not think is emphasised sufficiently in the Bill, and the extent
to which the encouraging words in the Bill can be made more robust or
be tested.</div>

can see no reason why the Minister is not prepared to go further and
state that it must publish notice and one of those locations where the
notice must be published is within those coastal local authorities that
are adjacent to the site designated in the order.</div>
<a name="0907011000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection (3)

does one test the extent to which the appropriate authority has made

does one test the extent to which the appropriate authority has
fulfilled its job? There is no mechanism here to ensure that it has. If
someone who believes that they should have been consulted wishes to
complain or appeal against the manner in which the authority has
discharged its duty here, there is no mechanism for them to raise any
objection.</div>
<a name="0907011000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not want
to stray into a debate on clause 121, but the principle applies to its

states:</div><a name="0907011000310"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The

is the effect of the clause. It has flexibility but places that duty on
the appropriate authority. Failure to publish and comply with those
requirements will be a failure of that duty. I would not want to have
an additional tier of monitoring and double-checking. Anybody not
properly consulted&#151;who has not been subject to the publication
and distribution of the proposals and so on&#151;has the right to
take action. A duty to involve all interested persons is clearly
stated.</div><a name="0907011000214"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907011000423"></a>Andrew
George:</b> The Minister has said that there is an opportunity
for an aggrieved interested party, who finds out that the order has
been made but who has not been consulted, to take action. I can see
nowhere in the Bill where action can be taken by an aggrieved party who
finds out at the eleventh hour that something is going forward that
might damage their interests or an interest they have in marine
matters. It would be reassuring to know what action they can take, as
it is not clear here.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907011000424"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> The ultimate default position, if these
duties have not been complied with, is under subsection (10) which
says:</div><a name="0907011000315"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;If
the appropriate authority fails to make the order before the end of the

purposes of complying with subsections (2) to (9)...is to be treated as
not having been
done.&#148;</div><a name="0907011000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
the appropriate authority fails to engage properly with all the
relevant persons who could be affected, subsection (10) says it has not
complied with its duty and that proposal does not stand. There is also
the option of judicial review. So there are safeguards. The essence of
these MCZs, as we described earlier, is based on early engagement, the
science being put in front of people, and a wide variety of proper
stakeholders. If there is no proper publication,
distribution and consultation, there are failsafes within the clause to
say that the process
falls.</div><a name="0907011000217"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907011000425"></a>Andrew
George:</b> I apologise to hon. Members for becoming rather
pedantic. My reading of subsection (10) is that it simply puts a
timetable on the process, but the Minister has said that the fall-back
position for anyone who feels aggrieved is to pursue the matter through
law. All subsection (10) does is put a 12-month deadline for the
fulfilment of all the other subsections up to subsection

do not wish to be flippant, but, just for clarity, during the clause

amendment seeks to include a sixth subsection to the clause. By placing
a duty on appropriate authorities to inform national representative
bodies of MCZ designations, the amendment would allow sea users, via
bodies such as the British Marine Federation and the Royal Yachting
Association, to comment and give feedback on the proposed zones in a
timely fashion.</div>

windsurfing, inland cruising and personal watercraft. The RYA manages
the British sailing team and Great Britain was the top sailing nation
in the 2000, 2004 and 2008 Olympic games. The RYA and the BMF are
recognised by all Government offices as the negotiating bodies for the
activities that they represent. The RYA has over 100,000 personal
members, the majority of whom choose to go afloat for purely
recreational, non-competitive pleasure on coastal and inland waters. An
estimated further 500,000 boat-owners nationwide are members of over
1,500 RYA-affiliated clubs and class associations. That gives an

we heard during the previous clause stand part debate, there is
unlikely to be any physical designation of MCZs in the sea itself

need to mark such areas on charts and communicate the locations of MCZs
to their members and to local sea users. I should be grateful if the
Minister could clarify whether such bodies will be properly consulted,

needed.</div><a name="0907011000226"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907011000428"></a>Ann
McKechin:</b> I fully agree with the sensible intent behind
the amendment. We have to make sure that we take every reasonable step
to ensure that people who are likely to be affected by an order are
made aware of it. Indeed, the issue is already covered by the Bill. I
draw the attention of the hon. Member for Newbury to an earlier part of
the clause that states that the appropriate authority must publish
notice of the making of an order</div>
<a name="0907011000316"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;in such manner
as the appropriate authority thinks is most likely to bring the order
to the attention of any persons who are likely to be affected by the
making of
it&#148;.</div><a name="0907011000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
assure the hon. Gentleman that organisations such as the RYA, which
shares his concerns, would certainly be included in that
definition.</div><a name="0907011000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause places a duty on the appropriate authority to do everything it
reasonably can to bring an order to the attention of people and
organisations likely to be affected. It also requires the appropriate
authority to make sure that a copy of the order is available for
inspection, and to provide a copy to people who ask for one. The
provision is all about transparency and is very important, because
protection of MCZs will only be improved when more people are aware of
their existence and appreciate what they are for. We have no wish to
have people unwittingly contravening orders because we have failed
properly to publicise
them.</div><a name="0907011000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
practice, I anticipate that the appropriate authority will publish the
order in an appropriate manner, with notifying organisations likely to
be affected by e-mail or letter. Organisations would, I believe,
include the RYA, but they are also very likely to include local
representative organisations which may, in fact, be more directly
affected than some members of the RYA. We do not simply send everything
to everyone, which would be a disproportionate burden; we must allow
the appropriate authority some discretion to make the judgment based on
its experience and expertise of marine matters about who is likely to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column74" />Column number: 74</div>be affected. In doing so, it has to act reasonably. I believe the
clause, as it stands, strikes the right note, and I hope that with the
assurances I have given today the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907011000430"></a>Nick
Ainger:</b> I have been contacted by the Countryside Council
for Wales, which is the statutory advisory body for the Welsh Assembly.
It has raised a number of issues that I would like to bring to the
Committee&#146;s attention. Unfortunately, in the time given, it was
not possible to table an amendment, but I will ask the Minister some
questions.</div>
<a name="0907011000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 123
creates the network of conservation sites, but does not state whether
any of them will be highly protected sites. The CCW is concerned that
some of the sites should be highly protected. It may mean that licensed
marine activity should not be allowed in MCZs, and that neither should
any fishing of any sort take place. In other words we create, as around
Lundy, no-take zones. I would be grateful if the Minister could tell me
if, within clause 123, those highly protected zones can be created to
give the assurance that the CCW is
seeking.</div><a name="0907011000331"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.30

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907011000431"></a>Andrew
George:</b> I am sure that you, Mr. Pope, will
notice&#151;I am sure that the Minister will have noticed&#151;that
I put forward amendment 40, which has not been selected. Perhaps it was
tabled too late for consideration. The amendment achieves what, I hope,
the hon. Member for Carmarthen, West and South Pembrokeshire was asking
for&#151;that the network should include highly protected
sites.</div>
<a name="0907011000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">There may be a
debate around the extent to which such sites might be designated and
what provisions might apply to them. There are a lot of conservation
bodies&#151;not just conservation bodies, but others&#151;who are
concerned that what we may end up with is mediocre protection, which
does not give the highest and strictest levels of protection to some of
the most fragile, sensitive sites of marine biodiversity. Some are
concerned that within the proposed MCZs&#151;rather than separate
from them&#151;we need sites offering the strictest protection for
our most vulnerable wildlife habitats and to allow damaged and degraded
areas to recover. Currently, fewer than 0.001 per cent. of the
UK&#146;s sea area&#151;all of the territorial area&#151;is fully
protected from all damaging activity. Such a network of highly
protected sites should include sites where all extractive and
constructive uses are prevented. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column75" />Column number: 75</div>They could be used for long-term monitoring and benchmarking and act as
control areas, unaffected by many human activities, where such levels
of protection are required to promote the recovery of green
eco-systems. So a case could be made for a higher level of protection
within some parts of the proposed
MCZs.</div><a name="0907011000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister will say that the problem with that proposal is that it would
create a two-tier conservation system and degrade the effect of the
MCZs. But in my view that is sophistry. It is a debating point. My
problem with the argument advanced by the Government in defence of
their position is that it does not apply to other areas of regulation.
For example, different grades of heritage protection apply to the
schedule of ancient monuments, but that does not diminish the
protection of areas not given the highest level of protection. It also
applies in different areas of planning and the environment. The impact
of MCZs will be diminished only if the MMO, and the bodies supporting
it, do not have the authority of those with an interest in marine
conservation and the impact on the marine environment. That relates
partly to the resources that the Government invest in the organisation
and the respect that it commands among stakeholders with an interest,
from any angle, in marine conservation and the recovery of resources
from the sea&#151;all those industries with an interest in the marine
resource.</div><a name="0907011000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that the Minister will reflect on my proposal. No amendment is
available on this matter for us to divide on, but given that it is one
of the totemic issues for many conservation bodies, we might well
return to it on Report. Even though he will have the opportunity to bat
it away today, given that no amendment is available on which we can
divide, I hope that he will reflect on the matter. He should recognise
that such highly protected areas need not be separate from MCZs, but
contained within them, which might encourage him to allow them to
feature in the
Bill.</div><a name="0907011000241"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907011000432"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> In respect of the contribution from my
hon. Friend the Member for Carmarthen, West and South Pembrokeshire, I
understand the concerns of the CCW, and I am very pleased to say that
Welsh Ministers have already indicated their intention to introduce
areas that are more highly protected than others. It is probably a
recognition of where we have got to in this Bill that we have a genuine
UK joined-up approach. As he will understand, it is up to them to
decide where to introduce those proposals, but they have signalled that
they intend to do so&#151;as do we.</div>
<a name="0907011000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me address
the points that the hon. Member for St. Ives made. As he recognised,
there is no amendment to debate, but this is a good opportunity to
explain further. All MCZs will be jewels, as I referred to them
earlier, but they will be very different; some will have high levels of
protection, whether one wants to call them highly protected areas or
simply acknowledge that they will be highly protected. The Government
have always been committed to ensuring that the Bill provides the right
level of protection for zones, according to the objectives of each zone
and the science that underpins them, which we discussed earlier. I have
absolutely no doubt that there will be high levels of protection for
areas that are particularly fragile or irreplaceable.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column76" />Column number: 76</div><a name="0907011000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me make it
clear that the Bill fully enables Ministers to designate MCZs with high
levels of protection. Moreover, that is recognised in the reporting
duty in clause 124(2), which requires Ministers to report to Parliament
not only on the number of MCZs, but on the number of MCZs where any
licensable marine activity such as fishing or taking animals or plants
has been prohibited or significantly restricted. So, it is pretty clear
that we expect there to be areas where activities will be prohibited or
significantly restricted, because we will have to have a reporting
function on that.</div>
<a name="0907011000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not want
to fix in law a definition of what highly protected means, because
including such a term in the Bill would require a definition that would
not be right in all cases because of the variety involved. What
constitutes a high level of protection in one area will not be high
enough in another, or, in contrast, may be too high for another. One
size of high-level protection simply does not fit all, and we have
recognised that by maintaining flexibility in the Bill to provide the
appropriate level of protection in each case, based on the
science&#151;whatever that level might be. One important issue that
was remarked on in the other place is that we do not want to end up
with a two-tier system of highly protected MCZs&#151;the Rolls-Royce,
as they were described, that everyone strives for&#151;and a lower
class of MCZs that are not quite as deserving of protection and
attention. They will all be an essential part of our network.</div>
<a name="0907011000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not want
to risk any of that happening, but I will give the hon. Member for St.
Ives one assurance, regardless of the fact that we are not debating an
amendment. MCZs will include areas that have not only a high level of
protection, but a high level of protection where extractive industries,
for example, are prohibited. I hope that he and my hon. Friend the
Member for Carmarthen, West and South Pembrokeshire have been reassured
by my comments, not least as the Welsh Ministers have already indicated
their intention to introduce such
proposals.</div><a name="0907011000246"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907011000433"></a>Nick
Ainger:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for that explanation
but will he finally clarify this point? Is he saying that, of the MCZs
or special sites that will form the network, some may be designated as
highly protected areas&#151;appropriately, given the nature of their
environment&#151;under clause
123?</div><a name="0907011000247"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907011000434"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> I understand what my hon. Friend is
asking, but there will not be a two-tier system. There will not be a
title that says, &#147;Here is the Rolls-Royce MCZ, called the
HPA&#148;&#151;or whatever&#151;&#147;and here is
another.&#148; This clause, in tandem with clauses 124 and others,
allows us to designate highly protected areas where there are such
significant restrictions that we will have a duty to report on them and
on how they are progressing. The capacity is there to deliver them, but
we will not call them a Rolls-Royce or a
Mini.</div><a name="0907011000248"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907011000435"></a>Andrew
George:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for his explanation,
although I do not accept the two-tier argument that he advanced. He
drew attention to clause 124(2)(c), which states that the report that
has to be written must
include</div><a name="0907011000317"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
number of MCZs
designated&#148;</div><a name="0907011000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">in
which the activities he described</div>
<a name="0907011000318"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;are prohibited
or significantly restricted&#148;.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column77" />Column number: 77</div><a name="0907011000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">He says that the report
must contain such information, but the answer in the report may be nil.
There is no requirement in the Bill to ensure that such places are
designated; there is simply a requirement to report on the number of
MCZs in which those activities are restricted. The Minister wanted to
reassure me, but I am reassured only that the measure takes us in the
right direction. There is no requirement to ensure that such places are
designated.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907011000436"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> I disagree with the hon. Gentleman. In an
earlier debate, we talked about introducing not only individual MCZs,
but an ecologically coherent network based on the available science. I
challenge not only myself but any subsequent Minister who reports to
the House that they have not designated any highly protected areas to
stand in the House and not be laughed down. The intention is clear, and
it is clear that we have the capacity. We must now use that framework
and get on and do it.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907011000438"></a>Nick
Ainger:</b> This is another issue that has been brought to my
attention by the Countryside Council for Wales, which is concerned that
public authorities could grant consent for an activity that could
damage an MCZ. It suggests that the same principles and rules that
apply to land-based planning decisions should apply to marine planning
decisions. In other words, if a public authority were minded to grant a
consent that could directly affect and damage an MCZ, it should have to
inform either the UK Minister or a Welsh Assembly Minister, as it would
when dealing with a departure from an existing structure plan or
whatever in land-based
planning.</div><a name="0907011000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
the CCW suggests that there should be a power for the Government or the
Welsh Assembly Government to call in such applications. I would be
grateful for the Minister&#146;s comments on those ideas. They have
merit, because at the end of the day, we rightly restrict the powers of
local planning authorities or national parks that are minded to grant a
consent that is in breach of their policies on the ground that it is in
the wider public interest. We should apply the same restrictions to any
public authority that is minded to grant or permit an activity or
development that could damage an MCZ. I would be grateful for the
Minister&#146;s comments on that
proposal.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907011000439"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> It may be worth giving an example to
illustrate how it might work. &#147;Public authorities&#148; are
defined in clause 316, and mean a Minister of the Crown, a public body
or a public office holder. For nature conservation, the phrase
encompasses local authorities, Government bodies, Government
Departments, the MMO and local planning authorities. A concrete example
is that it could be necessary in some circumstances for a public
authority to carry out certain specific activities that will not
further the conservation objections for a MCZ. If a local authority
needed to repair a lighthouse in an MCZ with a high level of
protection, the necessary work may not further the conservation
objectives for the site in the short term, so it is important that the
Bill provides for such
circumstances.</div><a name="0907011000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
hon. Friend the Member for Carmarthen, West and South Pembrokeshire
raises an important point: what happens if the public authorities fall
short or hinder the conservation objectives? We have included
provisions in clause 125 to ensure that public authorities are under a
duty to carry out their functions in a way that best furthers the
conservation objectives for an MCZ. If the statutory conservation body
considers  that a public body has failed to comply with the
duty, clause 128 provides that the statutory conservation
body can request an explanation for the failure from that public
authority. Whether it is a local authority or somebody making repairs
to a lighthouse, they can be pulled up and asked to explain why, in
carrying out their work, they did not do their best to protect the
interests of the MCZ.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907011000440"></a>Nick
Ainger:</b> I am grateful for the explanation, but it gives me
cause for concern, because a local planning authority may be asked to
account for a decision but the fact remains that that decision is made
and has gone ahead, thereby causing damage to an MCZ. I suggest that
before such a decision is implemented, the Welsh Assembly Government,
the Scottish Executive or a Government Department should be able,
first, to insist that they are notified if there is a departure from
conservation objectives and, secondly, to call the decision or
application in and hold a public inquiry if they remain concerned. That
is the situation under the Town and Country Planning Act 1990. There do
not seem to be such provisions in this Bill. My concern, and the
concern of the Countryside Council for Wales, is that without those
provisions, we may see unnecessary damage to MCZs. It is all very well
for the planning authority to have to account for its actions, but such
a provision, which exists in land-based planning, should apply to
marine planning as well. I am not going to push for a Division on the
clause, but I suggest that the Minister take the idea away, look at it
and bring something back on

is a short but important amendment. The text is there for hon. Members
to see. It aims to minimise the cost of environmental impact
assessments and subsequent monitoring. The key sentence
is:</div><a name="0907011000319"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
costs of this monitoring should be reasonable and proportionate with
respect to the scale, costs and environmental benefits of the
project.&#148;</div><a name="0907011000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
of the marine renewables industry&#146;s greatest concerns is the
cost of environmental impact assessments and the subsequent monitoring
of them, as it could potentially destroy the UK&#146;s wave and tidal
energy sector. In my opening words this morning, I said that it was
important that the Bill stand the test of time. Developing technologies
are going to be fundamental and vital in how we progress our approach
to climate change and development of renewable energy systems. On
Second Reading, the hon. Member for Brighton, Kemptown (Dr. Turner)
spoke about the situation in Strangford loch. The marine current
turbine development in Strangford loch provides a concrete example of
the disproportionate costs for small firms, with &#163;4 million
attributable to the stipulated environmental monitoring programme for a
project with an initial budget of less than &#163;10 million. This is
a really important emerging technology. If we constrain that kind of
development and technological advance through prohibitive costs we have
a
problem.</div><a name="0907011000267"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907011000442"></a>Andrew
George:</b> The hon. Gentleman is making an important point
that certainly affects the experimental wave hub project, which the
Government are keen to promote off the north coast of my constituency.
That highlights the fact that two arms of Government policy are in
conflict, but the Government can resolve that conflict by requiring the
MMO to co-operate as much as possible in providing information, data
and support to any body or industry seeking to provide the necessary
data for the environmental impact assessment of the type the hon.
Gentleman says is going to be costly. Surely it demonstrates the need
for co-operation between one arm of Government and
another.</div><a name="0907011000268"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907011000443"></a>Mr.
Benyon:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his
comments and support for what I am seeking to achieve. The amendment is
reasonable and would be greatly welcomed by a lot of people seeking to
develop emerging technologies that will be important to us in future. I
hope that the Minister will recognise that in his remarks, because this
is something I feel strongly about and will push, if required, to a
vote.</div><a name="0907011000269"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907011000444"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> I hope the hon. Gentleman does not push it
to a vote because, while the amendment is well intentioned, it might
not do what it is intended to do. The approach we have taken with MCZs
is based on achieving conservation objectives in a focused and
intelligent way. That is what is in the Bill. We want a conservation
mechanism that is an easy tool for everyone to work 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column80" />Column number: 80</div>with and, as the hon. Gentleman said, does not impose unnecessary
burdens on any sector or interests. I agree with the thrust of the
amendment which, as he has just explained, is concerned to ensure that
statutory conservation bodies advise on monitoring activities in MCZs
and that the costs of such monitoring should be reasonable and
proportionate. I do not think that anybody will disagree with
that.</div>
<a name="0907011000270"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 127
outlines the scope of the advisory role of the statutory conservation
bodies. It gives the bodies a power, and in some circumstances a duty,
to give advice and guidance on a range of matters in relation to MCZs,
which could include marine monitoring requirements where appropriate.
These bodies also have general powers to offer advice to public
authorities and make representations to them. Public authorities would
have to take such advice and representations into account when making
decisions. I fully expect the conservation bodies to carry out the
advisory functions under the Bill, like all their functions, in a
reasonable manner without specific requirement in the Bill. The
amendment would require that an advance assessment be made of the costs
of monitoring requirements, as well as overall project costs and the
value of any environmental benefits. That would probably be an
impossible obligation for conservation bodies to fulfil in their
advisory capacity. It is important that we do not blur the distinction
between the responsibilities for giving advice and for making
decisions&#151;between advisory bodies and those who take the
decisions. It is for the licensing authority, rather than conservation
bodies, to determine what conditions need to be attached to any licence
that they issue.</div>
<a name="0907011000271"></a><div class="hs_Para">Licensing
authorities, such as the MMO, which will issue marine licences under
part 4 of the Bill, will receive advice from conservation bodies, but
will also take into account a number of other factors, including
socio-economic ones, when determining whether to grant a licence and,
if they do, what conditions should be placed on it. That could include
environmental monitoring. Any environmental monitoring conditions in a
licence granted by a licensing authority should be proportionate to the
environmental risks posed by the development, and not proportionate to
the total costs of the
project.</div><a name="0907011000272"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907011000445"></a>Mr.
Benyon:</b> I entirely agree that it needs to be
proportionate. Will the Minister tell me where that appears in the
Bill? This is
important.</div><a name="0907011000273"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907011000446"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> I shall indeed return to that point.
Monitoring will not always be necessary, but it is likely to be more
important for larger developments, those in environmentally sensitive
areas and where the impact of experimental technologies is difficult to
predict. For example, the MFA has approved three pilot wind and tidal
developments in England and Wales, two of which do not have any
environmental monitoring conditions attached. The third has limited
monitoring conditions because of its location right next to a special
area of conservation protected under European habitats
legislation.</div><a name="0907011000274"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is important to recognise, however, that we are not creating a one-way
process. Monitoring will often be required, but I want to see a proper
two-way dialogue between the authorities and the developers about how
best to carry out that monitoring. That will include ensuring that the
costs are reasonable. It is a process 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column81" />Column number: 81</div>that often takes place now, as I just illustrated, but I want it to be
strengthened and built on in future. We have the capacity to deliver
that in the Bill. It is happening on the ground in many places, and I
hope that my words of assurance on how I want this measure to b taken
forward will allow the hon. Gentleman to withdraw his amendment. It is
well intentioned, but it would place a burden on conservation advisers
that they are not equipped to deal with. For the reasons that I have
laid out, it is probably not appropriate to have to estimate in advance
the costs of every proposal and its
monitoring.</div>
<a name="0907011000275"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907011000447"></a>Mr.
Benyon:</b> The difficulty is that the Minister&#146;s
points are relatively subjective. Unless we have a commitment that
binds future Ministers and authorities, together with a proportionate
approach, the kinds of difficulties faced in Strangford lough could
happen elsewhere. I am not in the business of limiting environmental
accountability and protection. I believe that environmental impact
assessments, certainly for large-scale wind-powered developments are
necessary. However, he has yet to provide any evidence of
proportionality in the Bill. I think that inspiration might be on its
way, in which case I am very happy to allow him to intervene. That
might encourage me to withdraw the amendment. I look forward to his
intervention.</div><a name="0907011000276"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907011000448"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> I might be able to provide some clarity on
two aspects. First, clause 71(1) enables the MMO to put conditions into
licences as it thinks fit. If those conditions are unreasonable, an
appeals mechanism 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column82" />Column number: 82</div>is in place for developers to challenge them. Secondly, I want to flag
up what would happen if a statutory conservation body was to give
disproportionate or unreasonable advice. I hope that will not happen,
but if public authorities must have regard to the advice received from
a statutory conservation body, it is not bound by it, and the authority
would be very unlikely to follow any advice deemed inappropriate for
whatever reason. One improvement that we have made to the licensing
system is to introduce an appeals mechanism that will give applicants
the ability to appeal any decision made by the licensing authority, so
if a developer thinks that the conditions attached to the licence are
too onerous or unjustified it can challenge that decision before an
independent
body.</div><a name="0907011000277"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907011000449"></a>Mr.
Benyon:</b> I am grateful for that inspired response, which
will give the necessary comfort to those seeking to develop different
types of wave and sea energy, who will be reassured to know that they
have the comfort of a full independent appeals process and that some
wording on proportionality exists in the legislation. I beg to ask
leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="0907011000278"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,
