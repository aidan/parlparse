<H5>4.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. John Redwood </B>(Wokingham): I had almost concluded my remarks. I had taken the Committee through the Opposition's line of thinking on amendment No. 61, and we had just reached consideration of the fourth paragraph, (d)--``franchise agreements''.
<P>
<B>Mr. Desmond Browne </B>(Kilmarnock and Loudoun): I listened carefully to the right hon. Gentleman as he set out his arguments. He said repeatedly this morning that clause 18 will make illegal the types of commercial practice listed in his amendment, and that, accordingly, such practices required ``comfort''--I think that that was the word that he used--otherwise, there is no point to the amendment. As subsection (1) sets out a general prohibition of abuse of a dominant or monopolistic position in the market, and as subsection (2) merely lists examples of what might constitute abuse, can the right hon. Gentleman explain what interpretation of the clause necessitates his list of exceptions?
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> That is exactly what I argued this morning. The clause works in an interesting way, as the hon. Gentleman said. First it sets out a general prohibition, then, for the benefit of people trying to follow the Bill, it specifies a series of examples of abuse. It does so for no apparent good reason, because the list is not comprehensive; it is merely a series of suggestions--presumably of the more likely cases of abuse--that leaves open the opportunity to bring a case outside the framing of paragraphs (a) to (d).
<P>
<B>Mr. Browne</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> May I finish answering the hon. Gentleman, and then he can have another go?
<P>
In the spirit of the Bill, the Opposition have said that if the Under-Secretary thinks it necessary to give examples of abuse, it is also necessary for the guidance of businesses to give counter-examples of legitimate business practices that would not constitute abuse. The four examples are largely modelled on threats and problems we foresee with the examples of abuse set out in the Bill.
<P>
I have not argued that all of the things that I am trying to exempt would definitely be caught by the Bill. I hope to draw the Under-Secretary into confirming my interpretation that in normal circumstances none of the examples in the amendment would be caught by the Bill. I trust that the hon. Gentleman will agree that they should not.
<P>
I have said that it would be helpful if the Under-Secretary confirmed for the record that our four categories are not intended to be caught. He has confirmed that in his view half of one of them would not be caught. It would still be better for the proper guidance of the courts to add the provisions of our amendment to the types of abuse listed in subsection (2).
<P>
<B>Mr. Browne:</B> Is it the right hon. Gentleman's intention that practices that fall within his examples of exceptions in the amendment will in no circumstances be considered an abuse of a dominant or monopolistic position in the market. If not, what value would the amendment add to the clause as drafted?
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> The intention is that in normal circumstances the four ideas listed in our amendment would not constitute abuse, but of course it would be for the authorities to decide whether a practice was a genuine bulk discount or whether it was
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``applying dissimilar conditions to equivalent transactions'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
as stated in clause 18(2)(d), which would be an abuse as constituted.
<P>
If the Bill refers to one side of an argument, in fairness the other side should also be mentioned, so that business can see that there is both a threat and a defence. The clause is worded strangely because it sets out the threats to business and opportunities for consumers, but it does not set out a defence. There are defences, but it will ultimately be a matter for the competition authority to make a judgment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Browne:</B> I am very interested in the vocabulary that the right hon. Gentleman is using to explain his amendment. It cannot be correct to say that the amendment sets out a defence. The only defence to an accusation of a breach of the prohibition in the clause is that it is not an abuse of a monopolistic or dominant position in the market. One could list examples indefinitely, but it would make no fundamental difference to the clause, or its application.
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> The drafting of the original legislation is then extremely difficult to explain. The amendment mirrors the drafting of the existing clause, which sets out examples of abuse. I would have more sympathy with the proposal if it were left at clause 18(1) and it was entirely up to the competition authority and the court to decide what is an abuse, or if the legislation neither suggested what an abuse was or how to defend oneself against a charge of an abuse of a dominant position. But, if there are examples in the Bill on how an abuse is established, how to establish a defence should be mentioned.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Lansley </B>(South Cambridgeshire): I imagine that like me, my right hon. Friend has looked at the draft guidance prepared by the Office of Fair Trading. What is in the Bill is reflected directly in those draft guidelines. The Director General of Fair Trading elaborates in the guidelines the examples of what might represent an abuse, as contained in the Bill. Therefore, it should be for the director general to elaborate how the examples in the amendment might not be considered as an abuse of a dominant position.
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> My hon. Friend makes a powerful and sensible point. The Government should explain why they think it is appropriate to specify examples of abuse but not necessary to offer lines of defence?
<P>
More importantly, the main intention behind the amendment is to tease out from the Government what they are trying to catch. That brings us back to the fundamental problem with the Bill. The many business men to whom I have spoken, who are worried about the Bill, always come back to the same question. They say, ``As a Committee member and a shadow spokesman, can you tell us whether what we are doing now, which we think is in the interests of customers as well as our business, will or will not be legal?'' By asking question of the Under-Secretary, I am trying to respond to the questions put to me by business. Business needs to know the answers.
<P>
<B>The Minister for Competition and Consumer Affairs (Mr. Nigel Griffiths):</B> The right hon. Gentleman is not a lawyer.
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> The Under-Secretary says that I am not a lawyer. Neither, I hasten to add, am I charging for the service. But I am a legislator, and it is perfectly reasonable for business interests to ask me or any other member of the Committee what is the intention of the legislation? I find it difficult to answer that question, as does the Under-Secretary. But he owes us a little more information in response to our important amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Boswell </B>(Daventry): If it is impossible for either my right hon. Friend, with his experience, or the Under-Secretary to answer those questions definitively, it merely intensifies our case that businesses of all shapes, sizes and types that act responsibly will have to have recourse to their lawyers, at considerable expense, in order to elucidate whether they are compliant with a law of which they do not know the details?
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> Indeed. In summary, the Opposition believe that, in usual circumstances, offering a bulk discount is helpful not only to the company producing the goods or service, but to the customer. We believe that promotional discounts are reasonable business practice and that existing contracts, save those that are under examination by the competition authority, or could be put under examination immediately by the President of the Board of Trade, should be regarded as being reasonable and deserve grandfather rights during the transition period. We believe that reasonable support to a brand enforced or encouraged on retailers by a manufacturer is a reasonable business practice, and we believe that most franchise agreements are reasonable.
<P>
What is the Government's objection to specifying that in the Bill, to give comfort to all the many businesses that do not indulge in anti-competitive practices under the current legislation? We think that they should get similar comfort from the Bill. That is the amendment's intention. It will have made progress if the Under-Secretary can tell me that all current legitimate business practices will not be prevented by the new legislation. It would be even better if he would concede the desirability of including it--or something similar--in the Bill.
<P>
I do not believe that my list is comprehensive enough, just as I think that the list of abuses--the four paragraphs in subsection (2)--does not do full justice to the range of abuses that dominant players can perpetrate. My list does not do full justice to the number of legitimate defences there could be, and I should be happy if the Under-Secretary were to point out some more and add them as well.
<P>
<B>Dr. Stephen Ladyman </B>(South Thanet): I rise briefly to point out an abuse that will be allowed if the amendment is accepted. Clause 18, in conjunction with European jurisprudence, sets out a mechanistic way in which to determine whether pricing is being set appropriately. That method involves the cost of production and supply to the person who sets the price.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Dr. Ladyman:</B> If the hon. Gentleman will let me finish my point, I shall gladly give way.
<P>
Clearly, bulk discounts are perfectly permissible within the terms of the Bill because if the bulk supply means that costs are reduced, the price to the customer can also be reduced. If the amendment is accepted, all bulk discounts, whether anti-competitive or not, will be allowed. It would be possible to offer a discount that was out of all proportion to the cost saving that could be made as a result of the bulk supply. That could be done in order to allow a supermarket chain to drive out of business small customers, at which point the supplier could raise his price. That would be an abuse that would be allowed by the amendment. The Opposition must consider their attitude to such an abuse. Is this another example, as we saw in this morning's sitting, of the Opposition trying to do damage with their amendments, and that if such amendments are accepted, they will then try to think of appropriate ways to put right the damage that they have created?
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> When the hon. Gentleman talks about the relationship between price and cost, is it a legitimate business practice for a supplier, who is developing a new product, to offer a substantial discount to a company that will get that product going for it when the costs the supplier has in mind merely cover the overhead costs and not the variables?
<P>
<B>Dr. Ladyman:</B> It would not be an abuse of a dominant position. If companies doing that were able to justify their action on the basis of costs saved to themselves--because the customers were doing work on their behalf, testing, evaluating, leading them in a marketing campaign or by being prepared to share risk with them--they would perfectly safe. They would not be abusing their position. They would not be in an anti-competitive position and their actions would be allowed under the Bill.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I think that the hon. Gentleman misunderstands. Does he agree that bulk discounts in that context can be interpreted to mean only those discounts that are justified by reference to the cost saving for a supplier in supplying in bulk, as distinct to supplying in some disaggregated form? If the supplier were to go beyond the cost savings that accrued to him, that would prima facie constitute predatory pricing if it brought the price below the average variable cost. But that is not what the amendment is intended to protect; it is intended to protect a manufacturer who passes on to his customers the cost saving that accrues through delivering in bulk.
<P>
<B>Dr. Ladyman:</B> My point is that the amendment would allow people to pass on not only the savings that they make by delivering and supplying in bulk, but futher price reductions out of all proportion to the savings made. The amendment is quite specific--it would allow all bulk discounts. It would therefore introduce the possibility of anti-competitive action.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I rise merely to help the hon. Gentleman. He is a serious member of the Committee and often makes intelligent points. It might help if, when he reads the amendment, he implicitly adds its first words:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Nothing in this section prevents--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) offering bulk discounts''.
<P>
</UL></FONT>My right hon. Friend's intention is that if a business can establish that that was all that it was doing by giving a bulk discount, it would be exempted from the force of the clause.
<P>
<B>Dr. Ladyman:</B> No words in the amendment qualify ``bulk discounts''; it simply states, ``bulk discounts''. A supplier could easily make a case that it was his intention--
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. John Bercow (Buckingham)</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>Dr. Ladyman:</B> Let me finish answering the hon. Member for West Dorset. I shall then sit down, Mr. Atkinson, and others may be able to catch your eye.
<P>
A bulk discount could easily be introduced by a supplier to indicate that when a supply went over a particular amount he would give price reductions out of all proportion to the savings that he made in delivering such bulk. He could do that with the intention of allowing large retailers to drive small retailers out of business. The amendment is poorly worded and would allow practices that would be excluded under the Bill.
<P>
Several hon. Members rose--
<P>
<B>Dr. Ladyman:</B> I shall not give way. I shall conclude my comments and then listen to hon. Members fawning obeisance to the shadow President of the Board of Trade.
<P>
The amendment would allow an abuse that I do not believe the Opposition want. It should be rejected.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I shall first answer the argument of the hon. Member for South Thanet. It is perfectly open to the Government, if they believe that the amendment is mis-worded but has the right intent, to come forward with their own version. The fact that the amendment includes the words:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Nothing in this section prevents''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
does not mean that anything that qualifies under one of the amendment's categories is, ipso facto, exempt from the clause. It means that nothing in the section prevents those things, as such. In court, it would fall to the judge to decide whether the item in question could be so categorised. The only prima facie basis for assuming that it was an abuse of a dominant position would be that it was a bulk discount, and if so, and only then, would it qualify under proposed subsection (2A)(a). The hon. Gentleman is nit-picking.
<P>
<B>Mr. Browne:</B> I agree with the hon. Gentleman's interpretation of the amendment. It is for that reason that I identify a split between the hon. Gentleman and his Front Bench spokesman. Does the hon. Gentleman accept that, contrary to what the right hon. Member for Wokingham has been arguing vociferously for some time, the amendment does not provide a defence? Secondly, does the hon. Gentleman agree that subsection (2) does not list breaches?
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I entirely agree that subsection (2) does not list breaches. It clearly lists prima facie breaches. It states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Conduct may, in particular, constitute . . . if''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is intended to give the judge a set of categories, so that if he thinks something fits into them, the thing in question probably qualifies under subsection (1).
<P>
The articulation of amendment No. 61 is symmetrical. It is intended to give the judge another set of characteristics; they may not be definitive in terms of subsection (1) but they give the judge a set of characteristics of which he can say that if the item in question fits into one of those categories, prima facie it is not covered by subsection (1). That is the intention.
<P>
The hon. Members for Kilmarnock and Loudoun (Mr. Browne) and for South Thanet (Dr. Ladyman) between them have a considerable amount of intellect--[Interruption.] I did say between them, Mr. Atkinson; it could have been construed as rude.
<P>
If the hon. Gentlemen wish to suggest a modifiction to amendment No. 61 to make its intent clearer, I am sure that my right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood), with all his wetness and generosity, would accept that proposition. The point that I am trying to make is that there should be common ground between the two sides of the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> My hon. Friend has already made the point so forcefully that my intervention may be superfluous. However, my hon. Friend has made the point so well that there seems no harm in underlining it.
<P>
Is not the essence of the problem that the hon. Member for South Thanet is guilty of thinking that the term ``nothing prevents''--[Interruption.] My right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham suggests that the hon. Gentleman is guilty of thinking. I shall not be so unkind. Is not the essence of the problem that the hon. Gentleman wrongly equates the term ``nothing prevents'' with the term ``everything guarantees''? The two terms are not synonymous.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> With that definitive, authoritative and magisterial dictum, I rest my case.
<P>
I rose to speak about another aspect of the amendment. The hon. Member for South Thanet made an error, not of the sort that we have described, but of substance. Unless my eyes deceive me, clause 18 does not define what it is to abuse a dominant position; it is left to European jurisprudence to be translated into English law. Nor, contrary to the hon. Gentleman's assertion, does the clause define what it is to sell at a price that is predatory. That definition appears--bizarrely, in the light of the hon. Gentleman's remarks--in clause 19. I shall not be in the least surprised to discover that the Government want to delete clause 19, thereby eliminating the definition in question.
<P>
<B>Dr. Ladyman:</B> I did not refer to clause 19; however, the hon. Gentleman is right to say that I shall certainly want to see it removed from the Bill. I pointed out that clause 18, taken in conjunction with European case law, makes clear how predatory pricing is to be calculated. Such a test is purely mechanistic. To say that nothing prevents ``bulk discounts'' is the same as saying that bulk discounts are allowed. Without defining more precisely how bulk discounts are to be calculated, the amendment would allow the abuse whereby pricing may not be directly in proportion to the savings made by delivering in bulk.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> The problem is that the first part of the hon. Gentleman's remarks were not true. I am sure that that was not his intention. It is not the clause in conjunction with European jurisprudence that could clarify predatory pricing. It contains no reference to that. European jurisprudence would have to make clear the meaning of predatory pricing. I think that the hon. Gentleman meant to say that European jurisprudence applies such a mechanistic test.
<P>
<B>Mr. Browne:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I shall in a moment, but I wish first to develop my point as it is important to the Bill. I do not believe that European jurisprudence can create in English law a mechanistic test. The Under-Secretary may be under the illusion that it can and perhaps it is on that basis that he rests the clause. I shall explain my argument. First, by and large, English judges will not be involved in such matters. The Under-Secretary has carefully tried to keep them out of such proceedings.

<P>

<B>Dr. Ladyman</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I shall give way in a moment.
<P>
The Director General of Fair Trading will apply the clause. Secondly, I refer to the new Competition Commission, about whose proceedings we know nothing. We do not know who its members will be, how far they will be influenced by European jurisprudence or whether they will be economists. If they are economists, we do not know whether they will be of an Austrian or other persuasion. Judgments could be made on predatory pricing that have nothing to do with judgments that have arisen during European jurisprudence. Nothing in the Bill prevents that from being the case.
<P>
<B>Dr. Ladyman:</B> I take issue with the hon. Gentleman. I understand that there is a clause that requires English courts to take into account European jurisprudence. That jurisprudence, in conjunction with subsection (1), makes it clear how predatory pricing should be defined and how pricing that is fair should be defined. That could be usable as a defence if one were accused of an anti-competitive practice while giving a bulk discount.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> The hon. Gentleman refers in particular to clause 60(2), the first line of which states :
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``At any time when the court determines''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That may be an example of bad drafting, but I take it that such a provision was intentional. It limits the interpretative provisions of the Bill to courts. In other parts of the Bill, the Under-Secretary has specifically kept the courts out of the matter. That is highly regrettable and my right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham and I, and one or two others, have tabled amendments that would reintroduce the courts much earlier in the proceedings. That would help to solve the problem.
<P>
There is nothing to make the Competition Commission or the Director General of Fair Trading interpret clause 18 in the light of European jurisprudence. Furthermore, there is not the slightest reference to European jurisprudence in the director general's so-called guidance. Although he may have had some personal nodding acquaintance with European jurisprudence, I speculate that the lack of reference to it is because he has had no professional reason to be so familiar with it in the past.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> My hon. Friend will have noted in clause 60(4) that the provisions to which he is referring apply to the Director General of Fair Trading, but not to the Secretary of State. He will also have noted from the provision, which bites on the point made by the hon. Member for South Thanet, that even when a court is considering such questions, it considers only the corresponding questions. ``Corresponding'' has not been defined. It would be out of order for us to debate that now, but I am sure that we will debate it later.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> That is absolutely right, although the omission from subsection (3) that is more significant than that of the Secretary of State is that of the commission. It is the commission that will ultimately determine matters under the Bill. For a reason that is wholly obscure to me, the commission is exempt from the provisions.
<P>
<B>Dr. Ladyman:</B> The hon. Gentleman now seems to be arguing that because clause 60 states that courts must take European jurisprudence into account, the director general will somehow not have to do so--that he is exempt from that requirement and can take any decision that he likes. The director general will be responsible for carrying out the provisions of the Bill. If he does not do that, he will soon find himself in court having to explain why he did not take account of European jurisprudence.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I am sorry, but the hon. Gentleman is not right. As my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley) pointed out, the Bill forces the director general to apply its provisions. However, he will not be taken to court under the Bill; he will be taken to the Competition Commission, which is specifically not covered by the interpretative provisions. The matter is much worse than that; that is merely the first leg of my argument.
<P>
The second leg is much more difficult to remedy. The Under-Secretary could solve the first problem by reintroducing the position that the hon. Member for South Thanet wants, which would be rational, in which a definition from European jurisprudence would be applied as a mechanistic test simply by including the Competition Commission when we reach clause 60. For all I know, the Under-Secretary may introduce such an amendment. That would help, but the second leg of my argument is much more difficult to deal with.
<P>
In clause 19, there is an attempt, which the Under-Secretary may try to undo, specifically to place into English law the mechanistic test to which the hon. Member for South Thanet attaches so much importance. The clause would prohibit
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``imposing selling prices below marginal cost of production on a persistent basis.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I take it that the brunt of the hon. Gentleman's argument is that in principle it is easy to find out what is the
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``marginal cost of production on a persistent basis''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and therefore to test whether predatory pricing is occurring, and that the amendment tabled by my right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham dealing with bulk discounts and the like would jigger up the otherwise perfect world of good information about what constitutes selling below marginal costs, and hence what constitutes predatory pricing.
<P>
My right hon. Friend's amendment goes some way--although, as he said, not the whole way--towards curing a substantive problem with the chapter II prohibiton. If it is based on that thought about European jurisprudence and its application, it is based on a fundamental piece of economic illiteracy and business ignorance. That is important, because the Under-Secretary is surrounded by a large amount of expertise, almost none of which corresponds to the world of business, the practice of business and what economists will do when they come to testify about the matter before a commission that does not yet exist.
<P>
We have only one frame of reference, because there is only one place where such things have been tested under an Anglo-Saxon system of law--as opposed to a civil law system, which is essentially what the European system is. That place is the United States. In the United States, the issues of predatory pricing have been argued at interminable length by some of the world's great micro-economists and some of the world's most brilliant lawyers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> At some expense.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Indeed, at terrifying expense, both public and private. I can assure the Under-Secretary--he may himself suspect this--that there has been the most almighty amount of difference of view about what constitutes selling marginal cost. Does one mean short-run marginal cost or long-run marginal cost? What is marginal cost in any case? What is to be included in marginal cost? To what extent is one to include cost to capital, and if one is to include that, how is one to adjust cost to capital in dynamic conditions--in particular, in recession?
<P>
I draw attention to that example not only because the Government are driving manufacturing into an early recession, which will bring that problem to light at an early date, but because in a recession firms try to rescue themselves by pricing themselves back into markets that they would otherwise lose--especially when they are dealing with import substitution of production, which is exactly what is occurring at present with the high pound.
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> Will my hon. Friend consider that issue a little further? Let us suppose that a highly competitive industry contains several United Kindgom competitors facing enormous competition against international competitors because the value of the pound is high. Let us suppose that one of the larger British players decides to match foreign competition by cutting prices, and therefore incurring substantial losses. If one of the other players in the British market then goes out of business, would that be an abuse of a strong position in the UK market--although the world market is very competitive-- or just a sign that there is a highly competitive market generally?
<P>
I fear that under the President of the Board of Trade's definition of an abuse, the British competitor trying to hang on to life by cutting below cost would be deemed to be acting anti-competitively.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> My right hon. Friend is absolutely right.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> If I may, I shall not give way just at the moment, because I want to expand on the point raised by my right hon. Friend with a particular example that my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry may find helpful. Although it may appear to the contrary, I choose the example entirely without partisan intent, and to register a point with the Under-Secretary, who I suspect may have an especial interest in it. My example is the coal industry in the United Kingdom.
<P>
In not too many days time, we may find that the Paymaster General, who is currently sitting in the Committee considering the Finance Bill, has fixed some kind of deal for the British coal industry that may or may not receive the blessing of the President of the Board of Trade and others. I am not sure what the term means, but I think that the coal industry is sufficiently fractured not to count under the terms of the Bill as a revenue-generating monopoly, and will therefore not be exempt. As an aside--if you will permit me, Mr. Atkinson--I find it strange that a Competition Bill specifically exempts revenue-generating monopolies, but nevertheless prevents abuse of a dominant position by those who are not a monopoly, but that is the ``Alice in Wonderland'' world into which the Bill brings us.
<P>
For example, Mr. Budge does not have a monopoly, but it is clear that he has a dominant position. Mr. Budge is, at least marginally, revenue-generating. I take it that the purpose of the Paymaster General fixing a deal between him and the generators is that he should be more revenue-generating. I fear that on many definitions of marginal cost, under that deal Mr. Budge will be persistently producing below marginal cost. I take it that the hon. Member for South Thanet, who attaches so much importance to the wonderful mechanistic test that is apparently to arrive by grace of European jurisprudence through subsection (1), will be an ardent supporter of the coal industry deal immediately being taken by the Director General of Fair Trading to the Competition Commission--a group about which we know nothing--which will apply that mechanistic test. If that happens, the Government will face a large coal industry strike very soon.
<P>
I do not think that that is the intention of the Bill or of the Government; the Government simply have not thought about what it is to abuse a dominant position and how different it is from mechanistically setting a price below someone's definition of marginal cost. They have got themselves into the most frightful bind.

<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> My hon. Friend enables me to pick up both the point that I may have made earlier and the one that he has illustrated so well with his example. Would it not add insult to injury, where a domestically based industry was in severe economic strain and difficulty, if a foreign competitor, perhaps riding on the back of a highly competitive exchange rate--or, in the case of the coal industry, even being subsidised domestically--were to take suit in the British courts as a third party, alleging that the victim in the United Kingdom was abusing a dominant position?
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> My hon. Friend brilliantly anticipates me, because we will face exactly that position. I mentioned import substitution and the high pound precisely because that links so well with the coal industry. It is more than likely that, under the Bill, two groups of people will take the coal industry to the Competition Commission. Paradoxically, one group will be the people with whom the Under-Secretary is currently doing the deal--the generators.
<P>
The generators might argue that they can obtain cheaper prices without the Under-Secretary's deal and that the people with whom they do the deal, via the Under-Secretary, are abusing their dominant position by selling below marginal cost. The other group will be the Polish coal producers, who can truthfully argue that they have been excluded from the market by group of people selling below marginal cost. The fact that Polish coal producers might be selling coal far below marginal cost is not a material factor, because the Bill deals with the United Kingdom coal industry only. It does not deal with the Polish coal industry, nor does it deal with that of South Africa, which might use the same argument.
<P>
I know that the Under-Secretary disdains talking about real-life examples. Indeed, from time to time, he tells us that he is not allowed to think--let alone talk--about real-life British industrial examples. However, the coal industry is of great concern to the Government. They are taking action to preserve the British coal industry that many of us regard, for a number of reasons, as highly deleterious to the economy.
<P>
The Bill will undoubtedly allow those who are wholly opposed to the Government's intentions to make a prima facie case against the industry that the Government are trying to preserve. They will take their case to the Competition Commission, which will apply the mechanistic test that the Under-Secretary believes should always be applied. That will have wider consequences. The Bill will mechanistically apply to English jurisprudence so-called European jurisprudence, the development of which has nothing to do with Anglo-Saxon law or with how such matters are traditionally interpreted under Anglo-Saxon law. It would be far better if the Under-Secretary reconsidered the clause altogether, taking inspiration from the amendment and asking himself, ``What am I trying to protect against? What do I want to catch? What don't I want to catch?''
<P>
The purpose of the amendment is to draw the Committee's attention to the necessity of such reconsideration. If the clause is not reconsidered, the Government will discover what they want to do cannot be done. The Under-Secretary, and people undertaking business practices that are perfectly acceptable anywhere in the world, will discover that drawing down from the tables of Brussels something that makes perfectly good sense in European jurisprudence and unthinkingly putting it into the framework of English law will have effects that he did not dream of and does not want.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I hope not to detain the Committee too long, but it would be sensible to clear up several points that have arisen in the debate. When Labour Members sought to criticise my right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham and other hon. Friends, they were labouring under a gross misapprehension.
<P>
I shall reinforce the points that were well made by my hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset by referring to the director general's guidelines. Although the clause gives examples of conduct that might constitute an abuse, it is not intended to be exhaustive, nor is it intended to define the abuse of a dominant position.
<P>
In his draft guidelines, the director general elaborates on each of the examples in subsection (2) and tries to explain what it means. The critical point is that, in bold type, he states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``These are no more than examples, and are not exhaustive.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Given that the clause is not intended to define the abuse of a dominant position by reference to an exhaustive list of categorical examples, he is right to continue:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The important issue is whether the behaviour of a dominant firm either allows it to abuse its dominant position''--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
which seems reasonably obvious--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``or allows it to enhance its dominance by removing or excluding competitors.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is more relevant.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
As my right hon. and hon. Friends have been at pains to point out, if we rest on the use of dominance to remove or exclude competitors, when the director general presents guidelines for business--our interest being to make the law clear, rather than opaque--we must ensure that he can give specific examples of activity that, judged against that criterion, offers evidence of abuse. Equally, however, there are specific activites that, if they are not used in a way that is designed to remove or exclude competitors--which, according to the circumstances specified in the Bill, would almost certainly go beyond the terms in which they are phrased--would be regarded prima facie as not constituting an abuse of a dominant position.
<P>
It is important that we view the amendment in that context, and each of the examples that I have given has merit. If the amendment is not accepted, there is a distinct danger--although my right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham is more expert than I could be in pointing out examples--that, for temporary or for market reasons or as a result of changes in costs, bulk discounts may bring done long-term variable costs of production. Existing agreements that have been ratified under existing legislation have led to dissimilar conditions being applied to the circumstances in which products are provided to customers. Vertical agreements and franchise agreements have led to what might in other circumstances be regarded as discriminatory conditions. For example, franchises often operate not only under vertical agreements, but under horizontal agreements.
<P>
To protect a franchise and to give it substance, a franchise holder will often not only offer the franchise to others, but will manage some franchises directly. Sometimes it is necessary to protect a brand by means that might otherwise be regarded as attempting to prevent other products from entering the marketplace. Although they must be carefully confined, measures taken by, for example, Mars and Coca-Cola to present their brands in isolation, but not to the exclusion of competitors in the same outlet, are legitimate in some circumstances--they protect the brand and are a necessary marketing feature.
<P>
It is important, as the amendment proposes, that we enable the director general, in presenting his more definitive guidelines, to give examples of what might constitute abuse and, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham hinted to the Under-Secretary, of economic activity that may constitute the exercising of a dominant position but does not constitute abuse. It is important to specify both examples.
<P>
We shall debate the tribunal when we reach clause 60. My hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset will forgive me if I dwell on his point for a moment, because I should point out that references in clause 60 to ``court'' clearly mean any court or tribunal. I understand that the Competition Commission, in so far as it is an appellate body, is a tribunal and not a commission. Unless the Under-Secretary says otherwise, I shall assume that ``court'' means tribunal. I believe that the same is true of definitions in clause 58, but any other reference to a court means the High Court, not a tribunal. I think that that is true. The Under-Secretary will tell me if I am wrong.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> If my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire's reading of subsection (5) is more intelligent than mine--if he is right that the commission is the organisation to which a company can appeal against the director general--the commission does constitute a tribunal, which helps to clarify the matter. If the Under-Secretary can confirm that, the first leg of our argument disappears, but, alas, a much more difficult second issue remains.
<P>
I hope that the Under-Secretary will not refute the example of the coal industry on the grounds that paragraph 8(3) of schedule 3 will do the trick.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman took us on a tour of the Polish coalfields earlier, which was not relevant to the amendment. Can he explan how his present comments are relevant?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I apologise, Mr. Atkinson. I referred to the coal industry in relation to clause 18 as an industry that would unfortunately be caught if the amendment were not accepted. The Under-Secretary might say that, under paragraph 8 of schedule 3, the coal industry is exempted from the Bill. However, I wanted to prevent him from giving that trite response [Laughter.] It is a complicated Bill, but I did not invent the blasted thing. I apologise to you, Mr. Atkinson, if that phrase was unparliamentary.
<P>
Under paragraph 8(3) of schedule 3, it is clear that the only exemption in respect of the coal industry is to the extent to which the European Coal and Steel Community treaty gives the Commission exclusive jurisdiction over the matter. The coal industry is a real, live example.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nigel Griffiths:</B> Welcome back to the Committee, Mr. Atkinson. I listened carefully to the points that were made by the right hon. Member for Wokingham and his colleagues and those much more perceptive interventions from my hon. Friends. It will help the Committee if I explain in detail my thoughts about the amendment. It sets out several commercial practices that, according to the Opposition, should be excluded from the chapter II prohibition. Presumably, it purports to be able to say that certain types of practice will never be abusive or anti-competitive.
<P>
I shall explain again that the fundamental principle of the Bill is concerned with effects not form. That is why we are getting rid of the old formalistic style of legislation that applies so arbitrarily. Many innocuous practices are caught in legalistic knots and really damaging arrangements can escape. The amendment would exclude various forms of practice, regardless of whether they have serious anti-competitive effects.
<P>
I assured the Committee this morning that we anticipate that a large majority of commercial arrangements that fall within the wide descriptions in the amendment will be entirely harmless or, indeed, pro-competitive. Firms operating such arrangements have nothing to fear from the Bill. Most of them will not be dominant or anything like dominant. Such firms will not be caught by the prohibition. They will be protected by it. Individual cases must be examined in particular circumstances.
<P>
Paragraph (a) of the amendment deals with the offering of discounts. Usually, offering discounts is entirely justified and harmless, but in a few instances, it might not be. Dominant companies can use discount systems to tie distributors or retailers to their products, shutting out smaller competitors. Such practices are extremely anti-competitive and damaging to the interests of consumers and competitors. It is right that such practices should be outlawed. They can be under article 86--for example, in the Michelin case.
<P>
Clause 18 will, therefore, stop such abuses in this country. However, the amendment would give them a green light and wave them through. European Union jurisprudence will be a guide to business, as, of course, will the guidelines issued by the director general. The important matter is whether the effect of the practice is anti-competitive in the circumstances. Of course, if the firm involved is not dominant, it will not be caught.
<P>
Paragraph (c) of the amendment, which deals with how retailers support brands, contains such a vague statement that it is difficult to know what it would cover. It might be meant to refer to the sort of selective distribution arrangements whereby manufacturers require retailers to meet certain criteria before agreeing to supply them, but such matters are normally considered under article 85, rather than article 86, at European level. A considerable body of case law under article 85 relates to such cases.
<P>
Qualitative restrictions on whom the manufacturer will supply that are objective and non-discriminatory will not be contrary to the prohibition. However, it is right that a dominant company that uses restrictions in its contracts with retailers to foreclose the market and shut out competitors should be caught. It is a matter of assessing the circumstances of the case. 
<P>
Paragraph (d) of the amendment deals with franchise agreements. Such agreements will normally be considered under the chapter I prohibition. There is an EU block exemption for franchise agreements. Agreements meeting the conditions of that block exemption will be automatically exempt under the chapter I prohibition. It is difficult to foresee circumstances in which a normal franchise agreement would infringe the chapter II prohibition. However, we do not want to include in primary legislation a rag-bag list of agreements that would probably not infringe the prohibitions.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I understood the Under-Secretary to say that franchise agreements will be exempted automatically under the EU block exemption provision. To the extent that the Bill's coverage and wording are not identical to that of the EU legislation--albeit that the concepts are broadly similar and the jurisprudence is the same--how can he say that confidently, without considering each agreement or giving them a block exemption through the Office of Fair Trading and the Competition Commission under the Bill? Those agreements might be exempt, but how can he say definitively that they will be?
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> I can certainly say definitely that agreements that meet the conditions of the block exemption will be exempt automatically. I hope that that satisfies the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
If we were to adopt the Opposition's proposals and exclude from the prohibition agreements that we considered would not be caught, we would cast doubt on the position of similar arrangements not expressly excluded. That would be guaranteed to confuse business and cause it greater expense in having to consult experts.
<P>
Paragraph (b) of the amendment is important and deals with:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``existing contracts that have been cleared under competition legislation''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It was clear from the way that it was presented by the Opposition that their argument was based on unrealistic premises.
<P>
Specific agreements falling within the terms of the Restrictive Trade Practices Act 1976 may be the subject of directions under section 21(2) of that Act if the restrictions are not of such significance as to merit a reference to the court. Agreements benefiting from such directions will be excluded from the chapter I prohibition. It seems highly unlikely that such agreements would constitute an abuse of a dominant position.
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
If specific business arrangements have been recently examined in the course of a Monopolies and Mergers Commission investigtion, and the commission has not found them to be adverse to the public interest, one would clearly not expect those same arrangements to amount to an abuse of a dominant position. However, specific contracts are not cleared as such by monopoly investigations, so the amendment does not stand up.
<P>
More importantly, the Opposition should accept that economic circumstances can change quickly. The market reflects the ebb and flow of business. Companies may gain or lose market power, and product and geographic markets can shift. The conditions of supply and demand can alter. Arrangements that were benign under one set of circumstances might be anti-competitive and abusive under different circumstances. It would be quite wrong to exclude specific contract terms regardless of their effect. I have no hesitation in urging my hon. Friends to reject the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Although the Under-Secretary read an eloquent speech, it had nothing whatever to do with the preceding debate. He ignored what my right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham and other Opposition Members tried to explain about the purpose of the amendment, and he did not refute the example that we gave of the coal industry. I hope, nevertheless, that it has entered the Under-Secretary's consciousness and that it may emerge in a later ministerial utterance--or amendment.
<P>
The Under-Secretary's argument needs some further and urgent attention in relation to franchise agreements. It is clearly a false line of argument; I can see how it was derived, but it is clearly false. The logic that he was espousing was clearly that EC legislation exempts franchise agreements from the chapter I prohibition if they fulfil certain criteria. In clause 10, under the parallel exemptions procedure, they would be automatically exempt from the provisions of chapter I.
<P>
The crucial point in the Under-Secretary's argument was the first step, when he said that franchise agreements would normally fall to be considered under chapter I. That may be true in the EU, because of the particular circumstances of inter-state trade, but, without the amendment, it will not be the case in the UK. If the clause is unamended, people who are trying to undo franchise agreements, of whom there will be many, because there are good, competitive reasons for doing so, against dominant operators--many of those who operate franchise agreements are dominant--will immediately spot logic. Even if they have not read the Under-Secretary's utterances, they will spot the logic that he has just traversed, see that the chapter I prohibition does not apply to those agreements and move smartly to chapter II and clause 18.
<P>
Because the Under-Secretary is resisting the amendment, chapter II and clause 18 will not contain a prima facie exemption for franchise agreements. If the Under-Secretary was wrong about his compliance cost assessment before, my goodness me, he will certainly be wrong about it now. If he resists exempting franchise agreements from chapter II, the non-recurrent cost of lawyers having to go through every franchise agreement by any operator who could be said to be in a dominant position in the UK will be humungous. The Under-Secretary should reflect on that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> My hon. Friend makes an interesting point, to which the Under-Secretary should respond. The Director General of Fair Trading will write a more definitive guidance, not only in the master guide but more particularly in the further title that deals with the abuse of a dominant position. Will the Under-Secretary guarantee that the director general will not only elaborate on the conduct that may give rise to an accusation of abuse of a dominant position, but give instances or explain legitimate business practices that would not give rise to an abuse of dominant position? Businesses will not want guidelines that constantly threaten or inhibit their drive towards competitiveness in the marketplace, but will want guidance on how to engage competitively without risk of legal challenge.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> This has been an interesting and illuminating debate. I readily concede two things to the Under-Secretary. First, these are extraordinarily complex issues which, as my hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset said in the United States context, have involved many an expensive legal and economic consideration. Secondly, the Under-Secretary has made some attempt this time not merely to bluster, but to read out a definitive statement in his own terms of what will happen. We want to give careful consideration to his remarks, but he has not met the Committee's needs or responded to our amendment tonight.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset has performed a considerable service--not for the first time--in exploring some of the detailed considerations, such as the application of the clause to the goings-on in the coal industry, which are real-world and difficult situations. My hon. Friend has highlighted a point that I would emphasise strongly; the Committee Room, the cloistered confines, or, indeed, the Office of Fair Trading are not the places where these situations will arise. Some people will be happy to exploit the facilities afforded by the clause to go on fishing expeditions and to operate aggressively against the practices of their business competitors. They may well sink them. We do not know whether that will happen--we have neither the detailed guidelines nor the application of jurisprudence within the UK context to go by.
<P>
The Under-Secretary conceded that in order to protect themselves, and because there will be no blanket exception, individual cases will need to be considered, so companies will have to seek legal advice, although they could still be at risk of severe penalties and a major commercial disaster. Companies will have to go through their own franchise agreements, for example, and study them in detail.
<P>
It was nowhere more revealing than when the Under-Secretary said, when referring to proposed subsection (2A)(b), that the Monopolies and Mergers Commission would not automatically nod someone through, but it might help--I think he said that that would be taken into account. Even if one had been through the process, a business would not have a certificate on which it could then readily trade without further consideration.
<P>
We are talking about difficult cases. The Under-Secretary clearly believes that his proposals will not apply to some companies, which may be welcome, but large numbers of people will be caught. If they are, they will have to consider whether they can sustain the consequences. I urge my hon. Friends to vote for the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 87, in page 10, line 39, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>```conduct'' shall include any failure to act in any circumstances where, had action been taken it could reasonably have been expected to have been taken; and'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I hope to be brief. I shall tell the Committee the purpose of the amendment. The Under-Secretary may then be able to say that I have no need to worry.
<P>
I am not a lawyer, so I stand to be corrected, but I understand that ``conduct'' will normally mean not only actions but a failure to act. If I am wrong about that, it is important to have the amendment because failure to act could well lead to the abuse of a dominant position. Let us assume that ``conduct'' means failure to act as well as acting, so sins of commission and ommission are covered. It is, therefore, important that failure to act should apply only when it is reasonable to expect the companies involved to have acted. The provision would not apply if there was an unreasonable expectation that the undertakings should mitigate their dominant position in order to avoid abuse. It would apply only when it is reasonable to expect them to act in a particular way to mitigate their dominant position to prevent abuse.
<P>
I hope that that reads better than it sounds, but I think that it explains the purpose of the amendment. I rely on the Under-Secretary and his advisers to have at least looked at the amendment beforehand and to have understood what I am attempting to achieve. Will the Under-Secretary say whether the amendment is helpful in clarifying the terms of the clause?

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Nigel Griffiths:</B> It is clear that the prohibition set out in clause 18 is closely modelled on article 86 of the treaty. Clause 60 provides that the new prohibition must be interpreted so as to avoid inconsistency with article 86. The alignment is critical to our policy. It is crucial to business to have consistency between the UK and EC prohibitions; it must be able to look to EC case law as a guide. As a matter of principle, we do not intend to fiddle around the edges of the prohibition, as the amendment proposes. To do so would risk producing a different prohibition that cannot be interpreted by applying the jurisprudence under article 86. Inertia by dominant undertakings has been found to constitute an abuse in some circumstances under article 86. We do not want our prohibitions to apply any more or less widely than article 86 to dominant companies' failures to act.
<P>
Our proposals achieve that. The amendment would add a new definition of abuse, for which EC jurisprudence would be no guide in interpretation. Indeed, no one would know how it was supposed to be interpreted. Business would hardly welcome that.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I assure the Under-Secretary that this is a genuine pursuit of information. Is he arguing, as he contended in a different context earlier in our proceedings, that the assumption of reasonableness is implicit in the Bill, negating the requirement in the amendment that might otherwise be considered relevant?
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> The purpose of the clause is to ensure an alignment of the Bill with article 86. Inertia by dominant undertakings has been found to constitute an abuse.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am grateful to the Under-Secretary, who is doing his best to help the Committee. Perhaps he could advise me. In cases of EU jurisprudence in which inertia has been found to constitute an abuse of a dominant position, I do not know whether the European courts have introduced tests such as those that my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire suggests in his amendment. Is omitting to do something when in a dominant position a strict liability offence or could circumstances of reasonable action be imposed as a further test before penalties were introduced?
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> I want to help the hon. Gentleman and the Committee. I can cite two cases under EC case law in which the European Court of Justice condemned inertia by undertakings, which, as it happened, enjoyed statutory monopolies. In the port of Genoa case, an undertaking had exclusive rights under Italian law to organise various operations at the port. The European Court of Justice held that the undertaking's conduct was abusive in that it refused to use modern technology, resulting in an increase in costs and delays. In the second case of Hofner v. Macrotron, the German federal employment office had the exclusive right under German law to provide employment agency services in Germany. The agency was manifestly unable to satisfy demand in the market for recruitment services, and the Eruopean Court of Justice found that that was an abuse. I hope that that helps the Committee, that the amendment is considered probing and that the hon. Member for South Camgridgeshire will withdraw it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> It is a probing amendment. I am slightly disappointed and surprised by the Under-Secretary's contention that he does not propose to fiddle around the edges of the prohibition. I am sure that by the time that we have finished, the Under-Secretary will have undertaken to bring article 85 and article 86 prohibitions into line with UK circumstances. Among the circumstances with which the prohibitions have to be brought into line is the manner in which UK courts will interpret legislation into UK practice. If EC jurisprudence and UK statute law are to coincide in that respect--where inertia on the part of a dominant undertaking has been construed as abuse, it would be reasonable to expect that dominant undertaking to have acted to stem that abuse--it would be reasonable to include that language in the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> My hon. Friend makes a powerful case. He will have noticed that a few moments ago the Under-Secretary said that the purpose of the clause was to align our arrangements with European law. This is not a nit-picking point, it is central to our understanding of the potential and significance of the clause. ``To align with'' is not synonymous with ``to replicate the precise content of''. Unless a better and more powerful argument against it can be made, the amendment is necessary to avoid the danger of an over zealous, over-literal interpretation, and the attendant danger of gold-plating.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I think that, in practice, UK courts will use the Bill to bring UK law into line, as my hon. Friend says, but I imagine that they will also apply UK legal tests of reasonableness. It is incumbent on us to recognise that they will do that themselves. If they are to do so, there is nothing to prevent us from trying to assist that process, rather than to inhibit it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for giving way, and to the Under-Secretary for his elucidation of the points that my hon. Friend raised. Although obviously we have not studied the court reports of the two cases cited, which is why we asked what the cases were, it appears to me that it could be argued that the consequences of the inertia--the reasonable inaction, as it were--were not reasonable at all; that the abuse was further compounded by no action having been taken to stop it.
<P>
In those cases the result would appear to be satisfactory, but they are only two examples--a very small set--and we do not yet have an assurance from the Under-Secretary that the reasonably foreseeable test could not be extended into cases in which it could create difficulty for an innocent business that happened to be in a dominant position, but was not bent on further abusing it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I will not delay the Committee further, but simply ask the Under-Secretary to reflect on two points. He did not respond to the previous debate, but we can return to that in a moment. First, will the Under-Secretary consider using the many guidance documents that will be published to inform dominant businesses in which circumstances it is incumbent on them not only not to act in a way that would constitute abuse, but sometimes to act so that they are not in an abusive dominant position in the market?
<P>
Secondly, clause 59, which deals with interpretation and governing principles, could be used to define the principle of what constitutes ``conduct''. That is an alternative way to deal with the issue. If the Under-Secretary is at least willing to consider the subject, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> We have debated the amendment at some length; that has raised a series of questions about the clause. I hope that the Minister will see fit to answer some of those questions now. It is of the utmost importance that he does; otherwise, no one in the United Kingdom will have the foggiest clue what was his intention in introducing the clause.
<P>
I hope that the Under-Secretary can answer what is by far the most important and straightforward question. Is the combination of subsection (1) and subsection (2)(a) meant to catch the case of a coal industry that was selling under its marginal cost? Whether it will be is, of course, a matter for the courts, but it would be helpful for us to know whether the provisions are meant to catch such a case.
<P>
Secondly, we need to know whether subsection (1) is intended to catch franchise agreements. Could a dominant operator be accused of abusing his position under a franchise agreement? It is of the utmost importance that the Under-Secretary tells us whether he intends that to happen because a vast amount of feverish legal activity will depend on it.
<P>
My third question is more general. What is the hon. Gentleman trying to achieve--other than mirroring European jurisprudence, which is a glorious, aesthetic activity? We are dealing with a law that will affect people's lives. The hon. Gentleman did not tell us on Second Reading what he is trying to achieve with the clause. Is he saying that any party that can be accused by another party of using its dominance to influence the market in such a way makes it more difficult for the other party to compete and succeed in the case? Or is he trying to protect customers against the activities of dominant operators? That could have a bad effect on the consumer because they lead in the long run to higher prices or lower quality? We must understand whether the brunt of the clause is aimed at the behaviour of one company towards other companies or whether its aim is to try to protect the consumer against lasting effects.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> In weighing his answer, the Under-Secretary will want to consider the cognate point that, in the new Green Paper on the regulation of activities, his department sets out as its primary test the interests of the consumer. If he does not answer along the lines of the second option outlined by my hon. Friend, he appears to be at odds with that particular objective.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I entirely agree with my hon. Friend. I was about to mention that in the context of the difficult question of what is a revenue-producing monopoly. My hon. Friend's point has a profound implication. Is it the Under-Secretary's intention to protect the customer along the lines of utility regulation? If so, given recent case law, firms can approach the Commission and argue with a prima facie chance of success that their action, while it may have significantly disadvantaged a competitor, is not to be caught by the chapter II prohibition because it can be established that that was in the long-term interest of consumers. Such action will, of course, require a good deal of economic argument.
<P>
I refer to the important real-life case of the newspaper industry, which the Under-Secretary will not want to discuss in relation to clause 19. The questions about the activities of the various players in that industry are whether they are damaging one another, whether that should be the test of the matter or whether they mean that the customer has benefited from an unprecedented reduction in prices in the newspaper industry, but with no discernable reduction in quality. [Interruption.] My hon. Friend the Member for Daventry says that I am wrong to suppose that there has been no reduction in quality. There may have been, but I doubt that that is due to competition. It is of vital importance for that industry and many others to know in which direction the Under-Secretary intends to go with the clause. It is critical that that be stated to the Committee because, apart from on Report, he will have no other chance to put it on record. If the Under-Secretary does not tell us now, we shall have to return to the question of compliance costs.
<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
It will have to be assumed that any action directed by the dominant player against other players in the market could be caught, even if it is perfectly clear that it is to the advantage of customers in the long run, and that the Under-Secretary may have intended it to be caught. Every dominant player would therefore have to hire lawyers to find out, as it steps, however gingerly, towards any other player, whether any action that could harm that other player, quite regardless of its effect on consumers, was illegal. That would intensify not only the non-current costs, it would increase out of all proportion the recurrent costs so airily dismissed in the compliance cost assessment. It is vital that the Under-Secretary answers that today.
<P>
Those are not unreasonable requests. They are not put in a partisan spirit. They are not intended to argue down the import of the clause. I am asking the Under-Secretary to do something that, by this time, he should be in a good position to do, which is to explain why he is bringing forward one of the two most important clauses of the Bill.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> We have debated certain aspects of clause 18, but not its underlying intention, which is to bring in a prohibition approach to the abuse of a dominant position, as distinct from the case-by-case and example-by-example legislation that we had previously.
<P>
The Under-Secretary was at pains in the debates on clauses 2 and 3 to chide the Opposition about the fact that the previous Government were moving towards competition legislation and that the draft Bill published in August 1996 included a prohibition approach, carrying into UK law something akin to article 85, although it was not necessarily in the same form as this Bill. However, when we come to the article 86 EC prohibition, it was not the previous Government's view or the Conservatives party's view that a prohibition approach was the best way to proceed.
<P>
It is instructive to remind ourselves why that was. I shall read a slightly lengthy quotation--I hope that you will forgive me, Mr. Atkinson--from the consultation document of August 1996. It said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``we remain concerned that the risks of inhibiting genuinely competitive behaviour may outweigh the potential benefits of greater deterrence that a prohibition system might bring. It is clearly important that we should not introduce a prohibition if its application is uncertain and if the uncertainty coupled with potential exposure to penalties and third party claims causes companies in, or arguably in, a dominant market position to `aim-off', acting more cautiously. This could damage genuine competition and the exploitation of innovation.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There we have it.
<P>
Not least through our debates on the amendments and the many other similar debates that we shall have on the schedules to the Bill, we are trying to introduce certainty into the prohibition. Even with a greater degree of certainty than is to be found in the present legislation, there is a significant risk that, far from deriving competitiveness benefits and consumer benefits from the introduction of prohibition, it may have a perverse effect. The overall effect may be to inhibit competition, innovation and investment rather than sustain them.
<P>
Given that that was the view of the previous Government in August 1996, and that it was explicitly mentioned in the balance of costs and benefits, I turn to compliance cost appraisal. We have not heard much on that subject. Presumably, when Ministers came to office they wanted to consider the matter again, but far from simply using article 86 on the basis that if it was good enough for the European Community it was good enough for us, they remembered that the previous Government had decided that the costs outweighed the benefits. They therefore decided to examine the costs and benefits in detail.
<P>
We know from previous debates that, in the compliance cost appraisal, the Government made no effort to quantify the benefits, nor even attribute them to the specific prohibitions. One cannot even look at the overall figure of supposed benefits of a very small proportion of 1 per cent. of gross domestic product and determine which part of that proportion is attributable to the chapter I prohibition and which part is attributable to the chapter II prohibition. That makes it difficult to do the balancing act that the compliance cost appraisal is intended to achieve.
<P>
Let us consider the costs that arise from what is colloquially termed the chilling effect of introducing such a prohibition approach. The compliance cost assessment contains the heading, ``Effects on international competitiveness''. I expected that heading to be followed by something of substance, instead of which the assessment states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``By promoting effective and fair competition, the legislation will provide a spur to British companies to innovate and invest. This may act to bolster the international competitiveness of UK firms.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is all the assessment says on the matter.
<P>
If the effect of the prohibition is unambiguously to promote effective and fair competition, no Opposition Member would dispute the fact that that would bolster the international competitiveness of UK firms. However, the compliance cost assessment should deal with the fact that not only political parties but many economists believe that the prohibition will create a problem.
<P>
A survey of economists and lawyers in the most recent issue of Global Competition Review, published in March, states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``three-quarters of economists said they thought it was a bad idea to operate an Article 86 system, only 23 per cent. of lawyers expressed doubts.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Government are proceeding on the basis that lawyers think that the Bill is okay, but economists think that it will not work. I wonder why economists think that--perhaps it is because they think that there will be a chilling effect on innovation, investment and competitive activity.
<P>
We are dealing with how hard one applies the brake to the steam train of motivation towards competition in the marketplace that delivers consumer benefits. The impetus towards competition leads to concentration in the marketplace and, if unrestrained, ultimately to abuse of the dominant position and imperfect competition.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> My hon. Friend is making a speech of remarkable power--if only it could have been heard before the clause was drafted. Does he agree that whether his worst forebodings come to fruition depends on the Under-Secretary's answer to the question of whether the clause is intended to be aimed at the cause of harm to firms or to the consumer? If the clause is aimed at the cause of harm to the consumer, would not it be possible for dominant firms to protect themselves against pursuit by other firms, hence reducing the chilling effect on their willingness to innovate and be active in the market?
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I think so. What my hon. Friend says is right. Super-competitive companies can either retain the excess profits accrued because of their competitive advantage or they can use their competitive advantage to deliver substantial market share and long-term benefits to consumers. Indeed, wise companies look to the longer term and deliver benefits to consumers, so protecting their long-term ability to make profits, rather than taking short-term benefits.
<P>
I agree with my hon. Friend if he is saying that we should constrain those dominant firms that try to keep all the benefits of their dominance for themselves, rather than distributing them to consumers. However, we cannot be sure that that is how the prohibition will work. Therefore, my general point of contention against the clause is that no justification has been given for the introduction of a prohibition approach. Furthermore, it is wholly absent from the self-same documentation that the Government should use to provide such justification. For that reason, we should oppose the measure.
<P>
I have set out my general reasons for opposing the clause as a whole. I should now like to turn to some more specific reasons. I tabled amendment No. 134, which was not selected, possibly for technical reasons. However, that amendment related to a matter that I wish to raise with the Under-Secretary. The amendment would have inserted in subsection (3)
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the relevant product market, provided that such market consists of, or extends to''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
the United Kingdom. However, the point would have been covered more expeditiously by stating in subsection (1) that the prohibiton related to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``abuse of a dominant position''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
in a relevant product market, inasmuch as
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``it may affect trade within the United Kingdom.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We shall not debate at this point what the phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``may affect trade within the United Kingdom''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
means. I note that, in the master guidelines, the director general has promised us a separate document on that subject, but we shall constrain ourselves at present. However, I am worried because
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``may affect trade with the United Kingdom''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
in subsection (1) is qualified by subsection (3) which states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>```dominant position' means a dominant position within the United Kingdom.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Subsection (3) continues:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>```the United Kingdom' means the United Kingdom or any part of it.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am worried that those who wish to implement the prohibition might be guided by that conjunction of definitions to treat
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``dominant position in a market''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``may affect trade within the United Kingdom''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
in terms of a geographic market. That geographic market might be much more local than the United Kingdom, or it might take no account of the fact that the relevant product market is much wider than the United Kingdom.
<P>
I am guided by the remarks of the Director General of Fair Trading who, on 20 March, published a guide to the provisions of the Competition Act 1998. Those were not the master guidelines, but the market defintion ones. Paragraph 2.12 of the document states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``A market definition should normallly contain two dimensions: a product and a geographic area.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There we have it. The matter is perfectly straightforward. In clause 18, market, in this context, is assumed to be geographic market, not a product market.
<P>
Will the Under-Secretary give the Committee a categorical assurance that the interpretation of ``market'' in clause 18, with reference to some other part of the Bill, will be that it is a ``relevant product market''? I hoped that my amendment would ensure that the exact meaning would be ``relevant product market''.
<P>
When we were trying to bring competition to the forefront of the examination of merger references, one of the difficulties was the way in which people wanted to construe public interest, as it applied to mergers--to narrow it down to much less than the actual market within which that merger took place. The classic case was to constrain the public interest to refer to the market in only one area of the United Kingdom: Scotland was the typical example.
<P>
In bringing competition to the forefront, we wanted to examine the whole relevant product market, not merely that market within the United Kingdom. If there was a Community-wide market, we considered it on a Community-wide basis. Abuse of a dominant position should relate to the relevant product market and not merely to a geographic subset of it.

<P>

<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> My hon. Friend is exploring matters that we should all have noticed, but which I had not. Does he agree that what gives rise to the particular problem here is once again mistranslation from the European context to the UK context? Although the geographic definitions were simply transposed from Europe to the UK, the whole import of the original clause was restricted to inter-state trade, so the number of firms that could be caught was vastly reduced.
<P>
In a small town such as Beaminster in my constituency, there may well be a chemist that has a locally dominant position that would be caught--wholly unintentionally, I think, on the Under-Secretary's part--which would of course not have been caught by the original clause.
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> My hon. Friend is right. We must not get too carried away, because of course there will be turnover limitations. I note that the Under-Secretary suggested previously that the turnover limit for companies might be &#163;20 million. Actually, that rather reinforces the point. When we are dealing with large companies operating within the United Kingdom, the product market in which they are working may well not have easily confined edges; indeed, it may extend beyond the United Kingdom to an extent.
<P>
Where the Community is concerned, where the relevant product market is outside the United Kingdom but within the European Community, there will probably be EC jurisdiction. But equally, we can think of many companies that have a product market that extends beyond the United Kingdom but does not necessarily extend within the Community. There is a whole range of examples of relevant product markets. When we are setting out the principles of how the prohibition is to work, without getting into particular examples, there is everything to be said for making it perfectly clear that we are dealing not just with the geographic market but with the product market. The clause as drafted dismally fails to deal with that; that is a mistake.
<P>
So I have a problem with the particular and with the generality of the clause, and for that reason I for one will oppose it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Colin Breed </B>(South-East Cornwall): A couple of sittings ago, I asked the Under-Secretary a question relating to geographical area. The hon. Member for West Dorset helpfully suggested to me that we might consider that in our discussion of dominant position under clause 18.
<P>
I want to ascertain from the Under-Secretary the intention of the clause in respect of the supermarkets, which are an important part of our economy. At present, four rather large supermarket chains account for some 67 per cent. of the whole UK food market, which is obviously a large market. In many large cities, consumers have a good choice among several different superstores, but that is not typically the case in rural areas. In my constituency, and indeed, in most of Devon and Cornwall, there is only one supermarket on the edge of most towns.
<P>
Nationally, none of the supermarket chains exceeds the 25 per cent. threshold of the market that would require an investigation, but on a regional level--and, above all, on a local level--and bearing in mind the wording of clause 18(3), which states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>```the United Kingdom' means the United Kingdom or any part of it'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
they clearly have a market share well in excess of 25 per cent. In fact, a breakdown of those retailers' shares according to 11 television regions shows that Tesco and Sainsbury, for example, have a combined share of 57 per cent. in London and the south-east and 58 per cent. in the eastern part of England. So two providers between them appear to have 50 per cent. of those markets, which even with my limited maths means that they have more than 25 per cent. each.
<P>
<B>Dr. Phyllis Starkey </B>(Milton Keynes, South-West): Does the hon. Gentleman forget that London and the south-east constitute a rural area?
<P>
<B>Mr. Breed:</B> Originally I said that we have access to one supermarket and that if we split the country into television areas, such supermarkets share 57 per cent. of the market. I was trying to demonstrate that a relatively small number of retailers have a large percentage of the UK market. It is not a complicated point; I am sure that the hon. Lady understands it reasonably well.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I apologise for interrupting the hon. Gentleman, but just as I cautioned the hon. Member for West Dorset for taking us on a tour of the Polish coal fields, so I must caution the hon. Gentleman that we are not debating supermarkets and retailers. I understand the hon. Gentleman's using it as an example of a dominant position, but we do not want a debate on the issue at this stage.
<P>
<B>Mr. Breed:</B> That is helpful, Mr. Atkinson.
<P>
Regional and local monopolies are the essence of a dominant position. The clause suggests that ``part'' might refer to regions or localities, as I suggested earlier. Regional and local monopolies are clearly part of the current structure of the retail industry.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I am following the hon. Gentleman's serious argument. On the margins of the Committee the other day, he and I briefly discussed this important point. Does he agree that whereas the term ``region'' has specificity, perhaps even exactitude, the terms ``local'' or ``locality'' do not? Is that not a cause for further apprehension?
<P>
<B>Mr. Breed:</B> Absolutely. I am apprehensive about much of the way that supermarkets have developed over time. Although I accept that they provide great benefits, they are now giving rise to anxieties about their monopolistic position in the locality of their stores.
<P>
A recent Deutsche Morgan Grenfell Group study said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``a new superstore creates a local monopoly.''
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Has the hon. Gentleman considered the phrase that so perplexes me, which the Under-Secretary consistently refuses to define--``a revenue-producing monopoly''. As I read schedule 3, if the hon. Gentleman were right that the case was a monopoly, as I believe it would be, it would clearly be revenue producing. Presumably he would agree that on the face of the Bill, such a case would not seem to be covered. It would be too dominant to be covered.
<P>
<B>Mr. Breed:</B> That is absolutely correct. We must understand the intentions of clause 18 and the exact meaning of its wording. I should like to think that the clause could be used as a referral for at least an investigation. Until the Under-Secretary tells us whether that is so, we shall not know.
<P>
According to the Office of Fair Trading, a monopoly is defined as:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``a situation where a company supplies or purchases 25 per cent. or more of all the goods or services of a particular type in the United Kingdom or a defined part of it.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The OFT notes that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``local monopolies can therefore be examined''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The clause should provide a robust argument for local monopolies to be examined. I hope that the Under-Secretary will be able to answer yes or no to the question of whether the wording in clause 18 will provide the means by which local and regional monopolies such as supermarkets can be investigated.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I do not want to add to the lapidary contributions made by my hon. Friends the Members for West Dorset and South Cambridgeshire, who made the telling points. We remain dissatisfied with the Under-Secretary's response to amendments so that the clause remains as drafted. We press him to reach a conclusion on whether he is trying to penalise business or to assist the consumer. He should also cast a little more light and shade on the question of location. Although I understand the remarks that the hon. Member for South-East Cornwall (Mr. Breed) made about regional monopolies, to make the clause bite at much below the national level is likely to increase severely the amount of compliance work.
<P>
My dominant concern is that application of a European principle to a national matter will diminish its effectiveness. There is competition in the single market and people from outside are able to enter it. If the clause is interpreted too literally within the United Kingdom, it may give aid and comfort to overseas competitors who would use it as a device to attack our share of our own market.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nigel Griffiths:</B> I want to explain yet again what the clause seeks to achieve.
<P>
Clause 18 introduces the chapter II prohibition, which acts against abuse of a dominant position that damages competitors and consumers. It is modelled closely on article 86 of the treaty of Rome and must be interpreted so as to avoid inconsistency with it. In interpreting the chapter II prohibition, the authorities and the courts will be required, by virtue of clause 60, to act so as to avoid inconsistency with the jurisprudence under article 86.
<P>
As a result, conduct that is an abuse under EC rules will be an abuse under our domestic law, and what constitutes dominance in the EC system will constitute dominance under the Bill. Businesses and their advisers will be able to look to EC jurisprudence for guidance on the interpretation of the domestic law. More important still, they can be confident that particular conduct will be viewed consistently under the two systems.
<P>
For too long British companies trading in European markets have had to deal with two completely different sets of rules--one at domestic and one at European level. That puts our companies at a disadvantage to many of their competitors elsewhere in the Community. The Bill will level the playing field and help to make it a truly single market for our firms.
<P>
There is wide agreement that the prohibition approach is the most effective means of deterring abuses of dominance. Many other Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries--for example, the United States, France, Canada, Australia, Italy, New Zealand and Spain--have prohibition-based legislation in this area. The United Kingdom is behind the times. Our current regime for dealing with anti-competitive behaviour by monopolists badly needs radical overhaul. It is slow, cumbersome, sadly lacking in any real deterrent and absolutely lacking in any provision for recompense for those at the receiving end.
<P>
Under the existing regime, it takes far too long to halt anti-competitive practices. There has to be a lengthy period of investigation by the Office of Fair Trading and then the MMC before anything can be done. In the meantime, consumers and competitors suffer. Worse, competitors can be driven out of business. There are no powers to provide them with interim relief while investigations are completed. My right hon. Friend the President of the Board of Trade has already referred to the Southdown Motor case where such problems occurred. I could also mention bus services in the north-east of England, on which the MMC reported in 1995--once again after the damage had been done and a weaker business had been driven to the wall.
<P>
I entirely agree with the point made by the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire that the relevant, geographic market should not be limited to the United Kingdom. However, his unsuccessful amendment was also unnecessary. In Britain as abroad, there is no excuse for letting dominant companies get away with bullying their smaller competitors and exploiting their customers. Just as I followed your strict instructions, Mr. Atkinson, not to take a tour of the Polish coalfields, I do not intend to visit the supermarket.
<P>
Clause 18(3) specifically provides that a dominant position may be within the United Kingdom or any part of it. That means that the relevant market may be a local one, and that is how it is defined in the Bill. The prohibition approach is right for a modern, dynamic economy. It will be a far more effective deterrent against anti-competitive behaviour. Abuses of dominance will be unlawful, in stark contrast to the current regime, where nothing is unlawful unless a lengthy investigation has taken place, followed by orders made through secondary legislation. Financial penalties and third party claims for damages may follow.
