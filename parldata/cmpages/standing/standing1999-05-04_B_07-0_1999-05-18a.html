<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind the Committee that with this we are taking amendment No 119, in page 11, line 5, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``(5A) The following shall be inserted after section 88A(3)(d) of the Finance Act 1989 (lower corporation tax rate on certain insurance company profits)--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``(e) chargeable gains''.''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mrs. Barbara Roche):</B> Before we adjourned this morning, I made the point that trusts for people with disabilities are already treated more favourably than other trusts, under the capital gains tax rules. They are treated in this way for reasons that all members of the Committee would endorse. They receive the full annual exempt amount set against their gains in any year, rather than half the annual exempt amount, which is available to trusts generally. I see no need to increase the complexity of the taxation of trusts by introducing a different rate of capital gains tax, and I therefore advise the Committee to reject the amendment.
<P>
Clause 23 provides that the rates of capital gains tax will be the same as those for savings income from 6 April 1999. Amendment No. 119 seeks to extend this principle to the rate of tax levied on insurance companies and friendly societies in respect of gains included in the share of their profits attributable to policyholders. There are special rules setting the rate of corporation tax charged on the profits of life companies and friendly societies. That part of a life insurer's profits on gains that will eventually benefit its policyholders is charged at a special rate at present equal to the basic rate of tax.
<P>
We are aware of the representations by the Association of British Insurers that the rate of corporation tax should be changed to reflect the change in the capital gains tax rate structure. However, the relationship between the corporation tax paid by an insurer on policyholder profits and the tax that the policyholders would have paid if they had made the underlying investments themselves is far from exact. That is because, among other reasons, the way in which gains on chargeable assets are calculated and the reliefs or deductions available are different for companies and individuals.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stephen Dorrell </B>(Charnwood): I am listening carefully to the Financial Secretary. She said that there was a special rate for the taxation of profits that would accrue to the benefit of policyholders in life insurance companies. Can she confirm that the law does not specify a special rate, but links the rate directly to the basic rate, so when the basic rate changes, the taxation of policyholders' profits changes automatically?
<P>
Are not the insurance companies arguing, on behalf of their policyholders, that the policyholders should benefit from the change from 23 to 20 per cent., in the same way as they will benefit next year when the basic rate changes from 23 to 22 per cent? In those circumstances, would it not introduce a new distortion into the tax system to leave the tax rate on policyholders at 23 per cent. when it has been cut to 20 per cent. for everyone else?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I understand the point that the right hon. Gentleman has made. If he will allow me to make some progress, I shall be able to assist him.
<P>
An insurer may already be paying less tax on policyholder gains than the policyholder would have done. The decision is therefore not straightforward. I must inform the right hon. Gentleman and the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb) that we shall carefully examine the arguments for and against, and that we cannot accept the amendment because it is defective in that it does not include a commencement provision, which is appropriate for a rate change for companies.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I accept that the Financial Secretary is trying to be helpful. Will she give an undertaking to examine the matter in time for the Government to reach a conclusion and to table an amendment that is not technically defective on Report?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roehe:</B> No, I cannot give that undertaking, but we shall examine all the arguments for and against. I assure the right hon. Gentleman that we shall do so thoroughly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael Jack </B>(Fylde): The Financial Secretary will be aware that this is a complex matter. Will she give an assurance that her consideration of this point will be of this point alone, and that it will not involve the resurrection of the life insurance policyholder reform?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> The right hon. Gentleman tempts me to go down that route, but I shall not do so.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am pleased about that.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche: I am seeking to win your approval, Mr. Butterfill, at the start of your chairmanship this afternoon and this evening.</B><P>
<P>
I cannot give a commitment about the time scale, but we shall examine the matter closely. The right hon. Member for Fylde (Mr. Jack) is right to say that this is a complex area of taxation; and we shall give it the appropriate consideration.
<P>
Commencement provisions that are applicable to the clause involve years of assessment. As the right hon. Gentleman knows, corporation tax rates are set for financial years. Given my commitments, I hope that the amendment will be withdrawn, but, if it is not, I advise my hon. Friends to vote against it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick Gibb </B>(Bognor Regis and Littlehampton): It is a great pity that the Government have not taken on board the real concerns that have been expressed about amendment No. 120. It is grossly unjust to make people who are forced to have their capital paid through a trust because of personal difficulties subject to a much higher rate of tax than they would face if the money were paid to them directly. I hope that in the months ahead, the Government will think again--we urged them to do so last year--about whether the right rate of tax is being applied to such trusts, especially those for the mentally disabled and for those who qualify for the higher rates of care allowance.
<P>
We welcome the Financial Secretary's statement that she will carefully reconsider the arguments for and against amendment No. 119. Opposition Members and the Association for British Insurers believe that the omission was due to an oversight rather than an intention to discriminate against life assurance policyholders. My right hon. Friend the Member for Fylde was right to say that the proposal would create a new distortion in the tax system. It is a pity that the Minister did not give an undertaking to examine the issue before Report. If she does not present a technically correct amendment on Report, inadequate legislation will be on the statute book for a year, and it will have to be removed in next year's Finance Bill. In the mean time, the City and savers will have to cope with that inadequate legislation. We may end up in the same position as we are in this year, in relation to conditional shares, amendments have to be made to the previous year's inadequate legislation. It would be more professional if the Government moved the necessary amendments on Report. I hope that the Government will get their skates on and examine the arguments promptly, so that, if any amendment is necessary, it can be made this year rather than next. In view of the Financial Secretary's relatively healthy statement, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<H4><center>Charge and Main Rate for Financial Year 2000</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> We welcome the cut in corporation tax to 30 per cent. The Conservative Government inherited a rate of 52 per cent. from the previous Labour Government in 1979. Over 18 years, Conservative Governments cut that rate to 33 per cent. Although this Government have cut the headline rate, they have increased the burden of corporation tax on businesses. The Red Book shows that introducing quarterly payments will cost businesses £1.6 billion in year 1, £2 billion in year 2, £3.1 billion in year 3, and £2.2 billion in year 4. That is an extra £8.9 billion in taxes over the four years of the transition period. Businesses must also find £5 billion a year to pay for the pension funds tax, which was introduced in the Government's first Budget and which abolished the repayment of dividend tax credits to pension funds. On top of that, businesses must find £5.2 billion for the windfall tax. If that were not enough, businesses must also pay an extra £15 billion to comply with all the new regulations that the Government have imposed.
<P>
The new quarterly corporation tax payments system more than outweighs the cut in the corporation tax rate. In 1999-2000, the introduction of quarterly payments will cost business £1,600 million. The benefit of the rate cut, according to the Red Book, will be ``negligible.'' In 2000-01, quarterly payments will cost business £2,000 million, while the benefit of the rate cut will be £700 million. In the year after, quarterly payments will cost business £3,100 million, while the benefit of the rate cut will be £1,000 million. That is why the CBI has stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The reduction in the Corporation Tax rate does not amount to full compensation for earlier payment.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Government pretend that they are business-friendly, but they are loading billions of pounds of extra corporation tax on to Britain's top 20,000 companies. Between them, those companies employ more than half of the work force in this country, and their turnover represents about half of the total turnover of all businesses in the UK. That is why Adair Turner has said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``There is a concern about the accumulation of extra costs which have been imposed on business of which the biggest was actually the Corporation Tax changes which were very carefully''--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
portrayed --
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``as a reduction in tax rates, but were actually a tax increase.''
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In the headlines and spin, new Labour has portrayed the measure as a tax cut. Behind the scenes, and in the small print, they have levied a tax increase on businesses in this country. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has commented:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The net increase in taxation of company profits sits uneasily alongside the desire to raise business investment.''</UL></FONT>

<P>

<B>The Paymaster General (Dawn Primarolo):</B> I am disappointed but not surprised by the hon. Gentleman's comments on the cut in the main rate of corporation tax to 30 per cent. I am disappointed that his arguments were the old chestnuts that he advanced when we debated quarterly payments. [HMS: ``Facts.''] We might say facts by stealth, or truth by stealth. When we have one of the lowest rates of corporation tax in the industrialised world and the lowest rate in this country for a very long time, I am not sure how the hon. Gentleman can advance the case--without even blushing--that somehow a cut is really a rise. Never mind, we shall let him live in that world if he insists.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman again raised the issue of quarterly payments. He knows full well that companies will not be required to pay more tax; it is a question of when they must pay it. As he also knows, after the transition to instalments, large companies--small and medium-sized companies do not come within the quarterly payment regime--will gain £1.6 billion a year from the combined effects of the changes that we have made, both in the March 1998 Budget and the changes that we are discussing this afternoon.
<P>
I hope that, notwithstanding the comments that the hon. Gentleman keeps making, he will at least have the good grace to welcome the cuts in corporation tax and the benefits that they provide to business, especially in setting the rate and giving certainty to businesses during the period of transition to the quarterly payment scheme. I presume that no Opposition Member will want to speak against the cut and I therefore commend the clause to the Committee.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 24 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 25</center></H4>
<H4><center>Corporation Tax Starting Rate</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 58, in page 12, line 26, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``; and (d) can show that it is not a company incorporated by an individual with the sole or main purpose of taking advantage of this section.''<P>
</UL></FONT>.
<P>
I tabled the amendment because there is a feeling abroad in the world of business, particularly among small traders and those who trade on their own, that the clause will pressurise them into incorporation in order to take advantage of the lower starting rate of corporation tax. The amendment gives me a vehicle to discuss the matter and to probe Treasury Ministers on what work they have done to examine the equity of the proposal as it affects the small trader. Small traders are currently treated, for tax purposes, as individual taxpayers, but they might be tempted to take advantage of the lower starting rate of tax on any profit that they make. I want to explore the tax implications of incorporation for such persons because the position is anomalous.
<P>
For some reason, the Government have sought to give a particular advantage, in the lower starting rate, to the incorporated as opposed to the unincorporated. Why take that route? Why not maintain the long-standing tradition that when changes are made to the corporation tax structure, the unincorporated are also brought into line? The purpose of the amendment is to examine the motive that might tempt the unincorporated to become incorporated, with the sole advantage of relieving themselves of a tax burden. We have not heard much from the Treasury about its reasons for the split.
<P>
It is interesting to examine the advantages of avoiding tax by incorporation. An employed person with an income of £15,000 for the tax year 2000-01 would have a taxable income, after indexation and a personal allowance of £4,420, of just over £10,500, of which the first £1,530 would be charged at 10 per cent. and the remainder at 22 per cent. That person would have a tax bill of £2,144. For a self-employed person with the same criteria, the tax bill would rise to £2,987, but if he took the route of incorporation, restructured himself into a company and paid himself a salary of £3,900 with a dividend distribution to make up the difference to £15,000, the tax bill would drop to £1,248.
<P>
I do not understand why the Government are prepared to allow someone to avoid that amount of tax via transmutation to incorporation without regularising the position for those who do not want to go down that complex and expensive route and want to remain unincorporated. Many people would like the Government to explain their philosophy on that.
<P>
I shall not give the Committee further detailed examples, but the contrast becomes more stark. The respective tax bills for someone on £25,000 and with the same criteria that I gave earlier would be £4,344, £5,889 and, with incorporation, £3,498. Are the Government happy to condone that legal avoidance mechanism? The clause seems to encourage the avoidance of tax by inducing people to incorporate. It seems unfair that incorporation should confer an advantage when the complexity of the procedure may weigh against that. Those who are taxed as individuals will lose an advantage that an incorporated enterprise with the same income would gain. People may feel cheated by the Government's conferring an advantage on the incorporated and not the unincorporated and should be grateful for an explanation of that.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> The issue of whether a business is better off being incorporated or unincorporated and self-employed and what advantages the tax system provides for different businesses has received coverage in the financial and technical press for many years. I shall not trade examples of people's tax liability, which is always difficult in Committee, but I think that the right hon. Gentleman is inquiring into the Government's attitude to incorporation and unincorporation and whether there is a hidden agenda designed to push all companies towards incorporation. He seemed to be suggesting that the purpose of the 10p rate was to encourage incorporation. I shall return to his point about avoidance.
<P>
The right hon. Gentleman will be aware that the decision whether a company should be incorporated is not straightforward, and depends on a range of factors--whether the business is new, whether it may expand, whether it may amalgamate and so on. The 10p rate alone does not provide the push that shows the clear advantage of earlier incorporation. I refer to the measures in the budget that show that the Government are committed to supporting enterprise, encouraging entrepreneurial activity and helping businesses. Small businesses must decide for themselves whether to become incorporated or to remain unincorporated.
<P>
I shall remind the right hon. Gentleman of other measures in the Budget to encourage small businesses, in addition to the 10p rate. First capital allowances are extended and enhanced; from next year the basic rate of income tax will be reduced to 22p; the small business support service is being introduced specifically to provide advice and support to businesses on how to run those businesses; changes to the limit for quarterly payment of PAYE will help about 60 per cent. of small businesses--700,000 or so--with their cash flow.
<P>
The right hon. Gentleman made a direct comparison between incorporated and unincorporated companies, the 10p rate to do so. However, as he knows, the tax system includes other factors, including the cost of company formation and compliance, and whether the 10p rate provides an incentive over and above those costs. The right hon. Gentleman will know that the costs are quite high. Limited liability offers some financial protection to owner-directors, but has an impact on borrowing ability, and access to finance is important for small businesses. The structure of a company affects its ability to use company assets and funds, and to take funds out of the company. The regulations and tax liability applying to a company are also affected by the structure of the company. There are other comparisons. For example, pension fund contributions are structured differently depending on whether a business is incorporated or unincorporated, as are national insurance contributions. There is also the question of tax losses, privacy and how the company is run.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The right hon. Gentleman asked whether the Government had considered the possibility that the provision would provide an unreasonable tax advantage for incorporated over unincorporated businesses.
<P>
The Government did consider that. We wanted to provide a balanced package. It is not for us to decide whether companies should be incorporated. The Government also gave careful consideration to the other decisions that a company would make before becoming incorporated.
<P>
The answer to the right hon. Gentleman's first question is that the Government are not forcing incorporation; it is for companies to decide. The 10p rate does not force incorporation. The issue is more complex. It involves business decisions, including what stage a business has reached. The Government have ensured that the Budget contains a package of measures, including the 10p rate, to help companies.
<P>
The right hon. Gentleman asked what would happen if someone who was not entitled to the 10p rate tried to construct an arrangement to take advantage of it. I am pleased that he has not lost his habit of ensuring that tax that should be paid is paid. He will know--a point of order was raised on this matter this morning--that Inland Revenue press release IR 35 announced the Government's intention to consider the circumstance in which a service company might try to make use of tax advantages when it was not entitled to do so. Amendments relating to national insurance were tabled to the Welfare Reform and Pensions Bill last night and a point of order was raised this morning by one of the Opposition Front Bench spokesmen. The Government are consulting business on how we can achieve our objectives of preventing what we perceive to be the tax loss from an unreasonable use of legislation. At the same time, we must ensure that legitimate service companies, which we want to encourage because they make an important contribution to business, are not damaged and continue to operate.
<P>
I shall not go into whether the right hon. Gentleman's amendment would work, except to say that it is defective. However, his comments lead me to believe that it is a probing amendment which I am sure he will not press to a vote. I hope that he is clear about the Government's intentions.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Jack:</B> I am grateful to the Paymaster General for her observations, although she worried me slightly when she talked about the contents of IR 35, which seems to tip toe towards the subject that I raised. I hope that legitimate individuals who perform a proper service to society, such as taxi drivers or window cleaners, and who choose to be incorporated, will not be swept up by a wider consideration of the issue. She hinted that if such people moved from their current tax position to an incorporated one, they might find the wrath of the Inland Revenue bearing down on them. I suspect and hope that that was not what she had in mind.
<P>
Unfortunately, the Paymaster General did not get to the heart of the matter. She failed to explain why the Government had broken the link that once existed between the rates of corporation and personal tax. There was no need to consider the complexities of incorporated and unincorporated status. People may come up with what I might call low-cost ways of incorporating, and they will take advantage of the opportunities that are available.
<P>
My example shows that if someone decides to incorporate, set himself up as a company and pay most of his salary to himself as a dividend--that would already have been franked under the current arrangements by the tax that was paid through the corporation tax system--he would make a sizeable tax saving. People will carefully consider whether to go down that route. It is sad when people have to spend time away from their hard pressed businesses contemplating such matters, which are complex in legal and accounting terms.
<P>
If the Government expanded the current starting point--if they raised the £10,000 figure to £20,000--and applied a 10p rate, people would have a significant reason for going down the incorporated route. The Paymaster General might consider publishing a discussion paper on such matters. Her comments on the wider issues suggest that it would be useful for small and medium-sized enterprises--especially very small enterprises, about which the Government are concerned--to have an opportunity to review their position. I am grateful to the Paymaster General--
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown </B>(Cotswold): Does my right hon. Friend share my concern that the tax changes might force small business men, who may be in partnership or self-employed, into incorporation, which might not be the best thing for their business? A quick calculation that I have done shows that a person or a company with a turnover of £50,000 would pay about £7,000 on an incorporated basis or about £9,000 in income tax. A difference of about £2,000 is involved.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> My hon. Friend bears out my concern. The difference would be amplified if the lower starting rate of corporation tax were increased. I am disappointed that the Paymaster General did not give us greater insight into the Treasury's philosophy on this matter. However, I accept that this is not the place for more detailed scrutiny of some of the figures that I gave earlier. It would help small businesses if the Treasury would consider publishing a discussion document that explored such issues more fully. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I wish to speak on clause stand part.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> In that case, the right hon. Gentleman must wait until the question has been proposed.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I am sorry if I was a trifle premature--so great was my enthusiasm to make a short contribution to the clause stand part debate that, I did not want to miss my opportunity to do so.
<P>
I do not oppose the introduction of the proposed starting rate of corporation tax, unless I am invited to do so by my Fronts Bench colleagues, but I must probe Ministers on what was, frankly, as a missed opportunity during my time as Financial Secretary to simplify the tax system. I hope that I can interest the Government in taking up an idea that I was not able to follow through.
<P>
The structure of lower rates of corporation tax means that a company with a relatively low profit pays a low rate of tax, which is progressively withdrawn. In relation to the 20 per cent. or 30 per cent. rate, the companies that exceed the system's ceiling pay the full rate of tax on profits once they progress beyond the starting rate.
<P>
The result is that there is now a wide band of profits, and the marginal rate of tax paid on profits earned is higher than at the lower or higher rate. I have never understood why the corporation tax system could not have the same system of bands as the income tax system, so that the benefit of the lower rate band would not be withdrawn from companies making higher rates of profit, and the companies caught in between would not have to pay the even higher marginal rate, as the benefits of the lower rates were withdrawn.
<P>
That argument is even more powerful when applied to the relatively narrow band that the Government are introducing, of a starting rate on the first £10,000 of taxable profits. I hope that Ministers will consider the suggestion that, instead of having £10,000 at 10 per cent., with the benefit of that withdrawn at a marginal rate of 22.5 per cent., we might move to a system under which the first £10,000 of taxable profit would be taxed at 10 per cent. and beyond that the higher rates of tax would chip in. I cannot tell Ministers what the revenue costs would be, but I do not believe that they would be huge. That would be an important simplification of the corporation tax system.
<P>
The argument often mooted against that approach is that it would create an incentive for people to form a great many small companies, all of which could benefit from this band. That would not work, however, because there are corporation tax rules for companies that are brought together within a group.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Love </B>(Edmonton): I am curious to learn why the right hon. Gentleman did not introduce such a sensible measure when he was Financial Secretary to the Treasury?
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I shall not go into the details of the arguments that went on in the Treasury at the time. However, the arguments that were used against this approach are much less telling when one is considering only a £10,000 band of profits. The risk to the revenue base when considering £250,000--the band of profits to which the lower rate of corporation tax traditionally applied--is significantly higher. The revenue risk would be substantially less when considering £10,000, which might be split among all the companies in a group. For example, there could be a de minimis provision within a group of companies that the measure would not apply if those splitting provisions resulted in a band of less than £3,000 when split among four or more companies. The risk to the Revenue would be substantially less if one applied this principle to the new starting rate proposed by the Government. That would also avoid the complexity involved in the withdrawal of the band from the large number of taxable companies that fall above £10,000, but do not qualify for the full, main rate of corporation tax.
<P>
I do not advance that argument as a reason for not supporting clause stand part. However, I hope that Ministers will consider whether the added complexity that the clause introduces into the corporation tax system is worthwhile, and whether there might be a simpler approach, both for the Inland Revenue and for companies falling within this band of profits.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I shall not repeat the arguments advanced by my right hon. Friend the Member for Fylde. However, it is odd that the Government are pursuing policies that create a positive incentive for moving into incorporation not only the 10p rate set out in clause 25, but the stamp duty changes, which make it advantageous to transfer a company rather than transferring business assets--while at the same time implementing the provisions set out in press release IR 35. They must implement those provisions to reverse the incentives to incorporate, with all the side effects that that is having on people such as IT consultants, who are worried about IR 35's implications for the way in which they conduct their business.
<P>
That shows that the Government's tax policy is not properly co-ordinated. Ministers should take an interest in the overall structure of tax policy, rather than looking at each measure year by year. In discussing later clauses, we shall discover further examples of changes in policy that were completely reversed a year later. The Government have no proper plan and show no real understanding of tax policy.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
On the substantive part of clause 25, the Government have performed a classic sleight of hand. Although the Opposition support any reduction in taxation, the way in which the measure was introduced was quite disgraceful and must be put in perspective. In his Budget speech, the Chancellor of the Exchequer said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``I believe that the whole House will want to welcome what I am announcing: a new starting tax rate for small businesses of 10p in the pound. Every company making profits of up to £50,000 will benefit.''-- [Official Report, 9 March 1999; Vol. 327, c. 177.] <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Most interested parties understood that to mean that the rate would apply to all profits of up to £50,000. However, as we have heard, the truth is that it will apply only to profits of up to £10,000. Thereafter, a taper will apply until profits reach £50,000.
<P>
There is an Arthur Daley character to the Chancellor's pronouncements. To avoid being conned, one has to listen carefully to each word and look carefully at the small print. That is becoming a defining characteristic of the Government that the public--particularly pensioners and those approaching retirement age--are beginning to notice. It is the Opposition's job to point out all such sleights of hand in the sill. As my right hon. Friend the Member for Charnwood (Mr. Dorrell) ably noted, because of the taper, the marginal rate of tax will rise to 22.5 per cent. on profits above £10,000, and fall to 20 per cent. as they approach £50,000.
<P>
The measure must be put in perspective and I shall outline the cost to the Government and the benefits to business over the next three years. According to the Red Book, in 2000-01, the cut will benefit business by nothing. In 2001-02, business will benefit by £100 million, and by £140 million in 2002-03. One must compare those figures with the increases in self-employed national insurance for which business will pay. In 2000-01, those increases will cost business £240 million, and in 2001-02 they will cost £290 million. Thereafter, they will cost about £300 million.
<P>
Therefore, in 2000-01, a benefit to business of nil must be set against a cost of £240 million. In the following year, a benefit of £100 million must be set against a cost of £290 million. In response to a question tabled by one of my hon. Friends during last month's Treasury questions, the Financial Secretary was reluctant to provide those figures, but the Paymaster General was forced to give them to the House last week.
<P>
The £100 million and £140 million by which business will benefit in 2001-02 and 2002-03 is small beer compared to pension costs.

<P>

<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I think that the hon. Gentleman referred to a question about national insurance. It would appear that the Opposition tabled what was, from their point of view, the wrong question, to which I gave the correct reply. On reflection, he may wish to rephrase his remarks.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The question was tabled by one of my hon. Friend and it was a straightforward question: how much will the self-employed pay in the year 2000-01? That is an honest, decent question, and one would have expected the answer that appears in the Red Book--£240 million. However, the Government are carrying out a precise examination of words to see how they can manipulate the question in order to give the answer that they want to give. The hon. Lady is absolutely right--technically. [Hon. Members: ``Aha.'']
<P>
Government Members sound more and more like a gaggle of Arthur Daleys.``You didn't say nothing about pay. You just said payable.'' The Government are using the minutiae of words to prevent the public from knowing the truth about their policies.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B>  I know that it takes a little time to get used to being in opposition, but Treasury Front-Bench spokesmen must realise that when they hand out questions--[Hon. Members: ``What an outrageous slur.''] I have it on very good authority that it happens. However, if the Opposition were to hand out questions to their Back Benchers, surely they would have an obligation to ensure that the questions were correct. Otherwise, they would be in great trouble with their Back Benchers, which we would not want to happen.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The hon. Lady is being extremely disingenuous. It is quite unbelievable. It was a straightforward question, asked in a straightforward way, and the answer was manipulated by the Government to avoid revealing the truth--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We are getting a long way from the stand part debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Thank you, Mr. Butterfill. I shall resume the point I was making.
<P>
The cut in corporation tax to a starting rate of 10 per cent. is small beer compared with the extra national insurance that will be payable by the self-employed from the year 2000-01. It is also small beer compared with the £5 billion a year raid on pension funds, which will have to be made up by all those businesses that have pension funds, or the businessmen and employees of those businesses, who will have to pay higher contributions--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I hope that the hon. Gentleman is not about to recite a long list of alternative taxes and make some comparison between them. I hope that he will confine his remarks to clause stand part.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Thank you, Mr. Butterfill. The point is made that this is small beer. It will give back to businesses £100 million and £140 million in two years. Those are small figures compared with the range of taxes--which I could mention, but will not--that have been inflicted on business by the Government in their first two years.
<P>
I want to make two final points. One is a technical matter raised by the Law Society, which relates to the extra-statutory concession C9. It touches on the point raised by my right hon. Friend the Member for Charnwood that it is necessary to have a series of companies in a group in order to take advantage of the lower rates. Concession C9 relates to the existing small companies rate. Businesses are concerned to see whether the same concession, which includes calculating the number of companies, will apply to the new rate of corporation tax.
<P>
Secondly, will the Paymaster General say whether the £10,000 band will be indexed or whether we can expect it to reduce in value in real terms in the years ahead?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I think that the hon. Gentleman got a bit carried away. At one moment, he tells us that the Government have no real plan. Then, at the next moment, he tells us that we are planning to use sleight of hand all the time. He cannot have it both ways--or perhaps he can, because he tries to have it both ways on every other issue.
<P>
I shall deal first with the points made by the right hon. Member for Charnwood. If he can remember and prefers to exchange views privately, I should be delighted to hear what has been said to him at different stages about the points that he raised on calculations. I would even buy him a drink, if that were not considered bribery. I am in a generous mood this afternoon--lack of sleep probably helps people's humour.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Charnwood raised the issue of marginal rates, the complexity of the calculation, the reasons for such rates, and, in particular, the formula. I do not want to go through reasons such as ``That's the way it has always been done'', and ``People are familiar with it''. Apart from the technical considerations in relation to marginal rates--with which I am sure he is familiar--the Government were keen to ensure that the benefit for small companies was maximised. We wanted to encourage entrepreneurial activity and initial growth, and marginal rates were the best way of doing so. As the right hon. Gentleman knows, the amount of tax paid, in terms of the calculations on £10,000 and £50,000 using the marginal rate of 22.5 per cent., is no greater on average. He went on to say that it would not cost very much. 
<P>
First, there would be no logic to removing marginal relief for the 10 per cent. band and not doing so for the 20 per cent. and 30 per cent. bands.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I do not agree with that. I can supply the Paymaster General with the argument for removing it for the lower rate and not for the small company rate. If the Paymaster General wanted to advance that policy on the true grounds that it would cost less, she could do so on the basis that many more companies would be caught in the marginal rate between the starting and lower rate than would be caught between the lower rate and the main rate. The simplification benefit of eliminating the 22.5 per cent. marginal rate would be dramatically greater than the simplification benefit of eliminating the higher rate between the small company rate and the main rate.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> At this stage, we do not agree. Removing relief for one tax band and not doing so for others would leave the Government open to the allegation, which is constantly made by the Opposition, of introducing complexity and lack of certainty. We want to ensure that the focus is on smaller companies.
<P>
I do not want to embarass the right hon. Gentleman on the issue of cost, but the cost would be large--£650 million to £700 million. That money would--and should--be better spent elsewhere. None the less, his point about finding simpler ways of expressing legislation stands. It is an aim that we share, although, like him, we have not found a solution.
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton went down the line on national insurance contributions. I noted your remarks, Mr. Butterfill, so I shall not enter a discussion on the subject. I shall merely provide a little rebuttal. The hon. Gentleman knows full well that the package of national insurance reforms reduces the burden on self-employed people, especially those on low incomes. It ensures a fairer distribution of national insurance across all self-employed people. It also changes the entitlement to contributory benefit.
<P>
The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton also asked about extra-statutory concession C9. The concession will apply to the 10p band. The £10,000 band is not indexed, but neither is the existing small companies rate band. We believe that that provides the right symmetry. He will know that the Government have not been slow to make changes to improve and modernise the corporate tax system. We want to assist small and large companies in their entrepreneurial activity and to encourage investment so that they can grow. The clause is another step along that road.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> As a postscript to the Paymaster General's response, I noticed that my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton was confident that the burden of taxation on business was increasing. She countered that with an equally robust defence of the Government's policy. Will she agree to put the matter beyond peradventure by publishing for the next three years the Treasury's estimate of receipts from business? By enabling us to see all the receipts that the Government may receive from business, expressed as both cash and percentage of gross domestic product, we will be able to determine who is right.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> The Red Book provides the Government's forecast for income and outgoings. I know that the hon. Gentleman is good at studying the Red Book--
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> For the benefit of the Committee, can the Paymaster General point to the table or graph in ``Budget 99'' that gives the information in the form in which I have requested it? I searched diligently and did not find it, but I will make a fulsome apology if my efforts were inadequate. Will she guide me to the information?
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> While the Paymaster General is finding that information, I want to underline what I said in an intervention. I understand the symmetry of her argument that a taper withdrawal system for the small company rate should be matched by a taper withdrawal system for the starting rate of corporation tax. However, I hope that she is not persuaded by that argument and will consider, as she said she would, what I said in my earlier intervention,
<P>
Two separate issues need to be considered. Many more company taxpayers will pay the 22.5 per cent. marginal rate as the starting rate is withdrawn than corporate taxpayers will pay the marginal rate between the small company and main rates. The simplification benefit of introducing a simple band system for the starting rate of corporation tax would be considerably greater than if the same principle were applied to the small company rate. I hope that the Government will consider those matters individually and attach separate revenue costs to them. Removing the taper system from the starting rate of corporation tax would have a much smaller revenue cost and a much bigger simplification benefit.
<P>
On put and agreed to.

<P>

<B>Mr. Jack:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 59, in page 13, line 18, leave out 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``calculated by reference to £4,160'' and insert ``£416''<P>
</UL></FONT>.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, we may take the following amendments:
<P>
No. 60, in page 13, line 24, leave out ``£2 for every £3'' and insert ``£1 for every £15''.
<P>
No. 123, in page 13, line 24, leave out ``£2 for every £3'' and insert ``£1 for every £2''.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> This series of amendments raises questions about tax simplification and about other matters related to the clause. Those who drafted the Bill described the basis on which income tax reductions would be calculated in relation to the children's tax benefit ``by reference to £4,160''. It is not immediately apparent where that figure came from, although if one goes on a voyage of exploration, to section 256 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988, one gets somewhere near an answer. Section 256(2) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``where ... the relief to which a person is entitled for any year of assessment consists in an income tax reduction calculated by reference to a specific amount, the effect of that relief shall be that the amount of that person's liability ... to income tax ... shall be the amount to which he would have been liable apart from that provision less whichever is the smaller of ... the amount equal to 10 per cent. of the specified amount; and ... the amount which ~reduces his liability to nil.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I quoted that section at length because-- [Interruption.] I am delighted that the hon. Member for Shipley (Mr. Leslie) appears to have worked out the reason instantaneously. However, it is a pity that he was not listening earlier when I discussed the ordinary taxpayer, who may want to find out where the sum came from and how the mechanism operates. It is not all that easy to establish the route. One has to examine the 1988 Act and section 27 of the Finance Act 1998, which came into effect on 5 April 1999. That section states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``in section 256(2)(a) of that Act''--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
the 1988 Act--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``for `15 per cent.' there shall be substituted `10 per cent'.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The upshot of all of that is that we find out what the hon. Member for Shipley seemed to know all along, namely, where the 10 per cent. figure came from. Why did the Government use so convoluted a route? In this day and age of tax simplifications, could not the legislation simply refer to the sum of £416, as the amendment proposes?
<P>
The amendment would give a sum of money to the people who are specified in the clause and the schedule that we will debate later. Why did the Government choose a route that involves the tax system, not the benefits system? I shall not trespass on that matter further at this stage--we can discuss it in detail later.
<P>
Amendment No. 60 is consequential on amendment No. 59, and amendment No. 123 relates to the rate of withdrawal of the taper arrangement, although its figures may appear somewhat high. It would withdraw the marginal rate of 462/3 per cent. Why could not the figure have been 45 per cent., in order to mirror the rate of withdrawal in terms of the married couples allowance, for those who have the age element added?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I shall first respond to the points raised by the right hon. Gentleman on amendments Nos. 59 and 60. I shall deal with amendment No. 123 separately.
<P>
I understand the thinking behind amendment Nos. 59 and 60. Their aim is to simplify the presentation of the children's tax credit. I am sure that all members of the Committee would appreciate simplifications to the tax system. However, the amendments would not achieve the aims that the right hon. Gentleman described. I shall explain why that is the case, and why the Government have prepared the children's tax credit, using the figure of 10 per cent. that he mentioned. I know that the right hon. Gentleman will come back in the wider debate to the principle behind our preparing the tax credit in this way.
<P>
Amendment No. 59 would leave children's tax credit outside the general rules covering income tax reductions in section 256 of the Taxes Act. It would not then be clear that the children's tax credit was not a payable tax credit. The new tax credit is limited to the amount of tax payable, if that is less than £416. That is why we have accompanied its introduction with increases in the child elements of the working families tax credit and income support. That is to ensure that the benefits of the children's tax credit also go to people who either do not pay tax or are likely to pay too little tax to get the full amount of the tax credit.
<P>
That is the package of measures that the Government will use for those who pay tax and those who do not, and the different vehicles that will be used to deliver those benefits. I am sure that more will be said on those matters in the clause stand part debate. The amendments would also mean that the children's tax credit was left outside the rules covering the order in which income tax reductions are made. Technically, that would make the tax credit difficult to apply.
<P>
Expressing the children's tax credit as a reduction of £416 in income tax, as the right hon. Gentleman suggests, may seem clearer, but it would in fact be less transparent for the large majority of taxpayers who see the benefit of tax reliefs in their PAYE codes and their coding notices. I am sure that we would all agree that the calculations on our coding notices are not always as straightforward as we might wish, but if we follow the right hon. Gentlemen's suggestion of starting with a figure of £416, the calculations would be even more complicated.
<P>
The clause requires that the amount of the credit be made clearly visible on a coding notice. The amendment would require the credit to be converted first into a corresponding amount of tax free pay, which would then appear in the claimant's PAYE code. Our approach in the clause keeps the format of the credit in line with the format with which people are familiar through the married couples allowance or the additional personal allowance.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack rose--</B><P>
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> If I may finish this point, I shall be happy to give way.
<P>
The format will remain for pensioners who are keeping their married couples allowance from April 2000 and is a straightforward calculation that people understand. As I tried to explain to the right hon. Gentleman, to express it as £416 and then to have to convert it would make the process much more complicated, although the initial proposition seems simpler.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> A slight flaw in the Paymaster General's logic is that for new married taxpayers of the future, there will be no married couples allowance with which to become familiar. In my experience, people understand allowances better than credits.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> With respect to the right hon. Gentleman, that is not relevant. I am explaining how coding notices are dealt with for those who will keep their married couples allowance, not for those who will not receive it because of its abolition. The right hon. Gentleman is suggesting that there should be several ways of providing coding notices according to the designation of the taxpayer. I am not arguing that the current system of coding notices is simple, but the amendment would make it much more complicated. It would have to vary and would, therefore, increase the complexity, as when applied to higher rate taxpayers who would be in the taper.
<P>
I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will withdraw amendment No. 59, but if he does not, I shall ask the Committee to reject it. If it were accepted, it would then be right to make the changes in amendment No. 60. However, it would not be helpful to make the changes proposed by the right hon. Gentleman.
<P>
Amendment No. 123 would reduce the rate at which the children's tax credit is withdrawn from higher rate taxpayers. We have set the taper so that £1 of credit is withdrawn for every £15 of income over the basic rate limit. The entitlement to the children's tax credit will be exhausted for a claimant with an income of around £38,500. The amendment would change the taper so that £1 of credit was withdrawn for every £20 of income over that limit. That would cost an additional £20 million simply to benefit higher rate claimants who would keep their children's tax credit up to an income of £40,600.
<P>
The purpose of the taper is to target more help to lower income families. That is why it is so steep. The purpose of replacing the married couples allowance with the Chilterns tax credit, which has a taper for the higher rate taxpayer, is to maximise assistance for lower income families, who have a greater right to receive it. Therefore, I ask the Committee to reject amendment No. 123.
<P>
The right hon. Gentleman asked why we decided to stick with the format of £4,160 at 10 per cent. First, it keeps the children's tax credit in line with the residual married couples allowance, which still applies to pensioners. Secondly, people are familiar with that format through their existing allowances. Thirdly, they can see the amount of relief in their codes, even if it is restricted. Fourthly, the format ensures that the children's tax credit falls within the existing rules in section 256. Fifthly, some scope--admittedly, not much--is preserved to change the rate of relief.
<P>
Those are the reasons for using married couples allowance as the platform for creating the children's tax credit. Should the right hon. Gentleman press the amendments to a vote, I ask my hon. Friends to vote against them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> I am grateful to the Paymaster General for putting on record the Government's response to the amendments. The first two would clarify and simplify the operation of the tax system. On reading the Paymaster General's comments, many outside this Committee will understand where she is coming from in technical terms, but will be disappointed by the lack of simplicity and clarity. If it is not possible to clarify the matter now, perhaps the operation of those complex matters could be reviewed when the tax law rewrite eventually sees the light of day.
<P>
I dealt with some of the difficult adjustments that the previous Government made to the married couples allowance. The Paymaster General may come to regret her adherence to so called ``credits'' as an easy method of manipulating the way in which taxpayers can be relieved of a certain element of their tax burden. My experience leads me to believe that allowances are a better and more easily understood way of dealing with those matters.
<P>
With regard to amendment No. 123, I am disappointed in a way, that the Government are happy to have a 462/3 per cent. marginal tax rate on the withdrawal of the full effect of the children's tax credit over a very narrow income band of some £6,240. For consistency's sake and bearing in mind the fact that the credit will benefit the child, it is a pity that the Government did not at least align the rate of reduction in respect of age allowance at 45 per cent. rather than at the current figure.
<P>
This has been a useful discussion. I accepted at the outset that the amendments may have failed to anticipate certain technical consequences, and the Paymaster General has said as much. Therefore I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendments.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<B>The Chairman:</B> On a point of procedure, the right hon. Member for Fylde sought the Committee's leave to withdraw his amendments, but only one of them had been noted. Technically, it would be possible for him to move the others separately. If he wishes to that will be the procedure. If he does not indicate that he wishes to do so, I should simply proceed, and that is what I intend to do.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 117, in page 13, line 20, leave out from ``Where'' to ``his'' in line 22 and insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``any part of the claimant's income for the year of assessment falls within section 1(2)(b),''<P>
</UL></FONT>.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to consider Government amendment No. 118.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> The amendments make technical changes to clause 27 and schedule 3. The need for the amendments was helpfully pointed out to us by a professional association that scrutinised the Bill. Committee members will be aware that one feature of the children's tax credit is that it is progressively withdrawn where a person claiming it has income over the basic rate limit. The amendments make a technical adjustment to the way in which income taken into account for the purposes of applying the taper is defined, to make it clear that all income over the basic rate limit is included and that dividend income subject to the schedule F upper rate is not excluded. The amendments deal with points raised by representative bodies in response to the Finance Bill, and we are grateful to them for their assistance.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 124, in page 13, line 26, leave out ``persons'' and insert ``claimants''.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to consider amendment No. 125, in page 13, line 29, leaveout ``person'' and insert ``claimant''.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> This is a probing amendment to seek clarification from the Paymaster General about the drafting of clause 27(1). The word ``claimant'' is used in subsections (1) and (3) of new section 257AA, but in subsection (4)(b), the word ``person'' is used. I should be grateful if the Paymaster General would explain the difference between the words ``claimant'' and ``person''.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I ask the Committee to resist the amendments, which tinker with the wording of the Bill to no visible advantage. In doing so, the right hon. Gentleman inadvertently--I am sure--undermines the framework of the children's tax credit. [Interruption.] I am glad that hon. Members have not lost their sense of humour.
<P>
The amendment relates to new subsection (4), which defines a qualifying child for the purposes of the children's tax credit. New subsection (4) refers to a child in relation to a person, rather than a claimant, because that is what is meant. A person could have a qualifying child even if he or she is not entitled to claim the children's tax credit or has refrained from claiming. That could be relevant for the purposes of allocating or sharing the credit. Hence the difference in wording between ``person'' and ``claimant''. A person is responsible for a qualifying child, whereas a claimant is the person who applies for tax credit.
<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
By narrowing the definition of a qualifying child, the amendments would undermine the rules about allocating children's tax credit within couples. I am sure that that was not the right hon. Gentleman's intention. One result would be to allow couples with a higher rate taxpayer to avoid withdrawal of the credit by evading the rules about couples living together. That cannot be right, given the purpose of the children's tax credit. I hope that my comments have not allowed the right hon. Gentleman to stumble on a way to undermine the children's tax credit.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> Could the Paymaster General help me to understand this correctly? What would be the effect of adding the words ``or claimant'' after the word ``person'' in new subsection (4)(b)?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> The clause is perfectly clear about who is entitled to claim the tax credit. The person who claims the tax credit is to be the person who is responsible for a qualifying child. Additional words that are superfluous or which confuse the definition would be unhelpful. As I have explained the difference between a qualifying person and a claimant, the right hon. Gentleman should be able to withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> I am sorry that the Paymaster General has side-stepped my question about new subsection 4(b). The definition of the child in relation to the person may be valid in the first instance, but once child tax benefit is established, a person may also be a claimant because of a previous child. That is why I asked whether adding the words ``or claimant'' might be relevant in future. Sadly, she was unable to satisfy me on that. Although I enjoyed her response to the first two questions, perhaps she will reflect on this matter and agree to write to me.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> To save the trees, let me tell the right hon. Gentleman that I have given him an explanation. His point is irrelevant. The legislation is clear. As we discuss other amendments and the way in which the children's tax credit operates, he will see how credit sharing works. He will also understand the importance of ``the person'' and ``the claimant'' in the definition. I hope that he will not ask me to write to him on that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> If we get into that proposal, we will see the difficulties that are caused by the lack of clarity. I am disappointed that the Paymaster General is not prepared to correspond with me. She could, in the interests of the trees, communicate electronically. A silent message could be sent in response to my query about what will happen to children's tax credit. She may be right that the legislation is adequate at this instance, but I am interested in the future.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I do not want to deprive the right hon. Gentleman of the joy of receiving a letter from me. It is not that I do not want to write to him, but I am trying to answer him now. However, I shall look at the record and repeat what I have said in writing. If that is not correct, I shall clarify the matter. Let it not be on the record that I was not prepared to communicate with him. I shall be happy to do that by whatever means.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> The reckless generosity of the Paymaster General in agreeing to correspond with me has overwhelmed me so much that I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
{**P4**}Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<B>Mr. Edward Davey </B>(Kingston and Surbiton): I beg to move amendment No. 68, in page 13, line 27, after ``who'', insert ``either''.

<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I do not know whether I shall elicit a drink or a letter from the Paymaster General, but I hope at least to receive a positive response to the amendment. We do not agree that parents of children between 16 and 18 who are in full time education should not receive the benefit of the children's tax credit. When we read the Bill and studied the Government's press releases and notices, we were perplexed and did not understand their argument. I may have become a little cynical, but I wondered whether it was because the Government wanted to use the CTC as a method of replacing child benefit in the long term.
<P>
I am sure that that matter will be debated on clause stand part and I shall not go into detail now. It is clear that parents with young adults in full-time education have to bear the costs of their clothes, pocket money and accommodation, which the system of family support based on child benefit has recognised in the past. At present, child benefit is paid in respect of children between 16 and 18 who are in full-time education, and there has been long been cross-party consensus on that. Does the breaking down of that consensus lie behind the Government's failure to include 16 to 18-year-olds in the clause?
<P>
<B>Mr. David Ruffley </B>(Bury St. Edmunds): Does the hon. Gentleman share my concern that the Labour party has something against 16 to 18-year-olds? Does he recall the extensive briefing and the stories to the effect that the Chancellor of the Exchequer was seeking to abolish child benefit for children in that age group, and the fury that that caused?
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> Yes I do, and it was with those recollections in mind that I tabled the amendments. We must tease out from the Government how they intend to support families with young adults between 16 and 18. Press reports have stated that the Chancellor is considering introducing a maintenance allowance, targeted at young adults who want to stay on at school, but who are from low-income families who may bring pressure to bear on them to leave school and get a job. That is a serious issue and it is right that the Government are considering it.
<P>
It is important to increase staying-on rates at school, particularly for young adults from disadvantaged backgrounds. That issue can be separated from the debate on child benefit and children's tax credit, because in many ways, it is a completely different argument. If the Government are trying to tie in the two issues, they should be open about it and tell us that that is what is in their mind. They should not be making changes to the support framework for young adults without being upfront about their intentions. That is why we tabled the amendment, and why we hope that the Government will explain more about their thinking. Otherwise, we will remain highly suspicious of their intentions.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I ask the Committee to resist the amendment. I hope that I will be able to allay the suspicions of the hon. Member for (Kingston and Surbiton) Mr. Dawn on support for 16, 17 and 18-year-olds. I remind him that the Chancellor said in his budget statement that the aim of the proposed reforms of income tax personal allowances was to focus help more closely on families when they most needed that support-- after they had had their children and when their children were growing up. I know that the hon. Gentleman himself spoke on the Floor of the House about the stresses and pressures on low-income families, particularly when the children are small.
<P>
The purpose of the children's tax credit is therefore to focus specifically on the group that we are discussing; the taper is to ensure that benefits are recycled to that group. The hon. Gentleman linked that to a wider point about support for young people staying education after the age of 16. He referred to the announcement made by my right hon. Friend the Chancellor on the proposals for the new education maintenance allowance and I can give the Committee details on that. Its purpose is specifically to encourage young people aged 16 or over to remain at school or college and seek to improve their qualifications. I give that information because it is pertinent to the point made by the hon. Gentleman, so I hope that I may be allowed to stray slightly from the content of the clause.
<P>
The allowance will be piloted from September in Bolton, the city of Nottingham, Cornwall, Doncaster, Gateshead, Leeds, Middlesbrough, Oldham, Southampton, Stoke-on-Trent and parts of London. It is intended to provide support directly to young people who remain in education, not to their parents. 
<P>
In our alternative approach to supporting young people in full-time education, we believe, that it is only right that the children's tax credit should be limited to families with children under 16 living at home. The education allowance, of up to £40 a week, will be piloted in 12 areas across England from September and will be paid on a means-tested basis to young people in full-time education. The maximum payment will be given where the taxable household income is below £13,000 a year, and a tapered amount will be, available to those with household incomes between £13,000 and £30,000. In London the figure is £20,000. That will ensure that we get the money directly to the young person. There will be no restriction on how that money is spent but in order to qualify for it, the young person would have to sign and stick to a learning agreement; obviously we want to ensure that recipients are genuinely in full-time education.
<P>
The attempt by the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton to link the scheme with the future of child benefits cannot be sustained because the Chancellor's announcements are now in the public domain. The purpose of the children's tax credit is different; it will help low-income families with children below the age of 16. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will ask leave to withdraw the amendment, that he will no longer suspect the Government's motives and that he will look forward to the success of the pilot schemes.

<P>

<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> No drink, no letter--but that was still a useful answer from the Paymaster General. However, I invite her to be more specific about how the allowance will be paid for; I want her to allay my suspicion that the pilot schemes might be funded from other sources. It might be the Government's intention to phase out the child benefit paid to the parents of 16, 17 and 18-year olds by not increasing those payments in line with inflation. We all know that the Government have said that child benefit will generally increase in line with prices, but can the Paymaster General assure us that payments for that age group will be indexed? If she can give me such an assurance, I should be keen to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> If I promise to buy the hon. Gentleman a drink, will he withdraw the amendment? [Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Such offers of blandishments may have to be reported to the appropriate House authorities if they continue to be made.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> Does that mean, Mr. Butterfill, that I should buy you one, too?
<P>
The purpose of the pilot schemes for the education maintenance allowance is to test the policy. The allowance will be paid directly to the young people involved. It is intended to encourage young people to stay in education, given the problems that exist because of pressures in families that are unable to support their sons and daughters, or grandsons and granddaughters, in post-16 education. We must wait for the outcome of those pilot schemes to discover whether our objectives have been met in the best possible way. The Government will then decide how they want to take forward the education maintenance allowance.
<P>
The hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton continues to try to connect the educational maintenance allowance to child benefit. Frankly, I am disappointed with the hon. Gentlemen, because he has often complimented the Government on the Floor of the House on our commitment to child benefit. We have increased child benefit and continue to defend it as a central part of our policy of supporting families in need and ensuring that the money goes to low-income families with young children.
<P>
If the hon. Gentlemen is still not prepared to accept the undertakings that I have given, he must follow closely the outcome of the pilot schemes for the education maintenance allowance and decide for himself whether he thinks it a suitable way to fund post-16 education.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B>  As I suspected, I did not get a straight answer to my question--but given the need to make progress, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Whittingdale  </B>(Maldon and East Chelmsford): I beg to move amendment No. 98, in page 14, line 11, leave out ``2001-02'' and insert ``2000-01''.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B>  With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 99, in page 14, line 14, leave out ``2002-03'' and insert ``2001-2''.
<P>
<B>Mr. Whittingdale:</B>  I draw the lesson from our debate that we must try to keep the Paymaster General and her colleagues up all night more often, as it clearly engenders a wonderful spirit of munificence. I shall chance my luck now.
<P>
I shall not delay the Committee unduly on this amendment, but I do not wish hon. Members to draw the conclusion that we do not believe that it is extremely important. Its purpose is to enact the Budget speech--one would have thought that was what the Finance Bill was meant to do, but it does not do it. In his speech on 9 March, the Chancellor of the Exchequer said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``we will replace the married couple's allowance with a new family tax cut''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He went on to refer to the
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``children's tax credit, the tax cut for families to be introduced from April 2001''.--[Official Report, 9 March 1999; Vol. 327, cc. 182-183.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
What the Chancellor did not say in his budget speech was that the married couples allowance would disappear a full year before the children's tax cut came into effect. In other words, there will be a full year in which couples with children will have the benefit of neither the married couples allowance nor the children's tax cut. The Chancellor was quite clear in his speech. He said that the married couples allowance would be replaced by a new family tax cut. The purpose of the amendment is simple; it would make precisely that happen. It would remove that gap of a year.
<P>
If the clause is enacted as it stands, it will represent a huge increase in stealth taxation. The Red Book shows that the abolition of the married couples allowance will raise £1.6 billion for the Government in the coming year--2000--but the children's tax credit, as I have explained, will not come into effect until the following year. The Chancellor's statement is fraudulent in the way in which it describes how the replacement will come into effect. I hope that the Government will carry into effect the statement that the Chancellor made on Budget day. If they are to do that, they will have to accept the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> I support my hon. Friend the Member for Maldon East Chelmsford (Mr. Whittingdale), our Front-Bench spokesman, and I would be grateful if the Paymaster General would say what advice she has received from the Inland Revenue about the complexity that taxpayers will have to cope with, resulting from the changes caused by the removal of the married couples allowance in one year, followed by the introduction of the child tax credit. Why could not the two be synchronised? That is yet another example of the Government adding complexity to a tax system that grows--like Topsy, in complexity.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> Unfortunately, Opposition Members misunderstand the Government's policy on supporting families with children, which concentrates especially on families on low incomes. The Opposition do not understand the changes that have been made with the working families tax credit, which will come in this year or the changes to income support, which will also come in this year, or the true value in pounds of the increases in child benefit that will be made this year and next April. They therefore make the error of believing that there is a gap, and that resources are being taken away from families without replacement. I shall cite the example of child benefit and the married couples allowance. Child benefit will be increased from next April.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B>  Will the Paymaster General give way?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo :</B>  No. May I finish this point?
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B>  Will the Paymaster General give way on that very point?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B>  With respect, the right hon. Gentlemen cannot know what my very point is because I have not made it yet.
<P>
The loss of married couples allowance next year will mean a weekly loss of £3.78. The increase in child benefit for the first child is £3.55 a week. That will be before the increase in child benefit for the second child is in place.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B>  A stealth increase. 
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B>  The hon. Gentlemen is right. Families on low incomes will have the benefit of the increase in child benefit before they lose the married couples allowance, which will be replaced a year later by the children's tax credit worth £416 a year. Couples will be receiving more money, not less, so there cannot be a gap.
<P>
The child premium in the working families tax credit payable to those on low incomes will be increased in October, before the removal of the married couples allowance. The changes in income support child premiums will also be in place this year for those on the lowest incomes. We have supported those on the lowest incomes immediately, before the married couples allowance is removed. There is no gap.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B>  The Paymaster-General's argument ignores childless couples.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> Did the hon. Gentlemen say childless couple?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B>  Yes, in the context of the abolition of the married couples allowance, the hon. Lady's remarks do not recognise childless couples.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B>  The whole purpose of the reforms--
<P>
<B>Ruffley:</B>  Will the hon. Lady give way?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B>  Just a minute. The purpose of the reforms is to support families on low incomes who have children. The changes in income tax and the reduced rate will help childless couples and, again, they will be in place before the married couples allowance is removed. The hon. Gentlemen's point is not right. I would be glad if he got the gist of what we are about, which is supporting families with children. I ask the Committee to resist the amendments because they are unnecessary; they were drafted by Opposition Members who do not understand the full range of the benefits announced in the Budget for families on low incomes.
<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Whittingdale:</B>  That is all very well, but it is not what the Chancellor said in his Budget speech. He said nothing about getting rid of the married couple's allowance, replacing it with the working families tax credit and increasing child benefit. He said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``we will replace the married couple's allowance with a new family tax cut''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is a simple statement, but it is not true. The Chancellor then said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The married couple's allowance is today worth £190 ... The children's tax credit, the tax cut for families ... will be worth £416''--[Official Report, 9 March 1999; Vol. 327, c. 182-183.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He was quite clear about it; the married couple's allowance would go and children's tax credit would come in. All we seek is that should be delivered.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B>  The hon. Gentlemen has dug himself into another hole. Does he not accept that £416 is worth more than £190, and that the Chancellor was quite right when he said that we were replacing the married couple's allowance with a tax cut--the children's tax credit?
<P>
<B>Mr. Whittingdale:</B>  As my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton points out, not everyone who gets the married couples allowance will receive it the CTC. When the married couple's allowance goes in 2001, it will represent a gain to the Exchequer of more than £2 billion; the cost of the children's tax credit is £1.4 billion. By any definition, that is an increase in taxation.
<P>
The Chancellor was quite clear in his Budget speech. The Finance Bill does not deliver what the Chancellor said. The amendment does, We shall therefore press the amendment to a Division.

<P>

<B>Mr. Whittingdale:</B>  The amendments to clause 27 draw attention to some of the flaws in the Government's proposal for a new children's tax credit. However, other problems, which we have not yet touched upon, are more serious. It is also worth considering the effect of the changes taken together.
<P>
I have already said that the abolition of the married couples allowance will bring in an extra £2 billion to the Exchequer, while the children's tax credit will cost just £1.4 billion. The Exchequer therefore clearly gains through the measure, which is another example of the stealth tax increases that characterise this year and every previous year's, labour Budget. We have also drawn attention, particularly in the previous amendment, to the gap year, as a result of which all families, whether or not they have children, will pay more. There are other aspects to the measure, as my hon. Friend the Member for Bury St. Edmunds (Mr. Ruffley) pointed out childless couples will get no benefit from the measure.
<P>
<B>Members Sally Keeble </B>(Northampton, North): Does the hon. Gentlemen accept that childless couples, like pensioner couples with savings, are likely to be among the wealthiest people in our society and are therefore less likely to need support than people on low incomes--pensioners without savings and couples with children who are among the poorest in our society ?
<P>
<B>Mr. Whittingdale:</B>  I certainly would not argue with the hon. lady about the costs of bringing up children, because it is something that I confront every day. However, it is a sweeping generalisation to say that childless couples are generally better off. Many childless couples are on low incomes and will feel the loss of the married couples allowance severely. Many pensioners who also benefit from that allowance will lose out. The Paymaster General will say that pensioners who currently receive the allowance will continue to do so, but as we said on Second Reading, people who retire after April next year will not. Divorced people, couples with children, higher rate taxpayers and, as the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton said, couples with children in full-time education will no longer get the benefit. The proposal is therefore highly redistributive. [Interruption.] I know that some Labour Members may welcome that, but I had thought that new Labour had given up all those ideas about squeezing until the pips come out and so on.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> How many times does my hon. Friend think that the Chancellor used the word ``redistribution'' in his Budget statement?
<P>
<B>Mr. Whittingdale:</B> My hon. Friend makes a good point. In fact, the Government's Budgets so far have been redistributive--but it has been redistribution by stealth.
<P>
<B>Mr. Love:</B> With all their synthetic concern about poverty, I am surprised at the attitude that the Opposition are taking to redistribution. I have listened carefully to the hon. Gentleman; for the record, can he confirm whether the Opposition support the clause?
<P>
<B>Mr. Whittingdale:</B> Our amendments demonstrate that the clause is flawed. I shall draw attention to some major flaws in the clause and in the attached schedule--but will wait to hear the response of the Paymaster General before deciding whether to press the amendments or to vote against the clause. She may be persuaded by my arguments--I will not hold my breath, but one never knows.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman persuaded by the force of the argument of his right hon. Friend the Leader of the Opposition, who welcomed the proposition that the married couples allowance should be replaced with an allowance targeted at families with children? Never mind whether the hon. Gentleman thinks that I am persuasive--was he persuaded by his right hon. Friend?
<P>
<B>Mr. Whittingdale:</B> I thought for a moment that the hon. Lady was going to offer me a drink if I was persuaded; I live in hope.
<P>
I do not think that my right hon. Friend was referring to the proposals that we are debating, because he would endorse our arguments and agree that they are deeply flawed.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> Why did the Leader of the Opposition state in an article in the Daily Mail:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``if we were going to phase out the married couple's allowance we should have replaced it at the same time with a new allowance, better targeted on families who really need the help''?<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In his response to the Budget speech, the Leader of the Opposition welcomed the proposal.
<P>
<B>Mr. Whittingdale:</B> That quotation is not new; the Chancellor used it in the Budget speech. By definition, it was said at a time when my right hon. Friend the Leader of the Opposition and other Opposition Members had no opportunity of seeing the Government's proposals. My right hon. Friend was not aware that the Government's proposal to scrap the married couples allowance would be followed by introduction of the tax credit a full year later. That was not in the budget speech and we did not know about it until we examined the Red Book. Many damaging aspects of the proposal did not become clear to us until we examined the small print, as is so often the case with measures introduced by the Government.
<P>
On the general principle, my right hon. Friend made it clear that we welcome tax cuts--we would certainly not oppose them--but it is our duty to highlight some of the damaging aspects of the proposal. I have referred to its redistributive effects and the fact that it is a tax increase. My right hon. Friend the Member for Fylde referred to another aspect when he said that it introduces a considerable amount of complexity into the legislation. Unlike the married couples allowance, for which it is not necessary to renew a claim every year, we understand that the new allowance will have to be claimed by taxpayers. The detail of it takes up about five full pages of the Bill. It is not a simple measure, and it will make life difficult for people who may be on low incomes, without degrees in accountancy--or even in economics--and who are not skilled in making tax returns, particularly with the advent of self-assessment.
<P>
I regret, as do the professional bodies who have been in contact with us, that the Government did not choose to accept the recommendations of the tax law re-write Committee when they drafted the proposals. I am beginning to wonder what is the point of the tax law re-write Committee. About once a month I receive a large glossy document, with a foreword by the Paymaster General, referring to the Committee's valuable work, but none of it has turned up in any Finance Bill. My hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton spent many hours in the Committee attempting to simplify tax law and make it easier for taxpayers. I hope that soon we shall see some evidence of that work being put into effect, and some clauses will be tabled to a Finance Bill that reflect the work of my hon. Friend and other hon. Members who have so selflessly devoted their time and effort.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I accepted an amendment to put an apostrophe in the right place in the name of the working families tax credit from the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, which shows that Opposition Members can amend and improve legislation.
<P>
<H5>6.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Whittingdale:</B> I am always impressed by the open-minded attitude of the Paymaster General. We had hoped that the Government would make their own proposals for improvement, rather than relying on the Opposition to point out difficulties. I thought that that was the purpose of the tax law re-write committee. That is a serious point, and I hope that the Government will attempt to simplify the tax law, if not in this Bill then in the near future.
<P>
I want to make a more serious criticism of the clause. It represents a blow to the principle of independent taxation of husbands and wives, which the previous Government introduced couple who want to claim the children's tax credit will have to reveal their income to one another, in order to decide who will benefit from the allocation of relief. The independent taxation of husband and wife is not merely a fine-sounding principle; it matters to a large number of people.
<P>
Couples have visited my constituency advice bureau to express their concern about the Child Support Agency, the forms that they must fill in and the information that they must provide. I am sure that many Labour Members will have heard similar complaints. One of the biggest causes of resentment among such couples is that a parent who has remarried or who has a new partner must submit information about the new partner, husband or wife on the form. In several cases, the person concerned has bitterly resented the legal requirement to reveal information, which should be private. This is the first time that. tax law has required both members of a couple to reveal their income to qualify for a tax credit. That strikes at the heart of the principle of confidentiality and independent taxation.
<P>
At the previous Budget, we were told--or led to believe--that one of the reasons why the Chancellor backed away from taxing child benefit was that it would involve abandoning the principle of independent taxation of husband and wife. The Chancellor seems to have overruled that objection in relation to this measure, which will send a coach and horses through an extremely important principle that was introduced during our period in office. For that reason alone, the measure is deeply flawed.
<P>
We do not object to the measure only on those grounds, but on the grounds that it is deeply illogical. The principle that if either partner is a higher rate taxpayer the couple will no longer be eligible for the tax credit causes some extraordinary anomalies. Several professional bodies have pointed out that if each member of a couple earns £30,000, they will qualify for the children's tax credit. If one member of the couple were a higher rate taxpayer, however, they would be automatically disqualified. The measure will cause the additional problem of extending the benefit culture far higher up the income scale and dramatically increasing marginal rates for many people. For example, calculations that were carried out by the chief economist of the accountancy firm Chantrey Vellacott showed that a married man earning £35,000 whose wife stays at home with the children will pay tax at a marginal rate of 47 per cent. when the tapering of the new tax is taken into account.
<P>
The Paymaster General referred to other measures that the Government have advanced in this context, including the working families tax credit. Those measures, and the clause, suggest that the Government are making increasing numbers of people dependent on means--tested benefits. That is the opposite approach to that supported by the right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field), who, we were told, became a member of the Government in order the unthinkable and to come up with a great plan for reforming the welfare state. Given what has happened since, we can understand why he did not feel able to remain a member of the Government. During last night's debate on welfare proposals, he looked increasingly depressed. He would be even more depressed if he were sitting in the Committee this afternoon--the Government's proposal involves, once again, a move away from universal benefits and towards means--tested benefits.
<P>
The hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton voiced a suspicion about the connection between the proposal and child benefit, which was vigorously denied by the Paymaster General. I rather share the hon. Gentleman's suspicion, especially because, during the Budget speech, the Chancellor said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Our long-term goal is to bring together the different strands of our support for children in the working families tax credit, in income support, in our children's tax credit and so create an integrated and seamless system of child financial support''--[Official Report, 9 March 1999; Vol. 327, c. 183-4.]<P>

All such proposals involve increased reliance on means-tested benefits, which involve profound dangers, especially in the way in which they will extend dependency further up the income scale. That is why the Government's proposal is, at the very least, flawed. We need to consider it in its totality because it offends many principles, which I have discussed. Of course we welcome any reduction in taxation, and I suspect that we shall not vote against the clause, but I hope that the Paymaster General will respond to some of the widely felt concerns that I have voiced.

<P>

<B>Mr. Edward Davey<h>:</B> May I associate myself with many of the comments that were made by the hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford, who rightly pointed out many of the flaws in the proposal?
<P>
The Government seem to be unclear in their overall policy about supporting families with children. Committee members know that they made increasing support for families with children a key element of their welfare strategy. However, that policy was the result of various influences, and it therefore appears to be confused. In the budget speech in March 1998, the Chancellor was fulsome in his praise for child benefit. He said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Child benefit remains the fairest and most efficient and cost-effective way of recognising the extra costs and responsibilities borne by all parents.''--[Official Report, 17 March 1998; Vol. 308, c. 1106.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Having given it that ringing endorsement, the Government went on to consider other ways to support families with children, including the working families tax credit, the associated child care tax credit and, now, the children's tax credit.
<P>
It is not surprising that parents are confused. I do not know whether other Committee members have had the pleasure of going to local playgroups and painting recollections of their childhood, as I have done. The people who run playgroups told me that they are concerned about financing, that they have had to put up their fees, and that they are worried that parents on low incomes will not be able to afford those fees. I explained that the Government are introducing various measures to help such people. Despite my best efforts to promulgate some of the Government's policies in my constituency, many people do not understand the complexity of the Government's system.
<P>
That is a shame, because it will undermine the Government's objectives, which I share. These criticisms are being made not to score political points, but to assist the Government in getting it right.
<P>
In this year's Budget speech, the Chancellor of the Exchequer more or less admitted that he was creating a hotch-potch when he said that in the long run, the financial help that would be provided to families would be integrated into
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``a seamless system ... building on the foundation of universal child benefit.''-- [Official Report, 9 March 1999; Vol. 327, c. 184.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That would be great, if we knew the direction in which we were going. However, the Government have not said how they intend to integrate those financial provisions, or how the different agencies, computer systems and tax bodies are to cope with the plethora of tax credits and allowances. We need a clearer idea as to the direction that the policy will take. If that is not made clear, it will not be surprising if some of us have suspicions.
<P>
I welcomed the Paymaster General's statement on education maintenance allowances, but I must tell her that many tax specialists have examined the proposals for the children's tax credit, and have seen other agendas behind it. I shall quote Julian Le Grand, professor of social policy at the London school of economics, writing in the Financial Times:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Future chancellors will bless [Mr. Brown] for creating this taxing opportunity; for they will gradually be able to phase out one untaxed benefit and replace it with another, taxed, one.''<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
Those concerns will remain, unless the Government make an explicit commitment on the matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Derek Twigg </B>(Halton): Has the hon. Gentleman also seen the quote from Holly Sutherland, director of the microsimulation unit at Cambridge university, who has said that the Chancellor is making money follow children?
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I do not deny that there are outside bodies that support the Government's policy. The hon. Gentleman and I could trade quotes across the Floor; I have a quote here from Ruth Lister, and others from various journalists. However, I do not wish to take up too much of the Committee time with a fruitless battle of quotes.
<P>
I would like to deal with the theory that lies behind the Government's approach. The hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford was right to say that the proposal compromises the principle of independent taxation, and he explained to the Committee in great detail why that was a problem. I should like to take his arguments a little further.
<P>
The measure compromises the principle of independent taxation in that it presents the danger of creating a transfer of funds from purse to wallet. That argument was heard during the proceedings on the Bill that set up the working families tax credit, and it is even more relevant to the children's tax credit. In most cases, the higher rate taxpayer in a couple is the male, so the male would be given the children's tax credit. As the alternative would have been to increase child benefit, the proposal clearly represents a switch from purse to wallet.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> The hon. Gentleman's point is complete rubbish. The married couples allowance was claimed by the man. How, then, can the proposals for children's tax credit represent a transfer from purse to wallet, simply because the recipient might happen to be the man, if he were the higher rate taxpayer?
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> Perhaps I have misunderstood the way in which the married couples allowance worked. However, I believe that  taxpayers were able to decide which one of a couple obtained the allowance.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> The hon. Gentleman is wrong. The married couples allowance must be claimed by the man. It can then be shared, but the initial application must be made by the man.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> The Paymaster General makes a detailed point--[Laughter.]
<P>
<B>Mr. Shaun Woodward Witney:</B> May I assist the hon. Gentleman? The Paymaster General may be critical of the House of Commons Library paper, but the paper itself, produced on 6 May, says that if the man's income is too small to benefit from the allowance, it can be transferred to the wife. With respect, that is what the hon. Gentleman said.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I do not want--
<P>
<H5>7 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Sitting suspended.
<P>
<H5>8.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
On resuming--
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> Before the interval, the Paymaster General and I had an interesting exchange, during which I received support from Conservative Members, on whether the abolition of MCA and the introduction of CTC will represent a purse-to-wallet shift in resources. I was tutored by the Paymaster General in how and when MCA could be shared between partners, but she neglected to explain that the sharing of CTC will work differently. The higher-rate taxpayer will automatically be the recipient--
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I was not tutoring the hon. Gentleman, I was simply providing him with information. With regard to his suggestion that the replacement of MCA with CTC will constitute a transfer from purse to wallet, I explained that, although MCA can be shared, it can be claimed only by the man, but either parent can claim CTC. Therefore, how can the introduction of CTC constitute a transfer from purse to wallet?
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I was making the point about sharing when the Paymaster General intervened. Because of withdrawal procedure arrangements that ensure that money is taken away from the higher-rate taxpayer--who, evidence suggests, tends to be male--CTC will not offer the same sharing options as MCA.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman suggest that the Government should breach independent taxation by running together the man's and the woman's income, so that the taper need not be taken into consideration?
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> The issue is whether the provision will make a sensible addition to the tax system and constitute the best way to support families. The money generated by abolishing MCA could have been spent on child benefit. If we ask a counter-factual and make the comparison with CTC, it is clear that far more money could be channelled into the purse than the wallet. The Government chose not to take that approach, and they do not seem particularly interested in the matter, which is a shame. They have surely read studies such as those undertaken by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, which emphasise that is it important that the mother receives the money.
<P>
The hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford referred to the complexity of the administration system for CTC and the relevant schedule makes it clear that it will indeed be incredibly complex. The requirement for the Inland Revenue to gather information from recipients will prove significant. Having consulted the Library, I shall quote Edward Troup, a representative of a law firm called Simmons and Simmons, who expects administration of the credit to prove difficult. He said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``For every child with child tax credit, you have to identify two people. In a married couple with two children, that is not difficult but as we know that is a minority of households. Identifying who those two people are to check that the taper does have to apply to them is going to be a very considerable compliance burden on the Inland Revenue and is going to involve some potential snooping into individuals lives and I do not know how that is going to be worked out.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Those concerns were expressed by a very eminent tax lawyer. The Treasury tried to answer those concerns in its evidence to the Select Committee. Treasury officials said that only two additional questions were necessary on the self{**nrl**}assessment form to establish whether an individual was a top{**nrl**}rate taxpayer and whether the individual had children. However, when one considers the details of the schedule and starts to think about the practicalities, one realises that there is much more to it. One must work out who is whose partner, and with respect to which child. The tax authorities know it whether people are married but they do not know who is living together and they do not have information about the children. It will be difficult for them to make those links.
<P>
<B>Ms Keeble:</B> Originally, the allowance was called married man's tax allowance. The man was the earner and head of the household, the wife was the financial dependent and the children all came under the same income. It was much simpler but it was based on a model of the woman being financially dependent. Now, women work and are financially independent, so the situation becomes more complicated. Of course, it is necessary to work out who is responsible for the children and who is earning what. It is a completely different system and it is much more complicated. It puts extra burdens on women but it recognises that women are independent financially, as well as being independent in every other way.

<P>

<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Member for Northampton, North for those comments because she obviously agrees with me. I am pleased that there is agreement across the Committee. I should like to quote the remarks of someone else who agrees with the hon. Lady. Diana Coyle from The Independent asked, on 19 March, whether we really want tax inspectors to know the answers to such questions as whether someone is the father of a certain child or just a good friend. She refers to the
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``troubled history of the Child Support Agency''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and warns about the difficulties--
<P>
<B>Kali Mountford </B>(Colne Valley): Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Derek Twigg:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> If the hon. Gentleman will wait a minute, I shall be happy to give way, but I want to finish my point.
<P>
The concern raised by Diana Coyle, which I share, is that the Government are embarking on an administrative system that is very much like the Child Support Agency. Hon. Members on both sides of the Committee are aware of the problems created by that system in terms of administrative complexity and heartache among constituents.
<P>
<B>Kali Mountford:</B> The hon. Gentleman referred to the evidence given to the Select Committee. If he considered that evidence further, he would also notice that those complexities were discussed. Did not that evidence show that, in the majority of cases, the parent with care would be obvious, as the children could be seen in the household?
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> Well, Mr. Butterfill--
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> Killer point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> It is not a killer point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> Irony.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I failed to recognise the irony. The hon. Gentleman's irony is usually a little more obvious.
<P>
The hon. Lady might be right, and the evidence given to the Select Committee might be right about the majority of parents, but that would still leave significant numbers of parents facing those difficulties, and that is an additional burden on the tax system. I am surprised that the hon. Lady is so happy about that.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way when he is talking about the complexities of the tax system. Will he explain to the Committee how the additional personal allowance worked, what questions needed to be asked before someone could qualify for it and then, as the right hon. Member for Fylde often says, compare and contrast it with the child tax credit?
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> It is a tempting proposition to give the Committee an extemporary lecture--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not be tempted down that path.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I was just about to say that I would not be tempted, although I am, of course, familiar with the detailed workings of the additional personal allowance.
<P>
Finally, a tax professional put the point in an interesting way. Writing in Taxation, he said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The moral is fairly clear: if you cannot be good, be careful who you live with, and if you cannot be careful then do not contribute to the maintenance of the other person's children (in which event one apparently side-steps the whole fiscal shooting match).''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is what concerns the professionals. They believe that the proposal will not work in practice.
<P>
It behoves the Government to respond to those points. I look forward to hearing whether the Paymaster General can reassure the Committee that the new tax credit is not going to be a complete dog's breakfast and will not cause great heartache among our constituents.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick St. Aubyn </B>(Guildford): That speech has left many of us confused about what we are debating. I remind the Committee that we are talking about a stealth tax that will take money out of the pockets of people who do not earn very much. Although the previous Conservative Government had an outstanding record of cutting tax for people on lower incomes, they also cut tax for people on all levels of income. The difference with this Government is that under the policy of redistribution--Front Benchers dare not speak its name--the penalty is paid by those who earn more because they have to give money to those who earn less.
<P>
The problem with that approach, no matter how fair it may seem, is that it is short-sighted. We have evidence across the board that policies that rob one group of taxpayers to reward another contribute to a lower rate of growth and lead to less dynamism and less capacity for growth in an economy. The less an economy grows, the less money there is to pay for the needs of society. That is why today has been declared independence day. It is the day when the typical person working in this country stops working for the Government and starts working for himself. But under this Government, they will have to work longer to reach independence day.
<P>
We are told that the allowance returns £1.4 billion to the economy. However, that must be considered in the context of the loss of the MCA, which removes £2 billion from the economy. Indeed, in the first year, that is a straight tax grab of £2 billion.
{**P5**}The Chairman: Order. I am getting a little concerned about how the clause stand part debate is progressing. We spent a long time debating clause 28 on the Floor of the House.  It seems that a number of hon. Members are trying to debate it again. I have been tolerant in allowing a stand part debate on clause 27, but I will not let it become another debate on clause 28. The hon. Gentleman and others must confine their remarks to clause 27.
{**P5**}Mr. St. Aubyn: I am grateful, but Labour Members have admitted that we are debating a redistributive measure. We did not hear that on the Floor of the House.  Redistribution is a flawed strategy.  By destroying the willingness to save and provide for oneself, it damages the economy and prevents it from growing as well or as productively as it otherwise might. If we were to agree to the clause without signalling that point, it might be thought that we agreed to redistribution as a policy, which we do not. We argue that, where possible, tax rates should be cut across the board, because that would generate a more prosperous society. A smaller share of a bigger and faster-growing cake is worth more to every sector of society than such small-minded, short-sighted clauses and policies.
<P>
<H5>8.45pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
According to the Bank of England's latest inflationary report published this month, the measures introduced in the Budget are expected by the Treasury 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``to leave the effective tax rate on household incomes broadly unchanged over the next three years.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It also notes:
{**P10**} ``On the basis of the available data, the effective tax rate on households income is estimated to have increased by between and 1/2 percentage point in 1998, equivalent to 0.4 per cent.--0.7 per cent. of GDP. Higher taxes are therefore likely to explain some of the slowdown in the growth rate of consumption last year''<P>

<P>
consumption being a key component of the economy's growth rate.
<P>
Redistribution is not a long-term solution to the problems of poverty. The Select Committee on Education and Employment, of which I am a member, gave all-party support to the concept that people in post-16 education should receive help. Let us not forget how much the previous Government increased the staying-on rate.   I visited a sixth-form college in Hackney, where I met a young girl showing members of the Committee around who worked 15 hours a week outside her school study period to pay for a sixth form education. I accept the logic of the children's tax credit stopping at the age of 16 if there is to be help for those who stay in full-time education, but let us not forget that the point of doing that would not have existed if we had not already raised the staying-on rate at 16 to a much higher level than that inherited from Labour in 1979.
<P>
If we are to see a genuine benefit for people on lower incomes and find the money for better education, we need a faster-growing economy. Evidence from the inflation report and other countries suggests that we need to cut the general level of taxation, and not simply rob Peter to pay Paul.
<P>
The Government inherited a rate of taxation of 37 per cent. of GDP, and will have raised it to 41 per cent. by 2002. That 4 per cent. increase in the overall rate of taxation as a percentage of national income represents a drag on the capacity for growth of our economy and for our society to provide for all our needs.
<P>
That is why the Government's policy is fundamentally flawed. Although we may accept a tax credit for children as a cut, we do so with great reservations because of the surreptitious stealth tax on all married couples and the Government's broad agenda to raise taxes year after year.
{**P5**}Mr. Ruffley: The underlying logic that the Government are adopting in introducing the clause turns on an attack on marriage.  Paragraph 5.10, on page 68 of the Red Book, contains words to the effect that the married couples allowance is a poor way of recognising marriage. The reasons adduced for saying that change some of the facts to which Ministers have drawn attention, such as that the additional persons allowance payable to non-married couples with children is of the same value as the married couples allowance, and that therefore marriage is not recognised in the tax system.
<P>
It seems that there is no recognition of marriage in the new regime that the Government will usher in under the proposals. Worse than that, there as an anti-marriage bias in the clauses, and the reasons are not--
<P>
<B>Mr. Derek Twigg:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> I am delighted to give way to the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
<B>Mr. Twigg:</B> I am even more grateful that the hon. Gentleman has done so than I would otherwise have been. If the case is as you say, why did your Government--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order.
<P>
<B>Mr. Twigg:</B> I apologise. Why did the hon. Gentleman's Government cut marriage couples allowance from 40 per cent. to 15 per cent.? The hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford likes quoting accountancy firms, but Deloitte and Touche said that it is a small symbol of marriage.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> I am grateful for the intervention, but the hon. Gentleman's questions will be answered by the next part of my remarks.  Of couples married before the regime was ushered in, those who will remain tax privileged will be pensioners born before 6 April 1935. Those born after that date will lose the tax privilege associated with their being married. From amendments and remarks made by the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton, we know that, under the proposals, couples with children aged more than 16 will no longer receive a tax privilege for being married. We also know that couples in which someone earns more than £38,500 a year will not get any benefit from this tax credit at all, and they will also lose the married couples allowance. Those are tangible examples of ways in which the proposals actively discriminate against married couples, who were not so discriminated against before the Budget statement and the Bill.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I think that the hon. Gentleman was an adviser in the Treasury to the Chancellor before--
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> Oh, no. Answer the question.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> All right. If the hon. Gentleman was not, I shall withdraw that remark. I was not going to refer to policy--the hon. Gentleman is too quick to think that he would get a question to put him on the spot. Given what he said about the married couples allowance, I would like him to explain why on 29 January 1998, writing in the Daily Mail, the Leader of the Opposition said, referring to the previous Conservative Government's decision to phase out married couples allowance:
{**P10**}``We wanted to stop well off couples without children getting a tax allowance they did not need.''<P>

{**P4**}Will the hon. Gentleman explain whether that is still the position of the Leader of the Opposition? If it is, does he agree with it and how does that fit in with what he said on married couples allowance?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> The Paymaster General has made no serious attempt to answer the question of whether, before the Chancellor delivered the Budget speech, married couples expected their marriage tax to be privileged. In case she has forgotten, let us remind her that we are talking about pensioners born after 6 April 1935, couples with children aged more than 16--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I said to hon. Members earlier that I was not prepared to tolerate another debate on clause 28. We had a debate at great length on that clause on the Floor of the House.  We are on clause 27, and I insist that hon. Members confine their remarks to its content or I shall ask them to resume their seats.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> Conservative Members will of course follow your strictures, Mr. Butterfill.
<P>
My next point relates to the palpable unfairness of the clause and the associated provisions in schedule 3.
<P>
<B>Mr. Derek Twigg:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> I will not give way to the hon. Gentleman; his comments are not worth listening to. [Interruption.] If he would let me develop this point, I should be happy to consider whether or not to let him intervene later.
<P>
The palpable unfairness of the clause is shown in a simple case study. Let us suppose that a couple--a man and a woman--earns just under the top rate tax limit, say £32,000 a year each. They will be eligible for the new tax credit. Let us consider another couple; the husband is a top rate taxpayer on £39,000 a year and his wife earns nothing. She decides not to take paid employment, but to look after an aged relative or her children. The second couple will enjoy no tax credit, privilege or recognition under the clause. That is extraordinary, given that the Government argue that the provisions are family friendly. The second couple is discriminated against perversely.
<P>
<B>Mr. Love:</B> The Opposition cannot have it both ways.  They are saying that the principle of independent taxation must be upheld, yet what the hon. Gentleman says happens as a consequence of independent taxation. The Opposition must choose whether or not they want independent taxation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> The hon. Gentleman has not even intervened at the right point in my speech, so I shall comfortably ignore what he has said.
<P>
<B>Ms Keeble:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> I will not give way. In the spirit of co-operation, let me talk about independent taxation. I hope that the Government will respond co-operatively.
<P>
On 23 March, the Chancellor gave his definition of independent taxation to the Treasury Select Committee on which I am privileged to sit. His definition may surprise some of the hon. Ladies on the Labour Benches who are cheerfully smirking and may, or may not, be listening. There has been no serious discussion of independent taxation and its meaning, which is absolutely crucial to any sensible understanding of the clause and its effects.
<P>
The Chancellor used a selective definition of independent taxation. He said that the wife or partner should not be regarded as a chattel, as she was under previous tax legislation.  I agree with that fair-minded comment. [Interruption.] The hon. Ladies who are squawking hysterically should listen to the arguments. The Chancellor's second criterion was that everyone should be treated equally under the tax system. I have no problem with that statement, bland as it is--typical new Labour. His third criterion was that each person should have the same personal allowance. No one could disagree with that, but a problem arises under the clause.
<P>
The director of the microeconomic simulation unit of the university of Cambridge, Miss Holly Sutherland, has shown how the principle of independent taxation will be compromised under the clause. She gave an example of a two-earner couple, both of whom pay tax at the higher rate. Under the clause and the associated provisions in the schedule, the top-rate taxpayer would receive the credit. Miss Sutherland asked what would happen if that person was a women who, a year later, started to care for a relative and paid no tax. The argument is that the taper would apply in the first year against her income, because she was the top-rate taxpayer of the couple and, in the second year, it would operate against her husband's income.
<P>
<H5>9 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Miss Sutherland said that in those circumstances a change in the income of one partner affected the tax liability of the other partner. She argued that that was a breach of the principle of independent taxation, in that a change in one person's income should not affect the tax liability of the other. The Government have not even begun to address that definition, and one that an expert witness told the Select Committee on the Treasury was the appropriate definition of independent taxation.
<P>
What is the hon. Lady's definition of independent taxation? We all agree that the definition of the Chancellor was selective and highly inappropriate? It conflicted with what expert witnesses suggested.
<P>
<B>Mr. Love:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> I will not. Time is short.
<P>
I should like my next questions at least to be considered by the Paymaster General. First, the Chancellor wants a seamless system, so that child benefit payments, working family tax credit payments and payments under the child tax credit system are streamlined. When will that system be put in place? The evidence given to the Select Committee on the Treasury was to the effect that the Government did not really know. They must perceive a problem; that is why they want to streamline a complex system with three different modes of payment to families with children.
<P>
My second Question relates to the ways in which different couples can elect to whom the credit is paid. Will the Paymaster General give me an undertaking that the European convention on human rights is not breached by same-sex couples having a more liberal regime for electing to whom the tax credit should go? Heterosexual couples have a much tighter and more restrictive regime for their elections, as set out in paragraphs 2, 3, 4 and 5 of the schedule. Is the European convention on human rights being breached?
<P>
Finally, why will only the top-rate taxpayer in a couple be the recipient of the credit, not the lower earner of the couple who should logically be the correct recipient of the credit? If the Paymaster General could deal with those points and if those in the cheaper seats at the back of the Labour Benches, who are object lessons in joined-up sycophancy, took more note of issues such as independent taxation, the real role of women and how the position of women is prejudiced under the clause, this country would be in a better state than it is at present.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> Will the Paymaster General or the Economic Secretary kindly tell me why they thought that the clause was the best way to give £8 per week to couples with children?
<P>
Why did they reject alternative ways, such as further additions to child benefit, or other mechanisms? One of the key factors in helping children is the sustenance of a loving family relationship, however one chooses to define ``family''. Did the Treasury conduct research into the economic factors and the influence of the tax system on divorce in reaching its conclusions about the creation of this tax credit?
<P>
The structure of the credit does not distinguish between families with one child and those with more children. Will the Minister say why the Government felt that that was the best way to help families when it means that the amount of the credit is diluted in direct relationship to the number of children in a family? How will the mechanism help those at the lower end of the income scale with relatively large families?
<P>
Will the Minister comment on the creation of the seamless system? In The Guardian of 10 March, the Chancellor is quoted as saying that the children's tax credit is intended
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``to create an integrated and seamless system of child financial support paid to the mother''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Why does the structure of the tax credit not adhere to the Chancellor's own objectives?
<P>
Why are people in other dependency relationships, such as a son and his wife looking after an aged relative, deemed not to require particular help, whereas those involving children are deemed to need such help?

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We are straying perilously close to the contents of schedule 3, which we shall debate, I suspect, at considerable length in the near future. Clause 27 is relatively narrow. Of course, it impinges on clause 28 and on schedule 3. They are all inter-related, but we seem to be having a debate on all of these matters in relation to clause 27. I shall have to be very strict when we debate schedule 3 if we have a schedule 3 stand part debate as part of the clause 27 stand part debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> I hope that my comments about the structure of the tax credit relate to clause 27. I accept entirely that the schedule attached to the clause goes into much more detail, which I have tried assiduously to avoid. In asking my final question, I am seeking merely to draw from the Minister the reason why clause 27 does not contain a wider provision that goes beyond the dependency relationship that is currently defined in narrow terms, which relates only to children. I hope that she will answer my questions in full.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> I have three questions for the Minister. First, what will she say to the 6.4 million married couples who currently benefit from the married couples allowance, but who have no children who will benefit? They will lose out. Secondly, what will she say to the 0.3 million married couples who have children, who are eligible for child benefit, but whose children are all over 16? They will lose out.
<P>
It may be a point of principle. As a director of Childline, I am the last person in the world who would do anything that took something away from children. If it is a point of principle, why is the money not being made available next year?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I shall start with the comments of the hon. Member for Witney. He was not in the Room earlier, but if he reads the debate on the preceding amendments, he will see the detailed explanation of the extra money that went into low-income families' tax credit this year, the extra money that went into income support to families on low incomes and the value of the increases in child benefit this April and next April, which go to families before the married couples allowance is deducted. That shows clearly the resources being made available to the families in greatest need, who are on the lowest incomes and have young children. I know that that is of particular importance to the hon. Member for Witney, because of his interests outside the House.
<P>
As I have made clear in previous debates, couples who lose the married couples allowance and have no children will benefit from the reduction in personal income tax.
<P>
As regards children who are over 16, again I recommend that the hon. Gentleman reads the record about the education maintenance allowance. I shall not try your patience, Mr. Butterfill, by going through it again, but the hon. Gentlemen will find the answers to his questions there. They have already been posed in the Committee and answered.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> And the third question?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I am sorry. I do not remember what it was.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> What was the reason for scrapping the married couples allowance in the coming year but not introducing the child tax credit for a further year?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> We discussed that in the previous debate. There is no gap year, because all the extra money goes to families before the married couples allowance is removed. It is worth as much as, if not more than, the current value of £190 a year of the married couples allowance. Those families are not only receiving the extra money now, but will receive the new children's tax credit. There is no gap year. Again I shall not try your patience, Mr. Butterfill, by repeating everything that I said in the previous debate. The hon. Gentleman can read my wise words.
<P>
With regard to the general proposition, Opposition Members seem to want to overlook the fact that in the 18 years when they were in Government the number of children living in families in poverty substantially increased to more than 3 million. The UK had one of the highest rates of child poverty in the industrialised world. It does not surprise me that hon. Members do not want to discuss those points or--
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> Will the Paymaster General give way?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> Perhaps I may finish this point, Nor do they want to address the issues, unlike the leader of their party, who had the foresight to criticise his Government when in power for not redirecting resources to families in greatest need. Perhaps the hon. Member for Guildford (Mr. St. Autyn) can tell the Committee whether he agrees with the leader of his party when he said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``We want to stop well off couples without children getting a tax allowance they did not need.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I am grateful to the Paymaster General for giving way. I want to pick up on one point that she made about levels of poverty. In today's figures income was defined as poverty, in 1979 and in 1997? I think that she will find that, on her definition of poverty, there was a substantial increase in the real level of that income.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B>  The hon. Gentleman should feel ashamed of that comment. When he looks at the figures, which I am happy to circulate to him and to every member of the Committee, he will see that the real income of a substantial proportion of children in our society fell from 1979. That is a shameful record. The hon. Gentleman says that it was redistribution. His Government were redistributing it from the poor to those who had more.
<P>
A number of questions were asked about the children's tax credit, and hon. Members concentrated particularly on the married couples allowance. As you said, Mr. Butterfill, we discussed that extensively on the Floor of the House, so I shall not go through the arguments again about the protection of the married couples allowance for people aged 65 and over and the redirection of resources through the child care tax credit for people on lower incomes.
<P>
It is not true, as hon. Members claimed, that we are increasing the top rate of tax by stealth, by tapering away an allowance for higher rate taxpayers. There is no increase in the top tax rate. The principle of what we are doing is already adopted in the tax system to withdraw the value of an allowance. The age allowance for pensioners works on the same basis, and was put in place by the Conservative Government. But of course the Conservatives' collective amnesia does not allow them to remember that they were in power for 18 years and did such things.
<P>
<H5>9.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Derek Twigg:</B> My hon. Member mentioned the word ``amnesia''. I noticed that when I asked the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds about the reduction in the allowance when the previous Government were in power, he did not answer. Does my hon. Friend have any views on why he did not answer? 
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> Either it was shame, or the hon. Gentleman forgot. But he can answer for himself.
<P>
Opposition Members quoted the Red Book and said that we were not spending all the married couples allowance on families on low incomes. We have already been through that today, as well as discussing the increase in children's tax credit to £416 a year, as opposed to the £190 for the married couple's allowance. The money has also helped to fund increases in working families' tax credit, with specific premiums for children, and income support. In any event, the figure for children's tax credit in the Red Book is for the first year of the credit only.
<P>
The hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford said that most people needed to claim each year. That is not so. Most people will not have to make an annual claim for married couples allowance, any more than they do now. That was precisely the rule that Conservative Members presided over, without alteration, apart from the time that they reduced the value of the allowance. After the advent of independent taxation, the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke) described it, as an anomaly in the system that could not be justified, and so would not continue. But all that has been forgotten because the Conservatives think that the tax system just maintains itself, and that no doubt the wicked people in the Inland Revenue, whom Conservatives seem to hold responsible for everything that happened when they were in Government, are at it again.
<P>
There was also the bizarre allegation that the children's tax credit breaches the principle of independent taxation.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Burnett </B>(Torridge and West Devon): Will the hon. Lady give way?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I want to explain why children's tax credit does not breach independent taxation rules. I will give way to the hon. Gentleman afterwards.
<P>
There is no breach of the principle of independent taxation. People will still be taxed as individuals, and have their own allowances and rate bands. The credit is withdrawn on the basis of a claimant's income if the taper applies. There is no compulsory disclosure of information to the spouse or partner--
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> Will the hon. Lady give way?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I will not give way. I shall finish what I am saying. I shall then give way--first to the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon (Mr. Burnett), and then to the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds. People will not have to disclose income to a spouse or partner, but if people want to claim a relief, it is only right that they should be able to show that they are eligible for it. That is not revolutionary; it is how the tax system works--and it is how the married couples allowance worked.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> Does the Paymaster General not agree that, for the children's tax credit to operate, couples will have to disclose their income to each other to ascertain who has the highest income?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> No, only one person has to apply. To breach independent taxation, there has to be a disclosure of information and the bringing together of two people's tax records and allowances as if they were one. That was the position before the introduction of independent taxation, and the change does not make that breach.

<P>

<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> Will the hon. Lady give way?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> With respect to the right hon. Gentleman, I said that I would give way first to the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> The definition of independent taxation given by an expert witness to the Treasury Select Committee was that a change in the income of one partner in a couple should not change the tax liability of the other partner. It is a simple proposition. Is the hon. Lady denying that that is an accurate definition of independent taxation--yes or no?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> No, I am not denying that. That is why the tax credit cannot be shared if one partner is a higher rate taxpayer; both sets of information would have to be put together, and the taper would run accordingly. It is to prevent the breaching of independent taxation that the taper applies only at that point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I think that the hon. Lady is having some difficulty in responding to the two previous interventions. First, my hon. Friend the Member for Bury St. Edmunds asked whether a change in the income of one partner could lead to a change in the tax burden of the other partner. Is that right or wrong? The second question was how can two people in a partnership decide which one has the lower income if neither knows what the other's income is?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> First, if a taper is in operation, individuals who apply for a relief have to say when applying for the relief whether they are higher rate taxpayers. Secondly, as the right hon. Gentleman knows, independent taxation ceases when two individual tax records are put together. As the Chancellor explained to the Treasury Select Committee, the principles are still in place.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> It is a breach of the independent taxation principle.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> Well, the married couples allowance was shared without breaching independent taxation. Therefore the child care tax credit can be shared without breaching independent taxation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> Will the hon. Lady give way?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> If I may, I shall make a little progress. I have been asked several questions, which hon. Members will want to be answered on the record. I have been generous in giving way, but I should now like to make some progress. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> Will the hon. Lady give way before she leaves the subject of independent taxation?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> No, I would like to make progress.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> My right hon. Member wants to help the Paymaster General.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> Help I do not need.
<P>
The next set of points that the hon. Gentleman made was that the measure hits single earner households harder than dual earner households. To return to the subject of independent taxation, single earner couples will tend to pay more tax than dual earners, because they have only one set of allowances and rate bands to set against income. The taper raises no new issues. As we have said, plenty of other measures in the Budget help couples.
<P>
The next series of points was based on the notion that the taper is a disincentive to work. [Interruption.] If Opposition Members do not want to hear the answers to questions, I am happy to sit down; I am sure that had a nice glass of wine over dinner, but it has not improved their humour. The taper does not come into effect until income exceeds the higher rate threshold and ensures that money can be taken from higher rate taxpayers on a progressive basis and the resources reused.
<P>
The hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton wanted to know why we did not put the money raised from the abolition of the married couples allowance into something else, presumably child benefit. The child benefit increase was above inflation, and from April 2000 child benefit will be worth at least £15 for the first child and £20 for subsequent children. The new children's tax credit, the increase in working families tax credit and the income support increases provide a package of extra support to families who need it most, and will improve work incentives. The Government therefore chose a package of measures, in addition to child benefit, to help families. The real need is to ensure that we get the money to those on the lowest incomes.
<P>
The hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton went on to say that the Revenue inspectors would be intrusive and make many inquiries; he talked about the complexity of the system. Married couples allowance took 10 pages of legislation and the children's tax credit five. There is no reason to suppose that the previous work on the additional personal  allowance, and it is right to treat married and unmarried couples in the same way if they have similar responsibilities for children. The hon. Gentleman's argument that the measure is somehow a new charter for the Inland Revenue to make inquiries is therefore false.
<P>
Several hon. Members said that the Government did not value marriage. You reminded the Committee, Mr. Butterfill, that we should not repeat our discussions on the married couples allowance, but we would all agree that two people do not enter marriage because they will get tax relief, but because they want to commit to a relationship. The Government's proposals on reusing the married couples allowance ensure that families with children will get the support that they need.
<P>
The last question asked by the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton was whether the children's tax credit contravened the European convention on human rights. Our legal advice is that there are no ECHR problems.
<P>
The hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds went on to ask about whether same--sex couples could apply for double children's tax credit. The treatment of same--sex couples mirrors that for the current additional personal allowance under rules introduced by the previous Conservative Government The hon. Gentleman's points are simply wrong.
<P>
<H5>9.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> Will the hon. Lady give way?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> No, I will not give way.
<P>
In conclusion, the hon. Gentleman lacks an understanding of how the married couples allowance works and how the children's tax credit, built out of the married couples allowance, will provide, better income and security for families.
<P>
On put and agreed to.

Clause 27, as amended, ordered to stand Part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Schedule 3</center></H4>
<H4><center>NEW SCHEDULE 13B TO THE TAXES ACT 1988</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 127, in page 97, line 23, leave out from ``partner'' to end of line 25 and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``(b) otherwise the Children's Tax Credit shall be divided equally between the two claimants.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take amendment No. 72, in page 97, leave out lines 24 to 25 and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``(b) if they do not make an election, each partner will be entitled to a credit, calculated by halving the amount in section 257AA(2).''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> When I tabled the amendment I did not realise that it had tapped into a rich vein of uncertainty so far as the Paymaster General and her definition of independent taxation were concerned. We now have an opportunity to explore in more detail the thinking of Treasury Minister on that matter.
<P>
Paragraph 1(3) of the schedule states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``If the partners have the same total income for the year''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and goes on to deal with the election that they must conduct to decide who is the lower-earning partner. If they do not make the election,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``neither shall be entitled to a children's tax credit for the year in respect of a relevant child.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Only rarely will partners have exactly the same income. The enticing and intriguing question is how they will know. Two independently-minded taxpayers, each guarding carefully their income details the rounds of privacy and of the independence of taxation, may not disclose fully to one another precisely what their income is. It is unclear from our foregoing discussion how that problem is to be resolved.
<P>
The amendment would deal with the problem. The child affected by the stand-off between the partners--for whom the benefit is intended--should not be the loser. The credit should not
<P>
disappear by default but, when partners have the same income, it should be divided between the two parties in the absence of an election.
<P>
I can envisage some practical problems with this apparently tautological argument. If I go back to where I started, the real question is how the partners will determine who has what income. They might know intuitively that their earnings are similar, and not therefore make the election. Will the Paymaster General assist us by saying whether the Inland Revenue will have an interventionist role, or whether the burden of proof will lie entirely on the shoulders of the partners concerned? It is difficult to see how the problem will be resolved, particularly in the light of our earlier debates on independence. I look forward to the response of the Paymaster General to that conundrum.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> I want to ask the Paymaster General three brief questions.
<P>
First, why under paragraph 2 of the schedule is it clear that the top rate taxpayer in a couple will be the only recipient of the tax credit? Why is the lower earner not the recipient? Will the Paymaster General explain the logic of that?
<P>
My second question relates to the streamlining of the complex system by which individuals will have to make all sorts of complicated elections under paragraphs 2, 3, 4 and 5 of the schedule. The Chancellor has spoken of the streamlining of child benefit and working family tax credit payments, but when will that streamlining come into place? What is the time scale by which the Government will revamp the regime so that it becomes a seamless service?
<P>
My third question relates to the wording in paragraph 1(1), which refers to individuals
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``living together as husband and wife''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Will the Paymaster General explain what criteria the Revenue will use to determine whether individuals are living together as husband and wife? To help her, I remind her of the definition that Baroness Hollis gave in relation to social security benefits. In the House of Lords on 26 April this year at column 110 of Hansard, she said that a couple would be regarded as cohabiting if ``they share household finances''. Does a 50:50 sharing of household finances satisfy the schedule's definition of living together as husband and wife? Other organisations have asked how many nights a week would people have to share the same living accommodation to satisfy the definition.
<P>
I have asked three simple and brief questions. I trust that the Paymaster General will be able to shed light on them.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> The right hon. Member for Fylde made many of my points for me. However, I have some questions for the Paymaster General to check that I have understood how the system will work. That is why I tabled amendment No. 72.
<P>
I presume that taxpayers will receive the tax credit during the financial year. At the beginning of the financial year, the couple involved may not know what their incomes will be at the end of the year. Clearly, they will have to discuss with each other their expected incomes and share that knowledge. They may get the figures wrong and might have to reassess them at the end of the year. If they fall out during the year, do not want to discuss the matter and are not able to make the election required, the tax credits given during the year will have to be recovered.
<P>
Am I right in that assumption? I hope that the Paymaster General will explain if I am not. If it is the case, not only does the fill break the spirit of independent taxation but it also creates a complicated system; taxpayers will be extremely annoyed when they find that they have an extra, unexpected tax bill at the end of the year.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> The debate on the amendment tabled by my right hon. Friend the Member for Fylde. It is a perfect opportunity to test the proposition that the principles in the schedule are reconcilable with the principle of separate taxation. The Paymaster General made that claim in her reply to the previous debate about the consistency of the principles in the schedule, especially those relating to individuals whose partners have the same income, presumably down to the last penny.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Bury St. Edmunds asked why the Government concluded that the partner who has the lower income should not have the opportunity for a tax credit, which should be reserved for partner with the higher income. I shall listen with care to the Minister's reply to my hon. Friend's question; it will be interesting to know how she justifies the Government's policy, with which, broadly, I agree, and how she will defend it without violating the principle of separate taxation. Surely, the principle of separate taxation is that the tax bill paid by one taxpayer should be separately calculable by that taxpayer in the light of his or her individual circumstances and should not be influenced by another taxpayer's circumstances. That is how I understand the principle of separate taxation.
<P>
Let us suppose that within a marriage or partnership, the children's tax credit is available only to the higher earner of the couple provided, of course, that the higher earner is not a higher rate taxpayer--and the earnings of the person first thought to be the lower earner rise during the year. Surely in such cases the Paymaster General must accept--bearing in mind that everything is done through the PAYE system--that the tax bill paid by the person who started out thinking that he or she was the higher earner will be influenced by the fact that the partner's income has gone up. It is impossible for the hon. Lady to show the Committee that her proposals are consistent with the principle that the tax charge paid by one taxpayer is not influenced by the other partner's income or tax affairs. It is inherent in her policy that the tax charge paid by the person who starts the tax year expecting to be the higher earner will be influenced by the earnings capacity of his or her partner. How else can the policy be delivered?
<P>
I hope that the Minister will say how it is possible for a taxpayer to claim the allowance without making an assessment in conjunction with the other partner of their respective levels of income, because the taxpayer, in deciding whether to claim the allowance has to base the decision on whether he or she is the higher or lower earning partner. We live in a world in which the Inland Revenue--rightly, I think--is providing taxpayers with the opportunity and therefore, by implication, encouraging them to choose not simply separate taxation but separate assessment, individual assessment of tax liability.
<P>
If I am a taxpayer and I want to prepare my own tax return, I do not submit it before 1 October. I rely on the new law that allows me to wait until the end of January. I have not submitted it in time for the Revenue to conduct the assessment. How can I decide whether I am entitled to child tax allowance under the new law without assessing my partner's income?
<P>
<H5>9.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> The problem that my right hon. Friend outlines is compounded for the people we may be talking about in the amendment, because they may both be lower-rate taxpayers and therefore not obliged to compute their income position for tax purposes because they are not the subject of self-assessment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> Indeed. They are not the subject of self-assessment, but they are the subject of a requirement to claim the allowance if they want to benefit from it. In those circumstances how can they make that claim without discussing with their partner which of them is the higher earner? These phrases are defined in the schedule, which says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>```the higher-earning partner' means the partner who has the higher total income for the year of assessment''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Does the Paymaster General want us to supply in brackets the words ``but may not know it''? Is that the addition that she wants us to write into the Bill?
<P>
I have two simple questions for the Paymaster General. How can she claim that this is consistent with separate taxation when it is inherent in her policy that the tax charge paid by a taxpayer is affected by the partner's income, and how in the name of blazes can I decide that I am the higher-earning partner if I do not know what my partner's income is?
<P>
<B>Mr. Dawn Primarolo:</B> The two amendments refer to the tie-break where, in a tax year, two people earn exactly the same amount of money, to the pound. The Government have said that they must decide which of them is to receive the tax credit for which they are applying.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> Will the Paymaster General give way?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> Perhaps the hon. Gentlemen will allow me to say a few more sentences in response.
<P>
The Government's central point is that we do not consider it unreasonable to expect people to meet the qualifying conditions for the credit. There is no compulsory disclosure and no compulsion to claim. Couples must simply decide who is the main earner.
<P>
In the few cases where the couple refuse to decide, the tax credit is not apportioned, because it is a qualifying condition that they must decide which one of them it is paid to. It is an incredibly rare circumstance, but we must provide for it. Both amendments would apportion the tax credit when one of the couple was a higher-rate taxpayer, so the taper should apply.
<P>
The Committee has already discussed why the taper is applied to the higher rate taxpayer, and on that basis the credit cannot be divided. It is a qualifying condition of applying for the credit.
<P>
<B>Several hon. Members rose--</B><P>
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> Will hon. Members contain themselves a little longer?
<P>
The hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds asked how a decision would be reached on whether a couple were living together. We will use the same approach as was used for the additional personal allowance. That approach worked well in those circumstances--the previous Government introduced the regulations--and there is no reason why it should not continue to work and to address the questions raised by the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
On the question of whether the children's tax credit is too complicated, the new credit is a more and better targeted relief. It builds on existing rules and increases fairness. The rules must cope with the realities of modern day relationships, without being unfair to those involved. The right to claim is linked initially to the higher earner, but the credit can be transferred and shared if the higher earner is not a higher rate taxpayer. The attachment to the higher earner gives the right result for the application of the taper, which is a qualifying condition for the credit. If people want to apply for the credit, they must decide who is applying, whether it can be shared, and, if it is to be tapered, it can only be tapered against one member of the household's income. Each partner's liability is settled on the basis of his or her income. The allocation of the tax credit, during the year, is provisional, as with all pay-as-you-earn codes.
<P>
<B>Several hon. Members rose--</B><P>
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I would like to deal with this set of questions before hon. Members try to raise another one.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> It is the same question.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I am sure that hon. Members can put those questions if they catch your eye, Mr. Butterfill.

In most cases, partners can share the tax credit as they wish. Clearly, the partners are best placed to know what their incomes are likely to be. hon. Members are trying to make a mountain out of a tiny qualifying criterion, which relates to couples where both individuals earn exactly the same amount. Such couples must say to whom the credit should be paid.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> Will the Paymaster General give way?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The Paymaster General is not giving way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I simply want to give the Paymaster General the opportunity to express, in her own words, the reason why the Government have chosen to make the child tax credit available only to the higher earning partner. With great respect to her, she did not do so during her speech. My view is that the Government, in the context of their policy choices, are right. The Paymaster General's answer will reveal whether the proposal is consistent with separate taxation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I have three simple questions for the Paymaster General. First, how will the couple know that they have the same income? Secondly, when will the election have to be made about who gets the credit? Thirdly, do both individuals have to make that election?

<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> The credit goes to the higher rate taxpayer because of the taper--the allowance is tapered away from the higher rate taxpayer. Qualifying conditions have to be met before the tax credit can be claimed.
<P>
The hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon needs to keep a sense of proportion. The situation that we are discussing is incredibly rare, but when it does occur, those who apply for the credit have to disclose the information in order to qualify for the tax credit. I do not know why the hon. Gentleman finds that such a strange concept. The clause contains the relevant qualifying criteria.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> The Paymaster General is trying to disparage the Opposition's sensible line of questioning by arguing that the situation that the amendment would deal with is so rare that she cannot see what all the fuss is about. It just so happens that that rare event is, by her own admission, referred to in the schedule.
<P>
The Paymaster General will have received a helpful submission from the Inland Revenue that describes some of the rare cases of tax adjudication that lead to the need to legislate. In relation to some of the points of principle that we raised, to which we sought a response from the Paymaster General, her approach acts as a lightning conductor. She may be feeling a little jaded from last night's sitting of the House, and our approach may fray her temper and patience. However, we need to press her further on the practical issues that have been raised.
<P>
The hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon asked the most central question: how will the couple know? Some couples do not have the discussions that may be necessary to establish whether they are in that rare position. More generally, not everyone living with someone else as husband and wife has time to have an intimate financial exchange with their partner to establish whether within 30 days of the start of the start of the tax year--[Interruption.] I will gladly give way to any Labour Member who can tell me what his or her partner will earn this year. Clearly, no Labour Member who is living with a partner as man and wife has got a clue about how much their partner is earning. That demonstrates the disarray of the Government's response to our three questions.
<P>
We must not lose sight of the fact that the Paymaster General said that we should ensure that children benefit, but it is the amendment that would realise that goal. I agree with the Paymaster General that we may need to discuss the matter. If people are interested in their children, they may wish to approach the tax authorities, but I am surprised that the hon. Lady has given no indication of the help that the Inland Revenue could provide. The Revenue are the keepers of information about the income of both couples. If the couples wanted to maintain their privacy, surely it would be possible for them to approach the Revenue singly and ask them to adjudicate and award the tax credit, if applicable, on the basis of previous earnings information. However, the hon. Lady offers no practical way out.
<P>
I shall conclude with a request to the Paymaster General. She knows that the Revenue will have to produce one of their helpful information sheets to guide the poor, hapless taxpayer through the legal minefield that we are creating in the schedule. I have many more questions to ask, but to avoid wasting further time, I am prepared to delay asking them at this hour, if the Paymaster General will undertake to make available to us, before the conclusion of the Committee, a draft of the sort of instruction and guidance that the Revenue will provide to taxpayers. We could then see whether her advice will be easily understood by taxpayers, and we would be saved from having to return to the matter on Report and probe the definitions.
<P>
