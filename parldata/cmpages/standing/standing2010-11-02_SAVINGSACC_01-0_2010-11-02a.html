                           </strong> Welcome, colleagues, to the opening sitting of the
Committee stage of the Savings Accounts and Health in Pregnancy Grant
Bill. Before we begin, I have a few preliminary announcements to make.
First, the good news is that you may all take your jackets off during
Committee meetings. Will you please all ensure that mobile phones,
pagers and so on are turned off or switched to silent mode during
Committee meetings?<a class="bkMark" name="10110265000006">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
a general rule, my fellow Chair, George Howarth and I do not intend to
call starred amendments that have not been tabled with adequate notice.
The required notice period in Public Bill Committees is three working
days, therefore amendments should be tabled by the rise of the House on
Monday for consideration on Thursday, and by the rise of the House on
Thursday for consideration on
Tuesday.<a class="bkMark" name="10110265000007">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Not
everyone—including me—is familiar with the process of
taking oral evidence in Public Bill Committees, so it might help if I
briefly explain how we will proceed. The Committee will first be asked
to consider the programme motion on the amendment paper, on which
debate is limited to half an hour. We then proceed to a motion to
report written evidence and then a motion to permit the Committee to
deliberate in private before the oral evidence sessions. I hope that we
can take those two motions formally—we are not expecting much
difficulty with those issues. Assuming that the second of the two
motions is agreed, the Committee will move into a private sitting. Once
the Committee has deliberated, witnesses and members of the public will
be invited back into the room, and our oral evidence session will
begin.<a class="bkMark" name="10110265000008">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">If
the Committee agrees to the programme motion, we will hear oral
evidence this morning and this
afternoon.<a class="bkMark" name="10110265000009">&#160;</a>

David Hanson</strong> (Delyn) (Lab):<a class="bkMark" name="10110265000386">&#160;</a>
                           </span> I thank you and welcome you,
Mr Streeter and your co-Chair, Mr Howarth, to the Chair. I think that
we will get on fine in the next eight or nine sittings. You and I were
elected on the same day, Mr Streeter. Sir John Major was Prime
Minister, and in those days we sometimes did not know the outcome of
votes before the Tellers told us. They seem halcyon days in the current
climate, but not to worry.<a class="bkMark" name="10110265000013">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
Bill is important, and before we move on to the evidence sessions, I
want to consider the programme motion briefly. I am grateful to my hon.
Friend the Member for West Ham and to the hon. Member for Scarborough
and Whitby for agreeing it in the Programming Sub-Committee last
evening.<a class="bkMark" name="10110265000014">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
you said, Mr Streeter, the programme motion gives us an opportunity for
several evidence sessions today, Thursday morning and early Thursday
afternoon, ending with a discussion with the Minister about the
concerns that might have been raised in the evidence sessions. We will
commence discussing the amendments on Thursday afternoon, and have two
full sittings next Tuesday and two full sittings next
Thursday.<a class="bkMark" name="10110265000015">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Although
I expect that we will have sufficient time to discuss the amendments,
the Bill is controversial. My hon. Friends, including my hon. Friend
the Member for South Down, will take a strong view on its contents. For
those who are new to Committee Bill sittings—I include my hon.
Friends the Members for Stretford and Urmston, for Makerfield and for
Wirral South in that—it will be a new experience, but there will
be serious discussion of some of the amendments. It may help if the
Minister gave an indication of whether he was minded to accept any of
them. That would shorten the time needed for discussing them.
<em>[Interruption.] </em>I do not wish to discuss the amendments in
detail now, but such an indication from the Minister would shorten the
proceedings and

we will deal with amendment 21 about looked-after

                           </strong> I am grateful for that advice, Mr
Streeter. Perhaps I could frame my comments around the discussions
generally. We have tabled amendments—which might be selected by
you and Mr Howarth—about looked-after children, the
poorest third of children being exempted from the child  trust
fund and the disability living allowance. The preparation for the
Committee by my hon. Friends will be around discussions on those
particular points. We currently have one hour on Thursday and two full
sittings on Tuesday and on Thursday next week to discuss any amendments
that you, Mr Streeter, may choose to select.<a class="bkMark" name="10110265000018">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I would welcome it if the
Minister gave any views on those issues first. Let me give as an
example the issue of looked-after children. You will perhaps be aware,
Mr Streeter, that during Prime Minister’s questions
last Wednesday, my right hon. Friend the Member for Wythenshawe and
Sale East (Paul Goggins) asked the Prime Minister whether he would
consider looked-after children and child trust fund payments for
looked-after children. It would greatly help my hon. Friends and the
Committee if the Minister could give some indication as to what
progress is being made on discussions with my right hon. Friend for
Wythenshawe and Sale East on that particular matter.<a class="bkMark" name="10110265000019">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There are three main clauses in
the Bill: on child trust funds, the saving gateway and the pregnancy
and maternity grant. We have four sittings and an hour to deal with
them. In terms of our pacing any amendments that you, Mr Streeter, may
wish to select and our discussions of them, it might be helpful
if  the Minister could give an indication now, as part of the
programme motion debate, of any progress on discussions between the
Prime Minister and my right hon. Friend the Member for Wythenshawe and
Sale East, and of whether the Minister has made any approaches to my
right hon. Friend, or has plans to  do so, on the issue of
looked-after children. That is important, and we may then need to table
an amendment, or prepare discussions on an amendment.

interested, and this is still linked to the programme motion, Mr

                        </strong> It is a very important issue. We have an
opportunity for half-an-hour’s debate and I wish at least to
explore some of the issues. It will also affect  the type of
questions that we ask the witnesses and  the type of issues
that we discuss with them—for example,
looked-after children. If the Minister, following the Prime
Minister’s indication at Prime Minister’s questions, was
to have serious discussions about introducing amendments in Committee
or on Report about looked-after children, we need not detain members of
the Committee

                        </div>in questioning witnesses today about those issues, because they will
potentially be resolved before we get to them, should you select the
amendments, Mr
Streeter.<p class="tabbed">I took
the trouble of looking up the Conservative party manifesto on the child
trust funds, the health in pregnancy grant and the saving gateway.
There was no mention of abolishing the pregnancy grant or the saving
gateway. We shall discuss under the programme motion how much time we
can spend debating those issues, but in relation to clause 1, the
Conservative party manifesto said that it would
cut—<a class="bkMark" name="10110265000023">&#160;</a>

shall ask witnesses their views on a range of issues. I want the
Minister to respond because, first and foremost, I would not want to
ask questions about the poorest third of families or the potential for
disabled children to receive a child trust fund if the Conservative
Minister in Committee today was going to adhere to the Conservative
manifesto commitment. I would not want to waste the time of witnesses
or, indeed, the Committee by asking questions about whether the poorest
third of families should be exempt from the abolition of the child
trust funds, as per the Conservative manifesto, or whether disabled
children should be exempt, as per the Conservative manifesto, if the
Minister confirmed today that he and his hon. Friends are sticking to
the manifesto on which they stood for election in May. That is an
important issue in relation to the programme
motion.<a class="bkMark" name="10110265000025">&#160;</a>

the Minister make any movement on or have any discussions about
looked-after children? We need not question witnesses on the matter if
that is the case. Will he adhere to the commitments that he made in May
on the poorest third of children in relation to trust funds, and on
disability living allowance? If so, those issues need not be discussed
today by members of the Committee. Will the Minister uphold the
manifesto commitments not to abolish the health in pregnancy grant and
the saving gateway? He needs to give some indication of his approach to
those issues now, under the programme motion, so that we can at least
examine it, pending the amendments that you may or may not select in
due course, Mr Streeter. I fear that I have tested your patience
considerably, but I hope that for the sake of those elected on 9 April
1992, we can at least remain friends.<a class="bkMark" name="10110265000028">&#160;</a>

before the Committee. Will you give your initial assessment of whether
the child trust fund has made a difference to the potential recipients
who, in 18 years’ time, will ultimately receive the benefits?
What is your assessment of its success to
date?<a class="bkMark" name="10110265000046">&#160;</a>

Emmerson:</strong>
                           </em> Because of its nature, it is extremely
difficult to evaluate something like the child trust fund. You are
giving money to newborns, which they will have available to spend in 18
years’ time. It is not plausible that the Government could have
piloted it, as they would have had to wait at least 18 years to get any
results. We don’t yet know what benefits it will deliver. It is
not possible to know that about a policy that was introduced so
recently with such a long lag.<a class="bkMark" name="10110265000047">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">For me, it is the same for the
child trust fund. It is a lump-sum transfer from the Government to
newborns. In that sense, economists would say that it doesn’t do
any harm; it is not changing incentives in a way that is unhelpful.
Perhaps the bigger question is whether it does the most benefit for the
use of the money. Is it a good idea? You could just give families with
newborns a lump sum and say, “You can choose to spend it or save
it as you wish.” You could give a lump sum to 18-year-olds, if
you felt that it was an important time in their lives. It has never
been clear to me whether the child trust fund is the best way of
supporting those
families.<a class="bkMark" name="10110265000048">&#160;</a>

Emmerson:</strong>
                           </em> The child trust fund does little in terms
of the formal incentives that people face to save for their
children’s future. For instance, it is not giving them any extra
reward for every pound that they put in their child’s account.
It might help to facilitate more saving, because it provides a signal
to parents. The voucher clearly gives them a good reason to go out and
open an account. We have seen people making contributions into
accounts, but that it not a necessary condition to saying that it leads
to more being saved. It could be that those parents would have saved
money for their children in any case. That is a difficult question to
answer without some kind of pilot to show what people would have done
in the absence of the
account.<a class="bkMark" name="10110265000050">&#160;</a>

That average has now risen to 31%. Does that indicate that there might
be some benefit in helping to raise the level of saving on behalf of
children?<a class="bkMark" name="10110265000051">&#160;</a>

is on the number of other groups that  might benefit, or
potentially could benefit, downstream because of the introduction of
the child trust fund. One of the key groups that we are concerned
about —certainly on this side of the Committee—is
looked-after children. Do you have any view on the fact that certain
groups, such as looked-after children, do not necessarily have anybody,
either the state or their parents, saving on their behalf before the
age of 18? Could the trust fund provide a nest egg at that
age?<a class="bkMark" name="10110265000055">&#160;</a>

                           </em> Children from very unfortunate backgrounds
are likely to reach the age of 18 without any assets. That points to
several policy choices: you could give them a child trust fund at
birth; you could give them a lump-sum payment at 18 years of age, which
would have the benefit of their not having to wait 18 years before the
policy has benefits; or, alternatively, you could say that those
children would benefit from extra spending on them in some other
way—for example, through schools—in order to help their
life chances. It is not obvious to me that a £250 cheque at 18
years of age is the best way to support them, but clearly it would help
them.<a class="bkMark" name="10110265000056">&#160;</a>

                           </em> The key piece of evidence that the
Government used back in 2001 to justify the child trust fund was the
observation that individuals who have assets at aged 18 tend to have
better outcomes in life  10 years later, once you take into
account other background characteristics. I see that and think it is
probably a correlation rather than a causation. Individuals who are
better able to plan ahead are going to be more likely both to hold some
assets at age 18 and to have better outcomes later in life. It is not
obvious to me that the child trust fund is necessarily the best way to
help individuals to be better planners. I don’t think we know
that for sure. The evidence on the child trust fund is very
shaky.<a class="bkMark" name="10110265000076">&#160;</a>

need to be met at around that age, because while I can see your
argument about the lack of evidence in terms of the ability to plan,
none the less, an asset at the age of 18 has the potential to enhance
social mobility by enabling people at a certain point in their life
cycle to make certain
choices.<a class="bkMark" name="10110265000077">&#160;</a>

argument for a payment at age 18, rather than a payment at age zero,
which excludes everybody who has already been born. On that, what
activities do you want to encourage people to do at age 18? For
example, if it is higher education, maintenance grants might be a more
obvious vehicle than the child trust fund and if it is starting a
business, you might want to look at the operation of credit markets,
rather than the child trust
fund.<a class="bkMark" name="10110265000078">&#160;</a>

are saying is that there are range of instruments both to boost income,
and to give a lump sum at age 18 and support young people as they start
in higher education. We cannot say that one precludes the

18-year-olds typically have nothing and therefore it is increasing the
wealth of those with very little. I am not sure how meaningful that
statement is in the sense that you would expect individuals to have
relatively little wealth around age 18—you might expect them to
have debts when they get to 21 or 22, if they have gone to university.
One would expect individuals to have the most wealth in their lives
just as they approach retirement, as they have built up a pension. A
sum of £250 is a lot relative to the wealth of most
18-year-olds.<a class="bkMark" name="10110265000082">&#160;</a>

children in low-income families, the most obvious lever is to think of
policies that will boost those incomes, either directly through state
payments such as child tax credit, or thinking about measures that
might change incentives and encourage parents of low-income families to
increase their private incomes. If you are thinking about a broader set
of issues relating to child poverty and the life chances of children, I
would say things  such as education policy are likely to be
very important as
well.<a class="bkMark" name="10110265000084">&#160;</a>

likewise it is a pleasure to serve with you as Chair. Mr Emmerson, I
have two questions that both relate to the substance of your research.
First, you said that economists would say that there were no formal
incentives to save involved in the child trust fund. I think some
economists would certainly say that. What work has your organisation
done to understand the informal incentives to save? We know that people
do not necessarily respond to formal incentives to save involved in
financial products, but sometimes they respond to other factors in the
construction of schemes. I wondered what further insight you might be
able to offer about what kind of incentives the child trust fund
created.<a class="bkMark" name="10110265000087">&#160;</a>

Emmerson:</strong>
                           </em> There is a lot of evidence that people do
respond to formal incentives. Most assets in the UK are held in housing
and private pensions, and they are the most tax-relieved forms of
saving. If we ended tax relief on pensions, I suspect people would save
for retirement in very different ways. There is a lot of evidence that
people respond to those incentives.<a class="bkMark" name="10110265000088">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The child
trust fund may help encourage those people to save who would not have
placed money in an account for their children, because it gets over the
inertia of opening an account. If you get a voucher for £250 or
£500, you are probably going to open an account. You might then
say it is worth your while paying a bit in. Of course, low-income
families might also say they are least able to lock the money away
until the child is 18. What happens if the child really needs some
money spent on them when they are 14 or 16? It may not be a wise
decision to lock the money away. They may be better off
putting—<a class="bkMark" name="10110265000089">&#160;</a>

example, that while take-up of the accounts was higher when the
financial incentive was stronger, it was also the case that how far you
lived from the branch providing the account mattered, in terms of your
likelihood of opening an account. It was not just how much the
Government were incentivising you; it was how convenient it was,
perhaps, to go and open an account. Clearly, I do buy the argument that
the costs of opening an account do

at age 18 and we could identify which 18-year-olds had money in a
savings account, had investments or had received an inheritance. Then,
later in life, they were re-interviewed, and the evidence looked at
whether they were unemployed, whether they were divorced, whether they
smoked—all different outcomes that you might want to improve. It
was the case that individuals who happened to hold savings or
investments at age 18 were less likely to have these less good outcomes
happen to them later in life. That is probably saying that individuals
who were better able to plan ahead were those who were more able to
have an asset at age 18, and those who were more likely to have these
other, better outcomes. I do not think that having the savings or
investments was actually the cause. One thing that supports me in this
is that when you looked at the receipt of inheritance, which is perhaps
a little more random than whether the individual chose to have some
money in a savings account, there is absolutely no effect, but that was
buried in a footnote to the research that the Government
cited.<a class="bkMark" name="10110265000093">&#160;</a>

to think that it opened up opportunities that people were otherwise

opportunity to invest in higher education, which does deliver, on
average, very big returns for those people who undertake it. Therefore,
the £1,000 might be best focused on grants or subsidies to allow
individuals to participate in higher education. Alternatively, you
could do it at age 16 or 17, when individuals are making earlier

reduced the amount they were saving in another account in order to

saving behaviour. We also found evidence that the lower-income
households were placing money in the accounts, which was increasing
their saving in savings accounts, but there was pretty mixed evidence
on whether they were saving more overall. There was some evidence that
they were spending less on food consumed outside the home, so perhaps
it was leading to an increase in saving among lower-income

will continue to encourage tax-free savings for those who are able to
do so. Do you have any views on how that should operate, and, in
particular, how it should operate in a way that encourages the people
who I am concerned about—those who are not currently saving for
their children’s
future?<a class="bkMark" name="10110265000122">&#160;</a>

                           </em> The first issue is whether there is any
restriction placed on what the funds can be spent on once they are
available to be accessed. I do not think that there should be any
restriction there. It is an admission of failure in the policy if you
say that we are going to teach people about saving, and we are going to
let them build up an account, and then you start to say, “We
don’t trust you to spend the money wisely once we give you
access.”<a class="bkMark" name="10110265000123">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
second issue is how much you allow people to save tax-free. You might
not want to fix it at too high an amount, because low-income households
are not going to be able to save vast amounts for their children
anyway.<a class="bkMark" name="10110265000124">&#160;</a>

third issue is at what age do you give people access and under what
circumstances. Is it age 18, as with the child trust fund? Perhaps age
16 is more appropriate if you are worried about children who may be
leaving school at 16 anyway. What about children who perhaps need the
money sooner than that? Are there any circumstances under which the
money should be accessed before age
16?<a class="bkMark" name="10110265000125">&#160;</a>

response to that would be that, once we get to the stage of introducing
these junior ISAs, we would want to backdate them and ensure that
everybody who was not able to have a child trust fund was able to have
one of the new accounts. Of course, if it took, for example, a year to
get these things operational, there would be a period in their life,
perhaps, where they would not be able to save in those

between the child trust fund and a junior ISA would be that there is no

thinking, “Exactly what is the best thing to do for my child,
here?” there would be a strong case for them to save in their
own ISA, rather than placing it in a junior ISA. The advantages of that
for a parent would be that they could get access to the fund sooner if
they wanted to. Of course you can put £10,600 a year in an ISA.
That is a phenomenally large amount of saving for the majority of
households in this country. I would struggle to advise any family who
are not already using up all their ISA allowance that the best thing
for them to do is put money in their child’s ISA, where they

you have talked about the fact that the money is locked away in a child

that account available—where individuals can lock the money
away. I am not opposed to the idea of a junior ISA, where you can save
a certain amount a year, and it cannot be spent until the child is 16
or 18. I just think that parents are probably best advised to save in
their own ISA and try to show restraint. Imagine if the child was born
and then because of some horrible circumstances got extremely ill at
the age of 13 or 14. Would you really want the money locked away till
they were 16? I realise adults often do things that constrain their
behaviour, such as subscribing to the gym for the whole year rather
than paying in cash each month, but for low-income families in
particular it would be unfortunate for them to experience hardship if
they perhaps lost their jobs and had a period of unemployment, on very
low income, when they had some money sitting in a junior ISA that they
could not

further on what you were saying—that it might even be better for
some low-income families to have a bit of money and not save during
that time—is there not substantial evidence that one of the
things that deepens people’s poverty is the lack of access to
affordable borrowing; and that for many low-income families,
particularly in certain areas, the only ability to borrow, perhaps to
tide them over for a short period, not necessarily a long one, is by
going for some very expensive forms of borrowing, which other people do
not have to do? To some extent everyone borrows to overcome short-term
difficulties. In that sense is there not a value in enabling people to
build up savings, for example through something like a credit union,
which will give them access in due course to much cheaper
borrowing?<a class="bkMark" name="10110265000139">&#160;</a>

reasons for you not to be saving at the moment, because you want to
spend all your income; but of course it is still true that while your

saving gateway that it led to more overall saving from lower-income
households. They saved more in savings accounts, but when you looked at
the total amount of saving they were doing there was not much evidence
at all that there was an increase in saving. As I said before, the only
thing we found that was consistent with more saving from lower-income
households was some evidence of a reduction in spending on food
consumed outside the home; but that evidence is quite

people who have moved from unemployment into employment. That might be
a good moment in their lives to catch them, when they should perhaps be
thinking about saving more than they have been. As with the child trust
fund, I question whether spending £115 million on the spending
gateway is the best way to help individuals on very low incomes. Would

operated by Halifax. Clearly, in a pilot scheme there are reasons why
you can have only one provider. In that evaluation, we looked at what
factors made people likely to open an account. We essentially offered
the

                           </div>opportunity to open an account to a lot of people and not all of them
took it up. People with higher education, higher levels of numeracy or
existing assets were much more likely to open a saving gateway account
than people with lower education, lower numeracy levels or no assets.
The other key factor was how close people lived to a Halifax branch.
Clearly there is a problem in that although the saving gateway targeted
a lower-income group, it was those in that group who were relatively
better off and who had assets or numeracy who chose to engage with the
accounts. Among the lower-income group, those without numeracy or
financial assets were less likely to open an account and benefit from
it.<a class="bkMark" name="10110265000147">&#160;</a>

into an account and you have one month to go on that account, it is
worth your while to go and get £25 on a credit card and put it
into the account. There is also a problem with targeting. If you pick
any lower-income group, the saving gateway will benefit those on higher
incomes and who are more financially numerate within that group. It
will never manage to work for the rest of the

although unlike the child trust fund, it is a harder mechanism for the

an environment in which to provide the education. The obvious question
is whether you can deliver good value for money financial education to
these individuals. I do not think it is clear that you can. I would say
that perhaps the £115 million should just be spent on boosting

going into the Halifax. Do you agree that the saving gateway would

gateway that people opened an account at the Halifax branch and paid in
cash or cheque with their first contribution, and a lot of people set
up direct debits for the remaining 16 months in order to get the full
amount of the match without having to go back again. It is unfortunate
that when the account period finished, the money was moved over to a
different account and all the direct debits were cancelled. I think
that that makes it harder to get a permanent, enduring saving effect.

education, advice and information are increasingly important, where
individuals have to make their own decisions on saving and spending,
with the state doing less saving on their behalf. It strikes me that
from ages five to 16 there is a relatively easy way to engage with
people—through school. Beyond that, it is harder to do, and I do
not have any empirical evidence saying it is
cost-effective.<a class="bkMark" name="10110265000169">&#160;</a>

Emmerson:</strong>
                           </em> Clearly, when a baby is born, it is a point
in life where there are high costs. Therefore, it seems logical that
Government should provide not just an ongoing payment through child
benefit, but should focus a payment on a time when costs are
particularly high. In that sense, a policy aimed at the time around
birth is a good idea. There is a decision about whether to make that
universal, which the health in maternity grant is, or to target it more
precisely at households with high and increasing costs, and which might
be unable to meet those costs. The Sure Start policy makes a payment to
mothers giving birth for the first time, which is a way of targeting
mothers who are in low-income houses and who experience the biggest
increase in costs, because it is their first
birth.<a class="bkMark" name="10110265000177">&#160;</a>

take-up, and you reduce the possibility of stigma and the amount of
administrative burden on individuals in claiming the payment. If you
are just trying to give money to households when their needs are high,
regardless of whether the people in them are rich or poor over their
lifetimes, clearly their needs will be higher when they have children
and such needs will be particularly high when they have a newborn
arriving. There is a case for a universal payment, but equally you
might want to target the resources more precisely at those who need
them.<a class="bkMark" name="10110265000179">&#160;</a>

regular weekly payment in order to encourage spending that might be

diet, which is a lot of the advice that the mother receives when she
qualifies for the grant—versus the idea that the one-off
expenditures are all around birth and that you want to be buying
clothes, somewhere for the baby to sleep and so on, so maybe a one-off
payment there is better. I am not quite sure how you would balance
those two, but it seems to me that there is a case for either

                           </em> I am happy to answer that. I would say
that the child trust funds have been extremely successful, with 72%
take-up of the scheme by parents, which is far higher than the take-up
of most other schemes, pension credit being a case in point. Obviously,
the other major benefit of the scheme is its universal nature, which
means that all children are automatically enrolled into the scheme, one
way or another, after 12 months. The majority of people in the scheme
have invested in equities, with a ratio of about 75:25, the other 25%
being in cash. This should provide an excellent basis for social
change, a move, or a transition from a debt-based society to an
asset-based society. It will give those individuals a strong start in
life from the age of 18, when they have access to the money to pay for
investment in a first property or  to assist them in buying a
car or a bike to get to work, or even with clothing for work. Then,
there are all the educational benefits that can be leveraged through
schools.<a class="bkMark" name="10110265000197">&#160;</a>

                           </em> The majority of the stakeholder or equity-based
child trust funds were provided by friendly societies and members of
the Association of Financial Mutuals, so we have a particular interest
in the success of the programme. Everything that we have seen through
our work with the CTF demonstrated that it was really helping to
achieve something quite significant, both in terms of the number of
people who had a newfound interest in saving for their children and in
the amount that they were saving. Typically, parents were saving at
something like twice the rate that they were before the child trust
fund and indeed, saving twice the amount that they were saving
previously. To all intents and purposes, it has been a very successful
product.<a class="bkMark" name="10110265000199">&#160;</a>

societies and other mutual deposit takers were, in recent months, the
only providers of the cash child trust fund. Nevertheless, the balances
in the cash child trust fund, which account for about a quarter of the
market as we have heard, accounted for about 0.2% of total building
society and other mutual savings balances. So it was a successful
product, but it was not in any sense central to building
societies’ business. It was something that a number of building
societies were keen to add to their range of products, but it was never
a dominant product for us.<a class="bkMark" name="10110265000200">&#160;</a>

to be a useful savings mechanism. I am not quite sure that we
understand fully the extent to which parents—apart from those,
obviously, who have chosen the default option—who have actively
engaged in a child trust fund would not necessarily have actively
engaged in some other savings fund. Equally, I think we need to be a
little careful in so far as we do not really understand yet the
full-term benefits of the whole child trust fund proposition, which was
to include an element of education. No doubt, we will come on to

than we do as trade bodies, but all the evidence that we have—as
Martin has mentioned—is that twice as many parents were saving
substantially more money. So, the overall amount of money going into
children’s savings was far greater than previously. From that
perspective, we consider it to be extremely beneficial. If you look at
the analysis done by the Treasury and the HMRC, it indicates that the
increase in take-up was across the board.<a class="bkMark" name="10110265000204">&#160;</a>

child trust fund was doing, in terms of creating a savings culture, was
that even during 2007 and 2008 when people were starting to feel the
pinch through the recession, there was an ongoing commitment from
parents to continue putting money into the child trust fund. That was
the last thing that they wanted to give up. In terms of the amount that
they were saving, and also the culture, that was very strongly
enforced.<a class="bkMark" name="10110265000205">&#160;</a>

of accounts were being topped up, and that was across the board. There
were significant differences among certain providers; those that were
heavily marketing the product were achieving top-up rates of 40% to
50%. What was encouraging from that work was that they saw top-ups from

we encourage savings for those such as looked-after children, who do
not have a parent or a local authority to contribute to their savings
post-18, or children with a disability, for whom the Government
previously gave an additional premium to support the extra needs they
may have post-18. Do you have any assessment of how the loss of either
or both of those will impact on the future ability of individuals to
meet those needs post-18?<a class="bkMark" name="10110265000209">&#160;</a>

or voucher than other children. The principle of the child trust fund
was that simply relying on the voucher alone would never create a
fortune. Something like £500 at birth and £500 at year 7
would create a total value of just over £2,200 at 18. The most
important concept around the child trust fund was that regular

that many children are in the difficult position of not having a
parent, guardian or grandparent able to make those contributions. The
AFM is part of the Save Child Savings Alliance, which has produced a
piece of work through ResPublica on the ABC account—asset-based
savings for children. It suggests that a new form of product could
emerge that facilitates the creation of a fund, which could be used for
targeted audiences, so if there was no parent or guardian, companies or
other organisations would be encouraged to create and invest in the
fund for the public good.<a class="bkMark" name="10110265000210">&#160;</a>

not pretend that we need to rely on the Government or the public sector
to do all of this. The 49 building societies and other mutuals offer
about 100 children’s savings accounts in the free market, which
have been pretty successful over the years, although less so in the

the next week or so. The Government are obviously moving quite quickly
to try to address your point, which is how quickly it can be brought
in. There are a number of options as to how that scheme can be
designed, and whether it is referred to as a junior ISA. It could be
virtually the same as today’s CTF, but without the Government
contribution. If that was the case, it could be run on very easily from
4 January. If changes to the design of the product require changes in
terms and conditions, publication, training, IT systems and so on, it
will take much longer, possibly until the
summer.<a class="bkMark" name="10110265000218">&#160;</a>

                           </em> I suspect most of my members would not be ready
to provide a junior ISA by early January. The child trust fund itself
is a completely different animal to an ISA. An ISA is run on an annual
renewal basis, whereas a child trust fund is run as a trust for the
child over a much longer period. Therefore the investment in setting up
a new product would in effect be like starting from scratch. There is
no legacy that you can continue.<a class="bkMark" name="10110265000219">&#160;</a>

                           </em> There is a difference between the friendly
society and mutual insurers’ approach and that of the
deposit-based institutions that I represent. There is a choice. Do you
continue with the CTF framework or do you move it across to the ISA
framework? For my members, the ISA framework is much more important and
represents a much greater proportion of their business. For
administrative reasons if nothing else—there are policy issues
as well—they would prefer the ISA framework to be dominant in
future rather than the CTF framework, but I acknowledge that that is
not in the business interests of the friendly societies and mutual
insurers.<a class="bkMark" name="10110265000220">&#160;</a>

you seemed to be giving about the impact on the industry, the financial

describe what the impact would be on the industry. There seemed

                           </div>to be a suggestion from the deposit-based institutions that, really, the
child trust fund was not central, so in terms of increasing deposits,
it is not seen as having a large impact. My understanding is that the
sector at the moment is looking to increase deposits, so I would
suppose that removing the child trust fund would be seen as a
disbenefit. There seemed to be some conflicting evidence, so I am
looking for a bit more

trust fund came in, friendly societies have opened nearly 3 million
CTFs. That is against a total membership now standing at just more than
6 million. In other words, half our members are under the age of eight.
That is a seismic change in a sector that, historically, was regarded
as largely for older people. Therefore, our focus has very much changed

building societies and other mutual deposit-takers: just 12 building
societies, plus the Co-operative bank, also a member of the BSA,
offered cash child trust funds. The administration was seen as complex.
For example, you have to send a statement to the child on its birthday.
Many institutions are set up to send out statements on a specific day
in the year say, 31 December or 31 March, and they did not make that
investment. It is fortnightly reporting to the Inland Revenue, for
example. Those sorts of requirement put off many building societies
and, I suspect, some banks from offering the accounts. If you offered a
cash child trust fund, you also had to offer a stakeholder product
involving equities, and that typically has not been the market that
building societies have been in. As a result, a number of
building  societies decided not to offer the product. As I
said, it accounts for 0.2% of the whole cash balances invested in
building societies so it is a small proportion of building
society business. It is a large proportion of friendly society
business, hence the differing answers that we have offered
you.<a class="bkMark" name="10110265000250">&#160;</a>

involved in the design of the child trust fund from its initial
inception. I did actually go round to see the executive committees of
many of the providers to explain to them the financial dynamic of the
product. As Martin has just said, much of it is based on the
£250. You are basically talking about
£3—£3.50—a year as an income. When you
consider you have to provide all administration, all the investment
management and also the sending out of statements etc., it is very hard
to do for that kind of money. It probably costs about £6 a year
minimum to administer the account.<a class="bkMark" name="10110265000266">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Therefore, the
£250 or the £500 for the third of the population of
children through child benefit would make an average of, say,
£375, therefore an average income of £450 without any
top-ups. It was only for the first few years that it would be a
loss-making product, and most of the providers are working on the
assumption that it will be a loss-making product for five to 10 years.
If you then take away that Government contribution, you can see that it
starts to make the whole thing very difficult. Whether that will result
in a number of organisations withdrawing from that market will very
much depend on what this junior ISA looks like going forward and what
it is based

outstrip the charges that have been received so far. Had it run on for
another three or four years I am sure that firms would have been
happily saying, “We have started now to see a small return on
our investment.” At this stage, if it is £700
million, I suspect that the set-up and administration costs so far
would have been a lot more than

they adopted. Of the friendly societies, for instance, a number
actively marketed and developed the product. That has meant a
significant capital investment on their behalf. Others took the route
of saying, “We’ll just take the revenue-allocated
accounts”, which are products that the parent did not themselves
invest in. That meant that they could run the product on the back of a
spreadsheet and for some of those smallish providers, their largest
single cost was buying a new envelope stuffer. After years five or six
they started seeing a very small return on their investment. The larger
firms, because of the marketing and investment costs, will not have
seen a positive return.<a class="bkMark" name="10110265000275">&#160;</a>

it is feasible to have a junior ISA on the ISA model and the CTF model
in place, but there is one question that should be asked of those who
have CTF-model products. If no Government funds are going into them to
start out, would they still open new accounts? You may not have full

fortnightly reporting that Adrian mentioned earlier. The Government
scheme with the second lowest abuse is the ISA, so we must assume that
a junior ISA would also have a low level of abuse. There are three
possible products that we could make. One is to take the existing adult
ISA and make it available from birth but still have it locked in. That
would be cheap and quick for the industry and people who are currently
ISA providers to implement. The second option would be to design a
completely new product that is a mixture of the existing CTF and adult
ISA, perhaps as a junior ISA. That would take the longest to produce
and probably be the most expensive. The third option is to continue
with the existing CTF but to chop away the Government subsidies or
contributions. Those are three models, all of which have different
implications for different parts of the industry and for parents and
children.<a class="bkMark" name="10110265000285">&#160;</a>

them. The 28% who have not had a parent or guardian consciously invest
the money for them have still had the money invested. Certainly, from
our perspective, our members have done a lot of educational work. In
fact, only yesterday, the Association of Financial Mutuals launched a
new online website for children who are now at key stage 2, called
Saving Squad, that aims to encourage young people to take a more active
interest in money and to understand better the concept of
saving—not just of saving money, but of making savings around
the house and saving the planet. We see the whole concept of saving as
being very much ingrained alongside the child trust fund. That provides

was Halifax who piloted the scheme. When my colleague gave evidence
regarding the saving gateway last January, we felt that a broader pilot
might have been more beneficial. We were predominantly concerned in our
evidence about the construction and the administration of a saving
gateway, because of the low economic return that that type of product
was designed for. It transpired that there were only a couple of
providers who felt that it was suitably beneficial for them to provide
the account in itself.<a class="bkMark" name="10110265000297">&#160;</a>

a saving gateway account and there were four reasons for that. There
was the small market size, which was estimated, according to my notes,
as being—if it went really well—0.02% of the deposit
market of the UK: that is one fifth of one tenth of 1%. That would have
meant having a lot of systems development and staff training for a tiny
market.<a class="bkMark" name="10110265000298">&#160;</a>

banking account? Several years ago, when the Treasury Committee took
evidence from high-street banking institutions, there was clearly a
reluctance by some to enter the market—Nationwide was an
honourable exception—because it was not seen as profitable. It
was thought to be a lot of hassle to deal with people who would never
bring great returns for the institutions. Is it a similar scenario now?

the credit unions. It is probably best to ask representatives of the
credits union how they feel it might impact on their business or to
what level they would be happy to support it. You are quite right that
there is a reluctance from the primary providers in the industry to
support the scheme, because it would have been a crazy proliferation of

giving evidence to the Public Bill Committee that set up the Bill to
establish the saving gateway, the Post Office clearly stated that it
was targeting at least half that market. If you have the Post Office
taking half the market, that makes the proportion of the market
available to the building societies even tinier than I just suggested.
It was quite clear that some institutions felt that they were suitable
for that market, which made it more difficult for other institutions to

Certainly, something like the saving gateway was obviously highly
targeted at the lower end of earnings. It would hopefully have created
two things: first, an attitudinal shift, moving towards having savings
and assets; secondly, an active engagement, rather like the basic bank
account but for savings rather than the current account for the same
group.<a class="bkMark" name="10110265000309">&#160;</a>

actually correct. As it happens, I do not actually feel that the
administration of the account was that great; it really was great
compared to the amount of money that was likely to go in, so it is a
ratio rather than an absolute. So, yes, I think that the initiative was
right. I suspect that the target market, which was some 6 million
people, was too broad and it should perhaps have been more limited. I
must admit that we were surprised at the level of
generosity—providing a 50% matching. I say that because there
were actually two pilots, not one, and the response from those pilots
indicated that there was not a lot of difference between 20%, which was
the equivalent of standard rate tax, and 50%, which was actually what
was on offer from the saving gateway. So we had hoped that the scheme
would actually continue, but that we would cut back to the 20% standard
rate tax matching rather than continue at
50%.<a class="bkMark" name="10110265000313">&#160;</a>

                           </em> I do not think that there have been
significant costs for deposit takers in developing schemes. However,

political atmospheres change.<a class="bkMark" name="10110265000321">&#160;</a>

this area while working for the then shadow Chancellor that the fees
charged on some of these investment vehicles were relatively high
compared to other products, particularly index-linked products. So that

basis and therefore would not seek compensation for the cessation of
these schemes. Would you agree with that, or is that just my
