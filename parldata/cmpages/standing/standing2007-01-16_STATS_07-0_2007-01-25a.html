						<b class="B">
							<a name="07012583000206"></a>The
Financial Secretary to the Treasury (John Healey):
						</b> We now
come to the second, complementary side of arrangements for greater data
sharing of administrative information and the confidentiality rather
than the disclosure side of the equation. The clause is important
because it sets out some of the safeguards for privacy rights that are
fundamental to ensuring that people who provide their information can
have confidence that the data will be held
securely.</div>
					<a name="07012583000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
specifies that personal information&#151;information identifying
individuals or businesses, whether held by the board or passed by the
board to others, directly or indirectly&#151;is confidential, with
criminal sanctions for anyone found to have unlawfully passed personal
information to others or to have revealed personal
information.</div>
					<a name="07012583000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
discussed in earlier sittings the benefits to be gained from data
sharing, and we will return to it in more detail from clause 44
onwards. I shall concentrate on the protections that we need to put in
place. Although there is strong public interest in the greater sharing
of administrative data, there is an equally important public interest
in ensuring that the confidentiality of such data is properly
protected. We have attempted to ensure that the Bill strikes an
appropriate balance between those two
objectives.</div>
					<a name="07012583000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the
Government move to a greater era of data sharing&#151;an era, rather,
of greater data sharing&#151;to deliver better, more
responsive&#151;<i class="I">[Interruption.]</i> There is a little scoff from
the hon. Member for Sevenoaks. If one wants better, more responsive and
more personalised public services, an element of greater personal data
sharing is required and inevitable. What is important in the matter of
statistics is the safeguarding and disclosure of those
data.</div>
					
					<a name="07012583000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07012583000207"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Michael Fallon</b> (Sevenoaks) (Con): I hope that the Minister
did not misinterpret my scoff. It was not at the principle of data
sharing but at his reference to entry into a greater era. I think those
things are probably best left to
historians.</div>
					
					<a name="07012583000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07012583000208"></a>John
Healey:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman makes a fair point. He picked
me up on a slip of the tongue; rather than a greater era, I meant to
say&#151;I think I did correct 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column243" />Column number: 244</div>myself&#151;an era of greater information sharing. I am grateful to
the hon. Gentleman for giving me the opportunity to make that crystal
clear to the
Committee.</div>
					<a name="07012583000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the
future, in such an era&#151;greater or otherwise&#151;it will be
essential that people are confident that their personal data will be
handled appropriately. Statistical surveys often rely on people giving
their information voluntarily and even when that is not the case,
statisticians need complete and truthful responses on which they can
rely and, indeed, on which we can all rely for further
analysis.</div>
					<a name="07012583000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
statistical system, therefore, needs strong confidentiality safeguards
to give individuals and businesses confidence that their personal
information will not be disclosed improperly to other
partiesfor other purposes. A crucial part of the
board&#146;s maintaining its credibility in collecting, analysing and
publishing data is that there is the highest protection of such
personal
information.</div>
					<a name="07012583000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Office for National Statistics&#151;indeed, the Government&#146;s
statistical service generally&#151;has a long history of maintaining
data confidentiality and already securely holds information including
that from census returns, information on employees&#146; earnings and
data on businesses&#146; profits. However, we are taking the
opportunity in the Bill to increase the confidentiality safeguards and
sanctions on personal data. On safeguards, the data-sharing
arrangements that we propose will be permitted only for statistical
purposes, only where they are judged in the public interest and only
where permitted by the Bill, including the specific exemptions in
clause 36, or by orders under theBill. Any proposed extensions
by order must havethe agreement of Ministers and, most
importantly,the further scrutiny and agreement of Parliament
or the devolved
Administrations.</div>
					<a name="07012583000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Bill introduces a criminal sanction for the unlawful disclosure of
information concerning both individuals and businesses&#151;whether
held by the board, on members and employees, or by anyone to whom the
board has passed the data on&#151;where that information identifies
an individual or business or where it might allow someone to deduce
their identity. The criminal sanction, which could be up to
twoyears&#146; imprisonment, is an important addition to the
confidentiality regime for personal information collected by the board.
The confidentiality provisions are structured to allow both the sharing
provided for within the clause&#151;whether current or new
flows&#151;and the necessary exceptions in subsection
(4).</div>
					
					<a name="07012583000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07012583000209"></a>
							<b class="B">Alun
Michael</b> (Cardiff, South and Penarth) (Lab/Co-op): I
strongly support my hon. Friend&#146;s argument and the provisions in
the Bill for the protection of individual data. They are absolutely
right, as is the strengthening of the sanctions, but will the Minister
confirm that it would not be right for people looking at the sharing of
data in the public interest or for statistical purposes to say,
&#147;Oh, I was scared by the sanctions, so I thought it was safest
not to bother considering how to share that information. It was safer
to say no.&#148;? Their obligation will be to balance the pros and
cons and to consider the public interest adequately. The balance needs
to be there, and should be tough on both sides of the
equation.</div>
					
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column244" />Column number: 245</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07012583000210"></a>John
Healey:
						</b> My right hon. Friend is right. A balanced judgment
and a tough examination of both sides of the equation, as he put it, is
required from the board, from Departments with which the board is
discussing potential future administrative data-sharing arrangements
and, ultimately, from Ministers. Parliament will have to scrutinise and
agree any proposed extension of data-sharing arrangements, as well as
make judgments on such arrangements and hold to account the cumulative
decisions of Ministers and the proposals and operation of the
board.</div>
					<a name="07012583000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">My right hon.
Friend the Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth has brought me neatly
on to consideration of the exceptions in subsection (4). We have heard
in Committee and beyond the House arguments for restricting the
exceptions, such as removing exceptions for court orders or in criminal
investigations, as was proposed in some earlier amendments. I hope that
hon. Members will see such proposals as unrealistic and wrong, but I
appreciate that they may have been confused and misled by some of the
briefings that they have received.</div>
					<a name="07012583000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">For instance, the Royal
Statistical Society seems to have altered its position at different
stages. When we first published the Bill, the society suggested that
the confidentiality clause should be substantially reduced and
simplified:</div>
					<a name="07012583000164"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;so that all
personal information collected under the authority of the
Board...or transferred to the Board...must not be disclosed
nor used for other
purposes.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07012583000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">That clearly
does not strike the right balance. It probably then reviewed and
refined its position when it commented on the Opposition amendments.
The Society&#146;s view was that data transfers were essential to
support an efficient and effective statistical system. The key is to
allow such transfers while ensuring that no breach of confidentiality
will occur and that the data will be used only for statistical
purposes. However, it
said:</div>
					<a name="07012583000165"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;amendments 155-174
will have some undesirable
consequences.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07012583000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think
that the society has come now to a better, balanced judgment that I
hope the Committee will want to take into
account.</div>
					<a name="07012583000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 36(4)
contains a list of exceptions, which draws on experience of existing
practice, in the case of the Office for National Statistics, and on
experience with confidentiality clauses in other legislation&#151;for
instance, the Commissioners for Revenue and Customs Act
2005.</div>
					
					<a name="07012583000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07012583000211"></a>
							<b class="B">Julia
Goldsworthy</b> (Falmouth and Camborne) (LD): Will the
Financial Secretary confirm that there are extensions to the exemptions
list that go beyond the existing
situation?</div>
					
					<a name="07012583000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07012583000212"></a>John
Healey:
						</b> It is not clear which exceptions or exemptions the
hon. Lady is concerned about. We have made that list to strike the
right balance, as I have described, between encouraging greater
administrative data sharing, where that is in the public interest, and
ensuring that the proper safeguards are in place, because that will
also be a matter of public concern and interest. The list is drawn from
the experience of the arrangements that the ONS already has in place 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column245" />Column number: 246</div>and, as I have cited, in respect of our approach in other legislation.
If the hon. Lady has specific concerns about particular exceptions, I
hope that she will contribute to this
debate.</div>
					<a name="07012583000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
confidentiality clause works with the data-sharing provisions later in
the Bill to ensure, first, that our existing data flows can continue,
secondly, that specific extensions can be granted, subject to the
strict safeguards that I have already outlined, and, thirdly, that
there are stronger sanctions for disclosure, meaning that breaches of
the confidentiality obligation are punishable by up to two years
imprisonment. We have designed the clause to get a balanced approach
that takes account of the need for flexibility in future data sharing
and the need for reassurance about the basis on which any personal data
might be used by the
board.</div>
					<a name="07012583000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">In doing this,
we were, as the Committee would expect, conscious of the human rights
implications of our proposals and sensitive to the need to strike an
appropriate balance between the wider public interest in data sharing
and the rights of the individual. The data-sharing clauses and the
confidentiality clauses are considered, as has been confirmed, to be
compatible with convention rights. The board will be subject to section
6 of the Human Rights Act 1998, which provides that public authorities
should act in a way that is compatible with convention rights. In
making any disclosure permitted by provisions of the Bill, the board
will have to consider the compatibility of such disclosures with
convention
rights.</div>
					<a name="07012583000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">Since the
publication of the Bill, the Information Commissioner&#146;s office
has told the Treasury that the Information Commissioner, who now also
deals with data protection matters&#151;which may formally have been
the responsibility of the Data Protection Registrar&#151;welcomes the
creation of a criminal offence for the illegal disclosure of personal
information under this clause, which he believes should act as a
significant deterrent. He also welcomes the measures in the Bill that
aim to ensure that any personal information required by the board for
the production of statistics is tightly controlled and used only for
the purposes required to exercise its functions. Overall, I understand
that the Information Commissioner welcomes the recognition in the Bill
of the importance of ensuring that personal information is used only
where necessary and that confidentiality is respected. That is, as I
explained at the start, the very essence of the balance that we are
trying to strike.</div>
					<a name="07012583000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that I have given a helpful explanation of our principled approach
in framing the Bill in general and clause 36 in particular. I commend
the clause to the
Committee.</div>

							<b class="B">Mr.
Mark Hoban</b> (Fareham) (Con): Welcome to the Chair, Sir
John. I shall respond to a couple of the Financial Secretary&#146;s
comments. The Conservatives have not sought to press any of the
amendments to this clause that we debated&#151;rather
unsatisfactorily, because of time constraints&#151;on Tuesday
evening.</div>
					<a name="07012583000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">I return to
one of the exemptions in clause 36 to probe the Financial
Secretary&#146;s thinking a bit more. He set out clearly the
sanctions and safeguards that will give people who pass on personal
information to the board confidence about its use, and listed three
circumstances in which that personal information could be used. One use
is for statistical purposes. I think that we all agree that that is why
the data will be collected in the first place, but I was concerned
about the third exemption. After due parliamentary process, the data
collected by the board could be used by another Department under the
exemption in subsection (4)(a). It concerns me to wonder for what
purpose such data might be used. If subsection (4)(a) were qualified by
the words &#147;for statistical purposes&#148;, I could understand
and accept it, but the exemption is broad. It applies to
disclosures</div>
					<a name="07012583000167"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;required or
permitted by any
enactment&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07012583000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall give
a scenario to which I should like the Financial Secretary to say how
subsection (4)(a) will
apply.</div>
					<a name="07012583000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the 2011
census, data will be collected on the population of the UK&#151;their
address, personal data and date of birth. In theory, that census data
could be used by enactment as a cross-check against the national
identity database to see whether the database is complete. If people
knew that that was the case, they might be rather reluctant to provide
data for the purpose of the census.</div>

Healey:
						</b> The hon. Lady&#146;s concern will be dealt with
by the requirements in the Bill to strike the appropriate balance
between greater data sharing and protection of individual
confidentiality and data. Both of these will be ensured by the
safeguards and sanctions contained in the Bill. Any extension of data
sharing arrangements will have to be set out very clearly in any
subsequently proposed order and will be scrutinised by Parliament under
the affirmative procedure&#151;I have ensured that such matters will
be dealt with that way. I expect that such arrangements will be
carefully monitored by the board and, indeed, by the House as they are
implemented. That should give the hon. Lady the reassurance she seeks
and allay the concerns that may lie behind her question.</div>
					<a name="07012583000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">To the hon. Member for Fareham,
I repeat what I said at the end of our last sitting, which is that
there are no time constraints on consideration of the Bill in
Committee. Happily, the parties reached a shared view on programming
the Committee stage. As I explained on Tuesday evening, Government
Members were prepared to stay as long as necessary to give proper
scrutiny to the clauses we were then considering. Of course, if the
hon. Gentleman thinks that he has not when debating previous amendments
made points that in general terms relate to clause 36, it seems to me
appropriate, with your indulgence, Sir John, that they debated now. I
do not understand his reiteration that time constraints are an
issue.</div>
					<a name="07012583000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection
(4)(a) is in the clause simply to take into account other Acts of
Parliament that this House may pass that may affect the arrangements in
the Bill. The limits on the extent of subsection (4)(a) are, in simple
terms, the limits that are set by this House under other Acts of
Parliament. I think if the hon. Gentleman pauses he will recognise that
that is necessary in the context of the Bill; otherwise it could have
legal precedence over any other Act of Parliament and intent of this
House expressed in legislation. When we consider some of the clauses
that relate to the Registrar General, we will examine an example of
existing legislation that sets out certain conditions in which data may
be shared between the Registrar General and, for example, the health
service&#151;in that case, patient records. The purpose of subsection
(4)(a) is to accommodate the circumstances that arise if Parliament
passes legislation that is relevant to the data sharing arrangements in
the Bill but that the Bill is not designed to
override.</div>
					<a name="07012583000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope with

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07012583000221"></a>John
Healey:
						</b> I will not detain the Committee long, but the
clause is important because under it the board will be able to refuse
to release personal information following a freedom of information
request, whereas, in contrast, public authorities that have received
personal information from the board might have to release it following
such a request. I think that that might require some explanation and
justification.</div>
					<a name="07012583000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause does not mean that it will always be necessary for a public
authority that holds such information to release it. Depending on the
information in question, there might be reasons for not releasing it
that are permitted under the Freedom of Information Act 2000. For
example, in certain circumstances an authority could refuse to release
information that identifies a living individual. The clause will allow
historical information to continue to be passed to researchers and is
consistent with the Government&#146;s commitment to openness made in
the 2000 Act.</div>
					<a name="07012583000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">The FOI
Act gives any person the right to ask for, and be given, any
information held by a public authority. It also sets out, however, a
number of situations in which data are to be protected from release.
One of those situations, which are called &#147;exemptions&#148; in
the Act, is when there is a legal bar to data being released. The
confidentiality obligation for personal information in clause 36
provides such a bar, as we have discussed, as it legally obliges the
board and its employees not to pass personal information to others
except in the limited cases set
out.</div>
					<a name="07012583000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">As such, personal
information held by the board will not have to be released under the
FOI Act. That will help to ensure that survey respondents have
confidence that personal information passed to the board is unlikely to
be released. However, that provision must be balanced against the
commitments to openness made in the FOI Act and the value to
researchers of historical data. Clause 37 therefore sets out that when
personal information is passed by the board to other public
authorities, it will not automatically be exempt from release under
freedom of information simply because of the confidentiality
obligation. It may, however, be exempt from release on another basis,
as I have said, such as in certain circumstances if it may identify a
living individual.</div>
					<a name="07012583000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
that extent, the clause replicates the current situation. For example
census records, which are personal information, will continue to be
passed by the board to the national archives in time for release after
100 years, and the clause ensures that the archives can continue to
release historical census information in accordance with the Public
Records Act 1958 and freedom of information
obligations.</div>
					<a name="07012583000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Information Commissioner&#146;s view is relevant to the clause.
Overall, he welcomes the fact that the Bill recognises the importance
of ensuring that personal information is used only when necessary, that
confidentiality is respected and that the criminal offence of illegal
disclosure of personal data will help to underpin the system.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column249" />Column number: 250</div>
					<a name="07012583000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, Sir John, there has
been some suggestion that the Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act
2002 should be included in the clause. I am actively considering that
and working with parliamentary counsel and the relevant Scottish
authorities to determine what, if anything, needs to be done. I hope
that the Committee will understand that should an amendment be
required, I propose to table it on

is, given that the role of the National Statistician and the Registrar
General are being prised apart by the Bill. I understand why the
National Statistician needs to receive information from the Registrar
General but why will the board pass the data to the Department of

						</b> I shall answer the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
questions simply and specifically, as they refer to what appears to be
the main concern about the clause. There will of course be
circumstances in which the Registrar General, both now and when the
role is separated from the office and function of the National
Statistician, passes data directly to the health service. Information
that could include name, date of birth, place of birth, usual address
and other such data may go straight from the Registrar General to the
health service. As the ONS is currently able to do, the statistics
board can add to that data coding by post code, by ward and by
administrative area. In other words, the statistics service may add
further data that enrich what can then be passed to, and used by, the
health service.</div>
					<a name="07012583000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are circumstances in which and data on which the ONS can add further
analysis of a quality that is of value to the health service. The

future when the Registrar General and the National Statistician are no
longer legally and operationally the same
person.</div>

Friend&#146;s amendment unless the Minister can provide me with a
little comfort about a concern that I have. I understand the
Government&#146;s objectives and the reasons for their proposals, but
the Bill should not conflate statistics, which try to identify general
trends, and personal information, which might identify individuals. I
hope the Minister will reassure me that that will not
happen.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07012583000231"></a>Mr.
Fallon:
						</b> I, too, support the amendment, because subsection
(3) ranges extremely widely. The Minister tries to ensure that
information about registrations between general practices&#151;people
moving from one general practice to another, or from one health 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column251" />Column number: 252</div>authority area to another&#151;is properly captured. The explanatory
notes describe the process as the creation of an information gateway; I
think they mean the creation of a power to ensure that the board still
receives the information.</div>
					<a name="07012583000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">In subsection (3)(d), which the
amendment covers, the information to be provided as part of the
measurement of flows of people from one general practice to another
includes the reasons for an individual&#146;s cancellation or
re-registration. There may be many reasons why one cancels one&#146;s
registration with one&#146;s general practitioner, and they may have
nothing to do with one&#146;s relocation to a different part of the
country. One may be unhappy with the performance of the general
practice, for example. I am not sure that it is appropriate for the
board to start piling up information about why people have moved.
Surely the board needs only the statistical information that an
individual has moved or has changed GP. I should be grateful if the
Minister could explain why subsection (3) must go so far as to cover,
in paragraph (d), the reasons for people registering or not
registering.</div>

Healey:
						</b> Clauses 40 and 41 provide for the Secretary of
State for Health, public authoritiesor Welsh Ministers to
share patient registration information with the board for the
production of population statistics. To be clear, clause 40(4) makes it
explicit that patient registration information does not include any
information about the health, care or treatment of
individuals.</div>
					<a name="07012583000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">Patient
registration information is information about persons who are or who
have been registered in any place in England or Wales as persons to
whom primary medical services are provided. That may include, but is
not limited to, information such as a person&#146;s address, their
date of birth, their gender or their NHS number. The provisions
replicate the current data sharing arrangements within the Office for
National Statistics.</div>
					<a name="07012583000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">It may be helpful to the
Committee if I explain exactly what happens to such information.
Patient registration information is collated and held in the national
health service central register, which is currently maintained at the
Office for National Statistics and is used primarily to manage the
transfer of medical records between GP practices and between the NHS
and the armed forces&#146; medical services. Statisticians in the ONS
have access to that information, and that access enables the ONS to
derive and estimate migration within England and Wales and between
England, Wales, Scotland and Northern
Ireland.</div>
					<a name="07012583000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">The data
covered by the clause will therefore allow greater monitoring and
analysis of migration and population movements&#151;something in
which the Committee has taken an interest, as the hon. Member for
Fareham said. I think that all Committee members want there to be
better quality, more up-to-date data to assist in some important areas
of policy-making.</div>
					<a name="07012583000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 166 would prevent
the Secretary of State or another public authority from disclosing
tothe board any information that would allow the
identification of an individual. That would mean that all information
would have to be in an anonymised, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column252" />Column number: 253</div>non-identifying format. I hope that the hon. Member for Braintree will
understand that the distinction he tried to draw between statistics on
general trends and data on registration represents a conceptual
difference, but in practice it is important to bring them
together.</div>

						</b> It is interesting to see the way in which the
debate is going because it illustrates the importance of having
absolute clarity about the tension between having the quality of
information at the most local level and ensuring that confidentiality
is protected in the way set out by the Minister. That is important
because if one errs too far in one direction, one may find, as we did
in the past, that information simply does not pick up what happens at
the most local level, particularly in rural areas. The protection must
be there so that we can be assured that data are used in an appropriate
way to ensure that the interests of every area are properly analysed
and understood.</div>

							<a name="07012583000236"></a>John
Healey:
						</b> My right hon. Friend is right. In dealing with
concerns about understanding flows of population, it is necessary for
statisticians to have access to the data. The important question then
is whether that takes place in circumstances that sufficiently
safeguard the confidentiality of certain types of data and the uses to
which they may be put. That is the essence of the debate that we are
having this
morning.</div>

					<a name="07012583000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">The reason is
that, just like the ONS at present, the board will need to have access
to identifiable information if it is going to continue to
produce&#151;let alone improve&#151; useful and meaningful
population statistics. Such statistics require the ability to identify
all moves where an individual has registered a change of permanent
address, thus enabling the board to identify which individuals should
be counted as migrants and in what data periods, areas and population
sub-groups. Individual records are required for matching and tracing
migrants between separate reporting periods; research into
understanding, for instance, patterns of migration by linking recent
and older records is possible only if the two types of records can be
matched
individually.</div>
					<a name="07012583000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">It has
become increasingly important for policy makers to be well informed
about migration, both to monitor the pattern and trends in flows and to
respond to changes in the position and impact of migrants within
society and the economy.</div>

							<b class="B">Fiona
Mactaggart</b> (Slough) (Lab): This aspect of the data caused
some of the problems in Slough which I spoke to the Minister about, and
part of the failure to estimate mid-year populations accurately is to
do with such things. For example, young men in particular do not
necessarily have a health record, as they tend not to register with
GPs. Therefore, connecting all the pieces of information has
significance, if only to statisticians, who can work out whether
particular classes of people not registering and so on. That might help
to improve the accuracy of some of our poor counts, with results in

					<a name="07012583000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
Nos. 167 and 169 would widen the scope of clauses 40 and 41 so that the
patient registration information could be used by the board for any
purpose. The clause would, therefore, not restrict how the information
might be used by the board&#151;although, clearly, when taken with
amendment No. 166, the usefulness of the information for the
board would be
limited.</div>

information for the production of important population statistics. I

in clause 36(4)(a) for any enactment to be used to share the

subject to legislation, and on the other, some tightly worded
subsections restricting the use of data. There is a contradiction,

Healey:
						</b> In essence, the hon. Gentleman asks why we need
this wording and this specific focus on import and export data,
particularly if we are already sharing them. The answer lies in the
implementation of section 18 of the Commissioners for Revenues and
Customs Act 2005. That limited HMRC&#146;s ability to share
information, by laying down the general rule that HMRC may not disclose
any information held or received by it in the course of its
functions.</div>
					<a name="07012583000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">Since the
2005 Act came into force, officials have been examining the
HMRC&#146;s disclosures of data to ensure they are consistent with
the rules laid down in the CRC Act. Those investigations have brought
to light two occasions when information has been disclosed to the ONS
and then fed into the compilation of national accounts, so it has that
important function.
</div>
					<a name="07012583000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">The 2005 Act permits
HMRC to disclose data in certain specified circumstances, one of which
is where another provision authorises disclosure. That is similar to
subsection (4)(a) in the previous clause. The clause will form such a
provision to ensure that HMRC can lawfully share data with the new
board in the same way as the Inland Revenue and Customs and Excise
shared data with the ONS. So it is intended to put beyond any doubt the
basis for the necessary and current sharing of information that relates
to import and export
data.</div>

							<a name="07012583000245"></a>Mr.
Fallon:
						</b> I want to pursue more generally the concern raised
by my hon. Friend the Member for Fareham. The clause is very wide, and
I fully understand what the Financial Secretary has just said. He is
trying to replicate a power in the Commissioners for Revenue and
Customs Act 2005, to ensure that the information that is sent to the
ONS under that Act continues to be sent to the board. However, that is
not quite what clause 42(1) would do. It refers to information in
connection with</div>
					<a name="07012583000171"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;any
function of the Revenue and
Customs.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07012583000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have two
concerns about
that.</div>
					<a name="07012583000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">First, the
restriction of that information is not contained in the clause itself
but set out in the explanatory notes. Paragraph 165
states:</div>
					<a name="07012583000172"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It is
intended that two categories of data will be disclosed under this
provision&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07012583000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">That does not
reassurance us much. Presumably, the Financial Secretary could add to
those categories, or a future Minister with new intentions could
specify further categories of information to be disclosed. Can the
Minister reassure me that the explanatory notes contain the existing
categories that are disclosed and that it will not be possible to widen
them further than is suggested by the intentions that are set
out?</div>
					<a name="07012583000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">My second
question is on a point recently raised by the hon. Member for Slough,
who is sadly not in her place. I quite understand why personal
information will not be disclosable under the clause&#151;I welcome
that&#151;but the Financial Secretary has referred to one of the
central problems that besets the ONS: the lack of comprehensive data on
migration.</div>
					<a name="07012583000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">One of the
key matters is the number of people entitled to national insurance
cards and those who are registered and deregistered for them. At the
moment, that seems a hazy area. Even though personal information cannot
be disclosed, under the clause, can the board produce more accurate
migration statistics by examining the data on the number of national
insurance cards, or can it only examine data on the collection of
national insurance contributions&#151;in other words, the amount
paid, rather than the number of cards
issued?</div>
					
					<a name="07012583000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07012583000246"></a>John
Healey:
						</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his
interest in the clause and his attempt to help the Committee understand
the Government&#146;s
thinking.</div>
					<a name="07012583000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
does indeed permit the Commissioners for Revenue and Customs or an
officer of Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs to pass information
held by HMRC to the board for use in connection with one or more of its
statistical functions. It only permits the sharing of personal
information&#151;defined in clause 36, as data that can identify
individuals or businesses&#151;that relates to the import or export
of goods. That is considered personal information because it can
identify businesses and, in some cases, individuals who are sole
traders.</div>
					<a name="07012583000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Sevenoaks tempts me to stiffen the clarity and commitment in
the explanatory notes. It is intended that two categories of data will
be shared under the clause, both of which are currently shared. Any
future Minister or Government could make amendments, as is the case
with any legislation in any policy
area.</div>

					<a name="07012583000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">The first
category of data to which the provision will apply
is</div>
					<a name="07012583000173"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;summary data,
including information on income tax and National Insurance
contributions, which is currently provided by Revenue and Customs to
ONS, to allow ONS to produce statistics, including estimates of the UK
national income, as a part of their production of the UK National
Accounts&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07012583000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those data are
not personally identifiable. They are less relevant to the future
improvement of migration and population statistics than some of the
proposals that the National Statistician is putting in place through
her recent working group. If hon. Members want to pursue their concern
about the quality of migration statistics, I refer them to the
group&#146;s report.</div>
					<a name="07012583000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second category of data
is</div>
					<a name="07012583000174"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;information relating
to the import or export of goods to and from the UK, which is currently
passed from Revenue and Customs to ONS to allow ONS to produce
statistics. ONS use the data to identify businesses to survey about
import and export prices, and in the analysis of the results of such
surveys. Results from ONS&#146;s surveys feed into indices of the
prices charged to producers (part of the measurement of the value added
by UK manufacturers), and into analyses of the UK balance of payments
in the National
Accounts.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07012583000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
information is considered personal, as defined under the Bill, because
individuals can be identified from it. If the ONS did not receive that
information from HMRC, it would need to survey many more businesses to
find out which of them import and export goods. All hon. Members will
appreciate that that would significantly increase the survey burden on
businesses. Furthermore, the quality of the statistics that ultimately
come into the national accounts would be impaired. On that basis, I
hope that hon. Members will accept the
clause.</div>

44 gives powers to the Treasury to make regulations to enable or
require public authorities to disclose information to the board. I
understand why such powers may be required: to reduce the costs of
national statistics and improve their comprehensiveness and accuracy.
There is certainly great support from the business community for
measures that seek to reduce the cost of data collection when there are
alternative routes. That underpins part of the argument
forclause 42.</div>
					<a name="07012583000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment is designed to
address concerns about creating information gateways. I am worried that
we are creating the potential for data to flow from the public

the board to be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column257" />Column number: 258</div>used as a conduit in that way? Would it not be far better for the
information gateway to be directed, when that is required and

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07012583000248"></a>Mr.
Newmark:
						</b> The way I read it, clause 44 contains quite wide
powers for the Treasury to authorise the disclosure of information
where disclosure would otherwise be illegal or ultra vires. Although
that information can only be gathered for statistical purposes and
cannot be used for any other reasons, I support amendment No. 171,
which clarifies a point about which I was concerned before by seeking
to ensure that any personal information obtained in that way cannot be
disclosed. That is important, because at the moment, under subsection
(6)(b), the Treasury can make regulations containing
&#147;consequential and supplementary&#148; provisions, which could
authorise further disclosure by the board, even where that would
otherwise be illegal, as mentioned in subsection
(7)(b).</div>
					<a name="07012583000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the absence
of amendment No. 171, I am concerned that the Treasury could,
effectively, make regulations and not be subject to any scrutiny,
thereby empowering the board to collect personal information and then
to disclose it, even where it would otherwise be illegal. That sweeping
power should, at least, contain a ban on the disclosure of personal
information, as amendment No. 171
provides.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07012583000251"></a>John
Healey:
						</b> Before dealing with specific amendments and points
raised by the hon. Members for Fareham and for Braintree about
amendmentNo. 171, I should like to say that clause 44 is the
central clause relating to the power to authorise disclosure of
information to the board. It is worth emphasising that the aim of the
clause and the Bill is to ensure that information can be shared to
provide better services and better policies to support those public
services for citizens and businesses and that it can be used in other
instances where that is in the public interest. We are creating a
framework that will ensure the continued sharing of data between the
ONS and other parts of the Government for the purpose of statistical
production and analysis. We are also creating a mechanism to allow for
increased data sharing between the ONS and other parts of the
Government, and vice versa, where that is for the sole purpose of
statistical production&#151;and only where that sharing is judged to
be in the public
interest.</div>
					<a name="07012583000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">The specific
extensions of access will be agreed through secondary legislation that
will be subjectto parliamentary scrutiny through the
affirmative procedure and will therefore require the approval of the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column258" />Column number: 259</div>House. I believe that, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff,
South and Penarth and other Committee members have recognised, there is
in principle a clear case for stronger sharing of administrative data.
Such sharing can improve the quality of statistical data and analysis
and improve our ability to make and judge the impact of policy. Re-use
of data means that statisticians can produce richer statistics and
better analyses, often without needing to survey the same topic again.
It also has the potential to bring benefits in reducing the burden on
those responsible for completing, or required to complete, the surveys
on which many of our official statistics depend.</div>
					<a name="07012583000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">The 2005 report by the Better
Regulation Task Force, &#147;Regulation&#151;Less is More. Reducing
Burdens, Improving Outcomes&#148;, recommended increased data sharing
between Departments to reduce the intrusion on business and the
complexity and the time required for businesses to complete surveys.
The Confederation of British Industry echoed a recommendation that
Philip Hampton made in his 2005
review:</div>
					<a name="07012583000175"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It
would, in principle, be helpful if government departments and
regulators could hare information to reduce
duplication&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07012583000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">As part of
the Whitehall-wide plan to reduce administrative burdens, the ONS has
committed, as part of its simplification plan, to making &#163;10
million worth of reductions in the burden of business by 2015. Almost
two thirds of those savings&#151;approximately&#163;6
million&#151;are expected to come from the greater use of
administrative data for statistical purposes in place of the survey
returns from respondents that are currently
required.</div>
					<a name="07012583000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">The other
principal case for greater data sharing is to deal with declining
survey response rates. The response rates in many of the ONS&#146;s
major surveys have declined in recent years. The general household
survey had an 83 per cent. response rate when it was introduced in
1971, but that response had fallen to 72 per cent. by 2005. As survey
response rates decline, the chances become higher that the results will
be distorted and less reliable and will not truly represent the state
of the British
population.</div>
					<a name="07012583000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">Enhancing
the sharing of administrative data will help us to deal with some of
the problems with declining survey response rates, and will reduce the
cost to the Government of conducting the surveys. That can help in
three ways. First, it can help statisticians to compensate for lower
response rates by allowing them to augment the information that is
available for analysis. Secondly, it can help statistical services to
target future surveys at those who are less likely to respond, because
it will allow them to define more clearly and accurately the groups in
which response rates are a concern and to concentrate
attentionand activity on them. Thirdly, the greater use of
administrative data might, in the long term, offer an alternative to
survey activity.</div>
					<a name="07012583000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our
approach provides for extensions to currentdata sharing under
the powers in clauses 44 to 50. In broad terms, there could be
increased data sharing between the board and other public authorities
where regulations are made to permit such sharing. Of course, any such
regulations would be subject to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column259" />Column number: 260</div>further scrutiny and approval by Parliament. In practice, the discussion
and preparation of potential regulations will be between the board and
Departments, but, importantly, Ministers will be required to give
formal agreement prior to the laying of any such order before the House
or any devolved
Administration.</div>
					<a name="07012583000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
adopted that approach to allow the system to evolve. Data sets might be
created that could bring significant benefits to statistical analysis
if they are linked with those produced by other Departments. Clause 44
and the following clauses will permit further sharing under
regulations. We are doing that through regulations rather than primary
legislation to allow flexibility in the system for future evolution.
The system must be able to adapt to future statistical resources and
needs. It must also allow scope for new indicators to be developed that
can provide a more accurate, up-to-date, comprehensive and meaningful
description of the UK through the statistics and analyses that we
produce.</div>
					<a name="07012583000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 171 would prevent the board from sharing with others information
received under the regulations, but, in general, the circumstances in
which the board is able to share data that it has received from other
public authorities under the enabling clause are limited. As we
discussed, clause 36 includes the limited list of exceptions to the
obligation of confidentiality. Clause 44 restricts the exceptions
further, so unlessthe regulations make provision to permit
further disclosure, the board will not be able to share such data in
pursuit of its functions or with approved researchers as a matter of
course. It is important that the public have confidence that their
personal information will be held securely. Under subsection (4), the
board will not therefore be able to share data that it has acquired
through the enabling clause in pursuit of its function or with approved
researchers.</div>
					
					<a name="07012583000182"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.15
am</div>
					<a name="07012583000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">The provisions
leave the board able to disclosethe information only in the
remaining, limited, circumstances covered in clause 36. To allow
sharing in those circumstances is sensible and necessary, for reasons
similar to those that we discussed during our consideration of clause
36. It is right that the board should be able lawfully to share
information, for example in response to a court order, to comply
witha community obligation, or to aid a criminal
investigation, or to release information that has already been lawfully
released. We do not want to make release of data in those circumstances
a criminal
offence.</div>
					<a name="07012583000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
occasions when the board needs to share data with others. The clause
appropriately captures those circumstances. The hon. Member for Fareham
indicated that his was a probing amendment; I hope that I have given
him sufficient reassurance not to feel the need to take it
further.</div>

					<a name="07012583000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would like to complete the
CBI quotation that the Minister used earlier. The CBI
said:</div>
					<a name="07012583000176"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;However,
the information provided must only be used for the same type of purpose
by all bodies and careful and detailed consideration must be given to
concerns related to data protection and privacy.&#148;</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column260" />Column number: 261</div>
					<a name="07012583000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">That strand has been running through the
debate. I would argue that if information is held by another public
body, that body could be served a court order to release it, rather
than people going through the board or the Office for National
Statistics. I understand the Minister&#146;s point and the rationale
behind data sharing, but we need to examine more carefully how we
restrict data that are shared, to ensure that they are released
predominantly for statistical use, with certain specified 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column261" />Column number: 262</div>exemptions. That may be a theme that we return toat a later
date. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div>
