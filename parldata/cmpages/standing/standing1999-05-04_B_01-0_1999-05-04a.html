<B>The Paymaster General (Dawn Primarolo):</B> I beg to  move, 
<P>

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>That during proceedings on the Finance Bill, the Committee do  meet on Tuesdays at half-past Ten o'clock and at half-past Four  o'clock and on Thursdays at Nine o'clock and at half-past Four  o'clock except on Thursday 13 May when the Committee shall meet at  half-past Two o'clock only and on Thursday 6 May and Thursday 10  June when the Committee shall not meet.

<P>
I am delighted to see you in the Chair, Mr. Butterfill,  and I welcome you to the Committee. As an experienced  Chairman and an experienced member of Standing Com mittees on previous Finance Bills, you will ensure that  our proceedings are thorough, courteous and to the point,  and your skill and diplomacy will, doubtless guide our  debates. I also welcome the fact that your co-chairman is  Mr. Cook, who has much parliamentary and Committee  experience. I am sure that he, too, will ensure that Com mittee members stay in order. 
<P>
I welcome the opportunity to debate the Bill with the  right hon. member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory)  and his team. The Opposition Members are roughly the  same cast who entertained us during our consideration of  last year's Finance Bill, with the addition of the right  hon. Members for Charnwood (Mr. Dorrell) and for  Fylde (Mr. Jack), both of whom served as Financial  Secretary to the Treasury in the previous Government.  They will doubtless bring their expertise to bear on our  considerations, and we shall bring our experience of their  deeds to the attention of the Committee. 
<P>
As always, I look forward to debating with the hon.  Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey), and his  team. The Liberal Democrats bring their own distinctive  views to our proceedings--sometimes they support the  Government, and sometimes they do not. 
<P>
I welcome my hon. Friends to what I know will be a  thrilling and enjoyable experience. I am ably supported  today by my hon. Friends the Financial Secretary to the  Treasury and the Economic Secretary to the Treasury.  Alas, my right hon. Friend the Chief Secretary to the  Treasury was unable to attend this morning's sitting  because of a Cabinet committee meeting. I understand  that, out of courtesy, he informed the right hon. Member  for Wells that he would be absent. 
<P>
I hope that we shall proceed with, a civilised and  well-ordered frame of mind and that, although our  exchanges will doubtless become a little heated, the  issues will be properly examined. We shall do our best to  ensure that Opposition Members appreciate the Bill's  finer qualities. 
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory </B>(Wells): I echo many  of the Paymaster General's remarks, in particular her  welcome to you, Mr. Butterfill, and to your co-Chairman,  Mr. Cook. 
<P>
We look forward to a constructive consideration of the  Bill, which is, as always, highly complex. Although we  dealt with some of the issues on the Floor of the House,  many of its nooks and crannies remain unexplored. Our  experience of recent Finance Bills shows that the  detailed clauses require close scrutiny because they often  contain unannounced tax rises. For that reason, we have  assembled an unusually strong team on the Conservative  side of the Committee, including two former Financial  Secretaries to the Treasury who know where all the  bodies are buried in the Treasury, and who can bring  their many years' expertise to the Bill. 
<P>
I also welcome the Government Members. On pre vious Finance Bills, some of them have been referred to,  rather unkindly, as nodding donkeys. I did not use the  phrase, but it gained currency when they appeared to  accept almost any tax rise or increased complexity in  taxation. I suggest to the whole Committee that we have  a duty not only as supporters or opponents of the Govern ment, but as parliamentarians, to scrutinise an important  Bill on behalf of all our constituents. I hope that we can  bring a non-partisan expertise to some of the technical  measures, to ensure that the final version of the Bill will  be a credit to the House of Commons in its clarity, if in  nothing else. 
<P>
We have already debated parts of the Bill in Com mittee on the Floor of the House, where Conservative  Members criticised the fuel duty tax increases. That is a  matter to which we can refer obliquely here, because one  or two other clauses also refer to it. We are adamant that  the Government have made a mistake in ratcheting up  fuel duties; the so-called escalator has now gone beyond  a level that can be justified on environmental grounds. It  is now rendering an important British industry uncom petitive in European terms, and adding to the cost of all  manufactured goods. We believe that the Government  will eventually admit their mistake, although unfortu nately, it does not appear that we shall succeed in  persuading them to reverse that tax increase in the Bill.  None the less, we shall continue to try. 
<P>
We have also debated stamp duty and married couples  allowance, and we shall have the opportunity to return to  those subjects. There are many other areas that we wish  to explore, and for that reason, Conservative Members of  the Committee have retained the services of a tax expert  supplied by a firm of City accountants, PriceWaterhou seCoopers. That has been registered in the Register of  Members' Interests, but I also wish to inform the Com mittee of the fact orally, to avoid any misunderstanding. 
<P>
The Bill is part of a series of Budgets that is raising  enormously the tax burden on every section of the British  public. It is sometimes thought that tax rises can be  neatly categorised into those that affect businesses and  those that affect individuals. That is a mistake, as the  effects of all taxes are eventually borne by individual  members of the public.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies </B>(Croydon, Central): Is there a  danger that advice given by PriceWaterhouseCoopers  might be given in the interests of their clients, and might  therefore bias the contributions made by the right hon.  Gentleman? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> No, I do not think that there  is any such danger, as will become clear from our  deliberations. The hon. Gentleman knows, as a veteran  of previous Finance Bills, that all Committee Members  rely heavily on the advice of outside professional and  trade bodies. Their activities are sometimes described as  lobbying, but that description diminishes their  contribution. It is important for us to bring to the  Committee well considered views, criticisms and even  draft amendments that have been suggested to us.  However good we are, we cannot assemble all the  necessary expertise from among our own Committee  Members. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael Jack </B>(Fylde): Would my right hon.  Friend care to reflect on the hon. Gentleman's question,  and whether it might imply a rejection by Government  Members of any advice--however well-intentioned or  well argued, and however correct and proper--in  framing their views on the Bill? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I hope that that is not the  case, but my right hon. Friend is right to draw our  attention to that danger. We have already seen that the  Government do not listen. Many of the matters that we  shall criticise in the Bill were drawn to the Government's  attention during the previous consultation period. For  example, they could have avoided the fuel duty fiasco if  they had listened to outside bodies. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> Will the right hon. Gentleman  give way? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I hope the hon. Gentleman  will forgive me, but I want to complete my remarks on  tax rises, which go to the heart of our deliberations. 
<P>
Our complaint is that the Government are not only  raising taxes, but doing so by stealth. That was shown  immediately after the Budget speech when the Prime  Minister asserted, quite shamelessly and wrongly, that  the Budget would cut taxes by £4.5 billion. That has been  contradicted by the Library, as well as by many outside  experts. In that figure, the Government included all the  public expenditure increases and called them tax  reductions, with the absurd result that extra expenditure  on green transport, recorded in the Budget report as £5  million a year, was called a sort of negative tax, instead  of being classified as public expenditure. So the  Chancellor knocked that amount off tax increases and  came up with the bizarre figure of a £4.5 billion tax  reduction. That subterfuge lasted for about 24 hours. It  would be useful if the Government agreed early in the  debate that that was a misrepresentation, and that the true  effect of the Budget was to raise extra taxes, it is one of a  series of three Budgets that do so. 
<P>
The Government compounded that error by referring  to matters that are not in the Finance Bill as Budget tax  reductions. Conversely, the Finance Bill includes  matters to which the Chancellor did not refer in his  Budget speech. Another example is that "Budget 99", the brief version of the Budget that was circulated to the  public, mentioned research and development tax credits,  which were proudly announced as a measure to boost  productivity. That measure is not in the Finance Bill at  all. The same leaflet did not mention some measures that  are in the Finance Bill and do raise taxes. 
<P>
There are many matters to which the Chancellor did  not refer at all, or that he glossed over, in his speech. For  example, he did not mention the fact that, although a 10p  starting rate of tax will be introduced, the 20 per cent. tax  band will be abolished, so that for many people, the  marginal rate of tax will go up to 23 per cent, not down to  10p. Nor did the Chancellor refer to the fact that,  although the fuel escalator will continue at a rate of at  least 6 per cent. in real terms, there is a particular penalty  for drivers of diesel cars, for whom fuel tax will go up by  almost 12 per cent. in cash terms. 
<P>
<b>10.45 am </b>
</P>
<P>
The Chancellor also did not say that the new marginal  rate of 10 per cent. for those on earned income at the  lower end of the scale will not apply to savings income.  Savers will continue to pay tax on non-dividend savings  income at 20 per cent. 
<P>
The question of the system's complexity also arises.  Last year, we continually pointed out that a complex tax  system not only creates difficulties for the Inland  Revenue and Customs and Excise, but is a business  overhead that the whole country must bear. I am sorry  that the Government have not learned that lesson. Small  businesses will have to grapple not only with the  regulations governing working time, the minimum  wage, and so on, but make sense of two new bands of  stamp duty; instead of two bands, there will be four. Last  year, the capital gains tax system was made much more  complicated. Sadly, little has been done this year to  correct that. Given that certain changes are in prospect,  we may well deal with that point later in our  deliberations. 
<P>
There is plenty to occupy the Committee. Opposition  Members will try to approach the Bill in a genuinely  constructive spirit. We ask that Labour Members keep  clearly in mind not only their slavish devotion to the  Government, but the needs and representations of their  constituents. Perhaps the sensitivity that the hon.  Member for Croydon, Central (Mr. Davies)  demonstrated in respect of the Opposition's enjoying the  services of a tax expert arises from embarrassment about  the many representations from his constituents, which he  is not always inclined to raise with his Front Bench. I  hope that I am doing him an injustice, and we look  forward to his contributions. However, it is in all our  interests to improve--and, if necessary, to shorten--the  Bill during our deliberations.

<P>

<B>Mr. Edward Davey </B>(Kingston and Surbiton): I, too,  welcome you, Mr. Butterfill--and, in due course, your  co-Chairman, Mr. Cook--to the Chair, and I hope that  you had an enjoyable May bank holiday, which in  Kingston we celebrate with a traditional May Merrie. As  we wandered round the streets and on to the Fairfield, the  mayor of Kingston and I stopped to watch a Punch and  Judy show in the marketplace. Although I enjoyed it and    [Mr. Edward Davey] 
<P>
the children had a good time, I hope that the Committee's  proceedings will not resemble that performance. Should  you wish to visit Kingston on a May bank holiday, Mr.  Butterfill, I should be happy to arrange for you to join the  mayoral party. 
<P>
I recently served for three months on the Standing  Committee that considered the Greater London  Authority Bill. That Bill had another 30 clauses added to  it, and a record number of amendments--more than  1,300--were made. Hon. Members will understand what  an enjoyable experience that was, and I am sorry that I  cannot attend the Report Stage on the Floor of the House  today. I look forward to my chance to do so tomorrow. 
<P>
I hope that our proceedings will be as rigorous as those  on that Bill, although I should say that those could not be  described as trench warfare. My hon. Friend the Member  for Southwark, North and Bermondsey (Mr. Hughes) has  told me that in the past, Standing Committee proceedings  tended to continue through the night and into the early  hours. So far that has not happened with many  Committees during this Parliament, and I am sure that all  Committee members join me in hoping that, under your  good chairmanship, Mr. Butterfill, we shall make speedy  progress without needing to sit through the night. 
<P>
I should offer the apologies of those of my hon.  Friends who are participating in other Committees this  morning. Their absence indicates no discourtesy to you,  Mr. Butterfill, or to other members of the Committee. 
<P>
I thank the Government Whip, who consulted widely  before tabling the sittings motion, with which we are in  general agreement, and which will help us to scrutinise  the Bill and ensure its smooth passage. There was some  discussion about the days on which the Committee will  not sit, and the relevance of those days--I am sure that all  Committee members can guess the relevance. It is  generous to the official Opposition to allow them some  time off on those days; after all, they need all the help that  they can get. 
<P>
I hope that the Government will keep the sittings  motion under review. I hope that if during our  examination of the Bill, Opposition Members find cause  for further scrutiny, the Government will be flexible  enough to allow additional time. The Bill is relatively  short and, given the current scheduling of the  Committee's proceedings, we are time-rich. 
<P>
I do not intend to rehearse my speech on Second  Reading again, but I would like to say that I share the  concern of the right hon. Member for Wells about the  increased complexity of our tax system as a result of the  Government's legislation. Its tax system is an important  asset of any society. If you were to look round the world,  Mr. Butterfill, you would find that many other countries  wish that they had a tax system that was effective as ours  in raising revenue, and commanded as much general  support across the personal and business sector. Many  Governments in other countries have difficulty in  collecting taxes. When the previous Government  introduced what appeared to be one of the simplest of  taxes--the poll tax--they found that it was difficult to  collect. It did not command the consent of the people, it  was difficult to implement and it was eventually thrown  out. That brought the previous Government, and their tax  measures, into disrepute. 
<P>
I hope that the current Government will review their  overall philosophy as they legislate for the tax system. In  doing so, they should recognise the importance of that  system to the economy and the wider society. An  increasing number of people fill in end-of-year tax  returns, and increasing the complexity of the system  makes their task more difficult and goes against the  Government's declared aim of simplification. 
<P>
To illustrate the increased complexity, I can draw on  my discussions with people operating a playgroup in my  constituency. I mentioned a playgroup on Second  Reading, but I now refer to a different playgroup, and to  discussions that have taken place since that debate. The  bewilderment of those people, as I explained, as simply  as I could, the different tax credits available to parents on  low incomes, was worrying. They were worried about  how they would explain the system to mothers and  fathers who would need to take up the benefits to be able  to afford the higher fees that the playgroup had had to  charge because of other cost pressures. They were also  worried about administering the complex new tax credits  for members of staff who wanted to benefit. Small  playgroups will have a high administrative burden. 
<P>
Liberal Democrat Members support the thrust of the  Government's policies--it is important to give money to  families and parents who need child care--but the  complexity of the myriad credits will make it difficult for  people to understand and take advantage of them. That is  a clear example of the need for simplicity in the tax  system. If Ministers want to make benefits available to  people--I am sure that they do--the system must be  user-friendly for the taxpayer. 
<P>
I shall not comment on every tax change in the Bill, as  the right hon. Member for Wells did. I shall leave that  until later in our proceedings. 
<P>
There is a slight change of cast among Liberal  Democrat Committee members since last year's  Committee. I am pleased that my hon. Friend the  Member for South-East Cornwall (Mr. Breed) has joined  us. I look forward to seeing his skills and tenacity at  work. The cast on the Government Benches has also  changed; I was surprised that the right hon. Member for  Wells did not pick up that point. We have lost the former  Paymaster General, the hon. Member for Coventry,  North-West (Mr. Robinson), for reasons of which we are  all aware--indeed, we touched on them in our  proceedings last year. We are pleased that the hon.  Member for Bristol, South (Dawn Primarolo) is the new  Paymaster General. She fills the previous Paymaster  Generalls shoes with great aplomb, and we look forward  to hearing the hon. Lady and her colleagues answer our  questions. 
<P>
<B>Mr. John Whittingdale </B>(Maldon and East  Chelmsford): I start by adding my welcome to you, Mr.  Butterfill. We benefited from your chairmanship last  year, and I am sure that we are all pleased that you are  here again. We know that you will administer our  proceedings with a firm but fair hand. It is also good to    see that Mr. Cook will be joining us as your  co-Chairman. I do not think that he has chaired a Finance  Bill before, but I look forward to serving under his  chairmanship. 
<P>
As my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells and the  hon Member for Kingston and Surbiton have said, we see  many familiar faces on the Committee. This is the third  Finance Bill Committee that I have served on, although  for one and a half Finance Bills I was present in a silent  capacity, as a Whip. I was first permitted to speak half  way through last year's Finance Bill, and I hope that my  hon. Friend the Member for North-East Hertfordshire  (Mr. Heald), who is the Conservative Whip on the  Committee this year, will contribute occasionally to our  proceedings, in addition to his responsibilities for  keeping us under control. 
<P>
I am pleased to see one or two newcomers. The hon.  Member for Kingston and Surbiton mentioned two new  faces on the Government Front Bench. I welcome them  to the Committee and congratulate them on their  responsibilities. Although they have been in those posts  for some time, this is their first appearance on this  Committee in that capacity. I especially congratulate the  Paymaster General. Although she is a veteran of Finance  Bill Committees, this is the first time that she has been  given control of policy and the responsibility for getting  the Bill through the House. 
<P>
I see that the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, too, is a  member of the Committee. It is a pity that he is not here  this morning, but we understand that he has other  responsibilities. It has always been the case that Chief  Secretaries put in only occasional appearances in our  Committee. However, we hope that we might get at least  a glance at the right hon. Gentleman at some point during  our proceedings over the next eight or 10 weeks. 
<P>
There have also been changes on the Conservative  Benches. I am especially pleased that my right hon.  Friends the Members for Charnwood and for Fylde are  here to bolster the strength of the Conservative team.  They are welcome, but their presence reflects the fact  that we have lost one or two stalwarts. The sterling  service of my hon. Friends the Members for Ashford  (Mr. Green) and for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr.  Hammond) has been recognised, and they have been  given additional responsibilities on the Front Bench  which mean that they cannot participate in our  proceedings. My hon. Friend the Member for East  Worthing and Shoreham (Mr. Loughton) who also  served on previous Committees, is not here. 
<P>
He is serving on the Joint Committee on the Financial  Services and Markets Bill. That brings me to another  point that I am anxious to make. The sittings motion sets  out the timetable for debating the Finance Bill, which is  important and likely to affect the vast majority of people  in the country, yet we are being required to scrutinise it  while proceedings continue in the Joint Committee on  the Financial Services and Markets Bill. That will put a  strain on hon. Members who must undertake both  responsibilities. My right hon. Friend the Member for  Wells was modest enough not to mention in his opening  comments that he is a leading member of that  Committee, but I have no doubt that it will put an  additional strain on our Treasury team. 
<b>11.00 am</b>
<P>
The Government have made such a mess of the draft  Financial Services and Markets Bill that it will take far  longer to scrutinise it and reach conclusions, so there  may be some overlap, with both Bills under scrutiny.  That is unfortunate, to say the least, because it will be  difficult for hon. Members to do full justice to both tasks.  It seems that we can do little about that, but I want to  register my concern about the fact that the Government  have allowed that position to arise. 
<P>
When we debated the Bill in the Chamber, hon.  Members on both sides of the House observed that it was  not as long as previous Finance Bills in this Parliament.  We took note of that, more in hope than anything else,  but I examined previous Bills, and it is true that last year  we were confronted with a huge Bill running to two  volumes containing 399 pages, 161 clauses and 27  schedules. That Bill contained a huge number of  measures requiring very detailed scrutiny, the  Committee had to sit until quite late into the night on  some occasions, and our proceedings continued for a  long time. This year's Bill is not as large as that, and I  echo the hope expressed by the hon. Member for  Kingston and Surbiton that we do not have to spend too  many late nights on it. I hope that we shall be able to give  it the proper scrutiny that it requires without doing so.  However, it raises a number of major issues which will  require detailed scrutiny. 
<P>
The Bill comprises 169 pages with 129 clauses and 20  schedules. It is shorter than last year's Bill, but there is a  lot of meat in it, on which we shall want to spend some  time. In contrast, the first Finance Bill introduced by the  Government, which contained several extremely  damaging measures, the full effects of which are only  now beginning to be felt, was a lot shorter, with only 103  pages, 53 clauses and eight schedules. 
<P>
When we debated the Government's first Finance Bill,  you will recall, Mr. Butterfill, that that was made more  difficult because the Government chose to bulldoze it  through Standing Committee by use of the guillotine. It  was made even harder because the traditional period  between publication of the Bill and commencement of  the Committee's proceedings was shortened to a few  days, and people outside the House did not have the usual  period in which to study the Bill and make  representations to those of us who had to consider it. We  completed our scrutiny of its clauses and eight schedules  in just six days. The Committee was required to meet on a  Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Monday, Tuesday and  Wednesday. That allowed the Government to push it  through with the minimum of parliamentary scrutiny. I  think that they have learnt from their mistakes and that  they will not repeat their approach. 
<P>
It is extremely important for the Bill to receive proper  scrutiny--it is perhaps more important in relation to the  Finance Bill than to almost any other piece of legislation.  The Committee's most essential job is to scrutinise and  approve the Government's tax-raising measures, and we  should spend time doing that. However, our task is made  more difficult because the Chancellor deliberately set out  to create what I have to call a misleading impression of   [Mr. John Whittingdale] 
<P>
the Budget and of the Bill. Much was made of the fact that he had introduced a tax-cutting  Budget from which everyone would benefit, and numerous statistics were thrown around the  Chamber. It was very difficult for Opposition Members to analyse the Budget on the basis of  the Budget speech. As my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells said, many of the Bill's  proposals were not mentioned in that speech. When we were able to examine the Red Book,  we found various proposals hidden away in sub--paragraphs, footnotes or tables, and more  of the picture emerged when the Bill was published. 
<P>
When it is difficult to establish what the Chancellor's proposals are, it is also hard for  people to make adequate representations. The people who will be affected by the Bill should  have every opportunity to discover how their personal circumstances will be affected, after  which they should make representations to their Member of Parliament or to Opposition  Committee members so that their concerns can be debated fully in Parliament. My right hon.  Friend has already mentioned the fact that many different groups will be affected by the Bill,  including motorists, smokers, married couples, home owners, those who are about to  purchase a house, the self-employed and those who pay maintenance. They all have a direct  interest in the Bill's proposals, which will, in the main, leave them considerably worse off. It  is in the interests of those groups that we should thoroughly examine the Bill's proposals. 
<P>
As my right hon. Friend said, although many groups will be affected, some of them will  have discovered that fact only recently because the Chancellor did not mention every Budget  proposal in his Budget speech. For example, he referred to drivers of heavy goods vehicles  and other diesel-powered vehicles. Those people heard the Chancellor announce that he was  implementing an escalator of 6 per cent. plus inflation, but, when they had time to examine  the facts, they discovered that they will be required to pay not 6 per cent. but 12 per cent. The  Chancellor completely failed to mention the latter figure. 
<P>
Those drivers are by no means the worst affected. The excise duty on medium fuel oil was  increased by 22 per cent. I raised that matter on the Floor of the House, and I hope that we  shall return to it later in our proceedings. It will have a huge impact on some people. I told the  Economic Secretary that one firm in my constituency will have to pay an extra £20,000 a year  in costs as a direct result of the Government's proposal. I find it difficult to understand how  the Government can justify an increase of that magnitude, which goes way beyond the  previously announced escalator policy. It will target some businesses that face strong  competition and add considerably to their costs. Although the Chancellor glossed over that in  his speech, he devoted considerable time to measures such as the additional tax relief that will  be available to companies for the use of mobile phones. I seem to recall that another part of his  speech was devoted to tax relief for the provision of cycle equipment. That is not to say that  such measures are not welcome--I am sure that we shall spend some time debating them in  due course--but tax relief on mobile phones and cycle equipment is a less substantial issue  than the 12 per cent. rise in diesel duty, the abolition of the 20 per cent. starting rate of income  tax or the preservation of that rate for savings income. All those issues were either not  mentioned at all by the Chancellor or were referred to in passing, without their full impact  being made clear. 
<P>
Another measure that we shall discuss later, which will affect a small but important group,  is the removal of tax relief on maintenance payments. That will lead to a substantial increase  in the tax bills of some people, especially those who separated before 1998 and who, if they  are higher rate taxpayers, still enjoy tax relief at the higher rate. Not only was that not  mentioned in the Chancellor's speech but, when he was asked about it--I think by a journalist  in a subsequent briefing--he said that he was not even aware that it was contained in the  Finance Bill. There followed a frantic scurry of activity while the Chancellor was briefed on  what was proposed in the Bill, but if the Chancellor was not aware of what he was doing, it  makes it difficult for us fully to appreciate the implications of that measure within the time  scale available to us. 
<P>
I have referred to some of the measures that we shall consider in our debates, but there are  other measures to which the Chancellor or the Red Book referred, which do not seem to be in  the Finance Bill. That raises some genuine concerns. If the Government wish to table new  clauses or amendments later in our proceedings, that will have implications for our timetable.  However, I should like to refer to a couple of measures and ask the Paymaster General how  the Government intend to bring them into effect, if that is still their intention. 
<P>
The first is tax changes for the self-employed, which are contained in the Red Book but do  not seem to be included in the Bill. We understand that raising contributions for the  self-employed to class 4 will result in a sizeable tax increase for at least some self-employed  people. That has generated considerable press comment and criticism, and hon. Members are  already beginning to receive representations from constituents on that issue. As far as I can  see, that is not included in the Bill, but perhaps the Government intend to implement the  measure by secondary legislation. That is something with which we have become familiar in  relation to Finance Bills--

<P>

<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> Is it not the case that the Finance Bill Committee is not competent to  discuss national insurance? That is decided elsewhere. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Whittingdale:</B> That is an interesting question. I should like to know how that  measure, which was contained in the Red Book, will be implemented. We should be allowed  to know at the very least whether the Government intend to include it in a clause in another  Bill. 
<P>
<b>11.15 am </b>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> I am fascinated by the idea that the Bill could enact that measure.  Clause 56 deals with national insurance contributions. Will the hon. Member    for Maldon and East Chelmsford (Mr. Whittingdale) ask  how the Government will legislate on that? Why can they  legislate in this Bill on one aspect of national insurance  contributions but not on another? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Whittingdale:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes a  good point. It is strange that the Government are capable  of introducing a measure that will affect the level of  national insurance contributions, but are unable to  include a significant change that will affect many people.  I am worried that that measure will be introduced in  delegated legislation. We have expressed our concern  about the amount of legislation that the Government  choose to implement in that way. It became clear when  we discussed the previous Finance Bill that the  Government were prepared to leave the detail of a range  of measures to delegated legislation. That worried many  commentators, including my hon. Friend the Member for  Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb) who made a  powerful speech expressing his concerns. I hope that the  Paymaster General will say whether this measure will be  treated in the same way. 
<P>
There are opportunities to scrutinise delegated  legislation. Indeed, we recently discussed corporation  tax changes on the Floor of the House. However, such  matters are determined in a mysterious way that I have  never fully understood. A great deal of legislation is  passed without proper scrutiny. One must voice the  suspicion that when the Government choose to  implement measures in that way, it must be because they  are anxious to conceal something or to prevent  something from receiving the full attention of a  Committee. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown </B>(Cotswold): Is my hon.  Friend aware that since 1 May 1997, a staggering 2,400  secondary regulations have been introduced, the bulk of  which received no scrutiny from the House? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Whittingdale:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend.  He makes the point well. A huge amount of legislation is  rubber stamped by  without receiving proper scrutiny. All  hon. Members should be worried about that. It comes as a  surprise to our constituents that legislation, which often  has a major impact on their lives, is enacted without  debate. It is passed on the nod. 
<P>
I know that the Paymaster General will say that that  happened under the previous Government. I make no  bones in admitting that, but it is legitimate to voice  concerns about the extent to which the Government are  using delegated legislation to deal with serious issues.  Just because delegated legislation has been used in the  past does not mean that it is acceptable to use it  indefinitely to push through more and more changes. 
<P>
I have mentioned measures that have received  publicity and are causing concern, but which do not  appear in the Bill. One other measure, which may have  provoked more letters from my constituents and those of  my hon. Friends than almost any other, is not mentioned  in the Bill at all. It was referred to in the press release  accompanying the Budget documents--IR 35--which  announces the Government's intention to deal with  personal service companies. In certain professions,  people choose to incorporate themselves as a personal  service company and to undertake contracts of perhaps  three or six months on behalf of companies. The change  in the tax treatment of those people is causing a great deal  of concern. Professionals in the IT industry, in large part,  choose to form themselves into personal companies, and  gain a tax advantage in terms of their equipment and  training expenses. I understand that the Government are  anxious to close loopholes and crack down on tax  avoidance, but I do not regard that as an example of tax  abuse. 
<P>
The importance of IT professionals to the economy is  considerable, especially now that we are wrestling with  the possible problems of the millennium bug and the  Y2K issue. I would have thought that the Government  would be anxious to encourage IT professionals rather  than to disadvantage them through tax changes. The  measure is provoking enormous concern, and I am sure  that almost every hon. Member will have received, or  will receive, letters from people in the industry. 
<P>
I understand that the measure will come into effect at  the beginning of the next financial year. It is not  mentioned in the Bill, however, and I understand that the  Government do not intend to legislate until they  introduce next year's Finance Bill. It is worrying that the  implementing legislation will not come before the House  until after the measure has come into effect. 
<P>
<B>Ms Sally Keeble (Northampton, North):</B> This is an  important matter, especially in the M4 corridor where  many IT professionals work. Does not the hon.  Gentleman accept that delaying the legislation to allow  consultation with such professionals, which is the  Government's stated intention, is a good idea and  directly in line with all the points that he has made? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Whittingdale:</B> Obviously I agree that it is  important to consult. A number of IT professionals have  expressed alarm that there was no indication of the  Government's intention before the Budget  announcement. The Government have truncated the  whole process--an opportunity for consultation now  exists, but they appear hell-bent on introducing the  measure with effect from the beginning of the next  financial year. That has led to genuine concerns among  those affected that the consultation process is a sham. As  the Government will go ahead with the measure in a short  time, there will not be a proper opportunity for  consultation and they will not give proper recognition to  the concerns expressed. 
<P>
The Government have created a problem by springing  the change on people in the Budget, without prior  announcement, and by introducing it so quickly. If the  hon. Lady is anxious that there should be proper  consultation, it may be sensible for the measure to come  before the Committee when it considers the next Finance  Bill and for the change not to take effect until the  beginning of the following financial year. 
<P>
I hope that the Minister will comment on that  suggestion; although the measure may affect only a small  group of people, that group is none the less important in  our economy and has legitimate concerns.  [Mr. Whittingdale] 
<P>
The Bill makes no attempt to help those who were  damaged by the previous Budget, especially  non-taxpayers who will lose the dividend tax credits that  they might previously have enjoyed, as a result of  changes to advance corporation tax and the abolition of  dividend tax credits. That matter has worried members of  the Committee in the past; my hon. Friend the Member  for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton has argued  powerfully on behalf of those affected, and the hon.  Member for Kingston and Surbiton shares that concern. 
<P>
We tried to persuade the Government that some of the  most vulnerable people in society would be hurt by the  measure and were encouraged when the former  Paymaster General appeared to recognise the force of our  argument and said that he would reconsider the issue.  However, we then discovered that the Government were  not prepared to help, so our hopes that the Bill might  repair some of the damage, through amendments  addressing the concerns of that group, have been dashed.  Opposition Members--I include the hon. Member for  Kingston and Surbiton--will seek ways to address the  problem, as it concerns a group of people on low incomes  who will be deprived of, on average, £100 as a result of  this mean and petty measure, which has caused genuine  anger to many. 
<P>
The measure affects not only non-tax-paying  individuals, but charities, which will lose money as a  result of the change. We hoped that the Government  would be prepared to introduce measures to compensate  for such damage but, again, we hoped in vain. There is no  sign that they are prepared to make a move on that issue. 
<P>
I should like to touch on the timing of our deliberations  on two clauses, which relate to specific events in the next  few months. The first is clause 48, which covers the  allowances payable to Members of the Scottish  Parliament, and the Welsh and Northern Ireland  Assemblies, and is relevant to candidates standing for  election to those Assemblies. They will obviously be  aware of the Bill's proposals concerning those  allowances, but it is a pity that we shall not have debated  the clause before the elections take place. That would  have been possible if clause 48 had been discussed  earlier in our proceedings; we could then have addressed  the issue today. It would have been helpful if those who  will cast their votes this week, for the first time, for  Members of the Assemblies had been aware of our  views, and if we had been able to debate the issue before  the elections. 
<P>
<b>11.30 am </b>
<P>
The other clause relevant to events taking place in the  next few months is clause 121, which covers preparation  for economic and monetary union and which we shall  want to examine in detail. Although the measure is  small--it relates only to expenditure on computers for  the Commissioners of Inland Revenue and of Customs  and Excise--it raises substantial questions, particularly  on the legitimacy of using taxpayers' money in advance  of a decision by the British people on whether they want  the country to enter a single currency. 
<P>
We shall probably spend some time debating that issue  in general and the question of legitimacy in particular,  and the fact that taxpayers' money will be committed to a  project that the Government have said can proceed only  when the British people have voted on it. The  Government have also said that there is no prospect of  such a vote being held until after the next general  election, yet the measure is included in the Bill. 
<P>
That raises another issue. Lord Neill's report made  observations on the use of taxpayers' money in matters  of political controversy and everyone would accept that  this is a matter of considerable political controversy.  Although Lord Neill made recommendations, we have  not seen the Government's response to them. We await  the publication of draft legislation and I hope that we  shall know the Government's intentions, before we  debate clause 121. 
<P>
The Bill may be a little briefer than last year's but it  contains a huge range of important issues, which we shall  want to discuss in detail. I welcome the sittings motion  proposed by the Paymaster General and look forward to  our debates, but I am a little concerned about our  timetable. I share the hope that we should not dwell  overlong on all the Government's points, but I want to  flag up the fact that Conservative Members will want to  spend some time examining a number of the matters to  which I have referred.

<P>

<B>Mr. Stephen Dorrell (Charnwood):</B> I begin by  declaring an interest. I am chairman and a shareholder of  a family-owned business in the corporate clothing  industry. As far as I am aware, that has no impact on any  aspect of the Bill as drafted--but who can say what  amendments my hon. Friends may table--and my  interest will not be relevant to the Committee's  considerations. 
<P>
It is a great pleasure to be a member of the Finance Bill  Standing Committee with the freedom of the Back  Benches to explore the Government's true intentions and  to ask questions to which I may not know the answer. 
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I am sure that the right hon.  Gentleman did not mean to suggest that, when he was  Financial Secretary, he did not know what the  Government were up to and that the Back Benches now  offer him that liberation. Perhaps we should be a little  kinder to him. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I simply sought to celebrate the  opportunity, as a Back Bencher, to ask questions without  knowing the answers, to be able to probe the  Government's true intentions and to invite them to reveal  those intentions to the Committee and the public. I reveal  no secrets about the previous or any other Government,  but it would be a first if the Committee succeeded in  securing from the Government the whole, unvarnished  truth of their intentions on tax policy. 
<P>
I begin with a narrow, technical point on the sittings  motion. It announces that the Committee will meet on  Tuesday and Thursday mornings and afternoons. I have  always been under the impression that it was a  convention of the House that, if a sittings motion was  passed at the first sitting of the Committee, an afternoon  sitting did not take place on the same day. 
<P>
My understanding was that the Committee was  supposed to meet this afternoon. However, this morning  I received a card from the Clerk that stated that the  Committee would meet at 10.30 am, but made no  reference to the afternoon sitting. 
<P>
Given that the Committee had not accepted the  proposition to meet this afternoon, I fully understand that  omission, and I am making no criticism of the Clerk.  However, the sittings motion does not make it clear that  we are to meet this afternoon, either. I simply seek your  ruling, Mr. Butterfill, on whether the Committee will  proceed in the normal way--by accepting the sittings  motion and meeting in the morning and afternoon from  day two onwards--or whether we are to meet this  afternoon. For good order, I also ask how Committee  members are to determine whether a sittings motion is of  the old kind, which gives notice of an afternoon sitting,  or the new kind, from which we apparently must infer  notice of an afternoon sitting. 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> My understanding is that the  arrangement to meet this afternoon was made between  the usual channels, but too late for the card sent by the  Clerk to Committee members to reflect that agreement. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> Of course I expected the Committee to  meet this afternoon, and it is useful to know that it is to do  so, but we have already gone further than usual in  revealing the Government's true intentions. 
<P>
On a more substantive point, I invite the Government  to reconsider what is becoming their habitual  presentation of the March 1999 Budget. As my right hon.  and hon. Friends on the Front Bench have reminded us,  the Prime Minister is fond of hailing the Budget as  tax-cutting, and there may be some Government Back  Benchers who still believe it to be a tax-cutting Budget.  Of course, on a cursory reading of the Red Book it is  possible to conclude that the Financial Secretary--who  is, I think, still responsible for presenting the Red Book  to Parliament--believes that it is a tax-cutting Budget. 
<P>
Table 1.11 of the Red Book's "Financial Statement  and Budget Report", which appears to be the same as  table 1.3 of its "Economic and Fiscal Strategy Report",  suggests an expected tax cut for the financial year  1999-2000 of slightly more than £1 billion. However, no  interpretation of the facts contained in the document can  conclude that the tax burden in the current financial year  will be lower than that in the previous year. Therefore in  stating that they are reducing the tax burden, the  Government are presenting their tax policy dishonestly. 
<P>
I shall give two specific examples. Item 42 in table 1.3  is the hydrocarbon oil duty escalator. According to the  table, which states that there will be a £1 billion  reduction in the indexed tax base compared with the  previous year, the hydrocarbon oil duty escalator will  raise no extra tax. Anyone who believes that has not  recently purchased fuel from a garage forecourt. As set  out elsewhere in the Red Book, the Government's  explicit policy is a regular, year-by-year increase in  hydrocarbon fuel duty. 
<P>
Ministers will probably say that table 1.3, which  suggests a £1 billion tax cut, does not refer to that  increase because it has already been announced.  However, the Committee needs to know whether the  current year's tax burden is higher or lower than the  previous year's. The mere fact that that tax increase was  announced last year does not mean that it is not an  increase this year. Item 42 alone makes it clear that the  Chancellor introduced not a tax-cutting but a tax-raising  Budget. Year on year, that tax will go up, not down. 
<P>
I want to discuss another matter relating to item 42.  The table presents two analyses of the effect of a tax  during the current year--one is headed "non-indexed"  and the other is headed "indexed". The idea of an indexed  column was first used about 20 years ago, when the  inflation escalator was introduced into the tax allowance  system to assess the net effect on the economy after  taking account of inflation-linked movements in the tax  system. The hydrocarbon oil duty escalator-- 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The right hon. Gentleman will  be aware that clause 2 was debated at great length on the  Floor of the House. The Committee will not have an  opportunity to re-examine that clause's implications,  although that can be done on Report. Although I have  been tolerant of references to clause 2 in hon. Members'  opening speeches--such tolerance is a tradition in the  Finance Bill Committee--repeated reference to it is not  advisable. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> In that case, Mr. Butterfill, I shall  enlarge on my point, because I was going to use that  example to make a wider point. Taking account of  previous announcements under the heading "indexed" is  not in the spirit of the way in which indexed and  non-indexed tax assessments have been presented. There  will be a big increase in the tax burden. I am also  concerned about the fact that the table fails to distinguish  accurately between Budget changes that decrease the tax  burden and those that are, in fact, spending increases.  The clearest example is item 26, entitled: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"£100 Winter Allowance from 1999".
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
That involves increasing the pensioner allowance from  £20 to £100, and it will cost the public sector £640  million-- 
<P>
<B>Mr. Derek Twigg </B>(Halton): Is the right hon.  Gentleman in favour of that expenditure, or is he against  it? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I am more than happy to welcome it on  behalf of pensioners. However, it is not accurate to  record it in the table as a tax reduction. The English  language simply does not allow the Government to  present a payment to pensioners of £100--an extra  £80--as a tax reduction. Moreover, the payment is  described elsewhere in the Red Book not as a tax  reduction but as an extra payment. The descriptions of  the various benefits, which appear on page 102, make it  clear that the Government cannot pretend that tax  reductions are involved. 
<P>
The first item that appears under the heading "Benefits  1999-2000" is entitled "Maternity pay", but the  subsequent entry contains an interesting Freudian slip.  "Maternity pay" clearly refers to a payment, but in the  text, maternity pay miraculously becomes "Maternity  Allowance", as if those two concepts were the same.    [Mr. Dorrell] 
<P>
Presumably when the Red Book was being edited,  someone realised that the term Maternity pay" was  vulnerable to the criticism that I am making of it. 
<P>
Without seeking to transgress against your ruling, Mr.  Butterfill, I must point out that the provisions relating to  the fuel escalator and the Christmas bonus undermine the  Government's claim that during the tax year on which we  have recently embarked we shall enjoy a lower tax  burden than we had during the previous tax year. It  would be tedious to describe other such provisions, I  have simply cited the two clearest examples in the table.  In fact, we have seen a big increase in tax on fuel, and the  Christmas bonus will be an extra spending commitment,  financed by additional tax. My right hon. Friend the  Member for Wells referred to the working families tax  credit which, although shown as a tax reduction, is no  such thing, it is a spending increase. If the Government  cannot distinguish between tax reduction and spending  increases, they have no basis on which to claim that they  are a tax-cutting Government. 
<P>
<H5>11.45 am </H5>
</P>
<P>
I began by saying that I looked forward to asking the  Government to be specific about their objectives. Let us  start by encouraging them to be clear in their own mind  about the difference between a tax which they invite us to  pay and a spending commitment from which they invite  us to benefit. There is a difference. Unless that is  understood, we shall not make much progress on tax  policy. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> I welcome the fact that you are in the Chair,  Mr. Butterfill, and that we shall have the benefit of your  guidance. To avoid any doubt, I declare my interest as a  non-executive director of a business consultancy, which  I have readily declared in the Register of Members'  Interests. 
<P>
The start of a Finance Bill is an interesting process. It  is an important milestone in the progress of a Budget  because it gives legislative form to specific measures. I  acknowledge that the Paymaster General, the Economic  Secretary and the Financial Secretary, who have the task  of debating those measures, will work overtime to ensure  that they are properly prepared to answer the questions  that I hope hon. Members on both sides of the Committee  will ask. 
<P>
Although it must be recognised that the Government  have a sufficient majority to get their own way, I hope  that Ministers will not take that privilege for granted. A  key feature of the Finance Bill and the time that we  allocate for its consideration is what others outside the  House will make of what we, Ministers in particular, say.  I think that the hon. Member for North Warwickshire  (Mr. O'Brien)--who is now the Under-Secretary of  State for the Home Department--served on two Finance  Bill Committees, and on the first of them we were  entertained liberally by long quotations from legal text  that established his personal commitment to the Pepper  v. Hart judgment. That was seared into my mind. The law  is framed so that our decisions, and in particular, what  Ministers say, can be taken and used in evidence. 
<P>
When the Paymaster General was in Opposition, she  was fair and listened carefully to technical argument.  Equally, when I was Financial Secretary, I listened to  what she had to say. Sometimes we agreed and the odd  concession was made. I hope that, in the spirit of fairness,  if Committee members and--to pick up the point made  earlier by the hon. member for Croydon,  Central--practitioners and experts outside the House put  forward proposals in amendments that will improve tax  law, the Government will be prepared to acknowledge  and accept them. 
<P>
It is sad that the clauses do not contain an element of  the tax rewrite--the attempt to clarify in plain English  the tax law of this country. It is disappointing that the Bill  does not have coupled with it the first attempts to bring  aspects of that tax rewrite into law. Unfortunately, our  time will not be used to improve the transparency with  which our tax law works. 
<P>
I have a specific request. Those of us who do not have  the benefit of the incisive and in-depth briefing from the  Inland Revenue and Customs and Excise that we once  enjoyed must, like travellers on a long journey, speak to  other strangers to find out the local gossip and find out  what is going on, and thus equip ourselves to ask difficult  questions. Will Ministers consider using the power of the  internet to improve the notes on clauses? The notes on  clauses are inconsistent--those on the later clauses on  corporation tax provide helpful worked examples of how  the proposals will work, while those on VAT groupings,  which are the subject of pages of complex legislation,  leave one wondering how they will operate. The notes  are also inconsistent in how they deal with schedules; in  effect, there are no notes on the schedules. As we shall  see when we discuss clause 27, schedule 3 is utterly  crucial to the operation of the clause. The question of  how clause 27 will work in reality is not dealt with  properly in the Bill or in the notes on clauses. 
<P>
If the usual Treasury formula of six clauses a day is to  be followed, will the Paymaster General and her  colleagues anticipate our thirst for information and  provide a clearer insight into how things work? It is  legitimate for the Opposition to ask that question--the  Paymaster General will know, from her time in  opposition, that there were occasions when complex  matters required discussion and I and other colleagues  afforded her the opportunity of a Treasury briefing to  assist her in her understanding of some important  matters. We both reflected on the fact that those outside  Parliament would carefully consider what we said and  would expect us to answer their questions. 
<P>
Those of us who will not be here on Thursday 6  May--or, indeed, Thursday 10 June, which may be  rather late--and who venture on to doorsteps for  electioneering purposes, may receive some interesting  feedback about the Bill. That will increase our reservoir  of questions for the Government and encourage Labour  Members on the Committee to probe their Front Bench  Members on some of the difficulties into which they will  inevitably slide on Thursday. By midnight on Thursday,  they may be chastened by some of the local election  results--[Interruption.]

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I was not sure what the right hon. Gentleman was implying  when he started, but it is now clear. None of us will be here on 6 May or 10 June, if the motion  is agreed. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> I am grateful for you exacting clarification, Mr. Butterfill. My point was that the  experiences and messages received on 6 May by Labour Members on this Committee,  outside this Room, may better inform our debates. That may encourage them to ask their  Front-Bench Members the kind of difficult questions that they will encounter on that day. 
<P>
My right hon. Friend the Member for Charnwood put his finger on the purpose of the  legislation--it will be the precursor to an increased burden of tax on the people of the United  Kingdom. The Government have learnt something from the retail world in which it is  traditional to increase prices and then to announce a sale advertising 50 or 60 per cent. off  those prices, which gets back to normal prices. The price of a Labour Government is an  increased tax burden in the United Kingdom, and we shall tease that out during our debate on  the Bill. 
<P>
In my earlier comments I asked for clarification from the Government on how the Bill will  work. Tax practitioners benefit from tax complexity and even they have pointed out that,  while the Bill may have sacrificed something on volume--it is smaller than the first Finance  Bill that I considered in Standing Committee, which contained 220 clauses and I gave a huge  sigh of relief when I saw that the current Bill is in one volume--it has gained much in  complexity. Many tax practitioners argue that it has become an accountants' charter and that  it is a job-creation Bill for the financial services industry. There are certainly a lot of  nit-picking, anti-avoidance measures and I hope that the Government will be able to justify  them. 
<P>
The purpose of some clauses is to sort out failings in previous financial legislation. I would  be the first to acknowledge that such legislation is not always easy for the Treasury and that  measures sometimes have to be redrafted, but I hope that in framing the timetable motion the  usual channels have allowed enough time for outside representations to be properly measured  and considered, particularly if they offer ways of avoiding the need for clauses such as those  that are intended to do a repair job of our financial legislation. 
<P>
On transparency, the clause on VAT tax groupings provides a classic insight into what  typifies the presentation of the measures in the Bill and the voyage of exploration required to  discover what is happening. That clause first saw the light of day in Customs and Excise  notice C and E1 in which a summary paragraph suggested that it was a minor anti-avoidance  measure, but to discover what is really going on one had to read the notes for editors and  Budget notice 56/99, which contains a nasty little measure that gives Customs and Excise  wider powers than they want to use. I pick on that as an example, because the Government are  taking wide powers in the clause, but then say that they want to use only a small part of them.  There may be a good reason for that and I hope that the Paymaster General, the Financial  Secretary and the Economy Secretary will be able to explain the framing and formulation of  the law in that clause, because it is important that we understand it. 
<P>
Clause 33 removes tax relief on maintenance payments under pre-1988 arrangements, but  provides a windfall to recipients of such payments who had entered into agreements on the  assumption that receipts would be taxable. That may lead to all sorts of legal proceedings  with expensive costs for citizens. It represents another trend in some of the clauses that deal  with retrospection. If anything should send a chill down the spine of Treasury Ministers, it is  the threat of criticism that anything that they do should smack of retrospection. I hope that  they will explain why they have chosen in those clauses an element of retrospection. 
<H4><center>12 noon </center></H4>
<P>
I hope that the Government will make available to the Committee any general advice that  they have received. For example, clause 8 deals with the Government's effort to encourage  the development of more environmentally friendly motor cars. I applaud any measure that  improves the efficiency and operation of motor vehicles, but I cannot see the justification for  this proposal. It builds on part of a proposal in a consultation document on vehicle excise  duty, which the Chancellor put out for consultation last November, and the results of which  we have yet to see. The Government have anticipated those results by introducing part of  what will be an unknown package. I would like to hear their justification for that action. 
<P>
To examine a point in detail, there is an agreement in the European Union that the ideal  standard for carbon dioxide emissions from cars should involve vehicles capable of  producing 140g per kilometre as they travel. Some such cars now exist, but they will not  benefit from clause 8. That seems illogical, and we want to explore the matter further. 
<P>
The starting rate of 10p for income tax was the most advertised tax change in history. The  Government repeatedly talked about their "forthcoming attraction", and it has finally arrived.  However, as I said on Second Reading, research undertaken and published by the Rowntree  Foundation showed that there would be a high cost to the employment benefits of that  proposal, compared with other measures such as the working families tax credit. I hope that  the Government will publish their reasons for moving in that direction, for the benefit of the  Committee. 
<P>
It will be equally interesting to know why the Government chose to specify minibuses with  17 seats in clause 45. Those are the kind of details that we need to have explained, in order to  know whether it is appropriate for the Opposition to support or to reject a particular proposal.  However, when we examine the notes on clauses, we find that detail sadly missing. I am sure  that that will also be the case when we examine clause 27, which covers children's tax credit.  It would be useful to have a separate piece of paper explaining how that measure will work, as  some serious practical questions have already been raised on the matter. 
<P>
I hope that Ministers will also be willing to justify and explain their actions more clearly.  We had a debate on stamp duty on the Floor of the House, in which I raised a series of  questions that remain unanswered. If there is    [Mr. Jack] 
<P>
justification for such actions, let it be made clear to the  Committee. We are debating the timetable motion, and  the crucial issue is the use to which we put the time  available for scrutiny of the Bill. 
<P>
Some proposals--anti-avoidance-measuress--are  valuable in securing the tax base, as Members on both  sides of the Committee will agree. They are important,  because one man's tax avoidance is another man's  increased tax bill. The Government have decided how  much money they want to collect, and it has to be  collected from somewhere. Our attempts to plug the  leaks will safeguard the revenue pool. It is, therefore,  important that we understand what we should or should  not support in the debates. 
<P>
Like my right hon. Friend the Member for  Charnwood, I look forward to the voyage of exploration,  albeit, this time, without the benefit of the splendid  briefing that one used to receive from Inland Revenue  and Customs and Excise officials. I look forward to  asking difficult questions, to the Minister's searing  insight and to explanations in simple, plain English of  why the Government are implementing proposals that  will cause the tax burden to rise, because the  Government will be judged on those measures and, I  believe, found wanting. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> May I briefly say how pleased I  am to see you in the Chair, Mr. Butterfill, and how  pleased I am to see, for the first time in history, an  all-female Government Front Bench in Committee? This  is the third Finance Bill Committee of which I have been  a member, and it is very good to see that. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Love </B>(Edmonton): What about the  women on the other side? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> Oh yes. 
<P>
I shall not take up much of the Committee's time  because we have already spent more than one and a half  hours considering the sittings motion. We would do  better to consider the Bill, rather than meandering and  prevaricating about issues that have already been  discussed on the Floor of the House and which will be  considered later in Committee. If we had spent this time  more wisely, we could probably he discussing clause 6  by now. 
<P>
The Opposition habitually say that the Government  bulldoze through legislation, and they refer to the  Government's first Finance Bill. My recollection is that  during that Committee, the hon. Member for Daventry  (Mr. Boswell) spoke at great length about his relatives in  Wales. I did not understand the relevance of that, but it  wasted a considerable amount of time. This morning's  debate has been of some use because at least the right  hon. Member for Charnwood now knows that he should  come in this afternoon, and the right hon. Member for  Fylde knows that he need not come in on Thursday. So  the debate has been of some use in making clear to  certain Opposition Members--who, I am told, used to be  Ministers--when they should be here. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> Would the hon. Gentleman like to  predict whether we shall secure the same amount of  valuable information for every hour and a half that the  Committee sits between now and its final sitting? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I cannot offer any prediction, based on  my limited experience, and I do not want to take up any  more of the Committee's time, apart from to say, let us  get on with the Bill. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> May I also convey my good  wishes and those of my hon. Friends to you, Mr.  Butterfill, and say that it is a pleasure to serve again under  your chairmanship? I hope that I shall not have the  opportunity to test your authority too often. 
<P>
Clause 121, which relates to the euro, gives me an  opportunity to make a few remarks about the  Government's macro-economic policy. I then want to  consider the burdens placed on individuals and  businesses by the Bill and to comment on a few specific  clauses. 
<P>
The sittings motion must be considered in the context  of what the Government are trying to achieve. If the  Government are, as appears to be the case from their  proposals in clause 121, hell-bent on joining the euro, it  is incumbent on us to ask what their strategy is for joining  our economy into a cycle with the other European  economies.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Christopher Leslie </B>(Shipley): Can the hon.  Gentleman recall whether the right hon. Member for  Charnwood spoke earlier about clause 121 or said  whether we should prepare to join the euro? I am not sure  that I recall him making any statements along those lines. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I am not responsible for my right  hon. Friend's speeches; I can only be responsible for my  own. I have a few useful remarks to make about the euro.  In last year's Finance Bill, in this very Room, the  Government gave themselves the widest powers through  secondary legislation that I can ever remember any  Government ever giving themselves, so as to raise  money in relation to the euro. 
<P>
In clause 121 the Government give themselves even  more powers to raise almost any amount of money that  they want--the explanatory notes say that many millions  of pounds will need to be spent under the provision--so I  should like to ask them what their macro-economic  policy on joining the euro is. If the Bank of England has  the sole duty to manage monetary policy to meet an  inflation target, rather than to bring our economy into  cycle with European economies, one wonders when, and  at what rate, we shall be capable of joining the euro on a  sensible basis. We shall want to tease out answers from  the Government in that respect. 
<P>
The Bill will place burdens on individuals. Does it  constitute a fiscal tightening or loosening? Since the  Budget, much has been written on that matter in the  financial press. There is a great deal of obfuscation in the  Red Book, particularly about the way in which large  sums of money relating to the working families tax credit  and mortgage interest relief at source will be treated.  Will the tax base be secured? I have tabled such a  question to the Treasury, so if an answer is not    forthcoming now, perhaps I shall get one later. In  considering a Finance Bill, we are obliged to ask the  Government what they mean by tax, allowance and  expenditure. They have a duty to explain clearly, and the  public have a right to know, their thinking on those  matters. 
<P>
We want to examine the burdens that the Bill will  impose on individuals. The Government are encouraging  increasing numbers of people to fill in self-assessment  forms. It would he interesting to know how many of  those forms are returned in time for the Revenue to make  their calculations, and how many are returned after that  time, on the basis that the calculations are made by the  individuals themselves. Every Finance Bill--this one is  no exception--makes the burden of completing a  self-assessment form greater. 
<P>
I refer in particular to the clauses on capital gains tax.  During our consideration of last year's Finance Bill, we  found that the difficulties associated with computing  capital gains tax--which, compared to income tax or  corporation tax, does not yield a huge amount of  money--had been greatly exacerbated. In the current  Bill, no attempt whatever is made to reduce the burden  placed on individuals in respect of calculating capital  gains tax. We shall examine the relevant clauses in detail,  and I hope that the Government will have something to  say, in due course. 
<P>
The Bill makes a number of unfortunate omissions.  The Chancellor announced on Budget day that any  changes to the shipping tax regime would be put out for  consultation. The Government have already had two  years in which to consult, and it is disappointing to  discover that the Bill contains no tax, national insurance  or other measures that would help our ailing shipping  industry. 
<P>
I am reminded at this point to declare some interests. I  have property and farming interests that the Bill may  affect, and my family has shipping interests--although I  do not, I believe, benefit from them by one penny. 
<P>
The Government will say that the shipping industry's  decline has occurred over many years, but that is no  excuse. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Barry Gardiner </B>(Brent, North): Will the hon.  Gentleman give way? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> In a minute--I want the hon.  Gentleman to understand my point clearly. I hope that  the Government will not waste the Committee's time by  saying, "It's entirely the Opposition's fault that  such-and-such happened." The Government have been  in power for almost two years, and it is clear that they will  be responsible for the measures in the Bill. We look to  them to make changes that will benefit individuals and  the economy. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Gardiner:</B> On the question of tonnage-based tax,  the Government have no need to argue that the past 18  years of Conservative government were responsible for  the decline of the British shipping industry; the shipping  industry makes that case quite ably. Nevertheless,  although I support the setting up of Lord Alexander's  committee to investigate in great detail the principles of a  tonnage-based tax, the Government should, before  committing themselves to a measure that would have  substantial revenue implications, explore-- 
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Interventions must be brief.  We are not debating a specific clause. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I was waiting for the hon.  Gentleman to be called to order, because he was tying  himself up in knots. If ever an excuse was offered for the  Government's fiddling while Rome burns--they are  watching our shipping industry go downhill--that was it.  The Government have had two years to do something. In  debating this shipping's motion--a Freudian slip of the  tongue-- 
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> Shipping forecast. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> My right hon. Friend says  shipping forecast. I could go further, but I might get into  deep trouble. 
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Maldon and East  Chelmsford also mentioned the clauses on the Scottish  Parliament. It is odd not to debate the allowances and  expenditure for Members of the Scottish Parliament,  Welsh Assembly and Northern Ireland Assembly just a  few days before the elections. It would make eminent  good sense to amend the order of consideration to bring  forward those clauses for debate this afternoon. That  would give candidates in the Scottish parliamentary  elections, which will take place later this week, an  opportunity to know the terms and conditions of their  service before they stand. Members of the Government  might be so disappointed with the rates of pay and  allowances that they drop out of the elections, which  might be a good thing. 
<P>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Maldon and East  Chelmsford said, we will be examining the drafting of  the clauses. We are disappointed that none of the tax  rewrite suggestions and recommendations are in the Bill.  A number of clauses are very clumsily drafted, notably  those that attempt to close some of the loopholes that  were created by last year's Finance Bill. Those errors are  therefore compounded in this Bill. We intend to examine  that in great detail. One clause repeats, on the same page,  the definition of a trade and of a profession. 
<P>
I hope that the Government will be sympathetic to our  amendments. It ill behoves the Committee to produce  bad legislation. This is not a political point; we are trying  to improve legislation. Tax practitioners, who have to  work day in and day out with tax legislation, need a  regime that is as simple and practical to operate as  possible, given the Government's majority and their  determination to get their policy accepted. 
<P>
I hope that the Government will say how the Bill fits in  with macro economic policy, and where they intend to go  in future. Assurances were given by the Paymaster  General in Committee last year on long-term rates of  corporation tax. That set a good precedent and we should  like more long-term assurances. Indeed, on Third  Reading, I called for  similar assurances on stamp duty.  There is no harm in announcing the Government's policy  in advance so that the property industry and other    [Mr. Clifton-Brown] 
<P>
interested parties have an idea of the Government's  medium and longer-term thinking on tax. The previous  Government introduced a "tax and spend" debate in  November. I am sorry that we have returned to the old  system of an expenditure announcement in November  and a Budget in March. The Bill is inconsistent because  many of the enactments come into effect on different  dates. The Budget was held on 9 March, when many of  the changes in excise duties came into effect, but an array  of other changes came into effect on other dates. For  example, the change in gaming duty came in on 1 April,  but the change in pool betting duty came in on 29 March.  People must try to interpret the Bill and work out the  regulations. Is there any reason why the change in pool  betting duty could not have been introduced on 1 April  when the change in gaming duty was introduced? It  would be so much easier for those who must use the Bill  to have the same dates of implementation whenever  possible. 
<P>
Some of the regulations covering vehicle excise duty  will be introduced on 1 June 1999, but the bulk of them  were retrospective to 1 January 1999. The Government  should introduce some harmony to make it easier for  those who must operate the provisions of the Bill. 
<P>
I have said all that is necessary at this stage, but I look  forward to many weeks under your chairmanship, Mr.  Butterfill, I hope that the Committee will be constructive  and that we shall obtain some clear answers from the  Government. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick St. Aubyn </B>(Guildford): I, too, welcome you  to the Chair, Mr. Butterfill, and I look forward to your  guidance in the weeks ahead. This is an historic moment  because we have three women on the Government Front  Bench. I welcome them, but I am not the only member of  the Committee who will miss the unique insight of the  former Paymaster General from his pad in Park Lane.  One cannot help noticing that the Government Front  Bench has changed from the Grosvenor house gang to  Gordon's groupies. I hope that, with their more sober  approach to tax policy, which is reflected in the first  clause, our proceedings in the next few weeks will not be  too dull. 
<P>
I am concerned about how we debate Finance Bills.  We always seem to debate the most interesting matters  last. In many ways, the most interesting matters are the  new clauses. Mercifully, the Bill is shorter than last year  and Government revenue will change by only £570  million in the coming year, so it was a mouse of a Budget.  More than half of its fiscal impact will be felt after the  next general election, by which time different  considerations will apply.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman is talking  about the order of consideration. There is a motion,  which we may come to today, if we are fortunate, which  covers that matter. 
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I am grateful to you, Mr. Butterfill for  making that clear. 
<P>
We have a problem with the Bill because of the  amount of Treasury decision-making that will be done in  regulations. We shall not have a chance to see the full  picture, Mr. Butterfill, unless you and your co-Chairman  allow our debates to range widely. For example, it is  evident that the changes in the rate of national insurance  contributions must be considered alongside the proposed  changes to income tax. When we debate the changes to  income tax, I hope that we shall be allowed to range over  that area. 
<P>
It is striking that, despite the Government's  protestations, there will be a very high marginal rate of  tax for those earning between the minimum wage and  double the minimum wage. The marginal rate of tax,  when account is taken of national insurance  contributions, will be around 70 per cent. or more. It is  striking that many of the illustrations in the Red Book  focus only on single-earner families. The impact on  some two-earner families will be even more than 70 per  cent. I hope that before we debate those clauses, the  Treasury will explain the impact of the new proposals on  a single-earner family. What will happen if a second  member of that family wants to take up a job? I know  from my experience--I should declare an interest as the  chairman and owner of a joinery company--that it is  getting harder to persuade a potential worker who  belongs to a single-earner family to take on a job. 
<P>
What analysis has the Treasury made of the impact of  this very high marginal effective rate of income tax on  wage differentials? My business and others pay our  employees quite a lot more than the minimum wage and  we are concerned that the knock-on effect of the  minimum wage legislation will be that other wages will  be forced up. Do the Government intend to maintain an  effective high marginal rate of tax for salary levels that  are above the minimum wage, in order to mitigate the  pressure to restore wage differentials? They might argue  that the fight and the cost involved in achieving such a  restoration would not be worth the candle because the  measure had been taxed out of existence. 
<P>
That brings me to a more general point. During last  year's Finance Bill Committee, the Government said  time and again that various Conservative proposals  would cost so many billions of pounds, and they tried to  tot up such fictitious figures to a total of tens of billions of  pounds, which they said would have to come from  somewhere. Most, if not all, of our proposals last year  involved tax reductions, and they will do so this year.  There is a major difference between a tax reduction and a  spending commitment. During the previous Parliament,  Labour Members time and again made excessive  spending commitments in Budget debates and in the  relevant Finance Bill Committee, which meant extra  taxation. On the other hand, the previous Government  cut tax rates, which meant that more revenue was  generated. 
<P>
One need not be a disciple of the Laffer curve to  recognise that a lower rate of tax stimulates economic  activity and creates a bigger tax base. Many of our  proposals involve generating a bigger tax base by  increasing prosperity and developing a saner tax system.    This afternoon, we shall debate the taxation level on  tobacco. The Government's own figures show that their  higher rates of duty will raise £1 billion less revenue for  the Exchequer. I hope that we hear nothing this year of  the tens of billions of pounds that Conservative proposals  would cost. Our proposals involve cuts. Tax  adjustments, after all, will simply restore the position to  roughly what it was in May 1997, before the Government  started breaking their key election pledge that there  would be no tax increases. That is the simple background  to our debate. I hope that the Government will respond to  our proposals carefully. 
<P>
Corporation tax provides a classy example. The  Government's spin involved arguing that they were  cutting corporation tax to the lowest levels ever.  However, during the previous Government's 18 years in  office, the rate was reduced from 52 per cent. to 33 per  cent., which corresponded to a tenfold increase in the  revenue raised from corporation tax. That shows what  can be achieved by following policies of low taxation  and by widening the prosperity of the economy's tax  base. 
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
I should like to join my hon. Friends in highlighting  the nature of clause 121. I note that it might breach the  terms of the Neill committee, and perhaps also the terms  of the declaration on the front of the Bill, where the  Chancellor of the Exchequer tells us that the provisions  of the Bill are compatible with the European convention  on human rights. As I understand it, one of the  convention rights involves the protection of property.  We should not have protection of property if there were  unlimited Government expenditure, and potentially  unlimited Government taxation. 
<P>
It would be wrong of the Government to represent  themselves as complying with the convention on human  rights, when measures such as clause 121--although it is  a minor example--take away people's rights to  representation in cases where tax issues are debated.  Such cases should be scrutinised properly, in Committee  and on the Floor of the House. Instead, more and more  spending will be authorised behind closed doors, for  party political purposes. I therefore look forward to the  debate on that clause. 
<P>
I hope that we shall have time to debate new clauses.  Last year, we managed to engineer a debate on the tax on  art, even though debate on value added tax is generally  limited during deliberations on Finance Bills. I hope that  it will be possible this year to re-examine the relief that  might be given to the art trade, given that we are now  little more than a month away from the increase in VAT  on sales of works art--an increase that the Government  have done little to prevent. We want reassurance that the  Government have the matter in hand, so that the art  market in this country, which employs more than 5,000  people whose jobs will be directly affected, will be able  to look to the future with confidence--something that  they cannot do at present. 
<P>
Clauses 59 to 63 relate to securities and investments,  and I hope that we shall have the opportunity to debate  the impact of the proposed withholding tax on securities,  either during our debates on those clauses or through a  new clause. That impact would be devastating: tens of  thousands of jobs would be at risk if a withholding tax on  investments and securities were allowed to slip through  because of the weakness of the Government, who have,  until recently, vacillated on the issue. 
<P>
That would be a classic example of a proposal  purporting to be a tax-raising measure and an attack on  tax avoidance, having precisely the opposite effect  through loss of revenue and loss of business. Revenues to  the Exchequer would decrease dramatically, which  proves my point that when proposed changes to the tax  system would, according to Treasury calculations, mean  a reduction in revenue, the full picture cannot be seen and  the figures cannot be topped up in a simplistic way. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick Gibb  Bognor Regis and Littlehampton): I  welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Butterfill. We saw a brief  glimpse of your chairmanship during our deliberations  on clause 99, in Committee on the Floor of the House. I  am sure that we shall have a fair and ordered  chairmanship from you and Mr. Cook during our  proceedings. </B><P>
<P>
I welcome not only the new Members on the  Opposition Benches, but the new additions to the  Government Benches. We look forward to their  involvement in the proceedings. The press are taking an  increasing interest in the speeches made by Labour Back  Benchers, and there is no excuse for their not becoming  fully involved in the Committee's deliberations. There is  no shortage of speaking time. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman agree  with the maxim, better a nodding donkey than a silly ass? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> It takes one to know one. 
<P>
As my right hon. Friend the Member for Charnwood  said, the Government's explanations of the  consequences of their tax changes are becoming less  clear. In the light of that almost deliberate lack of clarity,  the Committee's importance in determining the Bill's  impact is enhanced. Considerable time will be needed to  deal with such concerns, and I am delighted that a tax  specialist from PriceWaterhouseCoopers has been  seconded to provide Conservative Front-Bench  Committee members with technical support. As such, I  am registering an interest on behalf of a number of  Opposition Committee members. 
<P>
In the fourth report of the Select Committee on the  Treasury on the Budget, HC 325, Kate Barker, from the  Confederation of British Industry, said that "most of the  information" in the Red Book "can be gleaned  eventually", but called for a clearer presentation to 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"facilitate analysis and lead to more accurate comment and reporting."
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
She also expressed the hope the presentation of such  information 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"will be improved for the new Millennium, so that all the new  measures, including those not mentioned in the Budget speech, can be  identified more readily."
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
As my right hon. Friend the Member for Charnwood  said, table 1.11, on pages 112 and 113 of the Red Book, is  very confusing. The Select Committee on the Treasury  identified all items in table 1.11, which are not tax    
<P>
I am concerned about whether 20 minutes is sufficient time to discuss a clause that will  impact on thousands of jobs. Professionals are also concerned about the appeals procedure  arising from the clause and the retrospective nature of the proposed legislation. The  Committee also has 20 minutes to discuss clause 25, which introduces a new 10 per cent.  corporation tax rate for the first £10,000 of profit and results in higher marginal rates due to  the working of the taper. Again, a concern exists that that may be an inducement for small  businesses to incorporate.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Davies:</B> How can the hon. Gentleman claim that 20 minutes is not sufficient when the  Committee has been discussing the sittings motion for two hours and 10 minutes? His point is  absurd. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The hon. Gentleman is wrong. Important issues have been raised, and without  such detailed discussion we may be unable to concentrate on the most important clauses later.  Twenty minutes is not sufficient to discuss important clauses, such as clause 27, which deals  with the children's tax credit. As the hon. Member for Redditch (Jacqui Smith) pointed out in  the proceedings of the Treasury Committee, clause 27 undermines the principle of  independent taxation, which should concern all hon. Members. The Chancellor himself knew  nothing about clause 33, which deals with maintenance payments. If the clause had not even  been scrutinised by the Chancellor and other Ministers, there is a bigger onus on the  Committee to scrutinise it in detail. It will affect 15,000 fathers catastrophically and 200,000  significantly. 
<P>
Clause 35, on the abolition of mortgage interest relief at source, will cost people £200 a  year in higher income tax. All that from a Government who said, when they came to power,  that they did not need to raise taxes at all. 
<P>
Clause 42 reflects the absurdity created by the Government's incompetent attempt to  clarify the legislation on benefits in kind relating to taking computers home. A concern exists  that if a director of a company takes home a computer it could nullify the tax relief on the  taking home of computers. With regard to work buses, to which my right hon. Friend the  Member for Fylde referred, why do the Government specify 17 seats? Why do they not  specify 12 seats, as proposed by the Institute of Directors, or nine seats, as proposed by the  Institute of Chartered Accountants? 
<P>
With regard to clause 50 on reverse premiums, the Institute of Directors believes that the  clause will effectively result in a tax on pension funds. That would be yet another tax on  pension funds, in addition to the £5 billion a year tax in the July 1997 Budget. An Inland  Revenue letter, which is circulating among professionals in the City and elsewhere, sets out  an interpretation of the clause that differs from the wording in the Bill and in the notes on  clauses. That is unacceptable. A copy of that letter should be given to all Committee  members, so that we can see the Government's true interpretation of the clause. 
<P>
We also have only 20 minutes to discuss clause 51 on gifts in kind to charities. The clause  would mean that off-cuts, such as wood or metal, as a result of the manufacturing process,  would not count. Why do they not count? Why have the Government drafted a Bill that makes  such an omission? The Committee must scrutinise that. We need sufficient time to ensure that  incompetent drafting is clarified and that no constitutional issues, such as the circulation of  Inland Revenue letters, are at stake. 
<P>
Clause 80 gives more powers to the Inland Revenue with regard to quarterly corporation  tax payments. We must ensure that giving powers to executive bodies of Government is right,  justified and necessary. The Revenue must not merely be given more powers to go on fishing  expeditions within the corporate sector and, therefore, to impose ever-higher burdens on  business.  
<P>
There are 17 clauses and seven schedules--nearly 36  pages--on stamp duty. Those provisions raise huge  concerns in the property industry and in business  generally, especially among small businesses. There is  enormous concern in the unit trust industry in the City of  London. 
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
It is important that the Committee should give full  scrutiny to these measures, which could lead to  businesses being driven overseas. These anti-avoidance  measures use a sledgehammer to crack a nut, and are  precisely the sort of legislation that this Committee was  established to expose. We need sufficient time to enable  us to do that, and I hope that as our proceedings continue,  we shall ensure that the Bill is given the detailed scrutiny  that it needs. 
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I thank the hon. Member for  Bognor Regis and Littlehampton for his kind and  generous welcome to the Financial Secretary, the  Economic Secretary and myself. I know that we can  always rely on the hon. Gentleman to be kind, generous  and helpful, and I look forward to the good humour and  light touch for which he has become so well known in  previous Finance Bills. 
<P>
I say to the hon. Members for Guildford (Mr. St.  Aubyn) and for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown), who  could possibly imagine that proceedings on the Finance  Bill Committee would be dull when we may enjoy such  fascinating contributions? I congratulate all Opposition  Members for laying out so clearly why they want to  discuss all the clauses at once, rather than considering the  Bill in a logical way. Another fascinating point about this  morning's discussion is that never has  PriceWaterhouseCoopers received so many free adverts  for its participation in the Finance Bill. 
<P>
In absolute fairness to the right hon. Member for  Fylde, I must say that throughout proceedings on  previous Finance Bills, when he was Financial Secretary  and I was on the Opposition Benches, he was always fair  and generous. That is not meant to embarrass him  because it is a serious point. He provided a model of how  Front-Bench Members should behave in order to get  Government business through. He is quite right to say  that he had to do that without a majority whereas we have  a substantial majority. None the less, his point about  scrutiny is important. We know how difficult it is to be in  opposition because we were in that position for a long  time--it is tough. We are eternally grateful that we no  longer have to do it and that we have the good offices of  the Inland Revenue and Customs and Excise to assist us. 
<P>
Therefore, my hon. Friends and I shall be as fair to the  right hon. Gentleman and his colleagues as they always  were to us when we were in opposition and we shall use  the same standards of disclosure. The right hon.  Gentleman offered advance briefings in relation to  double taxation treaties and also loan arrangements, but I  shall not go into that because it was a fraught time for the  Conservative Administration. That facility is still offered  in relation to double taxation treaties, and it is a tribute to  the right hon. Gentleman who started the practice  because it is a very good principle. 
<P>
I move on to some of the other points that have been  made about the best way to ensure thorough scrutiny.  Hopefully, it will not take Opposition Members as long  to decide that they want to debate the clauses in order as it  has taken them to decide whether they want to sit in  Committee at all. We shall do all that we can to assist  them by clarifying their misunderstandings and trying to  assist hon. Members, such as the right hon. Member for  Charnwood, to understand the answer to the  question--even if he did not understand the question in  the first place. 
<P>
We have spent a great deal of time on the sittings  motion, and I urge the Committee now to start work on  the detailed consideration of the Finance Bill, as  Opposition Members have implored us to do. 
<P>
Question put and agreed to. 
<P>
Resolved, 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>That, during proceedings on the Finance Bill, the Committee do  meet on Tuesdays at half-past Ten o'clock and at half-past Four  o'clock and on Thursdays at Nine o'clock and at half-past Four  o'clock, except on Thursday 13 May when the Committee shall meet  at half-past Two o'clock only and on Thursday 6 May and Thursday 10  June when the Committee shall not meet.

<B>The Chairman:</B> Before we proceed, I have a few  announcements to make. Copies of the Ways and Means  resolutions on which the Bill is founded are in the  Committee Room. In view of the resolutions of the  House relating to the declaration of interests, right hon.  and hon. Members are required to declare a relevant  interest when they table amendments, as well as when  they speak to them. Copies of the rules are available from  the Clerk. I also warn Committee members that they  must not breach the rules on advocacy. 
<P>
As usual, because of the quantity of paperwork, green  boxes are available to store papers between sittings.  They are lurking in the Cupboard. The boxes will be  locked in the Cupboard when the Committee is not  sitting. 
<P>
I draw attention to the fact that adequate notice must  be given of amendments. Neither I nor my co-Chairman,  Mr. Frank Cook, will, as a rule, call starred amendments,  including those reached during an afternoon sitting. 
<P>
When I am chairing the Committee, jackets may be  removed because it gets hot. We are blessed with a  cooling breeze this morning, but I know from experience  that that is not always the case. However, the Committee  must ask my co-Chairman whether he shares that view. I  suspect that he does. 
<P>
I welcome right hon. and hon. Members to the  Committee. This is my 12th or, possibly, 13th Finance  Bill Committee. I hope that its good traditions will be  maintained. Those who are new to the Committee will  know that it is a unique institution. Those of us who have  served on it for many years--we used to be called the old  lags--know that it is an introduction to Parliamentary  masochism.  [The Chairman] 
<P>
In accordance with tradition, I have been fairly lenient  and allowed Committee members to go wide in the  discussion on the sittings motion. I warn the Committee  that I may not be as lenient when we discuss the detail of  clauses. 
<P>
Resolved, 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>That the Order in which proceedings in Standing Committee on the  Finance Bill are to be taken shall be Clause 1, Clauses 3 to 9, Schedule  1. Clauses 10 to 13, Schedule 2, Clauses 14 to 27, Schedule 3, Clauses  29 to 35, Schedule 4, Clauses 36 to 48, Schedule 5, Clauses 49 and 50,  Schedule 6, Clauses 51 to 65, Schedule 7, Clause 66, Schedule 8,  Clause 67, Schedule 9, Clauses 68 to 70, Schedule 10, Clauses 71 to  84, Schedule 11, Clauses 85 to 97, Schedule 12, Clause 98, Clauses  100 and 101, Schedules 13 and 14, Clause 102, Schedules 15 and 16,  Clause 103, Schedule 17, Clause 104, Schedule 18, Clauses 105 to  108, Schedule 19, Clauses 109 to 129, New Clauses, New Schedules,  Schedule 20.--

<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> I beg to move amendment No.  10, in page 1, line 17, leave out "£161.20" and insert  "£45.101". 
<P>
It is a great privilege for the second year running to  move the first amendment in Committee. I am sure,  however, that it is no coincidence that Conservative  Members have left me only a short time before we break  for lunch. 
<P>
The amendment allows us to revisit last year's  enlightening debate on sparkling cider and perry. I  suggest that Committee members read it because it was  amusing. The right hon. Member for Wells told us how a  constituent had advised him that a certain cloudy cider  would

<P>
 
<P>
Other Conservative Members mounted a tirade  against Italian Lambrusco. The hon. Member for Crewe  and Nantwich (Mrs. Dunwoody), who was the  Committee Chairman last year, explained her interest in  cider. We had an engaging debate, which I shall not  rehearse today. 
<P>
We are concerned about two matters, namely, the  proposed size and speed of the increase in the duty, and  the continuing unwillingness of Customs and Excise to  review how to resolve the infraction proceedings against  this country. Last year, we discussed the fact that the  current approach harshly hits a small number of cider  makers. 
<P>
The explanatory notes summarise the Government's  approach. The Italian Government initiated infraction  proceedings against the United Kingdom Government a  few years ago because the UK's low tax on sparkling  premium ciders, relative to the duty on weaker sparkling  wines, primarily discriminated against Italian wine  makers. The solution that Customs and Excise officials  agreed with the Commission--I believe that the right  hon. Member for Wells was in the Treasury at the  time--was to level up the rates in a regulation that tightly  defined those UK drinks to which the higher duty would  apply. Rightly, the aim was to specify as far as possible  those drinks that would be affected. 
<P>
Last year I quoted from the regulation, and it would be  appropriate to do so again. On 5 May 1998 I said at  column 28 that the regulation results from the 1996  Budget and that it states that there should be a separate  rate of duty for 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"sparkling cider and perry defined as exceeding 5.5 per cent.  alcohol by volume (abv) but less than 8.5 per cent. alcohol abv which  is contained in bottles with 'mushroom stoppers' held in place by ties  or fastening, or which has an excess pressure due to carbon dioxide  solution of three bar or more.
<P>

<P>
The Paymaster General, when she was Financial  Secretary to the Treasury, replied to my speech. She  concentrated on the notion that I had not understood the  infraction proceedings. I was aware of them, but the  force of my argument last year was about whether the  regulation could be more tightly drawn or whether a different approach could be adopted that would stop the  infraction proceedings from going ahead, but which  would protect cider makers. 
<P>
I may have been intoxicated by the privilege of  moving amendment No. 1 last year, or perhaps I was  swayed by the force of the argument of the then Financial  Secretary to the Treasury, but, by the end of the debate, I  was convinced by her argument. On reflection, as I  sobered up in the cold light of day, I began to see some  holes in her argument. I have been compelled to review  my generous reaction to last year's debate and to return  to the matter. The increase in the duty is extremely  large--almost 400 per cent. in a year. I am sure that  Committee members are aware that when such a large  increase is introduced in any year, we need to ask  whether it is appropriate or whether it would require too  much adjustment in the tax system too quickly. 
<P>
Cider makers have been aware of the matter for  several years, but I am not sure whether they were aware  that there would be such a staggering increase in one  year. Why have the Government, who have adopted the  previous Government's cause of ending the infraction  proceedings against this country, suddenly decided to  take all the appropriate action in one year? Has pressure  been exerted by the Italian Government? If so, we should  be told. Is the increase, as the explanatory notes state, the  "final step"? Has the gap been closed, and was it really as  large as the increase suggests? Can the Government  justify its size? Was it necessary to raise the duty by such  a huge amount in one year to end the infraction  proceedings? Is there another agenda behind the  Government's approach? Are they involved in horse  trading in relation to other EU tax matters--
