							<b class="B">Mr.
Nigel Waterson</b> (Eastbourne) (Con): Good morning, Mr
Taylor. Welcome to week two of the Committee. I am sure that the time
is flying by. It falls to me to respond to what in many ways has been a
fascinating debate on this group of amendments. I will try to do so
fairly briefly. It is worth just commenting at the outset that both the
Minister and the hon. Member for Yeovil tried a little too hard to
justify the fact that neither of their parties, unlike ours, fought the
last election on restoring the link with earnings. I should perhaps
remind the Committee that we got there first.</div>
					<a name="07013040000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">For the record, as the Minister
seemed a bit confused about this, we remain in favour of restoring the
link with earnings. We agree with the Government that it must be
affordable&#151;not a word that appears very often in the Liberal
Democrat lexicon. The point was made last week, I think by the hon.
Member for Yeovil, that this use of the increase of the state pension
age as a kind of smokescreen for putting off the day of restoring the
link seems to be a very recent addition to the Government&#146;s
armoury on this issue. We think that this is a bit of an afterthought
and an excuse. I do not intend to press amendments Nos. 1 and 2 to a
Division. We have made our points on those.</div>
					<a name="07013040000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was fascinated to hear what
the Minister had to say about amendment No. 3 and his suggestion that
it amounted to a spending commitment of &#163;1 billion, although
that is dwarfed by the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for
Northampton, North which would cost &#163;14 billion. One wonders how
that figure is reached. Certainly we would take out the words
&#147;up or down&#148; by removing the whole of that subsection,
but how can the Minister look into a crystal ball and decide that this
will be the cost in future? That will be determined by future changes
in average earnings and the extent to which levelling up or down
arises. Perhaps he was pulling my leg. I am a good sport, so I will
take it in the spirit in which it was intended. In any event, it will
be a relief to him and to the Chancellor that I do not intend to press
amendment No. 3 to a vote
either.</div>
					<a name="07013040000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am, however,
minded to press amendment No. 4, and I was emboldened by what the hon.
Member for Yeovil had to say on the subject. This is one of a series of
amendments promoted, to give credit where credit is due, by
Mr. David Yeandle of the Engineering Employers Federation,
who has been very helpful on many aspects of this Bill. The Minister
went to enormous lengths to deal with the points made by the hon.
Member for Yeovil about putting in an alternative to &#147;of
earnings and prices&#148;. To some extent, I understand the reason
for that, but his only arguments against amendment No. 4 appeared to be
the need for flexibility. Well, flexibility is very nice when one has a
credit card or is going on holiday, but I doubt whether it is a key
function of pensions legislation.</div>
					<a name="07013040000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister cited the fact
that for one brief period in late 1998 and early 1999, the Office for
National Statistics suspended publication of this particular index. It
seems to us that he is getting over-anxious about this. If some ghastly
development were to occur so that this index was no longer used, it
would be a matter of a moment for that future Government to pass brief
legislation to deal with the issue. The Minister said rather
delphically:</div>
					<a name="07013040000346"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
point is that different circumstances may call for the use of different
uprating measures&#148;.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column153" />Column number: 154</div>
					<a name="07013040000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">He then talked about the
flexibility</div>
					<a name="07013040000347"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to enable us
to adapt to technical changes or different approaches if we need
to.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07013040000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, he got
back on track when he
confirmed:</div>
					<a name="07013040000348"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
have made it clear that we intend to use that
index&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;[Official Report, Pensions Public Bill
Committee,
						</i>25 January 2007; cc.
145-6.]&#151;</div>
					<a name="07013040000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">that index being
the earnings index set out in my amendment.</div>
					<a name="07013040000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">There comes a point in every
Committee on every Bill at which the Minister says, &#147;Well we
intend to do that, but we do not want to put it in the Bill.&#148;
The Opposition say, &#147;Why not put it in the Bill if that is what
you intend?&#148;. The whole ballet goes round and round in circles.
Given that the Minister has confirmed his clear intention to use that
particular index, we cannot see any good reason why that should not be
in the Bill. I will urge hon. Members to support amendment No 4 in due
course.</div>
					<a name="07013040000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						With
all due respect, the Minister did not deal seriously with my amendment
No. 78. The amendment is still valid and important. It would require
the Secretary of State to make an announcement about the intention to
implement the restoration of the link &#147;on or
before&#148; 5 April 2009. I was pretty open in my purpose,
which was to ensure that, prior to the most likely date for the next
general election, the Government should come clean on the issue. I find
it inexplicable that they would do anything else. As I said, I even
think it possible that the Chancellor, in his first 100 days, might see
this as one of his eye-catching initiatives. I am sure that I also
speak for the hon. Member for Yeovil, but the Opposition parties will
absolutely have something in their manifestos about this, so it is a
bit puzzling that the governing party is not prepared to make that
commitment.</div>
					<a name="07013040000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						For
the reasons given, the debate is a bit academic, because I am sure that
things will be made clear. Particularly if the Government continue to
be behind in the opinion polls, they will want to say something warm
and cuddly about pensions. Announcing the date of restoration of the
link strikes me as something that they could not avoid doing, unless it
is completely off the agenda because the economy is in such a state by
then.</div>
					<a name="07013040000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">So,
Mr. Taylor, I would like to give notice that, at the
appropriate moment, I would like to press both amendments Nos. 4 and 78
to a
vote.</div>
					
					<a name="07013040000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07013040000389"></a>The
Chairman:
						</b> Order. The Minister has responded to the debate
in the main. He wishes to respond briefly to the comments made by the
hon. Member for
Eastbourne.</div>
					
					<a name="07013040000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07013040000390"></a>The
Minister for Pensions Reform (James Purnell):
						</b> Thank you,
Mr. Taylor. It is a pleasure to be serving under your
chairmanship this morning. I respect the right of the hon. Gentleman to
press his amendments, but I will ask my colleagues to resist. I will
pick up on a couple of his points, which I did not cover earlier in the
debate.</div>
					<a name="07013040000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The
hon. Member for Eastbourne tried to say that we were confused about
Conservative policy on uprating. That is slightly tendentious, if I may
say so. Even today, he still did not clarify whether his party&#146;s
policy is that the state pension should be uprated with earnings from
now, which is what his shadow Secretary of State said 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column154" />Column number: 155</div>on Second Reading. The hon. Member for Eastbourne failed to say whether
that was the Conservatives&#146; policy or not. If anyone&#146;s
policy is confused, it is the Conservative party&#146;s. At least the
Liberal Democrats&#146; policy is clear&#151;they will just spend,
spend, spend. What we do not know is whether the hon. Member for
Eastbourne agrees with his shadow Secretary of State; he has not
resolved that confusion
today.</div>
					<a name="07013040000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						On
the &#163;1 billion, I do not have a crystal ball, but there are
analysts in the Department for Work and Pensions who do and who have
looked at the precise wording of his amendment. I made it clear that I
was sure that the Conservatives&#146; intention in tabling that
amendment was not to cause an increase in expenditure, but that would
be a result of the compound increases of 10p on a yearly
basis.</div>
					<a name="07013040000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The
hon. Gentleman is trying to come up with new arrangements for
specifying the amount of earnings. He is right that one always comes to
a moment in Committee when the Opposition say, &#147;Put it in the
Bill&#148;, and the Government say, &#147;That is our intention
anyhow, so it is unnecessary.&#148; The existing arrangements have
worked well. They have worked well with pension credit. There has not
been an issue of substance caused by the proposals, so maintaining the
flexibility which the current legislation gives us and which is mapped
into the new arrangements from the current legislation is more
appropriate. I say, &#147;If it isn&#146;t broke, why try and fix
it?&#148; I urge my colleagues to
agree.</div>
					<a name="07013040000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, the
hon. Gentleman said that I had not addressed his argument on amendment
No. 78. I thought that I had. What the Conservatives and Liberal
Democrats put in their manifestos is obviously up to them, but I would
treat cautiously an attempt by the hon. Member for Eastbourne to write
my party&#146;s manifesto, although I am sure that he would like to
do that. As much as I have great respect for him, however, I am not
sure that he would necessarily do with it what we would
want.</div>
					<a name="07013040000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">So the truth is
that we have a clear policy on the matter, which is set out in the
White Paper and legislated for in the Bill. The hon. Gentleman might
not agree with it, but we believe that it is the right approach and,
therefore, I urge my colleagues to resist the
amendment.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07013040000406"></a>Mr.
Laws:
						</b> Mr. Taylor, it is a pleasure to serve
under your chairmanship again. I say good morning to all Committee
members. Mr. Taylor, you will recall that I held back from
making a long and detailed speech on the last cluster of amendments, in
the knowledge that we would have a great opportunity this morning to
discuss those now before us. Obviously, I did not want to repeat
myself.</div>
					<a name="07013040000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendments
deal with some of the issues touched on by the hon. Member for
Eastbourne when he spoke to the last set of amendments, and they deal
in a bit more detail with the timing of the restoration of the earnings
link. They raise other interesting issues about affordability, the
implications of delaying restoration and the extent to which
restoration of the link is inextricably linked to increasing the basic
state pension ages.</div>
					<a name="07013040000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
had better begin, however, with an admission. There comes a time in the
consideration of every such Bill when a scantily resourced Opposition
spokesman must admit that an amendment does not reach the intended
heights of perfection. There may be some ambiguity in amendments Nos.
32 and 34, which the Minister will have spotted, although the latter
was fortuitously not selected for debate, so I do not have to discuss
it.</div>
					<a name="07013040000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">In case there is
any cause for doubt about what my amendments and new clause seek to
achieve, I shall explain in plain language. I hope that the Minister
will be generous and kind enough, after the weekend break, to conduct
the debate on that basis. We believe that the restoration of the
earnings link should take place as 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column156" />Column number: 157</div>soon as possible. We are very disappointed that the Government are
waiting until 2012&#151;two years after the Turner Commission
indicated was appropriate. We are also disappointed that there is an
element of uncertainty, as the hon. Member for Eastbourne mentioned; it
is possible that the link will not be restored until
2015.</div>
					<a name="07013040000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">We want the Bill
to make clear when the Government will make an announcement on that
issue. I am assuming that this Parliament will go the full five years
and that there will be an announcement about the earnings link in the
first year of the next Parliament, which is where the April 2011 date
comes
from.</div>
				
					
					<a name="07013040000356"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.45
pm</div>
					<a name="07013040000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are
wondering why the Government have not sought to put a detail into the
Bill to clarify that whenever the start of the next Parliament, there
will be an announcement on the uprating within the first year. We all
know that there is a lot of speculation at the moment about the
changeover of power at the top of Government in this country, and the
possibility that there might be an early general
election&#151;perhaps as soon as this year. If that were to be the
case, we would not want any uncertainty about the commitment that the
Government have already made in very clear terms, which is that there
will be an announcement on the timing of the restoration of the
earnings link at the beginning of the next Parliament. We want to make
sure that there is appropriate flexibility to ensure that that will
happen, even if the next Parliament occurs surprisingly
quickly.</div>
					<a name="07013040000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">The third
issue that we are seeking to raise in these amendments and which is in
new clause 19, is the extent to which the restoration of the earnings
link should be tied to the increase in the state pension age. We know
that prior to the Turner commission no British political party has
proposed that there should be higher state pension ages. This is
potentially an unpopular and controversial matter with the public. It
has been acceptable to all the parties, and to Back Benchers in all the
parties, precisely because the offset has been a restoration of the
earnings link. So there is a piece of good news to go against the piece
of bad news about the state pension age. The Government have said a
number of times that these two things&#151;the good news and the bad
news&#151;are inextricably linked. New clause 19 will test whether
there really is an inextricable link, or whether the Government might
delay the good news while not even contemplating delaying the bad
news.</div>
					<a name="07013040000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is worth
starting off by noting that there is quite broad concern about the fact
that the Government are going to take so long to restore the earnings
link. This was an issue that the Select Committee on Work and Pensions
looked at in detail when it took evidence on the Government&#146;s
proposals. The hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare will be aware that the
Committee concluded on a cross-party basis that, although it welcomes
the decision to re-link the basic state pension to earnings, it
was</div>
					<a name="07013040000349"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;concerned by the
inconsistency between the unequivocal statement that the link will be
re-established by the end of the next Parliament &#145;in any
event&#146; and the Secretary of State&#146;s statement that
affordability would come first.&#148;</div>
					
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column157" />Column number: 158</div>
					<a name="07013040000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Select Committee concluded:</div>
					<a name="07013040000350"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We ask the Government
to clarify this. In our view the link should be restored as soon as
possible, and certainly no later than April
2012.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07013040000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						This
is a big issue for the existing generation of pensioners right across
the country. The Committee will be fascinated to know that I was in
Worthing yesterday, talking to a large group of pensioners. The
particular issue that they wanted me to raise with the Minister was why
there is nothing in the Bill for the existing generation of pensioners.
Why will they have to wait so long before the earnings linked is
restored?</div>
					<a name="07013040000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
will be aware that a number of the representations on the Bill from
pensioners groups highlight their concerns about the delays that will
be involved. I have a good briefing note here from the National
Pensioners Convention, which points out that, relative to the wider
population, the pensioner&#146;s income will continue to fall for at
least five or six years, as a consequence of the delay in the earnings
link. On the basis of its calculations, 3 million of the present
pensioner population will not be around to see the link restored
because they will not be alive by then. It also points out&#151;as do
a number of the other pensioner representative groups&#151;that by
the time the restoration of the earnings link takes place, the basic
state pension will have shrivelled further in relation to earnings to
just &#163;75 a week in current earnings&#146; terms, or 12 per
cent. of average earnings. Other groups, such as Age Concern, made
similar points. Even one of the Government&#146;s favourite
think-tanks, the Institute for Public Policy Research, indicated that
it would like to see the earnings link restored
immediately.</div>
					<a name="07013040000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Therefore,
there is this issue about why the Government are delaying the
restoration of the earnings link, and what the implications of that
delay will be. Not only will pensioners be worse off than they might be
otherwise, but every year that the restoration of the earnings link is
delayed the number of pensioners who will be on means-tested benefits
in the future will rise. That rise will be locked in for the future,
undermining the Government&#146;s hopes that the proportion of
pensioners facing a life of means-testing will fall.</div>
					<a name="07013040000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The Work and
Pensions Committee, when it took evidence, helpfully highlighted how
the failure to restore the earnings link until 2012 or 2015 will
increase the proportion of pensioners on means-tested benefits. In a
note of evidence, dated 30 June 2006, that was given by the Department
for Work and Pensions itself, there are figures&#151;figures from the
Department, not from the Pensions Policy Institute or another
independent body&#151;that seem to indicate that, if the earnings
link were to be restored immediately, the proportion of pensioners on
means-tested benefits by 2050 would only be about 26 or 27 per
cent., which is below the existing estimates. By contrast, if the
restoration of the earnings link is delayed until 2015, about 32 per
cent. of the pensioner population would be on means-tested benefits,
based on the Government&#146;s own figures. That is quite a large
difference. It means that, compared with restoring the earnings link
now and restoring it at the latest date that the Government concede
that they might restore it, there would be about 6 per cent. more
pensioners on means-tested benefits, which would be nearly 25 per cent.
more pensioners on means-tested benefits than would be the case if the
earnings link were restored immediately.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column158" />Column number: 159</div>
					<a name="07013040000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">Therefore, this is not just an
issue about the incomes of existing pensioners; it also relates
directly to the range of concerns that have been expressed about the
sustainability of the Government&#146;s pensions policy and the
reliance on
means-testing.</div>
					<a name="07013040000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
necessary for us to touch briefly on why the Government have decided
that there should be a delay in restoring the earnings link. The
Secretary of State set out the Government&#146;s position when he
made his statement on pension reform on 25 May 2006. He indicated that
the Government&#146;s objective of restoring the earnings link in
2012 was subject to affordability and to the fiscal position. He made
it clear that the Government would make a statement on the issue at the
beginning of the next Parliament&#151;not in 2011, but at the
beginning of the next Parliament.</div>
					<a name="07013040000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						There were
some very interesting exchanges indeed in the Work and Pensions
Committee about this issue&#151;about why the Government had decided
that it was not possible to restore the earnings link now. The hon.
Member for Putney (Justine Greening) was magnificently
persistent&#151;for about three pages of the transcript that has been
printed from that sitting of the Select Committee&#151;in trying to
get an answer from the Secretary of State about why he was delaying the
restoration of the earnings link. It was quite clear that the Secretary
of State understood that there is a big problem with the delay in
restoring the earnings link. He said:</div>
					<a name="07013040000351"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It is not desirable. I
clearly accept that.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07013040000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						As the hon. Member for
Putney also pointed out in that sitting, Lord Turner had indicated
that, although he was just about willing to tolerate having his
proposals about the 2010 date ignored and the Government delaying the
restoration of the earnings link until 2012, he had also said that any
delay in the implementation of the process in 2012 could undermine the
balance of the overall policy package. That was obviously a serious
concern for Lord Turner to express.</div>
					<a name="07013040000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The
interesting element of that debate between the Secretary of State and
the hon. Member for Putney was that the Government appeared to be
taking the position that they could not give a cast-iron commitment to
restore the earnings link in 2012, because of issues about
affordability and the fiscal position at that stage in the economic
cycle. However, under questioning from the hon. Member for Putney, the
Secretary of State indicated that there was no concern about public
service expenditure. So it seemed to be in the Secretary of
State&#146;s mind that there was concern about the 2012 date; the
concern that somehow the economy would go off the rails and that the
fiscal position would deteriorate, and therefore that it would plainly
be irresponsible to be firmly pinned down to a date. However, as the
hon. Member for Putney persistently pointed out, it is somewhat bizarre
to suggest that there will be uncertainty about affordability in 2012
but that there will be such certainty three years later that the
Government are in a position to announce the restoration of the
earnings link come what may. They seem to be trying to hold two
different positions: that they cannot make a commitment with regard to
2012 because that might be unaffordable, and that it will be affordable
in 2015, come what may. How it is possible to be sure that something
will be affordable in 2015 when it is not possible to be sure that it
will be affordable in 2012 was beyond most members of the Committee, as
they indicated in their conclusions.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column159" />Column number: 160</div>
					<a name="07013040000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						We must also
point out that in his evidence on that occasion the Secretary of Sate
threw further uncertainty into the mix under intensive questioning by
the hon. Member for Putney. When she asked what would happen if there
were an affordability issue&#151;whether the package of pension
reforms or affordability and the public finances would come
first&#151;he indicated that the priority would be affordability. He
almost seemed to suggest that the Government have a problem with the
policy, because the Chancellor is not allowing the earnings link to be
restored until 2012 and possibly not until 2015, so we have uncertainty
as to whether the situation will be affordable by 2015. The Committee
pointed out in its conclusions that it was concerned about that
inconsistency in the Government&#146;s position. In their response to
the report, the Government claimed that there was no ambiguity about
the commitment. I hope that we will find out about that
today.</div>
					<a name="07013040000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">The other
element of the earnings link issue is to understand how clearly the
restoration of the earnings link is tied to the higher state pension
age. We know that when Lord Turner made his recommendations he wanted
the earnings link to be restored in 2010, and that he thought that that
was affordable. We also know that he wanted a higher state pension age,
and suggested that that should come in in the late 2020s. However, in
the package that was announced by the Secretary of State, the
Government brought forward the higher state pension age and delayed the
restoration of the earnings link. That was regrettable&#151;it has
caused concern among a lot of people, not least the existing pensioner
population&#151;and it raises a further, more fundamental, issue
about whether the two parts of the policy package are tied up very
closely. The White Paper published in May 2006 claimed at paragraph
3.25 that the restoration of the earnings link is &#147;inextricably
linked&#148; to two other elements of the reform package.</div>
					<a name="07013040000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another Conservative Member
raised the issue on Second Reading. He asked why the restoration of the
earnings link would be affordable in 2012 but not today. The Secretary
of State responded by saying that it
was</div>
					<a name="07013040000352"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Because it
is linked with our policy for increasing the state pension
age.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report</i>, 16 January 2007; Vol.
455, c. 662.]</div>
					<a name="07013040000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
appeared to imply that the funding of the pledge was inextricably
linked to the increase in the state pension age.</div>
					<a name="07013040000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						New clause 19
simply seeks to ask the Government to confirm what appears to be their
position, namely that the two pieces of news, one good and one bad, are
inextricably linked, and that we are not going to end up in a situation
in which they keep delaying the earnings link yet implement the
increase in state pension age on the stated date. I invite the Minister
to accept that those two things are inextricably linked in the package.
If there is a delay beyond the date that the Government have given in
restoring the earnings link, they ought to delay the increase of the
state pension age. Those are important issues; we discussed some of
them in the debate the other day, led by the hon. Member for
Eastbourne, but the amendments probe the Government further. We hope
for some detailed responses from the
Minister.</div>

								Mr.
Waterson:
						</b> I shall be brief, because as the hon. Member for
Yeovil pointed out there is a danger of repeating oneself on this group
of amendments.</div>
					<a name="07013040000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
long as these are genuinely probing amendments, we support them, as
this issue remains in need of probing. The Government cannot have it
both ways. In a great burst of glory, they announced that they will
restore the earnings link, following the Chancellor&#146;s personal
odyssey from opposing the link to coming round grudgingly to restoring
it. They then said that it would happen some time in the medium term:
2012, 2015, or perhaps even later depending on affordability. Why the
Government are not prepared to advance at least the announcement of the
restoration of the link remains a mystery to us, as it does to the hon.
Member for Yeovil. I agree with him that it is difficult to see how
affordability can change dramatically between 2012 and 2015. I will be
interested to hear from the Minister why he thinks it will be
unaffordable before then. On the basis of what calculations does he
think that?</div>
					<a name="07013040000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">At the
risk of breaking my own rule, I should like to repeat something that I
said in the last debate. I am still rather sceptical about the much
more recent linking of the increase of the state pension age to the
restoration of the earnings link. Like the rest of the Committee, I am
agog to hear what the Minister says on those
points.</div>
					
					<a name="07013040000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07013040000408"></a>
							<b class="B">Ms
Angela C. Smith</b> (Sheffield, Hillsborough) (Lab): I shall
speak against the amendment. This is not an argument about
affordability from the point of view of the Treasury; it is about
economic stability and the potential impact of instability on
pensioners and their children and grandchildren.</div>
					<a name="07013040000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to test the Minister on
the commitment to introducing the new link as soon as possible. Of
course, 2012 is a much preferred date: I would not like to think that
the delay would stretch to 2015. I would like to hear from the Minister
about the DWP&#146;s commitment to press the Treasury for the
earliest possible introduction of the link after the next general
election. </div>
					<a name="07013040000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
background to this debate bears rehearsing. Pension credit has reduced
pensioner poverty considerably. In a previous debate, I intervened to
point out that the net income of the poorest 20 per cent. grew by just
28 per cent. between 1980 and 1997, while for the top 20 per cent. it
increased by 76 per cent. The pension credit is now paid to 2.65
million households. In Sheffield, Hillsborough, the average credit for
the 5,340 pensioner households that receive it is &#163;40. That is a
considerable contribution to reducing the gap between the richest
pensioners and the poorest.</div>
					
					<a name="07013040000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07013040000409"></a>Mr.
Waterson:
						</b> Does the hon. Lady accept that there are still
1.5 million pensioners not receiving pension credit who are entitled to
it? Does she agree that the best way of helping the poorest pensioners
is to boost the basic state pension, of which the take-up, I guess, is
99 per
cent.?</div>
					
					<a name="07013040000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07013040000410"></a>Ms
Smith:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman makes an important point. In a
previous debate, the Minister said that every effort is being made to
ensure that all those eligible for the credit are encouraged to apply
for it. The pension credit has got us to a point at which we can start
to think about universal measures to reduce pensioner poverty even
further.</div>

							<b class="B">
								Ms
Sally Keeble</b> (Northampton, North) (Lab): Does my hon.
Friend accept that contrary to what the hon. Member for Eastbourne
said, if the basic state pension is increased it misses out a swathe of
the poorest pensioners who are not on the basic state pension: women
who have never had the entitlement? That is fundamental in tackling
pensioner poverty and inequalities.</div>
					
					<a name="07013040000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07013040000412"></a>Ms
Smith:
						</b> My hon. Friend makes a valid point. The Bill
contains a settlement, a package that is designed to give the right
combination of universal coverage to increase the number of women who
get the full basic state pension&#151;up to 90 per cent. by 2020. It
is a combination of security and incentives to save for retirement and
I applaud it.</div>
					<a name="07013040000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						However, we
need to test the date of introduction and I look forward to the
Minister&#146;s comments on that matter. We must remember that people
in the generation coming up to retirement age who are 65 this year, are
not ready to put their feet up&#151; Paul McCartney is 65 this year.
It is the generation that produced the Stones and the Beatles, and it
does not consider itself old in any way. That generation has
contributed a great deal to British society, but it also suffered
rising unemployment in the 1970s, the three-day week and the mass
unemployment in the 1980s. In my constituency, Corus, one of the main
employers, employed 6,000 people in the early 1980s and now employs
only 600, albeit in very high-value, highly skilled jobs. It is the
generation that suffered a collapse in the housing market, high
interest rates and inflation in the 1990s.</div>
					<a name="07013040000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">The key point to bear in mind
when we consider the introduction of the earnings link is that the
generation that is retiring now values economic stability more than any
other in recent years because it has experienced the full impact of
economic instability. We cannot do anything that destabilises economic
prosperity or risks doing so, because that generation of pensioners
understands the importance of having the money in the Treasury in the
first place to pay for the earnings link.</div>
					<a name="07013040000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">Members of that generation
value economic stability for their children and grandchildren. It is
not true that pensioners are selfish people who think of no one but
themselves. Pensioners have worked all their lives, they have brought
up children and they want to be able to enjoy their retirement and to
see their children and grandchildren enjoying life, enjoying prosperity
and seeing that their young ones are doing better than they did, if
possible.</div>
					<a name="07013040000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">We must put
the issue in a wider context: that economic stability provides the
Government with the resources to invest in health, education, housing
and all the other things that are as important as the subject of this
debate. It would be reckless to tie the Government to the introduction
of the earnings link in 2008-09. Nevertheless, I ask the Minister to
respond to the genuine concern about a potential delay to 2015. It is
important that the link is introduced as soon as possible, but the
judgment about when that will be is incredibly important and I want to
know the criteria that underlie
it.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07013040000413"></a>James
Purnell:
						</b> I start by putting the issue in context, because
some of what has been said in the debate assumes that since 1997 the
basic state pension has 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column162" />Column number: 163</div>been linked to inflation and that pensioners have not had any other
increase, or, indeed, that Government do not accept the principle that
as the nation&#146;s prosperity rises so the income of pensioners
should rise. That is the opposite of the truth. Since 1997 we have not
just recognised that principle but legislated on that basis.
Pensioners&#146; incomes, or just their incomes from the state, have
gone up broadly in line with earnings or faster than earnings,
depending on which measure one uses. That principle has been well
established. Under this Government the amount of public spending on
pensioners has gone up faster even than GDP as a result of the measures
that we have introduced since 1997. There is an increase of 1 per cent.
of GDP in the amount going on pensioner benefits. That principle is
accepted.</div>
					<a name="07013040000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">People
often also say that it has gone to people on means-tested benefits only
because of pension credit. It is of course true that we have
prioritised the incomes of the poorest. That is because when we came to
power there was a scandalous amount of pensioner poverty in this
country, which has been significantly reduced because of the
introduction of the pension credit. The poorest third of pensioners in
this country are &#163;2,000 a year better off because of what we
have done. That is something for which we make no apology, but it was
resisted by and large by the Opposition parties.</div>
					<a name="07013040000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is also true that even
pensioners who are not on means tested benefits have seen their income
from the state go up roughly in line with earnings. The average
pensioner is &#163;1,400 a year better off than they would have been
under the policies that we inherited in 1997. It is therefore partly as
a result of those policies that we can now say that for the first time
in a generation pensioners are less likely to be poor than other parts
of the population. The general principle that pensioners should share
in the rising prosperity of the nation is well
established.</div>
					
					<a name="07013040000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07013040000414"></a>Mr.
Laws:
						</b> Can the Minister confirm that over the years between
2007 and 2010-11 there will be a decline in the proportion of GDP going
on pensioner benefits?
</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07013040000415"></a>James
Purnell:
						</b> That is not the case. We have had that debate.
The hon. Gentleman tries to quote figures that are not just about
pensioner benefits. I am happy to point him yet again to the figures
that point to the fact that the amount of pensioner benefits is flat
broadly in GDP terms over the period to 2020. That is because of state
pension equalisation, so the amount going to pensioners on a
like-for-like basis is growing. The hon. Gentleman also assumes that he
can write the Budgets for the next few years. Much as I am sure that he
would like to write the Labour party&#146;s Budgets over the next few
years, it is something that we would resist in principle.</div>
					<a name="07013040000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">So the general principle that
pensioner benefits should be in part shaped by the growing wealth of
the country is one that we have accepted all the way through. We have
always rejected making a pledge to link the basic state pension to
earnings without having a way of doing that for ever and locking that
in in legislation. The danger of the Conservatives&#146; policy at
the previous election was that they were saying that they wanted to
restore the link but they had no policy for doing so beyond one
Parliament. Indeed, during the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column163" />Column number: 164</div>election their policy for doing so fell apart as first they had to say
that they were not going to abolish guarantee credit and they then came
under some pressure as to whether they were going to abolish the state
second pension. Much as the policy of the hon. Member for Yeovil on
citizen&#146;s income does not bear scrutiny, I am not sure that
their policy at the last election would have borne the scrutiny that it
would have required had they thought that they were going to get into
government.</div>

Member for Eastbourne tried to say that the link between the basic
increase in state pension and the rise in the state pension age was
only something that had arrived recently. That is the opposite of the
truth. One has always had to answer the question of how one would fund
the provision for the long term. One can do so through the Bill because
those very two things come together in it, exactly as the Pensions
Commission recommended. So, this Bill moves from a situation where
pensioners have, in practice, been sharing the growing prosperity of
the nation to one where we can legislate for that. We can only do that
thanks to the difficult choice in this Bill on the rise in the state
pension
age.</div>

						</b> May I use this opportunity to clarify one
confusion on the Minister&#146;s part? He seems to be claiming that
my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr.
Hammond) said on Second Reading that the Conservatives believed that
the link should be immediately restored&#151;today, tomorrow or
whenever. It is worth pointing out that he was responding to a specific
intervention by the hon. Member for Dumfries and Galloway on the pledge
for the one Parliament point that we have just discussed. I have tried
to make it clear that we agree broadly that this package can go forward
and that it should be affordable. Our only concern is why the
Government are so coy about making an
announcement.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07013040000421"></a>James

						</b> That is not actually what <i class="I">Hansard</i> says. It
has his colleague, the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge, saying
that they believe it 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column164" />Column number: 165</div>is affordable now. If it were to be introduced next year, it would cost
about &#163;0.4 billion in 2008, then &#163;0.9 billion in
2009, &#163;1.5 billion in 2010 and &#163;2.3 billion in
2012. Rather as in that Conservative party document, which I will not
refer to again, it has no plan for funding that. Until it says that
that is not actually its policy, we will continue to scrutinise
it.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07013040000423"></a>James
Purnell:
						</b> I know that you want us to move on,
Mr. Taylor, so I will, but what the hon. Gentleman says is a
contradiction of what his hon. Friend said on Second Reading.</div>
					<a name="07013040000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 32 would do away
with the convention whereby increases in relevant pension amounts come
into effect from the first Monday in each tax year. It would replace
that with a commitment to increase pension amounts from 1 April 2008,
regardless of which day of the week that may fall on. To clarify, the
tax year begins on 6 April rather than 1 April, so the
intended effect might be for increases to take effect from the tax year
beginning April 2008. The hon. Member for Yeovil asked me to draw a
curtain over the precise implications of the words and the slight
&#147;Groundhog Day&#148; nature of the amendment: I am happy to do
so. I know that that was not his intention, which is to bring in
uprating from 2008. The point about those extra costs remains, and he
has still not told us how it is to be funded&#151;whether by a 5p
increase in income tax or by abolishing state second pension and the
guaranteed credit premium. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman still does
not want to answer that question.</div>
					<a name="07013040000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given the importance of
earnings uprating as a central plank of our reforms, it may be helpful
if I first provide some background on why clause 5 has been drafted
this way. It is because we have a clear policy of guaranteeing in the
Bill that this will happen in the next Parliament. Our objective is to
do that in 2012: we will make a statement on the exact date at the
beginning of the next Parliament&#151;exactly as the Bill
says.</div>
					
					<a name="07013040000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07013040000424"></a>Mr.
Laws:
						</b> Is the Minister making it absolutely clear, on
behalf of the Government, that there is no question whatever of
restoring the earnings link before 2012?</div>
					
					<a name="07013040000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07013040000425"></a>James
Purnell:
						</b> I said exactly what I said, which is that our
objective is to do it in 2012, and we will make a statement on that at
the beginning of the next Parliament. At one point, the hon. Gentleman
was saying that the earnings link would never happen&#151;an argument
that has been rather undermined by our putting it into legislation. It
will happen as a consequence of this Bill and our policy, unlike his,
is absolutely clear.</div>
					<a name="07013040000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">So, clause 5 provides for this
to happen and the benefits uprating process relies on activity in two
consecutive tax years&#151;the first being the year in which a review
of earnings is carried out and the second being that in which earnings
increases take effect. Clause 5 provides for that, allowing the first
year for review with 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column165" />Column number: 166</div>regard to earnings to be designated, in the words of the clause, and
earnings uprating would then take place automatically in subsequent
years. Most importantly, it allows for that to happen in time to
introduce earnings uprating from 2012. Our proposals fit with these
existing arrangements, as we are not looking to change the processes.
They are tried and tested and work well every year when we have debates
on the uprating process. I am not aware of any complaints about how it
is working. That would not be the case, of course, with some of the
amendments before us, which would introduce an untested process that we
do not think should be
supported.</div>
					<a name="07013040000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I have
mentioned, earnings uprating is part of an integrated package of
reforms. Our plans, including timings, are subject to affordability and
sustainability tests, which although not Liberal Democrat tenets, are
central to our
reforms.</div>
					
					<a name="07013040000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07013040000426"></a>Mr.
Laws:
						</b> Why is the Minister not certain that the proposal
will be affordable in 2012, but is certain that it will be in
2015?</div>
					
					<a name="07013040000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07013040000427"></a>James
Purnell:
						</b> If the hon. Gentleman will hold his horses, I
shall come on to that later in my speech. I shall try to answer all the
questions that he
raised.</div>
					<a name="07013040000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall
provide some background: the Pensions Commission proposed that earnings
uprating should begin in 2010, as the hon. Gentleman said, although
Lord Turner has since confirmed that a short delay beyond that would
not seriously undermine the overall direction of his reform. In the
hon. Gentleman&#146;s opening remarks, he quoted figures that seemed
to imply that the delayed implementation would result in a massive
difference between the numbers of pensioners on means
testing&#151;between about a quarter, under his plans, and a third
under ours.</div>
					<a name="07013040000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">Actually,
we have projected that, as a result of our proposals, about 28 per
cent. of pensioners will be on pension credit in 2050. As the hon.
Gentleman knows, those projections are statistically
ambitious&#151;it is more than 40 years away and the projection is
subject to many different factors. We have, therefore, always said that
we are aiming for less than a third, rather than pinning ourselves to
exact percentages based on very long-term projections. His figure of 26
per cent. and ours of 28 per cent. are not hugely materially different.
The material difference will be this: a reduction in the number of
pensioners on means testing from 70 per cent. to less than one
third.</div>
					
					<a name="07013040000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07013040000428"></a>Mr.
Laws:
						</b> Does the Minister agree that, based on his
Department&#146;s figures, some 6 or 7 per cent. more of the
pensioner population will be on means testing as a consequence of
delaying the restoration of the earnings link from now until
2015?</div>
					
					<a name="07013040000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07013040000429"></a>James
Purnell:
						</b> Our policy is that we will make a statement on
exactly when that will happen in 2012. Our central projection is about
28 per cent., but, as I said, it would be inappropriate to pretend that
differences of 1 or 2 per cent. in the projections are reliable given
that we are projecting to a date that is 40 or more years
away. The hon. Gentleman might have a better statistical engine than we
do, but we set out 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column166" />Column number: 167</div>quite clearly in our forecasts the reasons why those variations in the
statistics need to be taken into
account.</div>
					<a name="07013040000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">So I have
dealt with the effect of amendment No. 32. Amendment No. 35 could
conceivably bring forward the date by which the order has to be made
if, for example, this Parliament were to run for four years, ending in
June 2009. That would mean that an order identifying the first review
year would have to be made before the first day in April 2010. We doubt
whether it will be possible to make legislation based on a start and
end date of a Parliament so we thought that the best approach would be
to pin it to the existing arrangements on uprating, which is what we
have done. That will clearly implement the Government&#146;s overall
policy, which I have mentioned already to the hon.
Gentleman.</div>
					<a name="07013040000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 36 would also remove flexibility and inadvertently the provision to
bring into effect the earnings uprating of the pension credit standard
minimum guarantee as soon as possible after the Bill receives Royal
Assent&#151;in other words, from the tax year beginning in 2008.
Similarly, amendments Nos. 76 and 77 would remove flexibility. Like
amendment No. 36, amendment No. 77 would remove the link
between the commencement of earnings uprating and the dissolution of
Parliament. Amendment No.76 then seeks to ensure that the year in which
earnings uprating would take effect must begin before 6 April
2013&#151;in other words, no later than the tax year beginning in
April 2012.</div>
					<a name="07013040000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause
19 is at the core of the debate initiated by the hon. Member for
Yeovil. His proposal is that, from 2012, for each additional year that
the basic state pension is not increased by earnings, the increase in
the state pension age should be delayed. I glad that the House has a
general consensus on the principle of increases in the state pension
age, which is to the credit of the Pensions Commission and the way in
which my predecessors ran the national pensions debate. What might have
been a very difficult issue for politicians to agree on has been
tackled effectively, which is a credit to the way in which the process
worked.</div>
					<a name="07013040000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">The question
that the hon. Member for Yeovil asked was whether, if there is a delay
in the earnings link, there should also be a delay in the increase in
the state pension age. That is to mistake short-term for long-term
affordability. The state pension age decision is important because the
commitment is long term. We and the Pensions Commission had to come up
with a package that was affordable for the long term. On its own,
uprating the basic state pension in line with earnings would cost
around &#163;56 billion in 2050. That is the main cost in our reform
package. By the time that the first increase in the state pension age
occurs, from 2024, the basic state pension will already have been
linked to earnings for a decade. Increases in the state pension age
from 2024 will, by 2050, reduce the cost of our reforms to the state
pension system by around &#163;32 billion. That is the bulk
of the way in which it is made affordable, and in which it is made
fair. By increasing the state pension age gradually, we will be
ensuring that the costs of rising longevity are shared fairly between
those contributing to and those receiving state pensions.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column167" />Column number: 168</div>
					<a name="07013040000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						A more
generous state pension and a rising state pension age, therefore, go
hand in hand for the long term. They are part of an integrated package
of complementary reforms, so they are of course linked. The crucial
point is that they are quite different in nature. People must have
absolute certainty about when they will get their state pension, so
that they can undertake meaningful planning. It would be irresponsible
not to provide
this.</div>
					<a name="07013040000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me confirm
our commitment on earnings uprating. I said to the hon. Member for
Yeovil earlier that our objective, subject to affordability and the
fiscal position, is to introduce the earnings link in 2012 or, at the
latest, by the end of the next Parliament. I hope that that gives my
hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Hillsborough some of the
reassurance that she was looking
for.</div>
					<a name="07013040000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">Flexibility
around affordability is essential if the package is to stay within the
envelope of affordability at the time. Neither the hon. Member for
Yeovil nor I know what will be the precise budgetary position in 2012.
Framing the decision in terms of affordability at that stage has always
been important. The issue of the state pension age is quite different
and is about affordability in the long run. We do not think that saying
to people, &#147;Here&#146;s a timetable, but it might
shift&#148;, is appropriate. People have to know when they are going
to retire. That is why we are planning to legislate on that basis for
the state pension age. We are clear that we can legislate the linking
of the state pension for the next Parliament and we have set out as an
objective a year for achieving that. We believe that to be the right
approach.</div>

by the legislation. The legislation would have to be changed if that
were not to be the case. The legislation gives people that guarantee.
We set out the objective date of 2012, which is clear in our policy,
but it is appropriate that that should be subject to affordability. All
policies have to be subject to affordability, which was the Secretary
of State&#146;s point in response to the

Gentleman&#146;s policy; it might include a citizen&#146;s pension,
but he cannot tell us what it will cost, or how it will be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column168" />Column number: 169</div>funded, or about the second state pension or premiums in guarantee
credit. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept that we have set out
our position clearly, we have costed it and we are legislating for
it.</div>
					<a name="07013040000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me answer a
couple of the points raised. It was claimed that we were bringing
forward the increase in state pension age proposed by Turner. That is
not the case. The proposal that the Turner commission made was for
introduction in the decade up to 2030, the decade up to 2040, and the
decade up to 2050. Introduction in 2024, phasing to 2026; in 2034
phasing to 2036; and in 2044 phasing to 2046 is completely compatible
with the Turner model&#151;it is in no way a bringing forward of what
was proposed. I hope that that answers all the points that have been

think are probing amendments. However, if he does not, I would ask my
colleagues to resist them.</div>

Laws:
						</b> We have had a relatively good, if somewhat subdued,
debate. I was expecting more fireworks, but perhaps it is too early in
the morning for that, or perhaps hon. Members, including those on the
Government Benches, understand that there is genuine disappointment
among the existing pensioner population that they will have to wait so
long for the restoration of the earnings link. It might be that hon.
Members are also concerned about what those delays will do in relation
to the amount of means testing and the incentive structures that people
face.</div>
					<a name="07013040000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government
have some logical hurdles to clear&#151;if one can do such a thing.
The Minister set out the merits of two completely contrasting and
perhaps incompatible principles. One appeared to be certainty, which
apparently people welcome in relation to bad news such as the increase
in the state pension age. The other is the principle of flexibility,
which apparently people welcome in relation to things that are good
news, which they would not want introduced too quickly in case that
were imprudent.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07013040000435"></a>James
Purnell:
						</b> I obviously failed to explain this point in my
speech, so I shall try in an intervention. Does the hon. Gentleman
recognise that delaying the increase in state pension age in 2024 would
make no difference to affordability in
2012?</div>
					
					<a name="07013040000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07013040000436"></a>
								Mr.
Laws:
						</b> What I recognise is that the Government have said
that the restoration of the earnings link is really an issue for the
longer-term costs, even more than for the short-term costs, and that
therefore the two things must be inextricably linked. I am saying that
pensioners ask me how they can be inextricably linked when they are
told with great certainty that they are going to have to work for
longer even though they do not know for sure when the earnings link
will be
restored.</div>
					
					<a name="07013040000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07013040000437"></a>James
Purnell:
						</b> By definition those pensioners will not have to
work for longer because they are already retired. Future generations
will have to work longer.</div>
					
					<a name="07013040000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07013040000438"></a>Mr.
Laws:
						</b> That certainly is the case. All of the population
share the concerns, but it is the pensioners who feel short-changed by
a package that does nothing for them. No doubt they have read in detail
the paper 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column169" />Column number: 170</div>that was issued alongside the Bill. The regulatory impact assessment
gives all the figures; they are very detailed and superbly prepared by
the Department and its officials, whom I congratulate on the clarity of
the document. In that very clear document, it is very clear that total
pensioner benefits as a share of gross domestic product will fall
between 2008 and 2011. Indeed, in the period from 2011 to 2020 there
will be a lower share of pensioner benefits, including pensions, in GDP
than there is today. That explains why there is such a lack of
comfort.</div>
					<a name="07013040000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have still
not heard a satisfactory explanation of why the restoration of the
earnings link is going to be affordable without any shadow of doubt in
2015. This is a definition of uncertainty which baffled the Select
Committee and which baffled me. This all begs the question why the
Government have made this decision. Is it because the Chancellor of the
Exchequer is still not very happy with this policy or that he was
bullied into it? Will he change his mind later? Will he attempt to
short-change pensioners in some way? Or is it the opposite of this?
Does the Chancellor of the Exchequer want to make this announcement of
good news himself? Does he want the flexibility, perhaps even within
months of becoming Prime Minister, if he does become so, to make this
grand announcement?</div>
					<a name="07013040000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						When I asked
the Minister whether he was absolutely sure and could give me a
guarantee that the Government were committed to not introducing the
earnings link before 2012, I thought I detected a little bit of
wriggling. The Minister knows that it is quite possible that the
Chancellor will suddenly decide that this is immensely popular and
that, if he is going to get all the credit for it, the measure may
suddenly be brought forward. Then the Minister and all his honourable
Friends will say how marvellous it is and what genius this man has and
how wonderful the Labour Government are and tell us all that we should
be grateful for it.</div>
					<a name="07013040000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">We know that positions can
change. We know sometimes that even the Minister has not been updated
on the latest policy thinking of his Department. He told us last week
that the Government did not have it in their mind to change the basis
on which lone-parent benefits were available and we wake up this
morning to discover that that is back in the melting pot. How confident
can we be, therefore, that the Government really have a clear policy on
the 2012 date? Maybe we should all be optimistic and actually think
that this deliberate uncertainty&#151;or flexibility, as the Minister
described it&#151;is actually designed for the Chancellor of the
Exchequer.</div>
					<a name="07013040000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the
final point, the Minister said that there was a great deal of
uncertainty about means testing and that we should not rely too much on
the estimates that I cited earlier about the consequences of delaying
the earnings link for the number of people on means testing. I pointed
out to him that all I did was to quote the figures that are available
in the notes supplied to the Select Committee from his own Department.
All members of the Committee have the very highest view of the
effectiveness and ability of his officials to make these detailed
calculations. That is why we take seriously the fact that they have
indicated that there could be a gap of 5 or 6 per cent in the number of
people on means testing, based on a potential delay in the earnings
link.</div>

								James
Purnell:
						</b> I have great respect for the hon. Gentleman and I
would not want him to take what I said out of context. What I was
saying was that single percentage figure differences in 2050 should be
treated with the caution as set out in the paper that we published on
this issue. If one is projecting 40 years away, that is well within the
margin of error. What I said in my intervention was that the forecast
that we have for the means-tested population in 2050 is 28 per cent.
The figure that the hon. Gentleman got for introduction in 2008 was 26
per cent. That was the only point that I
made.</div>
					
					<a name="07013040000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07013040000440"></a>Mr.
Laws:
						</b> I do not want to labour this, but the 28 per cent.
that the Minister cited is precisely the amount that appears in the
memorandum, based on the dates that the Government envisage introducing
this policy. Surely I am correct to say that the earlier the link is
restored, and the higher the basic state pension, the more reasonable
it is to assume that the number of people on means-testing will be
lower.</div>
					<a name="07013040000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">I accept that
the proportion of people on means-testing in 30 or 40 years&#146;
time is very uncertain and, as the Minister knows, we have had plenty
of debates in which we have aired the issue of uncertainty about the
total level. Surely he would accept, however, that, whatever the
central estimate for 2050, it stands to reason that the earlier the
earnings link is restored, the lower the proportion of people who will
be on means-testing. Whatever that estimate is at the current time, it
must surely be less the earlier the earnings link is restored, and that
is a fundamental part of the Government&#146;s
policy.</div>
					
					<a name="07013040000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07013040000441"></a>James
Purnell:
						</b> Of course that is right but that is only a
theoretical point until the hon. Gentleman tells us how he would fund
such a policy&#151;whether the 5p increase in pension spending or the
abolition of S2P in the guaranteed credit
premium.</div>
					
					<a name="07013040000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07013040000442"></a>Mr.
Laws:
						</b> Without going too far astray of my amendments, we
will certainly set out before the next general election very clear and
costed plans which will not require increases in taxation but will
demonstrate how we will reduce existing areas of Government expenditure
in order to deliver on our policies on the earnings link and the
citizens pension. I detect that that is probably as far as you want me
to go, Mr. Taylor, but I look forward to the Minister
attending my seminar in the same way as I look forward to attending
his&#151;neither of which has a date yet.</div>
					<a name="07013040000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">The one area where we have made
some progress in clarifying the Government&#146;s thinking is that
the Minister did not appear to have an objection to the suggestion that
an announcement on the restoration of the earnings link should be made
at the beginning of the next Parliament, whenever it comes. I think his
objection to our amendments on that point was not so much that they
were objectionable on principle, but simply that he could not see how
the Bill could be amended to make that point. If he is willing to
confirm that the earnings link announcement will be made in the first
year of the next Parliament, however early that is, that would be
extremely reassuring. I note that he is not looking at me so perhaps I
am being excessively optimistic. He may want to write to me to give me
that warm assurance in the event that the Chancellor rushes to the
polls after the Brown bounce.</div>

							<a name="07013040000473"></a>Mr.
Waterson:
						</b> I am sure that the Committee will be delighted
to hear that I shall be very brief in discussing this clause. Compared
with its predecessor, clause 6 is a relatively inoffensive clause; it
has certainly not attracted an awful lot of comment from outside
bodies. However, I wanted to raise a couple of issues before we move
on.</div>
					<a name="07013040000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 6, along
with its various related consequential amendments, is designed to
ensure that, for some benefits, the preservation of the link with
prices rather than earnings will continue, but some benefits will be
linked with the basic state pension as and when it comes to be linked
with earnings&#151;we do not want to go back over the issue of when
that day will dawn. One example of the second category of benefits is
bereavement benefit.</div>
					<a name="07013040000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am asking the Minister to address two issues in his comments. First, I
should like him to explain the reasoning behind the distinction between
the two groups of benefits. I assume that the reason for the groupings
is financial. I should be grateful if he would indicate the kind of
saving that is expected by making this distinction between the two
groups of benefits: those that will be clinging to the coat tails of
the basic state pension, in terms of uprating with earnings in due
course; and those that will continue, for ever and ever, to be linked
to the level of prices. That is all I have to
say.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07013040000474"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions
(Mr. James Plaskitt):
						</b> You will recall,
Mr. Taylor, that in our discussion of clause 5 we provided
for the earnings uprating of the basic state pension, the standard
minimum guarantee in state pension credit and industrial death benefit.
Clause 6 completes the picture. It amends section 150 of the Social
Security Administration Act 1992, which provides for price uprating.
Essentially, clause 6 removes references to the benefits that will now
be uprated in line with earnings, while preserving the existing
position for other benefits. I think that the answer to the second
question by the hon. Member for Eastbourne is that this process is
about maintaining the status quo; it is not about delivering any
savings in expenditure.</div>
					<a name="07013040000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">The changes that relate to the
basic state pension, industrial death benefit and bereavement benefits
have effect in relation to the designated tax year. The 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column173" />Column number: 174</div>changes that relate to the standard minimum guarantee have effect in
relation to the year in which the Act was passed.</div>
					<a name="07013040000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">Historically, the rate of
certain bereavement benefits has been linked by legislation to the rate
of the basic state pension, and consequently they have been uprated in
line with that. As I explained before, clause 5 maintains that link in
the case of industrial death benefit, because most people receiving
that benefit are over state pension age&#151;I think that is the
answer to the first question by the hon. Member for
Eastbourne.</div>
					<a name="07013040000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
other bereavement benefits&#151;widowed mother&#146;s allowance,
widow&#146;s pension, widowed parent&#146;s allowance and
bereavement allowance&#151;are paid to people during their working
lives, when people have needs and responsibilities that are different
from those of pensioners. If we did nothing, those bereavement
benefits, which at the moment are uprated in line with prices, would
instead increase in line with earnings, as a consequence of the
earnings uprating of the basic state pension.</div>
					<a name="07013040000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our policy commitment was to
uprate the basic state pension and the pension credit standard minimum
guarantee by earnings. Working-age benefits will remain linked to
prices, as they are now. So I repeat to the hon. Member for Eastbourne
that the clause maintains the status
quo.</div>
					<a name="07013040000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause breaks
the link between the rate of the basic state pension and those
working-age bereavement benefits, so that those benefits will continue
to be increased by prices, as they are now, in line with other
working-age benefits.</div>
					<a name="07013040000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">Sections 39 and 39C of the
Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 provide the
legislative links between the rate of the basic state pension and
bereavement benefits. Clause 5(5) and (6) amend those sections, the
effect of which would be to remove the links to the rate of the basic
state pension.</div>
					<a name="07013040000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given
that there is, at present, no legislative mechanism to determine the
separate rates of these benefits, the Bill gives the Secretary of State
powers to make regulations that prescribe new rates for these
bereavement benefits before the basic state pension starts to be
uprated by earnings. Clause 5(9) will ensure that the prescribed rate
of bereavement benefits will be the same as the basic state pension
until that is uprated in line with earnings. After that, the new
prescribed rates of bereavement benefit will be uprated by prices via
section 150 of the Social Security Administration Act 1992. For those
reasons, I hope that the Committee will agree to the clause standing
part of the
Bill.</div>

removes the link between the lower earnings limit and the basic
pension. The lower earnings limit is &#163;84 a week at present,
which equates to an annual qualifying earnings factor, as pension
legislation calls it, of &#163;4,368. The effect of the clause will
be that the lower earnings limit will not automatically increase in
line with earnings in the future. Instead, any future increase in the
lower earnings limit will be at the Treasury&#146;s discretion; that
will happen when the basic state pension is linked to
earnings.</div>
					<a name="07013040000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have huge
sympathy with the intent of new clause 18, which identifies an issue
that was raised on Second Reading by at least three Labour
Members&#151;the hon. Members for Colne Valley (Kali Mountford), for
Amber Valley (Judy Mallaber) and for Northampton, North, and I
understand precisely what it would do. It deals with people who have
several part-time jobs, each of which on its own is below the lower
earnings limit on which national insurance contributions have to be
paid in order to accrue a pension at a later date. However, when those
jobs are taken together, the total gross earnings come above the lower
earnings limit.</div>
					<a name="07013040000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
put some flesh on the bones, typically&#151;though not
exclusively&#151;it tends to be women who are in those circumstances.
The hon. Member for Amber Valley gave the example on Second Reading of
someone who may work as a dinner lady at lunchtime and in a corner shop
in the evening.</div>
					<a name="07013040000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
helpful briefing provided by Help the Aged estimated that about 600,000
women are not accruing pension rights because their earnings are below
the lower earnings limit. About 50,000 of those women have more than
one job, so they could benefit from the proposal.</div>
					<a name="07013040000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although I said that I
understand the purpose behind the new clause, and have much sympathy
with it, I have a question about its practical impact. On Second
Reading, responding to an intervention by the hon. Member for Colne
Valley, the Secretary of State said that it would be</div>
					<a name="07013040000354"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;extremely difficult from an
administrative point of view.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report</i>,
16 January 2007; Vol. 455, c. 662.]</div>
					<a name="07013040000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">My question is how new clause 18 would
work practically with the payrolls run by employers on a computer, or
manually if they are smaller employers. There is also the issue of the
cost to employers if an employee for whom they do not pay
employer&#146;s contributions goes above the primary threshold, which
is &#163;97 a week, at which point the employer has to pay 12.8 per
cent. Employer&#146;s national insurance contributions, and the
employee has to pay 11 per cent. One could imagine a situation in which
some women would be priced out of a job, as employers might choose not
to offer them work because of the cost.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column175" />Column number: 176</div>
					<a name="07013040000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will the Minister comment on how
class 3 voluntary national insurance contributions could be paid by
employees who are in work and earning below the lower earnings limit,
to enable them to accrue rights towards the basic state pension? Class
3 contributions can be paid by anyone over the age of 16 to enable them
to qualify for the basic state pension. The rate is currently
&#163;7.55 a week. As the employees concerned would not be paying
contributions otherwise, it would not be an additional payment. If that
would be the right way to go, how can the Government bring the option
of paying class 3 contributions to a wider audience?</div>
					<a name="07013040000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not asking the Department
to spend more on its promotional material, but it could flag up the
option of paying class 3 contributions in the advertising that it
already puts out. In the course of communications between employers and
employees, such as payslips or P60s, it would be possible to alert
everyone who earns below the lower earnings limit to that option. I
should be grateful if the Minister would comment on that suggestion. I
know that he understands the problem that is addressed by proposed new
clause
18.</div>

								Mr.
Laws:
						</b> We have no fundamental disagreement with clauses 7
or 8. Proposed new clause 18 is in my name and that of my hon. Friend
the Member for Solihull. She was one of the hon. Members to raise this
issue on Second Reading, along with a number of Labour Members, notably
the hon. Member for Colne Valley, who made a detailed speech and feels
passionately about it. The hon. Member for Dumfries and Galloway also
made an intervention during the debate.</div>
					<a name="07013040000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The issue
relates to how the Government, within the confines of their own
approach to pensions entitlement, will include some of the groups that
have been left out in the past. The hon. Member for South-West
Bedfordshire set out in a detailed, fair way the nature of the problem
and some potential impediments to possible solutions.</div>
					<a name="07013040000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">The proposed new clause is
designed to help people with earnings from multiple sources who do not
earn at least the lower earnings limit in any one job and therefore end
up without a full entitlement to the basic state pension. The inclusion
of more individuals in the scope of the basic state pension has been an
important part of the Government&#146;s approach. It is an important
part of the Bill, which we have already discussed to some
extent.</div>
					<a name="07013040000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">In its second
report, the Pensions Commission drew attention to the fact that many
female pensioners suffer from problems of the type that we are
discussing. The report argued that the need to include those
individuals and the practical difficulties of doing so made a strong
case for replacing the existing contributory system with a universal
pension that would be payable to all who meet a residency test. It
pointed out that within the confines of the existing system, it is
difficult to fix the problem of individuals who have multiple jobs that
are all below the earnings
limit.</div>

					<a name="07013040000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">The magnitude
of this problem is set out in the Department for Work and Pensions 2005
report on 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column176" />Column number: 177</div>women and pensions. The report describes how at that time approximately
2.2 million women were not accruing an entitlement to a full working
state pension, and of those about 600,000 were earning less than the
lower earnings limit, which was at that time &#163;82 a week. Fifty
thousand of those individuals are people whom the Government believe to
have more than one job and therefore people who would be affected by
this new clause, which has good support not only in this place but from
a number of bodies outside parliament, including Help the Aged, Age
Concern and the Equal Opportunity
Commission.</div>

about my introductory remarks. He has mentioned outside bodies to which
he has spoken. May I ask him specifically to deal with the issues
regarding employers and the practicalities of how we make this work
within a payroll system? Employers have raised these issues with me.
There is also the issue of cost for employers; before we blithely add
costs, we need to look at that aspect as
well.</div>
					
					<a name="07013040000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07013040000479"></a>Mr.
Laws:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman correctly draws attention to the
practicalities of what we are seeking to do and of what was raised on
Second Reading, and also the potential costs that could fall to
employers. We are not unconcerned about those matters at all. Without
going too wide of this particular debate, that is one of the reasons
why we favour a pension system based on residency rather than on
accruals, because it can be difficult and expensive to fix some of
these problems. We know that the Government do not want to go down that
route. They have said that their fundamental objection is not one of
practicality but one of principle. But they believe it is right for
people to receive state pensions in return for making economic or
social contributions during their working lives.</div>
					<a name="07013040000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">We believe that the
Government&#146;s attempts to ensure that the uptake of the full
basic state pension is increased to include as many groups as possible
implies that they have an end aspiration to ensure that as many people
as possible get the full basic state pension. We would prefer to
enforce the responsibilities on people to seek employment and not
simply rely on the benefits system in other ways. We know that the
Secretary of State has made some proposals on this to date in relation
to lone parents. We accept that there are some responsibilities within
the benefits system. We have not seen any evidence to date, unless the
Minister can contradict me, that the motivation of people of working
age in relation to employment, caring and so on is greatly affected by
the issue of national insurance contributions. Of course, the fact that
the Government have a means-tested level of pension that is set above
the level of the basic state pension, to some extent cuts against their
desire to have a contributory principle telling people that they are
not going to get something for
nothing.</div>
					<a name="07013040000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">In some ways
my answer to the hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire is that that
is precisely why we are concerned about the contributory principle that
he and the Government have stuck with and why we would like to see a
residency principle. We believe that the problem is that the Government
will take increasing 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column177" />Column number: 178</div>steps to try and include as many groups as possible when some sort of
universal residency-based pension would be more sensible.</div>
					<a name="07013040000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Gentleman rightly
explains some of the difficulties that may face the Government in
having records that ensure that they can identify these 50,000 people.
He also rightly identifies the problems that employers might experience
if they have to bear the costs. I believe that that was behind the
comments made by the Secretary of State on Second Reading when the hon.
Member for Colne Valley made her speech. I should be interested to hear
how the Government intend to fix these problems. It would be bizarre
for me to suggest that we should have a residency-based pension system
with these difficulties, but then propose a series of detailed and
thought-out amendments to deal with problems of the Government&#146;s
own making.</div>
					<a name="07013040000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">First of
all today I would like the Government to accept as a real concern that
some hard-working people on low pay are potentially not going to get a
basic state pension. I do not think that any of us would want them to
be left out. Then I would like to hear how the Government might deal
with the potential anomaly in a practical way that would not impose
unsatisfactory burdens on employers. That is what I am hoping to hear
from the Minister. If he encourages us to think that the Government
will bring forward measures to fix this, then there will be no need to
press any of the amendments to a
vote.</div>

							<b class="B">Lorely
Burt</b> (Solihull) (LD): I wanted to add a few remarks to
those of my hon. Friend and to remark further on the interesting and
valuable comments by the hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire. When
I first submitted my amendment, I was thinking that a simple and fair
solution would be to widen the eligibility for pension contributions
where people have more than one job but none on its own qualifies
towards national insurance contributions. The simplicity has been taken
out by the practical implications; I will come to that in a moment.
However, I am sure that no hon. Member would deny that, if possible, in
a spirit of fairness, it is desirable to aggregate those
people&#146;s jobs, so that the poorest, who need their basic state
pension the most in retirement, can hopefully be pushed over the lower
earnings limit and therefore be able to make some sort of national
insurance
contribution.</div>
					<a name="07013040000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
Second Reading, several hon. Members gave practical examples of the
sort of person who would be affected. A disproportionate number of the
people who would benefit from the application of the new clause would
clearly be women. One might be a woman who does several jobs to fit
around a caring role. Perhaps she is a dinner supervisor at lunchtime
and a bar steward in the evening. She is putting caring first. She is
literally working all hours. She deserves that the money she is
earning, the fruits of her labours, should count towards eligibility
for her
pension.</div>
					<a name="07013040000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The
hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire discussed the practical
implications. I completely understand his concerns. I thought that his
suggestion about class 3 voluntary national insurance contributions
might be one way of tackling the matter. If someone has two jobs, would
it be beyond the wit of Her Majesty&#146;s 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column178" />Column number: 179</div>Revenue and Customs to facilitate pro rata contributions? Could this be
one instance where the computer says yes? If HMRC can work out complex
formulae and contribution costs, implementing some form of pro rata
system would be possible. That is what I would hope. The Government are
committed to widening the circle of people who can earn credits towards
their pensions. I hope that the Minister will look at the new clause
and see whether the gurus in HMRC could find a way for the computer to
say yes on this
occasion.</div>

							<a name="07013040000483"></a>
								James
Purnell:
						</b> I start by putting the amendment in its proper
context. Our previous debate was about how clause 5 provides for the
earnings rate uprating of the basic state pension, and if no other
action were taken a consequence of the basic state pension being
uprated in line with earnings would be that the lower earnings limit
would also automatically increase by the same amount. Clauses 7 and 8
are therefore needed to prevent that from happening automatically. I
take it from the speeches by the Opposition Front-Bench spokesmen that
they agree that that needs to be corrected.</div>
					<a name="07013040000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">It may be helpful briefly to
explain the lower earnings limit and why we would wish to prevent it
from automatically increasing in line with earnings. The lower earnings
limit, currently &#163;84 a week, is the earnings point at which
employees start to build up entitlement to contributory working-age and
pension benefits. Another way of looking at the lower earnings limit is
to think of it as the benefit entry point.</div>
					<a name="07013040000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">National insurance
contributions do not become payable until an individual has earnings at
or above the primary threshold, currently &#163;97 a week. People
with earnings at or above the lower earnings limit but below the
primary threshold are treated as though they have paid national
insurance contributions. At the moment, the lower earnings limit
increases in line with prices because it is linked by legislation to
the weekly rate of the basic state pension. If hon. Members are
interested, that is through section 5 of the Social Security
Contributions and Benefits Act 1992.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07013040000484"></a>Ms
Keeble:

if they have already paid their national insurance contributions,

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07013040000485"></a>James

&#163;97.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07013040000487"></a>James
Purnell:
						</b> Yes. Once the basic state pension has increased
by earnings, as I have said the lower earnings limit would also rise in
line with earnings. We do not believe that the lower earnings limit
should 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column179" />Column number: 180</div>
						automatically increase with earnings simply as a
knock-on effect of the changes to the basic state pension that we are
making. For that reason, clause 7 breaks the legislative link in the
Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 and that is the
main purpose of the clause. The LEL is prescribed by regulation 10 of
the 2001 contributions regulations and is amended annually by the
Treasury. Regulations made annually by the Treasury through the setting
of the LEL are subject to negative procedures in this House. Clause 8
makes corresponding amendments in the Social Security Contributions and
Benefits (Northern Ireland) Act 1992 as it is just an equivalent change
for Northern Ireland.</div>
					<a name="07013040000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">I turn to the amendments before
us. I am happy to give the hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire the
assurance that he wanted, which is that of course people can make
voluntary contributions if they are earning below the LEL. They can
make class 3 contributions. People in that category who are not getting
NI credits in other ways would get deficiency notices from HMRC which
would alert them to the fact that they had a deficient year and the
possibility of paying national insurance contributions. We are always
open to suggestions on how that could be more widely publicised,
although obviously with the caveat that we would not want to increase
burdens on employers in an unjustifiable
way.</div>

that according to Help the Aged there are at least 50,000 women who
should be paying national insurance if we look at their gross earnings,
we need to be more imaginative and do a bit more, and it would be
possible in terms of existing communications not only from the
Department but also those communications that employers already send
their employees&#151;such as a payslip and a P60. Will he ask his

the hon. Member for Yeovil for raising this issue because it is
important that we debate it. He is right to say that our overall goal
should be to give people contributing, through work or care
responsibilities, the ability to build up state pension entitlements.
However, there is a difference of principle between our approaches: we
believe that certain contributions should be recognised, but that
others 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column180" />Column number: 181</div>should not. For example&#151;this is an extreme&#151;we do not think
that people in prison have the same right to build up contributions to
their basic state pension as someone caring for children or making
class 1 NICs.</div>
					<a name="07013040000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman might have a different point of view. It is worth noting also
that his policy is not for a universal residents pension because that
would imply that anyone in the country over the state pension age would
get the same pension, which would create the illusion that one could
get rid of any kind of means-testing. I think he knows that doing so
would create difficult political problems owing to the sorts of people
who would be getting a full basic state pension. His policy, therefore,
is for a person to build up a year&#146;s contribution for every year

							<a name="07013040000492"></a>Mr.
Laws:
						</b> Returning to his prison example, will the Minister
clarify whether somebody in prison for a period of their working life
will still be entitled to the Government&#146;s minimum means-tested
level of benefits above the basic
pension?</div>
					
					<a name="07013040000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07013040000493"></a>James
Purnell:
						</b> The two are different. One is a poverty
alleviation measure and the other the contributory principle by which
people build up their state pension. So, as always, the hon. Gentleman
has not quite answered my questions about the details of his policy. I
suspect that that is because he does not actually know the answers, or
because they are so unpalatable that he wants to delay setting them out
for as long as possible. However, the Committee has a few more days to
go and we may get more satisfaction before the end of our
deliberations.</div>
					<a name="07013040000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman and other speakers today are right to say that this is
an issue mainly about women. The family resources survey estimates that
fewer than 50,000 women have two or more jobs that individually pay
less than the lower earnings limit, but pay more together. As has been
kindly recognised, many of the measures in the Bill are driven by the
desire to recognise caring contributions more effectively than we do at
the moment. In fact, the core measure&#151;the shift to a 30-year
contribution limit to the basic state pension&#151;will largely
address the problem that we are discussing today. A minority of women
might find themselves in that situation for a period of their lives,
but the reduction in the requirement to 30 years should largely deal
with it.</div>
					<a name="07013040000265"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is worth
saying also that people with earnings below the lower earnings limit do
not necessarily fall through the system. Even though they might not be
contributing through their work, they might qualify for home
responsibilities protection, through child benefit, under our changes
to the weekly credits, or through national insurance credits&#151;for
example, the carer&#146;s allowance. The hon. Member for Solihull
gave the example of women eligible for carer&#146;s credit or
receiving child benefit who, therefore, would be building up an
entitlement. They could also build it up through working tax credits
or, indeed, maternity
pay.</div>
					<a name="07013040000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">So, as a
consequence of the Bill, we will improve the flexibility of those
credits and reduce the number of years required. Taken together, those
two measures will largely address the problems identified in the
amendments.</div>

							<a name="07013040000494"></a>Mr.
Laws:
						</b> The Minister might be coming to this, but is his
objection to the new clause one of principle or simply
practicalities?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07013040000495"></a>James
Purnell:
						</b> I am coming to that. It is indeed the
practicalities. Given the practical difficulties and given that the
other significant measures in the Bill may, in large part, address the
question that the hon. Gentleman is raising through his amendment, the
great practical difficulties of doing this may not be justified by the
benefit that would be achieved.</div>
					<a name="07013040000269"></a><div class="hs_Para">Indeed, the Pensions Commission
looked at this issue and it said clearly in its second report that
requiring employers to record and pass on details of earnings below the
lower earnings level, so that they could then be aggregated, would
significantly increase costs for employers. In that, as in most of this
Bill, we concur with what the Pensions Commission said. The Government
have also looked carefully at aggregation, but I am afraid that there
is no straightforward mechanism to allow earnings from multiple
employers to be aggregated in a way that would not impose excessive
additional administrative burdens and costs on
business.</div>
					<a name="07013040000270"></a><div class="hs_Para">One of the
key principles of national insurance for people in employment is that
both the employee and their employer should contribute towards benefit
entitlement. If the employee alone were to contribute then the amount
of payment needed might be prohibitive. The employer contribution helps
fund entitlement benefits in both the shorter and longer terms. And it
is because of this employer&#146;s secondary contribution that the
system is able to work overall. Unfortunately, that would be very
difficult to do if earnings were to be aggregated in this
way.</div>
					<a name="07013040000271"></a><div class="hs_Para">If earnings were
aggregated, it is not immediately obvious how the employer&#146;s
contribution could be easily calculated. The employer&#146;s
contribution would be variable: it would be a percentage based on an
employee&#146;s earnings in their work compared with their earnings
with another employer. Collecting and calculating it would impose
significant administrative burdens on employers. Indeed, the percentage
required might change from month to month and even week to week. It
might also make the cost of hiring someone uncertain. The employer
would not necessarily know about other jobs that the individual might
have, and therefore whether they would need to pay some
employer&#146;s national insurance contributions.</div>
					<a name="07013040000272"></a><div class="hs_Para">We cannot have a system to
aggregate earnings for benefit purposes but exempt people from paying
national insurance contributions on those aggregated earnings. That
would clearly be unfair. Let me give the Committee an example. If a
person has two jobs, each for 10 hours a week at the national minimum
wage, the total weekly earnings would be &#163;107. But national
insurance contributions would not be payable, either by the employee or
the employer. Another person working the same hours at the same wages
for one employer would pay national insurance contributions of
&#163;1.10 a week and receive pension entitlement. The employer would
pay &#163;1.28 a week. It would clearly be unfair to have a situation
where the person in the first category was given pension entitlement
but did not pay those contributions if someone who was earning the same
amount through one job did.</div>

								Mr.
Laws:
						</b> I quite understand the Minister&#146;s point.
Could he recap on those figures? What would be the excess of national
insurance contributions paid by the fully employed individual in a year
versus his example of the individual who was in two jobs, which was a
times 52 multiplication of the figures he used? I should just like to
be clear about how big an injustice we are talking
about.</div>

Purnell:
						</b> I think we are talking about &#163;58 a week. I
hope that I have avoided my Dan Quayle moment. That may not sound like
a significant amount of money to the hon. Gentleman, but the fact that
one person would pay tax on a level of earnings and receive pension
entitlement and the other person would get the pension entitlement but
not pay the tax would clearly derail this proposal. That is in addition
to all the burdens on
employers.</div>

							<a name="07013040000498"></a>Lorely
Burt:
						</b> I start by apologising for my lack of expertise in
this area. It is not my field. Is the Minister saying that it would not
be possible for the first person in the example, who had the two
part-time jobs, to pay pro rata national insurance contributions, and
that HMRC could not advise the two employers of their requirement to
pay pro rata national insurance contributions? Would that not increase
revenue to the Government, enabling them to pay a basic state pension
in the fair way that they seek to
achieve?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07013040000499"></a>
								James
Purnell:
						</b> I do not think that that would be possible. We
are talking about an end of the labour market at which people might not
have absolute clarity about what they pay; their payments might shift
from week to week due to flexible working patterns. Indeed, their
employers might not have terribly sophisticated pay-as-you-earn
systems. It is worth saying that the effect of burdens on employers at
that end of the market could be disproportionate. Given that we are
talking about people who are not paid significant amounts of money,
even a relatively small burden on employers could have a significant
effect on employment patterns. At that end of the market, the key thing
is to enable people to get back into work so that they can progress to
more hours and higher earnings if
necessary.</div>

							<a name="07013040000500"></a>Lorely
Burt:
						</b> I totally understand; and I agree about the
disproportionate effect on small employers. The Liberal
Democrats&#146; policy on national insurance and employee-related
payments is that in the case of small businesses the employer should
not bear the burden. How would the Government feel about extending the
measure to lift the burden completely from small
employers?</div>

taxation that is received to pay for it in the first place. I shall be
happy to look at the hon. Lady&#146;s detailed proposal when the
Liberal Democrats have decided exactly how they will fund that.
However, I do not want to tax your patience, Mr. Taylor, by
straying too far beyond the amendment.</div>
					<a name="07013040000279"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are, of course, people in

not to have to pay national insurance. It might be that people do not
choose to do that but that they have to, in order to look after
children or somebody who is sick or because it is a temporary part of
their work pattern. That is not a pattern that is common throughout a
person&#146;s working life; it appears to be something temporary. As
I said at the outset, our reforms, particularly the reduction to 30
years for carers&#146; credits, will benefit many people in that
situation. I see that the hon. Member for Yeovil is still doing long
division. I am starting to worry that he is about to intervene on
me.</div>
					<a name="07013040000282"></a><div class="hs_Para">We accept that
other, more difficult, circumstances might result in people not getting
a full basic state pension. It is right that we should seek to
understand who will retire without a full basic state pension and what
circumstances have led to that situation. That is the matter on which I
think the hon. Gentleman was asking us to do more research. I am happy
to give him a commitment to do so. We are undertaking research to
establish more about those who do not qualify for the full basic state
pension. We are also going further, and including those who will retire
in 2025 without a full basic state pension. We hope to publish the
results of that research in summer 2007. Perhaps, at the same time, the
hon. Member for Yeovil would like to publish his proposals as to how he
will fund his universal residential citizens pension at the unknown
level&#151;</div>

this particular problem? I am looking for him to clarify whether he

Purnell:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman was obviously looking for a
calculator when I was making my key commitment to address his concern.
Our research is to look at people who would not be eligible for a full
state pension, both in 2025 and 2050. It is too early to say whether
this is a key contributor to that, or whether it is addressed through
other means&#151;for example, people&#146;s eligibility through
child benefit or the carer&#146;s credit, or because of the 30-year
rule. The key point is to look at the 5 to 10 per cent of men and women
who might not get a full state pension in 2025, and whether that
reflects the contributory principle appropriately or is an
unintended consequence of our policy. That is the research that we are
committing to publish in summer 2007.</div>
					<a name="07013040000285"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I hope that
that gives the hon. Gentleman the assurance that he wants. I have tried
to set out the thinking here. The Bill intends to widen coverage for
people in this category and its main provisions, which we have debated
elsewhere, are the effective way of doing so. A significant burden, in
both administrative and, potentially, national insurance terms would
outweigh the advantage that would come from this
provision.</div>

								Mr.
Laws:
						</b> I want to respond briefly to the Minister. I am
grateful for his detailed explanation. It is useful that he has
acknowledged that the Government fundamentally want this group of
people to be included in the basic state pension system, and that the
issue is entirely one of practicality rather than principle. I also
accept his point that the 50,000 figure is likely to reduce over time,
because of other changes by the Government. I do not know how
significantly that 50,000 will reduce, or whether the Department has
made any estimate of that in relation to other changes. I assume that
it might be quite tricky to do so, as a lot of assumptions would have
to be made, but it would be useful if the Minister would let Members of
the Committee know in writing whether there is, perhaps, an order of
magnitude by which the 50,000 problem is to be reduced.</div>
					<a name="07013040000287"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister has, essentially,
set down a challenge to those who are interested in this
issue&#151;including ourselves and others outside this
place&#151;to table a detailed additional amendment, perhaps at
another stage in our proceedings, demonstrating that the aspiration
here might be practical. Clearly, that could be designed to deliver the
inclusion of these individuals within the existing system, by tweaking
the records of national insurance contributions that they are making,
or by seeking to advantage those individuals, who will be on very low
incomes, regarding those contributions that they do or do not have to
pay.</div>
					<a name="07013040000288"></a><div class="hs_Para">I appreciate
that the Government do not want to create an incentive for people to
give up their full-time jobs and acquire a number of different
part-time jobs. Sometimes, legislation creating such anomalies can
result in people changing their behaviour in an undesirable way.
However, on the face of it I should not have thought that there were
huge numbers of people who are, as in the exchange between the Minister
and the hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire, structuring their work
arrangements around some desire to avoid the lower earnings limit.
After all, the amount of national insurance contributions that they pay
will be pretty small. It is far more likely that they will acquire
these jobs because only part-time jobs are available or
because&#151;as my hon. Friend the Member for Solihull
indicated&#151;they are trying to fit around other caring
responsibilities.</div>
					<a name="07013040000289"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
was trying to do some calculations, as the Minister spotted, on his
&#163;52 and 52 weeks, and everything else. I may have got it all
wrong, as I am not always right on such things, but his estimate of the
cost differential of &#163;52 per week between the individual on low
pay in full-time employment versus the individual who splits their job
into two jobs and gets underneath the LEL, sounded to me very large.
Fifty pounds per week&#151;&#163;2,500 per year&#151;sounds like
a large contribution for somebody on a very low
income.</div>

differential would be &#163;50 per week, but he is now saying that it
would be &#163;50 per year. That is not a particularly large sum of
money. It is not a particularly large incentive to structure
one&#146;s behaviour in a different way. That has left some of us
with some ideas&#151;some problems, perhaps&#151;about how to deal
with this particular anomaly. The Minister has invited 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column185" />Column number: 186</div>

Purnell:
						</b> We now enter the delightfully complex area of the
state second pension, which we hope to make simpler by means of the
Bill. Committee members will know that, since the state second pension
was introduced in 2002, certain groups have been deemed to be earning
at the low earnings threshold, which is currently around &#163;12,500
per year. Some of the groups that have been deemed to be included are
carers and low earners and, as a result, they accrue additional pension
and have double the state earnings-related pension scheme rate,
typically 40 per cent.</div>
					<a name="07013040000300"></a><div class="hs_Para">With clause 9, we want to take
the reforms that we made in 2002 a step, or indeed a couple of steps,
further. We want to allow more people to be deemed to be earning at the
low earnings threshold, thus meeting our objective of modernising the
contributory principle by making work in care count equally for state
pension purposes. This would include those awarded child benefit for
children up to the age of 12, approved foster carers and those caring
for one or more severely disabled people for at least 20 hours a
week.</div>
					<a name="07013040000301"></a><div class="hs_Para">The recognition
of carers ensures that equal recognition for caring is made for both
basic state pension and S2P. These carers, in addition to those already
covered by the original S2P provisions, will accrue state second
pensions because they will have the necessary qualifying earnings
factor, either through earnings alone or through credits alone, as
before.</div>

credits from caring, for example, with their earnings to bring them
into S2P.</div>

does not change what we intend to do; it simply corrects a minor
drafting error. It makes clear the obvious. It does not require someone
who has earned enough to qualify for S2P also to have a credit in a
particular year&#151;for instance, if they are a carer&#151;to make
that year count for S2P.</div>

wider range of carers, parents and disabled people will be treated as
earning at the lower earnings threshold of &#163;12,500 a year for
2006-07 for state second pension purposes. We particularly welcome the
fact that the labour market attachment test, which required people to
pay class 1 national insurance contributions for a 10th of their
working life since 1978, will no longer apply. We are especially
pleased about the provision as it affects carers.</div>
					<a name="07013040000306"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have just one question for
the Minister. The explanatory notes on the Bill state that at present
parents who are in receipt of child benefit for a child under six are
treated as earning at the lower earnings threshold in respect of S2P.
The notes also say that those people in receipt of home
responsibilities protection are treated as being at the lower earnings
threshold. Paragraph 32 of the explanatory notes defines home
responsibilities protection as being awarded to people caring for
children under 16. It is a minor point, which I have raised before with
the Minister, but I should be grateful if he would clarify the issue of
the different ages of children as it relates to qualifying for various
levels of pension in the Bill.</div>

age in respect of qualifying for the state second pension is going up

to 12; the two are being harmonised. There was a question whether we
could have a theological debate on the matter, and I assured the hon.
Gentleman that we could not. The improvements to the basic state
pension more than outweigh the reduction from 16 to 12 and raising the
state second pension eligibility to 12 will bring a significant number

Keeble:
						</b> I shall be brief so that the Minister has time to
respond before we adjourn. The amendments would make the state second
pension more flat rate. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column187" />Column number: 188</div>
						They would bring forward the flat-rating of the
accrual state second pension to increase redistribution rather than
giving increased benefits to the higher earners. That would mean that
the state second pension would be more targeted towards the lower
earners. The amendments would abolish the second accrual rate band,
which gives greater benefits from S2P for those earning more than the
lower earnings threshold, currently &#163;12,500 a year, with
additional benefit accrued on earnings up to the upper earnings
limit.</div>
					<a name="07013040000318"></a><div class="hs_Para">The band would
slowly erode anyway under the present system, so that S2P would be flat
rate by 2030. Abolishing it now would enable a greater level of
flat-rate benefit to be paid to all through an increase in band 1 to
accrual rates of 45 per cent., which would give greater support from
the state for all, rather than the state pension system delivering more
for higher earners. The higher earners can, of course, save for
themselves and can accrue a greater retirement income through private
savings either in existing schemes or through the proposed system of
personal
accounts.</div>
					
					<a name="07013040000364"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.45
pm</div>
					<a name="07013040000319"></a><div class="hs_Para">Generally,
there has been a lot of criticism of the Bill for not providing for
pensioners&#146; needs now. I do not agree; the present generation of
pensioners is supported by other means. Pension credits have been
mentioned, and there are also things such as fuel allowance, the
increase in the personal allowance and the introduction of the 10p
starting rate for tax. However, the group that I have been concerned
about consistently&#151;they are, largely, the people we are talking
about in relation to the state second pension&#151;is women
pensioners. They will start to see some benefits under this scheme, but
will miss out on the more general improvements that will come, either
through the restoration of the earnings link and the reduction to 30
years&#146; contributions or because they are not of the generation
that is earning now and getting the same access to pensions as men
thanks to higher earnings and different working patterns. That gives us
a generation of women between now and about 2020 or 2030 who may need
more financial support in retirement. Bringing forward the flat rate in
S2P and making it more redistributive will make it more supportive for
that particular group at a critical stage before the other improvements
come through.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07013040000521"></a>Ms
Keeble:
						</b> There is clearly an issue of who should benefit
from the different schemes. It is important that measures that are
designed particularly to support those on low earnings should provide
adequate support to lift them out of poverty. Under my proposals, women
would have just over &#163;135 a week, which is not 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column188" />Column number: 189</div>a huge amount for people to live on. Of course it would be nice to give
more money to everybody, but people earning the amounts that the hon.
Gentleman mentions are more likely to have made provision through other
means, or may have savings.</div>
					<a name="07013040000324"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						
						We
have to ask who should be supported by the state and what we are trying
to achieve. Nobody wants to take money away from anybody, but if we are
trying to ensure that women on low incomes, perhaps in marginal areas
of employment, can have a better income in retirement without going on
to means-tested benefits, is it not sensible to make the measures that
are designed to support people on low incomes more rather than less
redistributive and bring them in earlier rather than later? That is the
argument behind these proposals.</div>
					<a name="07013040000325"></a><div class="hs_Para">It would be helpful if my hon.
Friend the Minister could indicate at what point the Government would
introduce the flat-rate &#163;1.40 a week band, and when he would
expect S2P to become entirely flat rate. Is there any scope for that to
happen before
2030?</div>

								James
Purnell:
						</b> I am genuinely grateful to my hon. Friend for her
amendment. She will be glad to know that this one saves money until
2050, and then it has quite a big spike. In her ping-pong with the hon.
Member for Eastbourne, she can quote this one. The precise financial
implications after 2050 are that the costs start to grow&#151;up to
&#163;7.5 billion annually by
2070.</div>
					<a name="07013040000327"></a><div class="hs_Para">The reason why
the amendment would reduce the overall cost is that it moves towards
immediate flat-rating and, therefore, takes out of the Bill the
transitional earnings relation. The issue is worth probing slightly.
First, the Conservatives say that they support the Bill overall, but
their position here is slightly more tentative. Every now and then we
read in the <i class="I">Daily Express</i> or <i class="I">Daily Mail</i> that they are
against the Bill on the basis that it is some huge stealth tax. The
truth is that it is not a stealth tax. Everybody, in all earnings
brackets, benefits from the Bill. Secondly, the Conservatives do not
have an alternative proposal, unless they are proposing to go back to
the old state earnings-related pension
scheme.</div>

							<a name="07013040000524"></a>James
Purnell:
						</b> Of course. I will stick closely to the
amendments, which are about when we go towards flat-rating. What I have
been pointing out all the time is that not going towards
flat-rating would cost about &#163;10 billion per year. That is a
spending commitment, if that is what the hon. Member for Eastbourne
meant in his
intervention.</div>

								Mr.
Waterson:
						</b> We are now in a twilight zone, where the
Minister is making spending commitments for us. To be clear, our
concern, which I will deal with in greater detail later in the clause,
is that the Minister always lumps together the increase in the basic
state pension when he looks at the effects on higher earners. However,
higher earners need to be aware that, even without the amendments
tabled by the hon. Member for Northampton, North, the proposals are
redistributive&#151;highly so, according to some
calculations. That is our point.</div>

Can we return to the subject of the
amendment?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07013040000527"></a>James
Purnell:
						</b> I take your directions clearly, Mr.
Taylor, and we can return to the issue
later.</div>
					<a name="07013040000334"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is worth
reminding the Committee that the state second pension is made up of two
components. Everybody who pays into the state second pension, or is
credited into the system, is assumed to earn at least &#163;12,500,
whether they do or not, which provides for them to receive the
flat-rate amount of S2P. In addition, earnings over &#163;12,500 and
up to &#163;33,540 attract an earnings-related component to the state
second pension. The Pensions Commission recommended that the
earnings-related component should be withdrawn to make way for personal
accounts.</div>
					<a name="07013040000335"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
commission analysis identified three options for accommodating the
withdrawal of earnings relation with the emergence of personal
accounts. First, the commission considered stopping earnings relation
overnight, which would be the effect of the amendment tabled by my hon.
Friend the Member for Northampton, North. At the other extreme, the
second option was continuing with the existing withdrawal path of
earnings relation, which would see us out of the system by the
mid-2050s. The third option, which the commission recommended and we
support, was to accelerate the withdrawal of earnings relation by
freezing the upper earnings limit at the point where accruals to S2P
end. This would see earnings-related accruals out of the system by
around 2030. I can confirm that our goal is to get to that point in
2030. There are provisions in the detail of the clauses to allow for
changes to be made around that date to achieve that and to revoke those
parts of the legislation that would by then have become
otiose.</div>
					<a name="07013040000336"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The
commission recommended that option, which is what we are doing. A
sudden move to flat-rating, which the amendments aim to deliver, would
impact not just on those who would otherwise get a transitional amount
of earnings relation, but on the contracting out of state second
pensions. That could have an unpredictable and quite damaging effect on
final salary schemes, which, of course, are supported by the
contracted-out element related to S2P. Given the importance of final
salary schemes, we decided that that would not be the right approach
and, indeed, the Pensions Commission has observed that a gradual
decline in the rebate would be the most appropriate
policy.</div>
					<a name="07013040000337"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second
objective of the amendment is to increase the accruals rate of the
flat-rate element from 40 to 45 per cent. That would make the flat-rate
element more generous. We have taken a different approach with our
simplification of S2P&#151;the heart of clauses 10 to 12, which we
will discuss in the relevant stand part debates. Suffice it to say that
our approach is simpler to understand and strikes the appropriate 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column190" />Column number: 191</div>balance between flat-rating and a transitional amount of earnings
relation. I therefore urge my hon. Friend to withdraw her
amendment.</div>

							<a name="07013040000528"></a>Ms

					<div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(7) The Secretary
of State shall publish estimates, no later than 1st April 2008, of how
many people he expects to receive less than &#163;135 a week in Basic
State Pension and Second State Pension combined in 2030 and
2050.&#146;.</div>
					<a name="07013040000341"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment is similar to the 29th recommendation from the Select
Committee on Work and Pensions in its report on the Government&#146;s
pension reform proposals and came in the context of a statement from
the Government in response to the consultation on the White Paper in
October 2006. In paragraph 57 of the White Paper, the Government
pointed out that the median value of a state pension for those reaching
state pension age in 2050 would be &#163;135 and that anyone
with a good working or caring life would be entitled to about that
amount. The Government have, of course, already responded to the Select
Committee&#146;s recommendation by publishing estimates, in October
2006. They project that under the White Paper proposals by 2050 about
half the number of individuals reaching the state pension age will have
a total state pension entitlement of at least &#163;135 per week, in
today&#146;s earning terms, and that two thirds will have an
entitlement of at least &#163;125 per week.</div>
					<a name="07013040000342"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment, which is a
probing one, is designed to invite the Government to keep closely under
review the level of pension provision for individuals of the type just
mentioned by the hon. Member for Northampton, North&#151;those on
lower earnings&#151;particularly given concerns that the new personal
accounts will not necessarily be very attractive to those on low
incomes because of the extent of means testing. It is important,
therefore, that we have a good and constant assessment not only of how
much they can expect from their basic state pension and state second
pension provision, but of how the personal account provision will
affect them in the future in order to ensure that it is an adequate
replacement for the benefits that the Government would have sought to
deliver more securely through the existing
system.</div>
