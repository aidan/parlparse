<H4><center>Limit on powers of courts-martial where accused elected court-martial trial</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Crispin Blunt </B>(Reigate): On a point of order, Mr. Makins. What was entirely clear to me, sitting with a wet towel on my head last Friday in my cottage in my constituency when I drafted amendment No. 130, is not now as clear as I try to refresh my mind with the details. I cannot remember whether the amendment was dependent upon the previous group and should have been taken with it. I imagine that it might meet the fate of all the other amendments that I have tabled. I think it is what is known as a probing amendment. With the benefit of the efficiency with which the Minister will have prepared his advice, could he explain its effect? I may then come back and either seek to withdraw it or make a case for it.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I understand the hon. Gentleman's problem. He might consider it appropriate to move the amendment formally. At that stage, the Minister may chose to give a reasoned response, but in any event the details may come back to the hon. Gentleman during the proceedings and the matter could be covered under the clause stand part debate. It is appropriate to take the matter a little further to see how we go.
<P>
Amendment proposed, No. 30, in page 34, leave out lines 28 to 33.—[Mr. Blunt.]
<P>
<B>Dr. Lewis Moonie </B>(Kirkcaldy): I confess that when I first looked at the amendment on its own, I felt a certain bewilderment. The advice given to me was that the amendment was closely related to the previous group. We therefore have a fair idea that, in principle, it was intended to be taken with it—not that we considered challenging the Chair's ruling on the matter, Mr. Malins.
<P>
By virtue of rules made in section 52 F of the Naval Discipline Act 1957, certain punishments awarded by the commanding officer will take effect only with the consent of a superior officer. They are known as warrant punishments. Once the commanding officer has decided that a warrant punishment is appropriate, the accused is remanded and consent to impose a warrant punishment is sought. When consent is granted, the CO will sentence the accused.
<P>
Consent to a punishment outside the CO's immediate powers is not given until the charge has been heard by the commanding officer. As election for trial by court martial would already have taken place, the powers of a court martial would not include these greater powers. I hope that that is clear.
<P>
Subsection (3) is necessary to extend the powers of the court martial when hearing a charge on election. This provision is not required for the Army and Air Force, because consent to extended powers of punishment is granted prior to an individual being given the opportunity to elect for trial. The amendment seeks to delete subsection (3) of section 62ZA of the Naval Discipline Act 1957 as inserted by clause 12. It relates directly to amendments Nos. 128 and 129, although it has been grouped separately. Amendment No. 129 would lift the cap on the powers of courts martial when hearing cases on election, but if the cap in subsection (1) were lifted, the extension of powers in subsection (3) would be unnecessary. Probing amendments have a long and honourable tradition in Committee, and are often a useful way of teasing out thinking on a particular subject.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> In that complex answer, which was helpful, the Minister seemed to say that if in a summary investigative trial, which will involve witnesses and evidence and could take a considerable time, it becomes clear to the accused officer that he will be found guilty, before sentence is passed he will elect to go to court martial, and the entire process will have to be repeated. Have I understood the procedure correctly, and, if so, is it not extraordinary?
<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> I seem to recall that we covered that possibility and that voluntary election will be an option only in certain circumstances, but I shall find out and let the hon. Gentleman know.
<P>
As the amendment relates directly to amendments Nos. 128 and 129, which we have just debated, I do not propose to expand at great length on my reasons for rejecting it. If no limit were placed on the sentencing powers of courts martial in dealing with cases on election, the subsequent provision would be redundant. The Bill gives courts martial the power to operate on the basis of the extended powers of punishment that the commanding officer may invoke with the approval of higher authority. However, given that under the Bill the cap on sentencing powers remains firmly in place, the amendment might, taken on its own, reduce the powers available to Naval courts martial when heating a case on election. I do not believe that that is what the hon. Member for Reigate (Mr. Blunt) is hoping to achieve. On that basis, I suggest that he withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Blunt:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for that explanation. I have still not established what was in my own mind, but I would prefer to be honest with the Committee. I assume that the amendment was linked to those that the Committee considered earlier. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robert Key </B>(Salisbury): I am sure that the Minister is familiar with the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, to which I shall refer in a moment. The proposed new section will impose a limit on the power of courts martial to award punishment in cases that have come before them as a result of an election. The maximum punishment that a court martial may award is limited to the maximum that the commanding officer could have awarded if he had dealt with the case summarily.
<P>
On Second Reading in the other place, Lord Mayhew asked whether clause 12,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>which provides that a court martial shall not impose a more severe sentence than the commanding officer could impose in the case of election for trial by court martial, goes quite beyond and against the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984? Crown Courts can of course impose higher sentences than magistrates. That is not something required by the convention on human rights and is itself likely to encourage elections for trial by court martial rather than by commanding officers—which surely must be deleterious.—[Official Report, House of Lords, 29 November 1999; Vol. 607, c. 680–1.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
As was the case for many of the reasoned arguments advanced in that debate, the response that Lord Mayhew received was slightly lacking, to say the least. Baroness Symons said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I heard with great interest the point made by the noble and learned Lord in his earlier intervention. This issue is about . . . balance . . . We believe that the clause is compatible with the ECHR; but at the same time, we wish to see it compatible in such a way that it upholds the authority of the commanding officer . . . there has to be a balance throughout between, on the one hand, justice to individuals and, on the other, the discipline of the Armed Forces. The Government believe that the clause strikes that balance in a proper and adequate way.—[Official Report, House of Lords, 29 November 1999; Vol. 607, c. 700.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I may be missing something, but I do not detect a specific reply to Lord Mayhew's important point. I hope that the Minister can help us, because it is important that we know whether the clause is in line with the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 or whether it goes beyond it. If he cannot give me that answer, will he undertake to write to members of the Committee setting out the Government's position?
<P>
The clause is flawed for five reasons. Under the new system, the accused will have the right to elect for trial by court martial before the commanding officer has heard the evidence and reached a conclusion. That will inevitably undermine the status of the commanding officer, which is our first objection to the clause. When the accused can receive no greater punishment than the commanding officer can give, there will be no disincentive to elect for court martial. That means that a service man could insist on election for court martial for even the most minor offence, which is our second objection. That could result in court martial hearings dealing with trivial offences, which could lead to a backlog of cases and delays in justice being administered. That is our third objection.
<P>
The Select Committee on Defence said that on the basis of surveys conducted by the Army with army offenders who were currently inmates of Colchester prison, as well as officers and regimental sergeant majors, it was likely that the possibility of a more severe punishment would remain a disincentive. The majority of personnel believed that it remained ``quite high risk to go straight to a court martial'', but the Bill means that the possibility of a more severe punishment will now be removed. The lack of that disincentive is our fourth objection.
<P>
The Select Committee witnesses believed that summary justice administered by the commanding officer would remain the preferred option of most defenders. In the case of personal animosity, however, between the commanding officer and an accused service man, the accused could elect for court martial to spite his commanding officer. The Director of Personal Services in the Army said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I believe, and I think this is the experience of most commanding officers, good soldiers will entirely accept that they have done wrong, they will be in front of the commanding officer and they will take their punishment.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The use of the word ``good'' is interesting, Most good soldiers do not end up in front of the CO. It is the small minority of troublesome, perhaps disgruntled, soldiers or other service men or women who will think that they have nothing to lose by using the system. Too much in the Bill is based on a perfect world model, with the accused service men being of good and reasonable character and team players. In most cases, its provisions will be applied to service men who have done wrong. For a host of reasons, they may not wish to co-operate or acquiesce. They may feel that there are good reasons for them to play the system and the Bill gives them plenty of opportunities to do so.
<P>
There remains the question whether it is truly necessary under the provisions of the European convention on human rights for the clause to be in the Bill, given that it goes beyond and against the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984. That is our fifth objection. Yet again, the Government are gold-plating the Bill, and second-guessing the ECHR. I hope that the Minister will address my point about the Police and Criminal Evidence Act and do his best to allay our concerns.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Blunt:</B> I wish to deal with a particular consequence of the clause, which the Government may have overlooked. Given the way in which the European convention has been interpreted by the European justice system, the clause is unnecessary gold-plating to protect against a perceived potential threat and it therefore serves to undermine the position of commanding officers and the justice system.
<P>
I should like to draw the Committee's attention to the unintended consequence. When the prosecuting authority and the commanding officer are making a decision about whether somebody should go in front of the commanding officer or go to court martial, there are clearly difficult judgments to be made in the range of charges. Those are judgment calls by the lawyers within the system who are advising the commanding officer about how to proceed.
<P>
<H5>2.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
My concern is that, if the case has begun summarily in front of a commanding officer and it is left to the individual to decide whether to elect for a court martial once the process has started, by limiting the power of any subsequent Court martial, the powers available would then only be those that could be summarily dealt with by the commanding officer. In fact, there will be a desire to bypass the summary justice system altogether. It would be much safer never to put the individual in the position of having the right to elect for court martial in the first place.
<P>
If the commanding officer is thought to be robust and it is felt that the unit is going to deal with an offence in a way in which the prosecuting authority has confidence, the commanding officer could be expected to deal with it robustly and give the maximum sentence for an offence which would otherwise go to court martial if it was felt that a proper set of punishments should be available.
<P>
There is a difficulty if the individual says that he wants to elect for trial by court martial once the summary justice system has started The prosecuting authority, which had made the decision to let the case go before the commanding officer rather than to a court martial is likely to be reluctant to risk that. It may be felt that, if he appears before the commanding officer who, given the way he has administered justice within his unit, is likely to give him a robust sentence, he would be able to take his punishment and soldier on. Such judgments will be made informally. They will not be made formally because, on the face of it, they may be improper. There is a system within which people give advice to commanding officers about what they must do legally. The system is administered by individuals—by commanding officers and the chain of command—and that is why it is not compliant. However, that is why I and those who have been part of it believe the system is just. It has give and take within it and there is no desire within the chain of command to be seen to be being unjust to those over whom they are exercising command because that would be entirely self-defeating.
<P>
I believe that the unintended consequence of this clause is the suggestion that we should forget the commanding officer altogether. The individual should not begin the process of summary justice because he would then be able to make an election for court martial, at which the punishments are limited to those available to the commanding officer. People will say ``We do not want him to have that opportunity, so we will never let him appear in front of the commanding officer.'' Under section 83 of the 1955 Acts the Defence Council may make regulations concerning the charges that can be dealt with summarily and, where there is an overlap between cases that can be tried by either court martial or the commanding officer, cases will be sent to court martial. At least one could then be sure that the court martial would have a proper range of punishments available to it and the individual would not be allowed the opportunity of pulling the lever on the slot machine, as it were, to see whether he could get the result he wanted at court martial. As every soldier knows, one is more likely to get an acquittal at a court martial than in front of a commanding officer. Because the court martial is limited to the same range of punishments available to the commanding officer, people will choose that route.
<P>
That is the problem with the clause. It flies in the face of the reality of every unit of the armed forces. People know the system and they know the indifferent quality of Army prosecutions. I can give the example of a case in which I was the assistant prosecuting officer. A soldier stole a colleague's bank card when the latter was on exercise, after having been told the PIN number to get some money for his colleague in town. The soldier emptied his colleague's bank account, withdrawing up to the limit on about 15 separate occasions. There was documentary evidence; indeed, the whole works. One would have thought that that was a pretty straightforward, open-and-shut case and that any prosecutor would have secured a conviction. Sadly, I regret to say that in my experience of the Army legal corps and of Army prosecuting authorities, that is not the case. The main prosecutor was a young lawyer captain who had been in the Army for three or four months. It was one of her first cases so admittedly she was inexperienced. When she was halfway through the prosecution case, the defence silk got up and made an application to the judge advocate that the case be dismissed because there was no case to answer. It was an extraordinary situation. The judge advocate, who had watched the prosecuting counsel's appalling performance, then demanded that she make a case for continuance. She broke down in tears, under that pressure from the judge advocate. I sat beside her wondering what on earth was going on. I think that I applied for a recess. So we had 10 minutes in which I explained to her what she had to do—she had only to make the point that the guy had taken money from his colleague's bank account on 15 separate occasions, drawing out money until there was none left. However, she was still in a state and I asked to take over the case myself, but the judge advocate would not allow it. That experience should have been unique, but sadly the Army—I cannot speak for the other services—does not attract top-notch lawyers to prosecute such cases. Consequently, defence counsel, who mainly come in from the civil sector, run rings round them.
<P>
So the clause gives people a direct incentive to go to court martial, where the lads all know that justice is much less likely to be done and they are more likely to get off, with the help of a bright brief who will destroy the inadequate case of the not-so-good lawyers working for the Army prosecuting authority. The effect of the clause is to make it in an individual's interests to go to court martial because there is no risk: the range of punishments is exactly that available to the commanding officer. Indeed, there is a direct benefit in going to court martial because people know that they have a good chance of getting off with a good brief.
<P>
In the civil sector, if one decides to exercise one's right to go to Crown Court and is then found guilty, one incurs a bigger tariff, and it should be the same in the military sector. It should be in the minds of soldiers, sailors and airmen who want to exploit the system that they face a greater tariff if they go to court martial. That is the main argument against the clause. The secondary argument against it is that the prosecuting authorities will think, ``Hang on, we do not want a case to go in front of a commanding officer, so we can avoid an individual making an election that will limit the options to summary justice from the commanding officer. Let us undermine the position of the commanding officer yet further and establish a system whereby we get individuals in front of a court martial, without the risk of a larger tariff.'' That would be the consequence of the clause. It is highly deleterious to the position of commanding officers and it should not be part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Would it be possible under the European Court of Human Rights to have a more severe tariff where an accused stands before a court martial than if he were dealt with summarily by his commanding officer? If so, that would be in accordance with the procedures in the civil courts and I cannot understand why the Government have not gone down that path.
<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> We went over many of these points earlier and I do not propose to repeat them in detail, except to say that the military system of discipline is distinct from the civil one. We accept the need for summary punishment, despite the fact that we know that does not comply with the convention on human rights. It is not a matter of being afraid of getting tied up in European courts for years. On 2 October this year this becomes part of British law and can be challenged in the British rather than the European courts. They are likely to hand down decisions on non-compliance within a day or an afternoon. It is vital that we have a system of justice in the armed forces that is compliant, otherwise it will certainly lead to our forces legal system falling into dispute.
<P>
<B>Mr. Blunt:</B> That is one of the key points where we are at odds. There is legal advice being given one way and legal conclusions being drawn the other about whether the system is compliant. Since there will be a quinquennial Bill next year and this does not come into effect until 2 October, we could allow the system to stay as it is. If there is a subsequent judgment in front of the British courts that strikes this down—and I do not believe that there should or would be—that will be an opportunity to change the legislation. There is a good case for saying that the present system is compliant.
<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> I am afraid that there will not be an opportunity to change the legislation. A decision such as that would have to be complied with immediately. Legislation would have to be rushed through both Houses; it would be done in a hurried fashion and mistakes might be made. It is far better to do it the way that we have chosen, which is to spend as much time as possible in drafting the Bill. Hon. Members will note that there has been only one Government amendment and that is on a good technical point, into which I need not go now. A sign of the effort that we put into drafting the Bill is that it is compliant and watertight.
<P>
If there were a negative decision in a British court, there would be no option to change the legislation; we would have to comply with it immediately. If the system of justice is non-compliant, some redress has to be offered, otherwise challenges to the summary system would certainly be brought to the courts and be successful.

<P>

<B>Mr. Blunt:</B> That does not stand up to analysis. If a judgment in a British court arose around this clause, there would simply be a defence counsel instruction to courts martial that, if they find themselves dealing with someone who had elected for trial, rather than going in front of his commanding officer, they cannot impose a sentence greater than that which would have been available to the commanding officer. That could simply be an instruction—it need not be included in the Bill. As long as no court applies a sentence more stringent than that available to the commanding officer, the subject of further appeals would not require immediate legislation.
<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> We want to ensure that when somebody makes a decision to elect or not—and remember that they will not know at that stage what the penalty will be—it is made as fairly and objectively as possible. The threat of a superior punishment, simply for having the impertinence to elect for another court, should not be allowed to interfere with that. It should be made on more logical grounds. There is still a risk to be taken and that was recognised by offenders in Colchester, as we know from evidence given to the Select Committee by Brigadier Ritchie. Their general impression was that, even with this change, there would still be a chance that they would receive a mid-line punishment within the tariff, which would overthrow the court martial. They could get a higher tariff within the appropriate band, so there would still be a small element of risk—not enough, in their opinion, to make them think twice before doing it simply for the sake of doing it.
<P>
We could argue all day about the hosts of barrack-room lawyers whom the armed forces' discipline system fails to instil with the ethos that we think is appropriate. That is nonsense. There is no evidence for it. Our barracks are not hotching with people who are looking to buck the system. Young men make mistakes. As was properly said, the behaviour of many of them who commit offences, if not excusable, is understandable in a group of young men. We do not have a plague of horrors lurking in dark corners in our barracks, waiting to pounce on us when we enact this legislation. I do not agree with the hon. Gentleman. Clause 12 is perfectly fair. We are bending over backwards to ensure that we are fair, because we want the legislation to be watertight; the last thing we want is for it to be challenged after 2 October. That would be stupid.
<P>
<H5>2.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> May I revert to a point that I made this morning? With respect, the Minister did not answer it adequately. If he is saying that he wants the same level of civil rights for service men as for civilians, why do civilians have the right to elect for trial by jury rather than in a magistrates court? The Government are trying to restrict that right in a Bill that is going through the House. Furthermore, there is no right in the Armed Forces Discipline Bill for the commanding officer to refer a case to a court martial, but in civil law a magistrate would have a right to direct that the case be heard by a superior court before a jury. The procedures that we are adopting in the Bill are totally different from civil procedures. I cannot see how the Minister can argue on one hand and be consistent on the other.
<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> The CO has always had the right to refer a case to a court martial, if appropriate. The Bill does not change that. It is not in the Bill, because it has nothing to do with the Bill. We are talking about a civil case. I shall not argue the merits of a Bill, which I support, to bring the English system closer to that in Scotland. I have said that I am prepared to defend it. In principle, there are many unnecessary elections for jury trial at present, which are a deliberate attempt to obfuscate and escape from the consequences of one's actions. What the Government propose is correct.
<P>
<B>Mr. Blunt rose—</B><P>
<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> No, I do not intend to give way. It is an extraneous point. In that situation we are talking about two compliant courts; here we are talking about one that is not compliant and one that is. We must have appropriate appeals and procedures available to compensate individuals for the summary hearing not being compliant.
<P>
<B>Mr. Blunt:</B> The question that was asked in Colchester was, ``Do you expect court martials to give a higher tariff than a commanding officer?'' The answer is yes. Another question that needs to be asked, which is especially relevant here, is, ``Do you think you have a better chance of getting off in front of a commanding officer or a court martial? Where are you more likely to receive justice?'' The answer is, ``You are much more likely to get off in front of a court martial''. That is why the incentives put in place in the Bill based on a level playing field point in one direction only.
<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> That does not alter the fact that they have the right to do it. Whether the hon. Gentleman wishes to accept it or not, they must have the right to elect and, in turn, a right to use the appeals procedure that we have set up for summary hearings. If people tend to abuse it, that will become evident when we start to apply it. I do not believe that that will happen; nor does anyone who knows anything about it. Plenty of people know nothing about it, but have inordinately long-winded opinions on the subject. They cannot read the future; nor can I. I would back my judgment against any of them—and I have finished speaking.

<P>
<B>Mr. Blunt:</B> I confess I have not had enough time to refresh my mind on the amendments because of my concentration on the debate about the previous clause and I ask the Minister to explain why they should not stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> It is the misfortune of this Minister that, although it may be possible for Members to take a few minutes to clear their minds of the detritus of the previous debate, I do not have that option.
<P>
<B>Mr. Key:</B> Would the Minister like to change places?
<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> No, that is not what I meant. I shall do my best to explain the reason why we are opposing this amendment. Paragraph 1(4) inserts a new subsection (9A) into section 83B of the Army and Air Forces Acts 1955 which provides that the prosecuting authority may not proceed with a case where it wishes to prefer a new charge or amend, substitute or add another charge where an election for trial by court martial has been made unless the accused has given his written consent. If no consent is forthcoming we must refer the case back to the commanding officer to be dealt with afresh. Paragraph 2(2) inserts an identical new subsection into the Naval Discipline Act 1957. I imagine it is for convenience. It saves the prosecuting authority having to refer the new or amended charge back to the commanding officer to be dealt with from scratch.
<P>
The amendments propose that the prosecuting authority may deal with alternative charges both without consent and without referring them back to the commanding officer if they could not be dealt with summarily in the first instance. However, because of the cap on the powers of a court martial if it is hearing a charge on election, a change to a charge which had reached the prosecuting authority by way of election would still attract that limitation on sentencing powers.
<P>
I understand the hon. Member for Reigate's point, that it may seem illogical for the Bill to require the prosecuting authority to refer revised or substituted charges back to the commanding officer, only then to have the commanding officer refer them back to the prosecuting authority because they cannot be dealt with summarily anyway. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will be pleased to learn that there is a very logical reason for this. If a court martial is hearing a charge on election, the court's sentencing powers are limited by virtue of the provisions in clause 12 to the maximum the commanding officer could have imposed. We have debated the reasons for that at length. However, unless we have the procedures in the Bill, this cap would also apply to any case heard by the court as a result of an initial election regardless of any changes to the charges made by the prosecuting authority in the interim. Therefore the court would be limited in its powers of sentence, regardless of the severity of the charge that is eventually heard. By requiring the commanding officer to refer the charges to the prosecuting authority afresh, we are ensuring that the court martial has the full range of sentencing powers available to it. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will concede the unintended effect of the amendment. It was possibly not quite what he had in mind when he tabled the amendment and I hope that he will withdraw it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Blunt:</B> I suspect that the purpose of my amendment would achieve the same purpose as the clause. If the Minister agrees, I shall be content to withdraw it.
<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> I did not intend to be patronising. The hon. Gentleman is not the only person who has difficulty in understanding exactly what is meant by some of the clauses of even the most clear legislation.

<P>

<B>Mr. Blunt:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Amendment proposed, No. 133, in page 51, leave out lines l3 to 19—[Mr. Blunt]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 135, in page 51, leave out line 34.
<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> It may be helpful if I explain the schedule and the reasons why the hon. Member for Reigate should withdraw the amendment. We do not think that the provisions that he seeks to amend need to be included in the Bill. In the process of its construction, we realised that there was a loophole in the existing system. Currently, the prosecuting authority may only direct that the accused has been dealt with by a court martial for the offence charged after a charge has been preferred and before the trial has commenced. The purpose of declaring that a matter should be deemed as having been tried by court martial is to ensure that it is not left hanging in the air.
<P>
However, if a charge were referred to the prosecuting authority that it does not believe should be tried and which should not have been preferred in the first place, all that the prosecuting authority can do is explain to the commanding officer why it does not intend to proceed. Even if the prosecuting authority were to say that, for legal and public policy reasons, no further proceedings should be brought by the commanding officer in relation to the charge, it cannot dispose of the charge under the current powers. It would be a misuse of a statutory power to begin proceedings only to discontinue them, solely to dispose of the charge.
<P>
In those circumstances, following the prosecuting authority's decision, it is possible that the commanding officer may not accept that he should not proceed summarily on either the same charge or a different charge on the same facts. If that new provision were not included in the Bill, we envisage at least two consequential problems arising. First, individuals may elect for trial by court martial. If that happens, the charge ends up before the prosecuting authority again and we are back to square one. Secondly, if the individual were dealt with summarily and found guilty, he would be able to appeal to the summary appeal court arguing that there had been an abuse of process. It is inconceivable that the prosecuting authority would actually contest the case, but it would still be necessary for an appeal to take place to overturn any finding that the charge was proved. That would involve a great waste of time and money in order to ensure that the summary conviction was overturned and, more importantly, would place the appellant in an unacceptable situation.
<P>
The revised subsections that the hon. Gentleman wants to amend are not very different from the current provisions. The main distinction is that the new subsection includes an additional power to deal with cases when, for whatever reason, the prosecuting authority considers it inappropriate to prefer any charge following referral from the commanding officer. That is in addition to the existing power to discontinue proceedings on any charge that it, the prosecuting authority, had already preferred.
<P>
An example of when the prosecuting authority may decide to exercise the powers direct that the accused has been dealt with by a court martial for the offence charged is when it considers that there is not a realistic prospect of conviction or if it considers that a trial would not be in the interests of the service. Such a direction means that the accused may not be tried under the service discipline Acts for the offence. Those provisions are designed to ensure that the situation that I have described does not occur.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman's amendment would remove the new subsection and leave the original provision unchanged. Perhaps he will, on reflection, accept that the changes to the admittedly complicated procedures are a necessary consequence of our bid to ensure that the disciplinary system is fair and equitable and does not involve the unnecessary continuance of inappropriate proceedings.
<P>
<H5>2.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Blunt:</B> I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for explaining why the Government have introduced the provisions. The test that I apply is based on my experience of what commanding officers might face, and I do not have the faith in the prosecuting authorities that the Under-Secretary clearly has. He described the case that was in my mind, in which the commanding officer thinks that an individual ought to be charged, to maintain discipline in his unit, but the prosecuting authorities take the case away from the officer and decide not to proceed. I suspect that all hon. Members have received letters from constituents who are outraged that the Crown Prosecution Service has dropped a case because it cannot be bothered, does not have enough people, finds the case too difficult or has failed to assemble the evidence correctly The victim of the crime will write to us and say, ``Why on earth didn't this case come to trial?''
<P>
A similar situation could occur in units in which commanding officers must administer discipline. If the prosecuting authority decides to discontinue proceedings, after taking a case away from the commanding officer, so for the purposes of what is proposed in schedule 2 the case may be done and dusted, the commanding officer would have no opportunity not to accept the prosecuting authority's decision. Although those circumstances are highly unlikely, he would not be able to say that he believed that the prosecuting authority was positively acting to undermine the administration of justice in his unit, the maintenance of discipline and good order and the necessary functions that he required to keep his unit together.
<P>
I hope that the Under-Secretary will pay attention to the fact that we do not live with perfection. Despite the good intentions of those who operate the prosecuting authority, it does not have the confidence of commanding officers. Only in exceptional circumstances would a commanding officer insist on his right to put an individual through the justice system in the teeth of the prosecuting authority's opposition. However, if a commanding officer wanted to do that, he should have that power. It would be a highly controversial decision in the chain of command, because he would be taking on the prosecuting authority by insisting that proceedings take place.
<P>
The individual involved could be remanded for court martial, but the prosecuting authority may be overstretched, incompetent or unable to put a prosecution together and may decide to drop proceedings. I was thinking of the case, in which I was involved, of a soldier who was charged with theft and who went to court martial. But let us assume that the case did not go to court martial. In the regiment, everybody knew that the man was a thief and that he had stolen from his mates. The prosecuting authority, however, decided that it could not get a result and threw out the case. In such a case, the commanding officer would be left saying, ``Hang on a minute. I've got an entire regiment that thinks with good reason that this guy is guilty, but he has got off, because the prosecuting authorities have dropped the case''. What is he to do? Under the terms of the Bill, there is nothing that he can do. He cannot even make a gesture of protest—the case is gone. The commanding officer is faced with that situation in his unit.
<P>
The reason why I want to press the amendment is that the commanding officer should have the option of saying, ``I will not be party to an injustice inside my unit. I will insist that the justice system begins''. In exceptional circumstances, an individual could go in front of the commanding officer and say, ``I wish to elect for court martial'', because he assumed that the prosecuting authority would drop the case, as it might already have decided to do, for whatever reason. If the accused elected for court martial in that way, the commanding officer could make it clear that he was determined that the prosecution should go ahead, in the interests of maintaining discipline in the unit, and that he was prepared to act against the wishes of the prosecuting authority.
<P>
A commanding officer would take such action only very rarely, when there was a really serious reason for doing so, and we should not undermine his position by taking that option away. He could be faced with a case in which someone returned to his unit and be able to do nothing about it. He would not even be able to make a gesture, if the prosecuting authority was absolutely determined on the course that it was setting. If, in a case in which the individual had elected for court martial, the case could go back to the prosecuting authority, there could be re-examination at a more senior level within the judge advocate general's department or the Army prosecuting authority, to establish why the commanding officer was making such a fuss and why he was taking the extreme step of exploiting the powers available to him to put the individual back into the justice system. The authority would establish the facts of the case, have a closer look at the prosecution and examine the reasons why the commanding officer, with all his knowledge of his unit and the circumstances of the offence, was taking that serious step.
<P>
I hope that I have convinced the Minister of the arguments relating to that situation. There is no problem with the European convention on human rights, because, if the accused went back into the justice system, he would have the same rights that he had before. There would be no finding against him, because the prosecuting authority would have decided to drop the case. However, the amendment would allow the commanding officer to demonstrate that he was not prepared to accept the decision of the prosecuting authority to drop the case, and invite the authority to think again; thus, he could demonstrate that he was making a command decision about the merits of bringing someone back into the justice system in those circumstances. The Committee should reflect on the position of the commanding officer and accept the amendment.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I want to ask the Under-Secretary about a circumstance covered by the amendment, or at least by the schedule. The schedule and the amendment are complicated, and the Under-Secretary read his reply quickly. Without the benefit of studying his reply in Hansard, I find it difficult to tell whether the particular circumstance that I shall outline is covered. If the Minister cannot answer, he might ask his officials to examine it.
<P>
I refer to a circumstance in which the accused has opted for trial by court martial, and all the evidence is gathered and the due processes followed, but, when the case comes to the court martial, it is immediately clear that the wrong charge has been brought. In this case, the court martial considers that there has been an offence, or a potential offence, and that a new and different charge should be brought. Paragraph 1(4) of schedule 2 contains the words:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>unless the accused has given his written consent or the charge is being referred under section 83BB of this Act.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is therefore immediately clear to the prosecuting authority that the charge is wrong and that a different charge ought to be brought. The barrack-room lawyer of the accused would not give his written consent for the new charge to be brought, so the matter would go back to the commanding officer. The accused would then opt to go back to a court martial convened on a different day and in different circumstances. That seems to be nonsense. The court martial should be able to hear a different charge.
<P>
Will the Under-Secretary give me his views on that? The method that I have outlined may be deliberate for reasons of compliance with the European convention on human rights. If not, I should like him to consider what I have said. In a civilian court, if a person elects to go to trial in a Crown court and has the charge thrown out, it would be possible for a different charge to be brought against that person before that court. The matter would not necessarily be referred to a magistrate to be dealt with summarily.
<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> I shall refer first to the points made by the hon. Member for Reigate about the procedures where an individual may elect for a court martial. The right to a court martial at the start of summary proceedings means that if the charge were referred back and another summary case were brought, the individual could automatically request to be sent to court martial again. He no longer has to accept a summary verdict. We have included the provision to ensure that we do not end up going round in circles. There is no longer the option of amending the charges to suit.
<P>
The Army prosecuting authority is different from that which supplied legal support at the time of which the hon. Gentleman spoke. It has been made independent because of the Findlay judgment to ensure that it is compliant. Obviously, the prosecuting authority has to be independent. Whatever the hon. Gentleman thinks of it, it must be given the right to deal with criminal cases as it thinks fit.
<P>
The APA is the only body that will undertake what is known as the evidential test, analysing the strength of the evidence. That test is not undertaken by a commanding officer, and never should be. It is not performed by inexperienced people, but by those who know the law and know whether a case will stand up. Prosecuting authorities often take decisions that are incomprehensible to us as constituency Members of Parliament. Whenever I have had the opportunity to discuss such decisions with them, I have always realised that I had not considered some facts in my ignorance of the law. Unfortunately, commanding officers are in the same situation. If we are to provide a system that is fully compliant, we must recognise that anomalies might exist, and we must ensure through the schedule that that does not affect the process.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman would agree that we must not let the situation become a game of ping-pong, with the court martial saying, ``No, sorry, you've got it wrong again.'' I am not being facetious, but that would start to bring our discipline system into disrepute.
<P>
I shall be happy to write to the hon. Member for Cotswold about the point that he made. I think that it is covered by the situation that I have described, but I am not certain.
<P>
<B>Mr. Blunt:</B> The issue turns on the inclusion in proposed new subsection (13) of the extra provision about whether
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the prosecuting authority . . . decides not to prefer any charge referred to him.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In those situations, the prosecution fails to bring charges or even to begin the prosecuting process.
<P>
It is unlikely that there will be a merry-go-round, with a commanding officer going on and on. I wish that I had the faith that the Minister has in the Crown Prosecution Service and the Army prosecuting authority. He has said that in his experience, whenever he has gone back to the CPS it has had a good explanation for the decision not to proceed. That is not my experience.
<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> The explanation is not always good, but within the judgment of the CPS it is sufficient. That is all that the CPS has to do; it does not have to justify its decisions to me, to the hon. Gentleman or to anybody else. Its independence allows it to make those decisions, and to stand by them, right or wrong.
<P>
<H5>3 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Blunt:</B> I understand that. However, if I may speak not in a representative but in an individual capacity—I have had items stolen that had my name on them. They were found, but the CPS then decided not to proceed with a case of possession of stolen property. Given that the theft had been reported, one would have thought it an open-and-shut case, but from the point of view of the CPS it was not worth prosecuting.
<P>
If a commanding officer finds that the independent prosecuting authority is acting to undermine his authority, for whatever reason, by deciding not to proceed with the charges, he should be given the opportunity to say, ``No, I really want this guy to go for trial.'' He may want to deal with the individual summarily, but if the individual has elected for trial a second time, or—this is more likely—was remanded for trial by court martial from the start, the case would never go in front of the commanding officer. The commanding officer may decide that what happened in his unit was so serious that he does not want to deal with it himself, and push it up to court martial. He may then find that the Army prosecuting authority decides to drop the charges and the prosecution is not begun. What should the commanding officer do when the guy comes back to his unit?
<P>
There should be an option for the commanding officer to say, ``The authority didn't deal with it, but I am going to deal with it. I must deal with it because I now have a real problem: I have someone in my unit who everybody knows has committed an offence.'' The guy may have committed an offence of trust against his mates or an offence of military discipline that is regarded seriously by his colleagues in the unit. That is the circumstance that we should allow for in the Bill.
<P>
I understand that the Minister wants to prevent a merry-go-round, but the case would not bounce backwards and forwards in the way that he has suggested, because the Army prosecuting authority would begin proceedings, bring the charge and then drop it, if the authority was confident of its position. The option would not then be available to the commanding officer, but at least the point would be flagged that he wanted the charges preferred and the prosecution case begun. If the individual had elected for trial by court martial a second time, the Army prosecuting authority could of course end the matter by beginning proceedings and dropping them, thereby taking them away from the commanding officer.
<P>
The commanding officer would also have to feel confident about taking his course, because it would raise all sorts of questions from his superior officers about his judgment. He would have to be sure of his judgment in challenging the authority of the Army prosecuting authority. We should give him the power to do that if he has the confidence, and we do not need to do more than leave the existing legislation as it is, by adopting our amendment.

Schedule 2 agreed to.
<H4><center>Clause 14</center></H4>
<H4><center>Summary appeal courts</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Key:</B> The Secretary of State has described the introduction of a summary appeal court as a second avenue for appellants who have not taken up the right to elect court martial. This in effect means that appellants have the option of refusing the CO's decision, if it is not to their liking. Would such an amendment not lead to the subversion of a commanding officer's authority, both in the eyes of appellants and of their peers who remain in service throughout the proceedings?
<P>
If a second avenue of appeal is necessary to keep us from entanglements with the European Courts, would it not be simpler to allow the accused to elect a trial by court martial once the commanding officer has found the charge proved? Would this not better provide the avenue of appeal desired? It appears that the Government have yet again amended armed forces procedure with too much emphasis on compatibility with the ECHR and not enough attention to the consequences for morale and fighting effectiveness.
<P>
The Government consistently demonstrate a reluctance to address the intangible qualities of the armed forces—fundamental aspects, such as corporate concepts, traditions, habits and emotions. They need to ask themselves three questions before they propose such legislative changes. What makes the military unique? What can we afford to change? What do we need to keep in order to preserve our fighting effectiveness? It should be obvious, but the commanding officer's authority is something that should be preserved and not challenged.
<P>
The commanding officer's authority is a fundamental part of the formal command structure that enables the downward issue of instruction and the upward issue of reports. It provides a framework for responsibility and mechanisms for discipline and it is a foundation stone of military effectiveness. That may sound trite, for those who do not understand or have any concept of the military, it is an impenetrable fog. People simply do not understand what is meant by ``the chain of command'' and how it works in the British system. It is also true that the British regimental system is not easily understood by most other nations, even our close military allies. In the United Kingdom we have a different view of how to maintain discipline and provide effective fighting forces. That framework is important and the chain of command is the backbone of it.
<P>
Integration into the European legislative realm must not be at the cost of effectiveness. The Government are undoubtedly keen, if not determined, to demonstrate their European credentials. They have set themselves lofty targets in the sphere of European economics, politics and the military, but they must not forget that effective European co-operation must harness a thoroughbred, not a cheap donkey.
<P>
The Bill introduces a right of appeal to a new summary appeal court established under each of the three Service Discipline Acts. This supplements the right to elect trial by court martial by offering to those who have been dealt with summarily a second avenue to a court that the Government hope is now compliant with the European convention on human rights.
<P>
We understand that the appeal on finding, or on finding and sentence, will take the form of a re-hearing along the lines of an appeal to the Crown court from a decision of the magistrates court. The rules of the court will be similar to those of the Crown court. The rules of evidence will mirror those in the civilian system, with appropriate modifications. It would have been helpful to have had an answer from the Minister about the point that I made about the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984. There might still be time for that.
<P>
Appellants will now be entitled to legal representation at the hearing of the appeal before the summary appeal court. They will also be entitled to apply for legal aid for this purpose under the services legal aid system. I have already mentioned at some length the problems with legal aid. Even under the services legal aid system, we are not convinced that the MOD has thought through sufficiently the resources that might be needed, in terms of people and of money. We are reassured that there is a substantial training programme under way, but we still think that the financial and manpower figures that have been given will be inadequate.

<P>

<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> My hon. Friend considered the problem when discussing the financial costs of the Bill. What happens when a person is dealt with summarily, serves the greater part of the sentence and applies to an appeal court and is let off? Under the rules of the European Court of Human Rights, will they be able to claim compensation? From what part of the Government's budget will it come?
<P>
<B>Mr. Key:</B> I am not a lawyer. I hope that the Minister will take up the point and obtain advice. I imagine that it would be quite in order for compensation to be sought. I look forward to the Minister's reply. My hon. Friend raised an important point, which underlines my point. We do not believe that sufficient resources have been anticipated.
<P>
The sentencing powers of the summary appeal court will also be restricted so that the sentence cannot be more severe than that imposed by the commanding officer. There will be no appeal from the summary appeal court on the facts, but an appeal on a point of law will be allowed to the High Court.
<P>
The proposal to establish summary appeal courts was cited by several noble Lords during the Bill's passage through the other place as the one that might most seriously undermine the position of the commanding officer. That is why we take the debate on clause stand part so seriously. In particular, the need for the summary appeal court was questioned by Lord Carver on Second Reading. He said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I am even more concerned at the proposal to establish summary appeal courts. That seems to me the greatest potential threat to the authority of the commanding officer. The accused man or woman will already have had the choice of deciding whether to be tried by his commanding officer or by court martial, and will have chosen the former. To allow him then to say that he does not like the commanding officer's decision and to refer either finding or sentence, or both, to a separate court not only fundamentally undermines the commanding officer's authority, but, as several noble Lords have said, will take time and will involve considerable effort and expense.—[Official Report, House of Lords, 29 November 1999; Vol. 607, c. 687.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Government's plans to set up summary appeal courts are, in our opinion, deeply flawed. Not only will a service man offender now have the ability to circumvent his commanding officer, by immediately electing for court martial, but even if he does not take that route he can immediately say that he does not like the decision that the CO has made following summary proceedings. The Government have evidently made it clear that they regard the summary discipline process as being under threat from the ECHR. But these new procedures are undermining the system in such a way as to make it virtually meaningless anyway. The new procedure is doubly flawed because a second avenue already exists that makes our disciplinary procedures compliant with the convention. Under the Armed Forces Act 1966, the accused may elect trial by court martial once the commanding officer has found the charge proved. That provides the accused with an avenue of appeal—to a court martial—against finding and sentence.
<P>
<H5>3.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Baroness Symons said that the new system
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>provides a further check which will enable an accused person to make a free choice as to the mode of trial, knowing that he will always be able to face an ECHR-compliant tribunal.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
She added that it was
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>arguable that the present arrangements, which were drawn up with the convention in mind, rely too heavily on the individual creating a situation that is compatible with the convention. It depends on his or her choice as to whether he or she is tried by a compliant court. I understand that that was thought sufficient when the Armed Forces Act 1996 was being prepared.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
She also said that the Government's legal advice was such that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>it is now considered that a right of appeal is also necessary to make the procedures associated with summary dealings compatible with the convention.—[Official Report, House of Lords, 29 November 1999; Vol. 607, c. 698-9.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
She explained that the advice, which has evolved since 1996, was that the summary appeal court was necessary.
<P>
Yet again, more is being included in the Bill than is necessary for compliance with the ECHR. In discussing the right of appeal against a summary sentence, Ministers have referred to the arrangements only in terms of ``may not'' as regards compatibility with the ECHR. They have mentioned only the possibility of a challenge to the powers of the commanding officer. The clause once more fits into our theme that the Bill sets in train a process of gold-plating service discipline and second-guessing the ECHR. I make no apology for repeating that point. It is fundamental.
<P>
The Defence Committee also took that view. It said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>It was not obvious to us that the whole system of summary appeal courts is necessarily required under the ECHR . . . Some have argued that the summary appeal court may be a case of over-insurance against possible future European Court of Human Rights' judgements, and that it is the aspect of the legislation which is potentially more damaging to the CO's authority. It may be that the MoD see this as a prudent measure to anticipate future ECHR cases, but the Minister needs to address this argument in debate on the later stages of the Bill's progress.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Minister has another opportunity to take up the challenge from the Defence Committee—or, indeed, from members of that Committee who are present this afternoon—to explain what it meant.
<P>
Such gold-plating and second-guessing undermines the authority of our commanding officers. So far, the Government have chosen to brush aside 99 per cent. of the criticisms that have been made of the Bill. However, they owe it to our service men to give our anxieties a proper hearing. We genuinely fear that the proposals will erode the status of the commanding officer.
<P>
On Report in the House of Lords, Lord Campbell of Alloway tabled an ingenious amendment that proposed the establishment of a military appellate court that would deal solely with the determination of convention issues arising in the course of the disciplinary process under service discipline legislation on appeal from courts martial or courts martial appeal courts in order to ensure compatibility with the convention. His amendment was based on the Lord Chancellor's supposed willingness to consider designating military courts as the appropriate forum for considering complaints made on convention grounds by armed forces personnel.
<P>
The amendment was thrown out by the Government, who seemed to be reneging on their earlier assurances. Baroness Symons said that the Ministry of Defence had investigated designating military courts to deal with convention issues that arise in the military, but had ultimately decided that they were unnecessary. She stated that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the staffs of all three services were clear that, after careful consideration of the matter, they saw no justification for setting up, training and staffing such a court.—[Official Report, House of Lords, 18 January 2000; Vol. 608, c. 992.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That reasoning seemed odd, as Lord Campbell's amendment proposed establishing the court on an ad-hoc basis as and when the need arose. Such occasions would be few and far between, and the staffing costs would be far less than those for the proposed summary appeals court. Perhaps the Minister will reconsider that proposal if he wants to save money.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Has my hon. Friend considered that, in civilian courts, High Courts have the power to decide whether an appeal should be allowed? Under the Bill, there is no such power for the summary courts. If the accused wishes to appeal, no matter how frivolous the grounds, we have to go through the expensive and time-consuming procedure of an Appeal Court.
<P>
<B>Mr. Key:</B> That is exactly my understanding; if I am wrong, I should be grateful if the Minister would tell me. Throughout our discussions, it has been my assumption that no one has had any choice in such matters and it will be up to the service man—the accused—to make it clear whether he wishes to go to court martial, however trivial the case. Are we right on that point? We shall be delighted to hear that we are not.
<P>
The Select Committee was also concerned that the new right of appeal would result in large numbers of personnel appealing against their commanding officer's judgment, because they would have everything to gain and nothing to lose from the new arrangements. The Army estimates that about 20 per cent. of cases will be taken to the summary appeal court. That is a large number and we can only hope that it is an overestimate. It is stark evidence that the summary justice system is in serious danger of erosion and permanent damage.
<P>
In the early stages of our proceedings, the Minister dismissed the possibility that officers could be sued by their men if they did not like the decisions that they made. The change that the Government are instituting today is not a million miles removed from that proposal. We were mildly reassured to learn that, in the first year of operation of the new system, the Army intends to review sentences that the summary appeal court hands down to ensure consistency with sentences given by commanding officers. The measures to introduce summary appeal courts dramatically slow down, interfere with and, in our view, further damage the summary justice system. Such provisions are dealt with in later clauses, but I wish to touch on them now.
<P>
At present, sentences imposed by a commanding officer, following summary proceedings, begin immediately. The Government are now altering that, so that any sentence of detention is suspended until the period of 14 days, during which an appeal may be lodged, has elapsed or, if an appeal is lodged, until the appeal has been heard, unless the accused chooses to begin the sentence immediately. Yet again, the potential for abuse is clear, even if it were the norm that most service men, once punished, will want to get on with their punishment and clear the air. That is yet another time when decisions will have to be made about custody when the convicted may not have access to legal advice about which route to choose.
<P>
We also learned from the proceedings of the Defence Committee that the target time in which appeals will be heard is 90 days for all three services. The Committee's service witnesses said that that was no different from the present situation for personnel who elect trial by court martial. It remains the case that summary proceedings relate mostly to less serious offences, so people could hang around for 90 days if they were unhappy about their punishment for, say, losing their identity cards, which is a common offence in the military.
<P>
Can the Minister imagine how that would impact on the authority of a commanding officer? It can only impart an idea of the commanding officer's inability to enforce punishment, while reinforcing the feeling of impunity of a determined or demoralised offender. Yet again, the current rapid and effective system of summary justice will end up being dragged out into a quasi-legal quagmire. The Minister for the Armed Forces said to the Defence Committee:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Life is not without tension, even in the best ordered societies, but . . . we view as manageable.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The description of ``manageable'' is a particular view from the Whitehall ministerial perspective, but try telling that to a commanding officer on an operation faced with a rebellious insubordinate playing out the new system to his own advantage.
<P>
It is not on for Ministers to gloss over such points. Summary appeal courts could irrevocably damage the summary justice system. That view has been made forcefully by many senior ex-service men, and their concerns were not adequately addressed by Ministers.
<P>
It has not been conclusively proved that these changes are necessary under the ECHR. We believe the Government are taking a foolhardy course of action. I hope that they will think again. With these new measures and this new right of appeal, the Government are cutting off their nose to spite their face.

<P>

<B>Mr. Viggers:</B> I am reinforced in my view that those who drafted the Bill know a great deal about the European convention on human rights but nothing much about the procedures and ways of the Army, Navy and Air Force. To his great credit, the Minister has not sought to demonstrate that the system that the Government proposal is better than the previous system; he simply says that it is compliant with the European convention on human rights and that is the way it is.
<P>
It is important to realise how the present system works. To take the example of an individual soldier, sailor or airman who has lost his identity card. That is not the most grievous of offences. It is serious because of its security implications, but it does not imply a great deal of criminality or mens rea by the individual concerned. In such a case there is no doubt that, if there were to be summary proceedings, the summary judgment would be consensual. The commanding officer would probably say, ``Smith, you've been a clot and I have to impose the following sentence or finding.'' That is my experience, both in the armed forces and in my constituency.
<P>
I can think of fewer than five cases in many years in which individuals or their families have told me at constituency surgeries, in conversation or through casual contacts or meetings in the street, that their husband, father, son or other relative has suffered injustice. Those cases are rare because they are consensual. The way it works is that the individual is made to accept that he has done something wrong. He accepts that. He takes his judgment and moves on. In this way, it is very different from the civil justice system. The magistrates tend to be better than judges. Quite often the judge speaks to the accused as though he were beyond contempt: ``Take him down!''
<P>
It tends not to work that way in military courts. I therefore very much support the present system. Changing it would be severely prejudicial to discipline and good order. We have a summary judgment system that is reviewed by a higher service authority. It is clearly laid down that an individual who is aggrieved at the judgment imposed on him in a summary judgment procedure can have it reviewed by a higher service authority. That works quite well, as I have explained.
<P>
We are now introducing a system where the individual can either go for summary proceedings or for court martial. If he goes for court martial, that will inevitably a more extensive and more protracted procedure. If he goes for summary proceedings before his commanding officer, that will not end the matter because there will be a clear opportunity for him to go to a summary appeal court, where he will be heard by a judge advocate and two independent officers. If he appeals, the appeal on finding, or on finding and sentence, will take the form of a re-hearing along the lines of an appeal to the Crown court from a decision of a magistrates court. Therefore, the rules of the court will be similar to those of the Crown court.
<P>
If the appeal is by way of a re-hearing, it is almost inevitable that the summary appeal court will pass judgment on the previous judgment of the commanding officer. It is almost inevitable that, if there is to be a summary appeal court with a judge advocate and jury of independent officers, they will have to say: ``We uphold the judgment of the commanding officer because,'' or ``We don't uphold the judgment of the commanding officer because.'' If it is the latter, inevitably there will be explicit or implied criticism of the commanding officer that will be prejudicial to discipline and good order. For that reason, I oppose the setting up of the summary appeal courts.
<P>
I also oppose setting up summary appeal courts because appellants will be entitled to legal representation at the hearing before the summary appeal court and will be able to apply to the services legal aid system. That will be yet another drain on the scarce resources of the Ministry of Defence. As the sentencing powers of the summary appeal court will be restricted so that a sentence cannot be more severe than that imposed by a commanding officer, again the accused will have nothing to lose by appealing. The system is shaped by those who are anxious to comply with the European convention on human rights and takes no account of the systems in the Army, Navy and Air Force. The clause is one of the worst in a bad Bill and I shall oppose it with relish.
<P>
<H5>3.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I wish to return to the point that I made in an intervention on my hon. Friend the Member for Salisbury (Mr. Key). The necessity of the power of appeal under the ECHR is arguable, because, as my hon. Friend said, the accused already has the right to opt for a court martial in the first instance. If he or she has opted to be tried summarily, he or she has waived the right of appeal. In addition, a test or threshold should be introduced which comes into operation before an accused person has the right to be heard by these expensive and time-consuming courts. A court should be satisfied that there are good grounds for a case to be heard. That is the norm when either the Appeal Court or the House of Lords hears a case from a lower court. For the same reason, they would not take it on automatically. The Government may need to look at this matter again and we may need to return to it on Report. I would be interested to hear what the Minister has to say, because in trying to become ECHR compliant, we may, as many of the noble Lords have said, be going completely overboard.
<P>
Will the Minister also answer my point about compensation? Having read a little further since I made my intervention, I see that the summary appeal courts must hear a case within 90 days. I suspect that there is no power in the Bill for that period to be extended. There are bound to be extenuating circumstances in some cases, such as need to find a replacement for a member of the appeal court in the event of a death. Where an additional witness or further evidence is needed to strengthen the case, the accused may also wish to ask for more time. Where the accused has served part of the sentence—which may be custodial—if the summary appeal court subsequently dismisses the case, presumably compensation will be sought. In that event, who will pay? Will that be a further drain on the Ministry of Defence's already overstretched budget? I suspect that the Under-Secretary will tell us that it will. When an appeal court dismisses a case, the accused may want to go to the European Court and ask for compensation from the British Government. That has happened before and will no doubt happen again in this increasingly litigious age. Compensation might need to be paid. Is that included in the Under-Secretary's £6.5 million estimate of the cost of the Bill? I suspect that it is not, and it shall be interesting to hear what he has to say.
<P>
<B>Mr. Martin Bell </B>(Tatton): I listened with interest to the speech made by the hon. Member for Salisbury. I do not share his party politics, but he often makes a lot of sense.
<P>
I hang out a lot with soldiers. I did so before I became a Member of Parliament, which they thought a bizarre career move. Fortunately, they have not yet ostracised me. In a curious way, they value the court martial system as it stands, not least because it provides the opportunity of acquittal for squaddies. Whether innocent or guilty, they know that they have a chance. They do not have the same confidence in the procedures of the Ministry of Defence police.
<P>
Is the change absolutely necessary for the European convention on human rights? I would also like an answer to a question that I raised earlier about the degree of enthusiasm or reluctance with which the chiefs of staff endorse the changes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Blunt:</B> The points made by the hon. Member for Tatton (Mr. Bell) are central. My hon. Friend the Member for Gosport (Mr. Viggers) said that the clause was one of the worst clauses of the Bill, but let us be in no doubt: it is the worst clause. Setting up summary appeal courts will have the Bill's most damaging consequences We are talking about the vital ground of the armed forces. We want to protect the summary justice system from the European Court. It is important to the services because it is justice administered by the chain of command. There is trust as part of the system between the commanders and those who are commanded. If the system of discipline that they employ is not just, it will rapidly fall into disrepute.
<P>
Soldiers, sailors and airmen know that the justice dispensed by their commanders has a reputation for being one of the fairest systems of discipline and administration of justice. It is much fairer than any civilian system in my experience, and is likely to ensure the right result. It starts going wrong at court martial, when defendants think that they have more chance of getting off. The system comes into a little disrepute when it goes beyond the administration of summary discipline by the chain of command.
<P>
I do not question whether it is proper for courts martial in our system to deal with more serious charges. They must have legal advice and be properly constituted. When trials take place at that stage, there is no reason why they should not meet the test of compliance with the convention.
<P>
What are we doing here? What we are doing is really damaging. Ministers in the other place and on Second Reading have told us that it is necessary to establish such provisions to meet the convention, but no case exists that means that we must set up such a system. No case law is forcing us to do it. What legal advice has the Minister received? The Committee should read it in detail and I hope that, when the hon. Gentleman responds, he will tell us who gave the Government such an opinion. Let us read those opinions in defence of the clause that have driven not only the Minister and his colleagues in another place to such a conclusion, but the chiefs of staff. We have been told that the chiefs of staff want the Bill because they want their justice system to be compliant with the convention and that their legal advice has drawn them to that conclusion.
<P>
What legal advice? I do not accept that argument until I receive details about it. There is no case law for setting up the summary appeals courts, so why are the Government intent on doing it? That system is a serious undermining of the commanding officer's authority. It is utterly indefensible to set it up until it is established in front of the European Court of Human Rights. Our armed forces are to operate a justice system that must be compliant because we are not willing to take the time and trouble to obtain a reservation for them under the convention. We should not set up the system until we are forced to do so. It will be so damaging to the armed forces. That is as plain as a pikestaff to anyone who has seen justice being administered in the services.
<P>
Commanding officers must dispense justice that is seen to be just and defensible because they have a trust to uphold in front of their units. During operations in extreme circumstances, they have to give orders that must be obeyed and when an accused appears in front of his commanding officer, it is called ``commanding officer's orders''. The commanding officer makes a judgment on the case and then gives an order for the sentence. The clause will establish the right of an individual, having received an order from his commanding officer, to say, ``I don't agree with that. I want to appeal'', even though he has had the opportunity to go through a compliant system.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Viggers:</B> My hon. Friend's point is one that I was groping towards earlier. When the commanding of officer and the accused walk out of the court, they must have and retain mutual respect, because they must have to work together in a military environment. That is how the system works and if it is to work successfully, as it has done so far, the accused, having been sentenced by the commanding officer, will remain respectful of the commanding officer and continue to serve, perhaps saving each other's lives. That is how the system works.
<P>
<B>Mr. Blunt:</B> I agree with my hon. Friend. Under the present system, when the commanding officer has given his orders about the punishment for an offence, that is the end of the matter. The soldier then gets on with serving out the punishment, paying the fine, serving a sentence of detention or complying with a restriction of privileges. It is then finished. If he is a good soldier, he gets on with his job.
<P>
The clause, however, will open up the opportunity for the individual to say, ``I don't agree with my commanding officer.'' The matter will then go to the summary appeal court. Hopefully, every commanding officer's judgment will be upheld by that court and it will be felt that there is no point going there because commanding officers, even at the margin, always get it right. But that will not happen. There will be occasions when the summary appeal court reduces the sentence that is imposed by the commanding officer and that will put the soldier in the unique position of feeling, ``I've got one over on him. I don't want to obey his orders. I will find another way round it.'' That will be deleterious to the commanding officer's authority. So why are we putting this into law? Why are we putting in a process that is deliberately going to undermine the position of commanding officers?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Has it occurred to my hon. Friend, on this theme of undermining the authority of commanding officers, that it is often difficult enough to get evidence in a civil case where events are often relatively slow. On active service, trying to get accurate evidence may be extremely difficult and it may depend on one officer's word against another.
<P>
<H5>3.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Blunt:</B> That is true and that comes to some of the consequences of having a summary appeal court and an opportunity to question the commanding officer's authority if a court martial has not been chosen in the first place. As my hon. Friend the Member for Salisbury points out, we will have to have a completely different standard of proof. The point about summary justice is that it is just, but it is more rough and ready than the justice administered with lawyers crawling all over every piece of evidence,
<P>
<B>Mr. Martin Bell:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman accept that the commanding officer has a duty of care, which is a concept no lawyer has even heard of?
<P>
<B>Mr. Blunt:</B> That is precisely the point. If the commanding officer is not just, very rapidly his authority will explode around him. He will be unable to carry the confidence of the men and women he leads. The commanding officer tries to run a disciplined system that is fair but rough and ready and does not necessarily take in the laws of evidence and everything else. He is not a lawyer and it is not a system designed to be administered by lawyers. It is a system designed to be administered by soldiers, sailors and airmen—and to work. If all the decisions of the commanding officer are to be crawled over by lawyers—first by the summary appeal court and then by lawyers for the accused, who, according to the Bill, will not get legal advice when it goes to the appeal—there will be the ability to legally unpick the quality of evidence brought against the accused. The evidence is almost certain to be true, but whether it is evidential and meets the law of rules of evidence is a wholly different matter. That is why, as part of the costings of this exercise, there was provision for 55 more military policemen so that they could gather the evidence with the expertise of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 and so that ordinary summary proceedings taken in front of a commanding officer would be properly in line with the rules of PACE.
<P>
<B>Mr. Key:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that there is another reason why this is such a dangerous and damaging measure? It will lead to the fragmentation of unit cohesion. One of the remarkable things about discipline, whether on board ship or in an Army unit, is that once a sentence has been passed down summarily, there is an amazing knitting together of the members of the unit immediately. It is the fastest rehabilitation system ever to be found. Perhaps someone has been a naughty boy. Perhaps they have received a sentence. The next day, however, they may be fighting together in a trench or they may be facing a hostile mob in a peacekeeping exercise, They bind together and knit around each other again whatever has happened. That will be destroyed if there is a cloud remaining over the head of one of those people for many months.
<P>
<B>Mr. Blunt:</B> My hon. Friend is right and it does not just relate to being on operations or fighting. It relates to training together and to peacetime activity as well. I want to come later to the issue of timing and how long this wretched process is going to take.
<P>
We have, however, come to the question of the necessity for proof. That is going to then drive all sorts of other unwelcome consequences. Suppose there is a situation where a sergeant, in the normal circumstances that we have now, would report a soldier for an offence. The case against him may be, in evidential terms, rather questionable. It is not, however, a serious offence and not one that would usually go to court martial. There is an implicit understanding that the individual involved would know that he had done wrong and that the sergeant and his NCOs would know that he had done wrong, and the NCO could bring a charge that would lead to a minor disciplinary hearing in front of his commanding officer. However, as that process may now culminate in an appeal to the summary appeal court, NCOs trying to administer discipline will say, ``Forget this. I can't build a case against so-and-so for dirty boots or being late on parade'' or whatever the offence is.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I am sorry to intervene on my hon. Friend again, but to follow on from that theme, the burden of proof will be the same as that for civil courts—beyond reasonable doubt. I shall give my hon. Friend an example, and ask whether he thinks that it would pass that test. If a weapon is discharged, and it cannot be conclusively proved that a particular soldier was responsible, the soldier would get off on that charge. Does my hon. Friend agree that individuals who might hitherto have been charged with a minor offence and have received a minor disciplinary charge will now get off, leading to an erosion of discipline in our armed forces?
<P>
<B>Mr. Blunt:</B> Yes, and ultimately that is precisely the point. The military system of justice at summary level has been seen to be fair and just, and that is why it works and why people are content to be judged by it. There is a rough and ready aspect to that system. Under the Bill, evidence that will stand the attention of a lawyer and meet the requirements of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act must be produced in order to deal merely with the raft of small offences of minor disciplinary matters that have hitherto been dealt with summarily. Dealing with minor matters summarily helps to retain a unit's cohesion. People know that they cannot step out of line by being untidy, late or mildly insubordinate and that they will be punished for such offences.
<P>
If an evidential case must be constructed that will survive the scrutiny of a professional lawyer if it goes to the summary appeal court, an alternative system of justice will be established. NCOs who administer discipline will not use the summary justice system. They will take soldiers to the back of the barrack block and thump them. That was how it used to be done. That is how to ensure that a platoon understands who is the boss and how command and discipline will be maintained. That will be the reality.
<P>
The Bill will create such circumstances. NCOs do not have time to fiddle about trying to produce enough evidence as proof against lawyers. That is the job of the military police, who interview people for serious offences in line with the Police and Criminal Evidence Act to ensure that prosecutions brought for serious cases before district or general courts martial will stand up to examination by professional lawyers. That will be the consequence of the system that we are creating.
<P>
The old-fashioned system of justice might be rather better than the one that we are putting in place now. That is the reality. The hon. Member for Crawley (Laura Moffatt) looks appalled. How is an NCO supposed to make his section work for him and respect him if he has lost faith in the summary justice system that sits above him and reinforces his authority and rank? That is why we must not include the clause in the Bill.
<P>
The quality of evidence that will have to be produced for minor proceedings is a problem. Also, the time taken from when someone has been sentenced by his commanding officer to when he makes a decision about appeal, and then to when he is in front of the appeal court, is a cancer in the Bill. I am sorry to detain the Committee on the subject, but it is terribly important. This is the worst clause in the Bill. As an ex-serving soldier, I am determined to ensure that the case is made properly and fully. My hon. Friend the Member for Gosport and I, who have served in the armed forces, are making it clear that the clause is a disaster for the forces.
<P>
The point about timing is a cancer that will undermine the authority and discipline of a unit and its commanding officer. Once someone has been sentenced by his commanding officer, he has 14 days to decide whether to appeal. Later, we shall discuss an amendment to shorten that period tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Salisbury. In those 14 days, if the soldier does not know what to do—if he does intend to take his punishment, turn to the right, get on with it and get back to duty as fast as possible—he will have all sorts of pressures brought to bear on him. His wife—or his girlfriend or boyfriend—

<P>

<B>Mr. Viggers:</B> Or both.
<P>
<B>Mr. Blunt:</B> Yes. Some such person might say, ``Hang on, this is really unfair. You don't have to stand for this.'' His mates will say, ``You can appeal.'' At the moment, he has to turn to the right and get on with his punishment. He has always had the option of court martial if he does not have confidence in the justice that would be administered by his commanding officer.
<P>
The individual will consider whether to appeal rather than get on with his punishment, so another 14 days will effectively be added to the time that he is in dispute with his commanding officer. He will make his appeal and will have to go to the summary appeal court. We are told that there is a target date of 90 days, but we all know what target dates are. We shall be lucky to get near 90 days; it will probably be more like 180 by the time everyone has gathered, the case has been prepared and presented, a lawyer has been appointed from the legal aid system and legal advice has been given. Throughout that time, a cloud will be over the unit and the commanding officer. It will also be over the individual concerned, because he has not been allowed to turn to the right, take the punishment and soldier on.
<P>
I beg the Committee to think seriously about what the consequences will be. The hon. Member for Crawley looked horrified at the suggestion that there may be punishments at the back of the barrack block. Perhaps my instinctive sympathy for NCOs who find themselves in that position is misplaced. People must use the justice system available, but I hope that she understands that my sympathy is based on experience. We shall make NCOs' lives more difficult than we should, which is why the clause should not stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> I have listened to much talk over the past three quarters of an hour and I cannot confess that I have heard anything new. I listened to every word that has been said so far about the Bill and, I regret to say, that, although much passion has been generated, there was little logic in the speeches and certainly no new argument to convince me to change my mind about the central plank of the Bill. It will remain, irrespective of the views expressed by Opposition Members.
<P>
As for Lord Campbell of Alloway, there is already an appellate structure for dealing with matters arising in service disciplinary proceedings, including convention points. There is no need therefore for a specific court for convention points. An appeal court could deal with them. The civilian system was referred to earlier. Anyone convicted in a magistrates court has an invariable right of appeal to the Crown court. It cannot refuse to hear the appeal. Only a higher appellate court can refuse leave to appeal.
<P>
<H5>4 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Much has been made of summary punishments and delays. Most of them are not custodial and would take immediate effect. A custodial sentence would not normally be expected for the loss of an ID card. The usual punishment for that would be a fine. As for the time for appeals, 90 days is a target, not a limit, and we hope that appeals are held within such a time.
<P>
There will be no case for compensation because there will be no serving of a custodial sentence, pending appeal. Therefore, there will be no basis for a claim of false imprisonment, which is the only claim that could be raised. No costs will be arising from such matters. I almost hesitate to cite the opinion of senior officers and allow them to remain anonymous, unless Opposition Members particularly wish me to name them. Over the past few weeks, we have had frequent briefings with people and, hoping to catch one officer on the hop, at the end of an interview during which we had not mentioned the Bill, I asked him directly what he thought of it. Without a blink of an eye, he said that he was 100 per cent. in favour of what we were doing and that he supported the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Viggers:</B> Will the Minister explain why he thinks that former chiefs of staff who are now in the other place are so vociferously against the Bill, while serving chiefs of staff support it?
<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> Many of those who were opposed to the Bill originally withdraw their objections to it when they had heard all the arguments. They said that they had had due cause to think again. The longer one has been absent from a position of command, the more that one thinks that one is better fitted to exercise it than those who currently occupy the seat. That relates not just to the armed forces, it happens in most professions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Key:</B> The honourable and jovial Minister is the second Minister who has repeated the canard about what happened in the House of Lords after Christmas. Prior to that time, several noble and gallant gentlemen had expressed their opposition to the Bill, while, after Christmas, only one noble Lord was present when a particular amendment was being discussed. He withdrew the amendment and, during the speeches on that amendment, there was no reference whatever to the principle that he still objected to the principle of the Bill. It is no good the Minister saying that everyone withdrew their objections. They did not.
<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> Those people certainly did not press their objections. It has been improperly suggested why only one noble Lord turned up after Christmas, while everyone else turned up before. However, we may find ourselves with the same problem.
<P>
If there were not adequate evidence to establish an offence, the commanding officer would never bring a charge in the first place. It will not be done just on the basis of supposition. Nothing undermines a bond of trust between a commanding officer and his soldiers more than poorly administered summary justice. That is agreed throughout the ranks of officers in the armed forces. A summary appeal court is designed to reduce the likelihood of that occurring.
<P>
Justice in our forces is administered arbitrarily and incompetently in many cases at present, and an appeal court will not be detrimental.
<P>
<B>Mr. Blunt:</B> Why, then, does the Minister think that it is military policemen who conduct interviews around serious cases that are likely to lead to charges that will go before a court martial, yet it is sufficient in the summary justice system for evidence to be gathered by NCOs? Is he suggesting that the standards that apply for courts martial should apply to the summary justice system, so that everybody who is taking evidence has to be trained in the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984?
<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> No, I am certainly not. The summary justice system—as I have said repeatedly, and I will say again for the benefit of the Committee, since memories appear to be rather short on the Opposition Benches—is something that we support. We are trying to underpin it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> Not just now. The summary justice system is at times administered incompetently and unfairly. It has been recognised as right that there should be an appeal procedure that complies with the convention on human rights, which, will be incorporated in British law this year and will come into effect in October. At present it is possible to appeal through the chain of command against a summary punishment. The difference is that that is not a compliant source of appeal. We must have one that is.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Before the Minister concludes his summing up on the clause, will he deal with my point about whether there should be a test or threshold that has to be considered by the summary appeal court before it decides whether to convene?
<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> No, the right is of appeal. The court does not have the right to refuse an appeal. The right is to appeal against a summary decision; the appeal court cannot set conditions on that. Just as there is an automatic right to appeal at a magistrates court or a Crown court, there is a right to appeal in this case, and that must be preserved.
<P>
<B>Mr. Blunt:</B> The Minister has made a serious charge against the administration of summary justice in the armed forces. He has said that in many cases it is incompetently and unfairly administered. In making a case for these measures, he is presumably saying that the administration of justice in the armed forces is inadequate and that these processes are required to address that. Is that his argument?
<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> I have made the argument and I shall not make it again. If many appeals are heard and are successful, it will be clear that cases have been incompetently brought. If, as I suspect, people sharpen up their act and ensure that cases are heard summarily and punishments are properly administered, appeals will be unsuccessful. It will quickly become recognised by the barrack-room-lawyers whom Opposition Members are so fond of citing that there is no point in wasting time and that they may as well take their punishment and get on with things. We will find out by experience. If the system at present is administered fairly, as the hon. Gentleman seems to think, he has nothing to fear from appeal courts. If it is not, those concerned have the right to have improper decisions reversed.
<P>
The summary appeal system is essential to the Bill. I have already said that we are talking not about European but about British justice. Appeals will be to British courts. We could be found to be in breach of the convention and automatically have to introduce certain measures. We cannot, in all conscience leave that to chance. We have been given thorough advice and the Bill has been drafted well. I believe passionately that this part of it is essential and I support it.

<B>Mr. Key:</B> The clause is a short one and we will not divide on it. It requires that judge advocates for the summary appeal court be appointed by the judge advocate general. Because of the strain that that will put on the budget, many of us wish that the Lord Chancellor did so—but that is another question. The clause also refers to the section in the Acts that specifies the qualification for a judge advocate: at least five years' experience as a qualified lawyer. We will return to the issue of qualifications in the next clause.
<P>
When the Select Committee heard evidence, it questioned whether five years was sufficient experience. The Chairman wondered whether such officials might effectively be barely out of university. The head of the Bill team explained to the Select Committee that that provision also applied to judicial officers. Lord Renton tabled an amendment in the other place—which was then withdrawn at Committee stage—that proposed the extension of the qualification period to 10 years so that judicial officers should have more than five years' membership of the Bar or as a solicitor.
<P>
I listened carefully to Lord Renton's argument and felt that he was partly a little distressed at the fact that his daughter was doing so well at the Bar; he seemed to be saying that he could not believe that she was that good. I dare say that hon. Members on both sides have sometimes doubted their children's extraordinary success—``Is this really my little child?'' I suspect that some of us, at least, have been in that position but most of us immediately come to our senses and realise that our children are brilliant.
<P>
Lord Renton noted that in the main, judicial officers would be judge advocates, advising the courts on the law and using their experience in the law to be effective. He believed that 10 years' experience was a more appropriate requirement than five years. The Government rejected the amendment on the grounds that the 10-year qualifying period would reduce the pool of lawyers from whom judicial officers could be appointed. Ministers argued that that would in turn reduce flexibility—and, as we were regularly told, the Bill was all about flexibility. Baroness Symons said that if passed, the amendment would make the implementation of the provisions much more restrictive and make the new procedures more difficult to operate. Lord Renton was not persuaded that five years was long enough, believing that it was a matter deserving of further consideration, but withdrew his amendment.
<P>
While we recognise some merit in Baroness Symons' reasoning for rejecting Lord Renton's amendment, he raised an important point. Given that judicial officers will have extensive powers in the military legal process, there is a lot to be said for having officers with a few more grey hairs than is the case at present. I would be grateful if the Minister could clear up for us whether judicial officers will mostly be judge advocates.
<P>
Although we will not divide the Committee on the clause, I would be grateful if the Minister could give the Committee a run down of the likely profile of judicial officers and judge advocates in terms of age, experience and background. A wise voice of experience and authority will obviously be needed in many of the disciplinary cases that these officers will face.
<P>
We may pursue the matter further on Report should we remain concerned about the position.

<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Although this appears to be a small clause and relatively straightforward, there are one or two points on which I wish to question the Minister. First, what happens in the event that the accused objects to the appointed judge advocate? Will that be possible and, if so, will that judge advocate retire from hearing the case? Under what circumstances, and how will that vacancy then be filled? Also, what happens in the event that a judge advocate, for one reason or another—perhaps a death—becomes indisposed in the middle of a hearing and has to retire? Will the case have to be re-heard in its entirety? There are a number of questions there. Some of these points may be covered under the order-making powers in clause 22 but not all of them are and I should be grateful if the Minister would consider them.
<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> First, on the latter point of the hon. Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown), as far as I know there is no right to object to a judge advocate just as there is no right to object to a judge. When one comes to trial, one comes before the judge to whom the trial has been allocated and the same would be the case in this instance.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Since the Minister is so keen that human rights are compliant, can he tell the Committee why that is? In section 92 of the Army Act 1955, in the case of courts martial there is the right of appeal against a judge advocate. Why should there not be a right of appeal against a judge advocate in the summary appeal court cases?
<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> It may well be that I was mistaken, in which case I am quite happy to withdraw that and tell the hon. Gentleman otherwise. If I am wrong, I will let him know in due course.
<P>
There is a difficult balance to strike on the 10-year or five-year requirement. Any decision will be arbitrary in that there is no specific point in anybody's career at which they become competent as opposed to incompetent. It is to be hoped that as they progress they will become more competent. These people will have undergone normal training, completed a law degree, their articles, other periods of training and possibly diplomas. I think that five years is a fairly substantial period of legal practice. On balance, I think that we have it about right. Any less than that and I might begin to feel uneasy. It has to be a matter of balance and that is the advice I have had. It is not just a matter of finding ourselves with an unduly-restricted pool if there were a 10-year requirement—although that would be the consequence. I honestly feel that five years is a reasonable balance. That is five years' postgraduate work and in most fields of life one has become reasonably competent in one's profession by that time.
<P>
The clause is not about judicial officers who deal with custody but judge advocates who deal with appeals. Most judicial officers will be judge advocates, but not all judicial officers can be judge advocates. Judge advocates' age of retirement at present is 40-plus [Interruption]—Sorry. The eyes are getting tired. The age of recruitment at present is 40-plus so they are clearly people of considerable experience.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> The Minister failed to answer one of my points. Could he tell the Committee what will happen in the event of the judge advocate becoming indisposed during the course of a trial? Will that trial have to be re-heard in its entirety?
<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> I think we covered that point earlier and I think that the trial would have to be re-convened, just as it would if a member of a court martial were to become ill or die, during the proceedings. I am not sure about it. If I have misdirected the hon. Gentleman I will be happy to correct that at a later date. I am giving him my opinion, but I am not sure if I can back it up with fact—not being a lawyer.
<P>
