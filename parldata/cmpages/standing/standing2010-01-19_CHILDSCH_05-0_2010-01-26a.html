<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012672000427"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> It is a real pleasure to serve under your
chairmanship, Mr. Amess. I know from experience that you
will be fair, of light touch and have all the good things that we
expect from a good
Chairman.</div><a name="10012672000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">Here
we are about the start the clause-by-clause, line-by-line scrutiny of
yet another education Bill from the Government. The amendments will
enable us to debate the principle, purpose and effectiveness of
enshrining into legislation a form of legal guarantee for the quality
of education. Clause 1 is an odd provision. Most people would assume
that they had been promised a certain quality of education when they
elected a Government, particularly one who had in their manifesto a
promise to deliver a quality education, and they would expect that to
be delivered through a range of administrative, executive and
legislative measures and through proper and careful funding out of
taxes levied on the general
public.</div><a name="10012672000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Labour party&#146;s 2005 manifesto set out the
promise:</div><a name="10012672000345"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
want to see every pupil mastering the basics. If they are not mastered
by 11, there will be extra time in the secondary curriculum to get them
right&#148;.</div><a name="10012672000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
went on to say
that</div><a name="10012672000346"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Every
pupil has the right to learn without
disruption&#148;.</div><a name="10012672000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is odd therefore that, five years later, the Government feel the
necessity to enshrine promises already made into legislation and into a
series of guarantees set out in the two appendices to the White Paper.
The view about the provisions is that, at best, they are just a waste
of time and, at worst, they could lead to a proliferation of legalistic
complaints.</div><a name="10012672000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
us take one of the guarantees from the consultation document. Pupil
guarantee 2.2 on page 24
states:</div><a name="10012672000347"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
curriculum is tailored to every child&#146;s needs so that every
pupil receives the support they need to secure good literacy, numeracy
and ICT skills, learn another language and about the humanities,
science, technology and the
arts&#148;.</div><a name="10012672000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given
that 16 per cent. of 11-year-olds are not reaching level 4 in English,
does that mean all the parents of those children should consider making
a complaint to the local government ombudsman? Nearly 40 per cent. of
11-year-olds are failing to achieve level 4 in reading, writing and
maths combined. Should the parents of those children take legal action?
Furthermore, 9 per cent. of boys and 4 per cent. of girls fail to
register a grade in the key stage 2 test taken at 11 years old. Surely
the parents of those children have grounds for complaint. Last week, I
visited a fine academy where half the year 7 intake had a
reading age below 11 years and a third had a reading age of nine years
or under. Those children have a lot to complain about in respect of
their primary
schools.</div><a name="10012672000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
1(1) of the Bill that amendment 1 would amend states that the Secretary
of
State</div><a name="10012672000348"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;must
issue, and may from time to time revise&#148;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column151" />Column number: 151</div><a name="10012672000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">a document setting out
the pupil and parent guarantees. A draft of that document has just been
published and put out for consultation. It states on page 8
that</div><a name="10012672000349"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;All
maintained schools and all Academies must already have arrangements in
place to consider any complaints from parents. But for those rare cases
where concerns and complaints cannot be resolved at school level,
parents can as a last resort take their complaint further. Parents can
complain to the Local Government Ombudsman where their complaint
relates to a maintained school or a local
authority.&#148;</div><a name="10012672000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
the local government ombudsman, having investigated the complaint,
upholds it, paragraph 19
states:</div><a name="10012672000350"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
LGO can recommend one or more of the following: where there has been a
failure to make provision promised in the Guarantees, the LGO could
seek to ensure that it is
delivered&#148;.</div><a name="10012672000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
question to the Minister is, how will the LGO &#147;seek to
ensure&#148; that a primary school stops sending children to
secondary school with a reading age of 9, 8, 7 or 6 and stops sending
33 per cent. of its pupils to secondary school with a reading age of 9
or under? Since the Minister, the Secretary of State and all his
predecessors do not seem to know how to do this, why does the Minister
think that the local government ombudsman will be able to do
it?</div><a name="10012672000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
our evidence session on Tuesday I asked Mr. Redmond, the
LGO, how he intended to ensure that the guarantee was delivered, he
replied:</div><a name="10012672000351"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I
do not think that it is the role or responsibility of local government
to change a school. My role is to consider a complaint that is
presented to the commission after it has been properly considered by
the school and the governing body...If I conclude that there is
evidence that the guarantee has not been fulfilled, I recommend to the
school that it consider how that guarantee should be fulfilled. As you
rightly point out, it is a recommendation&#151;I cannot enforce
it&#151;but I think by virtue of making that recommendation, I
highlight the issues on which I feel that the school has fallen short
in respect of fulfilling the guarantee...It is then for the school
to decide how it should
proceed<i class="I">.</i>&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;[Official Report, Children,
Schools and Families Public Bill Committee, 19 January 2010;
c. 5-6,
Q11.]</i></div><a name="10012672000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">So
Mr. Redmond would look at the evidence, which would clearly
show that too many children at that primary school were not learning to
read properly, and he would recommend that the school teaches those
children how to read and then leave it up to the school to decide how
to proceed. Would he examine the reading schemes used by the school? Is
it read-write or Jolly Phonics? Does it use the whole-language
approach? Is it still using the searchlights model? Does it use letters
and sounds? Will the LGO or a member of his staff sit in lessons to see
how the children are taught to read? Or will he just say, &#147;They
need to do better,&#148; and, as he says, leave it to the school to
decide how it should
proceed?</div><a name="10012672000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
response to a question from the hon. Member for Yeovil, Mr.
Redmond
said:</div><a name="10012672000352"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;we
are also conscious of the fact that in terms of curriculum and
teaching, some of those things might step outside the jurisdiction of
the ombudsman, and we would be conscious of how we proceeded in dealing
with those.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official Report,
Children, Schools and Families Public Bill Committee, </i>19 January
2010; c. 7,
Q5.]</div><a name="10012672000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">In other
words, if I have interpreted the LGO&#146;s words correctly, he will
not venture into curricular or pedagogical issues. That makes most of
the guarantees and indeed the whole apparatus pointless, because it is
likely that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column152" />Column number: 152</div>poor teaching or poor academic standards will make up the bulk of
complaints arising from guarantees about our education
system.</div>
<a name="10012672000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">Dr. Daniel
Moynihan of the Harris Federation summed up the issue when he told the
Committee during our evidence sessions:</div>
<a name="10012672000353"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;If
you look at some of the guarantees, every child is entitled to relevant
and challenging learning in all subjects. Of course that is true, but
can it be so because it is mandated by Government? If there are still
some schools that do not achieve that now, I cannot see how central
Government can guarantee it. There are other strategies that can bring
that about.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official Report,
Children, Schools and Families Public Bill Committee, </i>19 January
2010; c. 30,
Q38.]</div><a name="10012672000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">To take
just one more example, guarantee 3.10 says
that:</div><a name="10012672000354"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;every
pupil identified as gifted and talented receives written confirmation
by their school of the extra challenge and support they will
receive&#148;.</div>
<a name="10012672000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">But according to <i class="I">The
</i><i class="I">Observer</i> this
week,</div><a name="10012672000355"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
government initiative to boost the performance of Britain's brightest
schoolchildren is to be abandoned. The national academy for gifted and
talented pupils, which received &#163;20m funding, will be abolished
next month with the money rediverted...It will now be scaled down
to an online information
resource.&#148;</div><a name="10012672000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">So
will the guarantee now disappear from the draft consultation document?
If so, does that mean that whenever there is a change in education
policy or a redirection of &#163;20 million of funding from a
particular initiative, under clause 1 the Secretary of State will have
to produce another document? Can the Minister also expand on what he
has in mind in the phrase &#147;from time to time&#148; in clause
1? Does it mean that he will revise the document annually, or when
there is a major change in education policy, or every two years, or
every five years?</div>
<a name="10012672000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
Thursday&#146;s evidence session we heard witnesses talking about the
importance of children&#146;s spoken language&#151;something that
has been neglected in recent years. We heard how some children are
starting school with very poor spoken English and with a very limited
vocabulary. In another interesting and well-researched article in
<i class="I">The Observer</i>, which is the newspaper of choice on these Benches,
Mr. Amess, Harriet Sergeant compared a KIPP&#151;knowledge
is power programme&#151;charter school in Harlem, New York with a
school in east London. The KIPP school had high expectations and high
academic standards. In the east London school, the pupils who sat
around the reporter
were:</div><a name="10012672000356"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;slouched
in their seat, barely looking at me. These boys were just as
bright&#148;&#151;</div><a name="10012672000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">as
the pupils in the Harlem
school&#151;</div><a name="10012672000357"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;but
they complained they were &#145;bored out of our brains&#146;. One
said: &#145;I want to do all those experiments. But the female
teacher, she like talk to you about health and safety. She just treat
you like a
child.&#146;</div><a name="10012672000394"></a><div class="hs_brev">Afterwards
their teacher described their inarticulacy as &#145;a serious issue.
It&#146;s quite often the reason they get really frustrated&#146;,
yet she thought it &#145;patronising&#146; to try to correct them.
&#145;I don&#146;t want to push my middle-class values on
them,&#146; she
said.&#148;</div><a name="10012672000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">Perhaps
the Minister could respond to that article, and the notion that
teachers should not correct mistakes in spoken
English.</div>
<a name="10012672000049"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10012672000428"></a><b class="B">Caroline
Flint</b> (Don Valley) (Lab): I was very interested to read an
article in one of the Sunday supplements&#151;I cannot remember which
one&#151;about a school in London that was taking on the issue of
communication, and was  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column153" />Column number: 153</div>banning &#147;street language&#148; in school. This was a state
school. It felt, quite rightly, that&#151;while we have all, in our
private moments, and teenage years, used slang&#151;for everyday use,
in working life, we need to be able to speak English properly and be
understood. It is difficult to draw conclusions from the situation we
have just heard about. I do not share the values of the teacher who was
quoted, but there are plenty of schools in the state sector that are
being challenging and are not afraid to take on what might be seen as
sensitive
issues.</div><a name="10012672000050"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012672000429"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> The right hon. Lady is quite right. I have visited
many schools around the country that take that approach to education.
They correct spoken English and written English, and they are very
happy to correct pupils&#146; work when it is sent in. However, other
schools take an ideological approach to these matters, and they believe
that it is wrong to correct spoken English, for the reasons given by
the teacher in the article. They believe it is wrong, sometimes, to
correct written work, because that would undermine the flow and the
child&#146;s creative imagination. This is a big divide within the
education profession and among the public. My own view is that children
will flourish and boost their imagination and creativity only if they
have the skills and tools&#151;the grammar, the rules&#151;to
express themselves on paper. Children have to learn those rules so that
using them becomes automatic, and they do not have to worry about them
when they write, which can stifle creativity. The way to boost
creativity is to get the teaching right according to tried and tested
methods.</div><a name="10012672000051"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012672000430"></a>Caroline
Flint:</b> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that, as we are
dealing with such a huge expanse of schools in our country, in
different regions, with different ethnic groups and so forth, we need
to have checks and balances to make sure that delivery is happening in
the way we want to see it on the ground? This is an opportunity for a
parent to say to the local government ombudsman, &#147;I don&#146;t
think the school is attending to the reading needs of my child because
the teachers don&#146;t even mark the homework. They don&#146;t
correct spelling mistakes.&#148; Granted, the local government
ombudsman cannot change that school around, but what if he could pass
that information on to Ofsted, so that it becomes a focus for the
inspections that might follow? Is not shining a bit of sunlight on this
area really important? While the different tools are not perfect and do
not solve 100 per cent. of the problems, they try to explore schools
where the delivery of teaching, and the management and oversight of the
school may not be as good as in others.</div>

Gibb:</b> Again, the right hon. Lady makes some good points.
However, Ofsted is already charged with those tasks and I hear,
anecdotally, that many Ofsted inspectors would back up the
teacher&#146;s comments about not correcting spoken English. Often
the problem with people in the world of education and its bureaucracy,
is that they themselves have an ideological approach to education that
they then promote through the offices they hold. The local government
ombudsman will not be the answer to that because, as he said to the
hon. Member for
Yeovil,</div><a name="10012672000358"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;we
are also conscious of the fact that in terms of curriculum and
teaching, some of those things might step outside the jurisdiction 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column154" />Column number: 154</div>of the ombudsman, and we would be conscious of how we proceeded in
dealing with those.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official Report,

I do not believe that he will respond to the right hon. Lady&#146;s
challenge of shining a light on schools. He feels that on issues of
curriculum and pedagogy the measure goes beyond his, or her, expertise.
The question for the Minister is whether the correction of spoken
English will be part of the pupil guarantees that are set out in the
consultation document and in the document that clause 1 requires him to
produce from time to
time?</div><a name="10012672000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
1 replaces the word &#147;must&#148; with &#147;may&#148;; that

Liberal Democrats.</div>

David Laws</b> (Yeovil) (LD): I am broadly supportive of much
that the hon. Gentleman has said. However, I cannot understand why he
wants to exempt one particular category of schools; surely the argument
that he makes is one for exempting all
schools.</div>
<a name="10012672000058"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012672000433"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> Yes. The hon. Gentleman makes a good point. We are
opposed to the pupil and parent guarantees for all schools. However, I
make a separate point; with each piece of legislation emanating from
the Department since the current Secretary of State took
office&#151;and from time to time before that&#151;there seems to
be a chipping away of the freedoms that apply to academies.</div>
<a name="10012672000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">Academies, as
with CTCs before them, are meant to have most of the freedoms of
independent schools but without the need for parents to pay fees.
Increasingly, and incrementally with each education Bill, those
freedoms have been eroded. There are many examples in the
2009 Act; the clause is another example, and one of many in
the Bill. It demonstrates what we always knew to be true&#151;that
the Secretary of State is as opposed to academies today as he was in
the past, when, behind the scenes, he sought to undermine them and
undermine education
reform.</div><a name="10012672000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause applies the whole of the bureaucratic and ultimately pointless
guarantee paraphernalia to academies and CTCs. Amendment 41 seeks to
undo that. That is also the LGA&#146;s view. In its brief to the
Committee, it
states:</div><a name="10012672000360"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;we
believe the guarantees should be implemented in a way that avoids
central prescription and maintains local flexibility to support the
real engagement between schools, parents and pupils in a local area.
...</div><a name="10012672000361"></a><div class="hs_brev">The
draft document issued by the Secretary of State to accompany Second
Reading to illustrate the intention of sub clause 1(1) runs to 407
paragraphs and 80 pages of detailed central prescription.</div>
<a name="10012672000362"></a><div class="hs_brev">The word
&#147;should&#148; features 268 times in the document and
&#147;must&#148;, 264 times.</div>
<a name="10012672000363"></a><div class="hs_brev">We believe
that this level of control from Whitehall over the detailed
implementation of the pupil and parent guarantees is completely
unnecessary and will add to the already considerable burden of
bureaucracy on the school system.&#148;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column155" />Column number: 155</div><a name="10012672000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 42
would remove subsections (9) and (10) from the clause, as it
is a Henry VIII clause. It gives the Secretary of State the power to
amend primary legislation through secondary legislation. We also
support amendment 155, tabled by the hon. Member for Yeovil, which
would prevent the Secretary of State from extending his powers under
the clause to the independent
sector.</div><a name="10012672000062"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012672000434"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I welcome you to the chair, Mr. Amess,
and also welcome hon. Members back to the Committee for the important
part of our proceedings in which we scrutinise this extensive Bill
which, if passed into law, will have a major impact on schools and
those associated with
them.</div><a name="10012672000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
come now to one of the big debates that Committee will have about the
Bill&#151;on the subject of pupil and parent guarantees, which could
have a major implication for the funding of schools, the costs that
will fall on their shoulders and the amount of bureaucracy with which
they will have to get involved as a consequence of the rights of appeal
to the local government ombudsman.</div>
<a name="10012672000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton set out the terms of the
debate clearly, and even managed not to mention synthetic
phonics&#151;just about&#151;although I am sure that we will return
to that matter later in our proceedings. Liberal Democrat Members are
having a sweepstake on how many times he will mention it. The hon.
Gentleman clearly set out the purpose behind his amendments, however,
and also referred to several that we have tabled, particularly
amendments 125, 155 and 177 to 179.</div>
<a name="10012672000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some of the
amendments in the group are fairly detailed, and I would like to come
on to those at the end of my comments. The substantive amendment,
however, is the lead amendment: amendment 1. It questions whether the
pupil and parent guarantees ought to be introduced on a mandatory and
top-down basis, as the Government currently plan, and whether that is
sensible. I will therefore spend a lot of my speech, particularly my
early comments, considering whether it is sensible to implement the
measures in the way that the Government have
described.</div><a name="10012672000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">Particularly,
we question whether it is a good idea to impose the so-called
guarantees in the way that the Government intend and whether the
proposed guarantees are meaningful, appropriate and deliverable. We
also want to question how much bureaucracy is likely to be associated
with them, especially if there is an appeal route through the local
government ombudsman. We also question the potential cost of
implementing the measures and whether the Government have carried out a
serious cost-benefit analysis of the consequences of implementing the
pupil and parent guarantees. We also want to consider whether there is
enough money in the system to guarantee them. We are therefore
supporting&#151;as should already be clear&#151;amendment 1, which
was moved by the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton. We
note, as think that he did, that the amendment has the explicit support
of the
LGA.</div><a name="10012672000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
has been fairly widespread concern about what the parent and pupil
guarantees will mean in practice. The hon. Gentleman referred to the
LGA&#146;s submission, which is typical of the concerns that have
been expressed by many groups outside this place. Its concerns are that
the measure will involve an extremely bureaucratic and prescriptive
approach, and that implementing and policing 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column156" />Column number: 156</div>the guarantees might involve large costs. The Association of School and
College Leaders has been persistently extremely critical of the
measures, and the well-respected leader of that organisation, John
Dunford, described the pupil and parent guarantees as a
&#147;whingers&#146; charter&#148;. The ASCL, in its
representation to the Committee, said that it
believed:</div>
<a name="10012672000364"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the creation of
these guarantees will open the floodgates for increased litigation
against schools. The introduction of these guarantees has the potential
to create a &#145;whingers&#146; charter&#146; and bring a
proliferation of frivolous complaints by a minority of litigious
parents, thereby serving to increase the work load of school leaders
and undermine the work that schools have
done&#148;.</div><a name="10012672000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
National Union of Teachers has also been critical of the way in which
the pupil and parent guarantees are being implemented. Although it
understands that the intention behind many of the guarantees is
positive, it fears that they will not be funded properly and that the
proposal forms part of a bureaucratic process through which
improvements in the school system are delivered. The TUC has echoed
such concerns in its submission. In advance of the Second Reading
debate, it expressed concerns that the new system should not entail a
large bureaucratic burden, which would undermine the core functions of
the work force of teaching and supporting
pupils.</div><a name="10012672000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
question is not simply whether we should have pupil and parent
guarantees&#151;whether they are a good idea in principle&#151;but
whether the Government have framed the guarantees in the right way. Our
party is not against having a set of minimum standards that public
services must deliver. If those standards and undertakings are not met
in a meaningful way, however, there is a real risk that citizens, when
confronted by what is usually a monopoly in state public services, will
not be able to get anything done if they feel that the service with
which they are dealing is unresponsive. We think that it makes sense to
frame a small number of guarantees and undertakings&#151;in
education, health and in other areas&#151;that public service
consumers can look to when they feel that they are being let down by an
organisation.</div><a name="10012672000070"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012672000435"></a>The
Minister for Schools and Learners (Mr. Vernon
Coaker):</b> May I make sure that I understand what the hon.
Gentleman is saying&#151;that the position of his party is to support
the guarantees? Presumably he accepts that there would have to be a
document, and alongside that, if the guarantees are to mean anything, a
redress system. Notwithstanding the amendments that he has tabled, is
he saying that he actually supports the establishment of a guarantee
document?</div><a name="10012672000071"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012672000436"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> No, I said that my party believes it is important
that there should be a minimum set of core standards for all public
services that should be sensibly framed, meaningful, easy to understand
and with clear enforcement
mechanisms.</div><a name="10012672000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
me give the Minister an example that goes beyond schools. We have
argued that people who cannot be seen by the NHS within a particular
time scale should have the right to be seen by the private sector at a
cost  to the NHS itself, meaning that there is a clear penalty
to the NHS if it fails to deliver a reasonable standard  of
service within a clearly defined time scale. I would distinguish such a
guarantee&#151;something that is clear and uncontroversial, and with
a clear mechanism for redress, rather than a bureaucratic mechanism for
redress&#151;from the guarantees we are discussing today.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column157" />Column number: 157</div><a name="10012672000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me lead
the Minister and colleagues through some of the guarantees that the
Government are setting out so that I may explain why we have concerns
about them. The many guarantees that the Government are proposing have
unclear definitions and it is debatable whether they could be
implemented in a practical manner. I shall contrast those aspects of
the pupil and parent guarantees with the types of guarantee that I
argue could be meaningful, appropriate and deliverable. I am sorry for
taking a while on this, but it goes to the heart of whether or not
amendment 1 is sensible and whether these guarantees should be imposed
on schools and other related
bodies.</div><a name="10012672000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
paragraph 6 on page 6 of the White Paper, the Government trumpet that
the pupil guarantee is
a</div><a name="10012672000365"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;new
Pupil Guarantee, setting out new entitlements to personalised support
for every
child&#148;.</div><a name="10012672000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
will come back to that when we debate whether or not these guarantees
are new and, if they are new, whether money will come along with them.
The guarantees are set out in much greater detail in annexe A at the
back of the White Paper. Let me take the Minister through some of the
areas about which we have particular concerns, starting with pupil
guarantee 5<b class="B">. </b>For those who do not know the guarantees off by
heart, it states how important it is</div>
<a name="10012672000366"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;that every
11-14 year-old enjoys relevant and challenging learning in all subjects
and develops their personal, learning and thinking skills so that they
have strong foundations to make their 14-19 choices. This will be
phased in by September
2010.&#148;</div><a name="10012672000397"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11
am</div><a name="10012672000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
seems to be a classic example of a badly framed, almost meaningless
guarantee. I am astonished that the Minister is saying it will be
phased in by September 2010 because I would assume that, in the
Government&#146;s view, every primary and secondary school is already
delivering such an undertaking. If they are not, and the idea of
phasing this in by September 2010 is to have any meaning, presumably
the Minister can give us an estimate of how many schools are not
delivering it at the moment.</div>
<a name="10012672000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">I put this
issue to the local government ombudsman in the evidence session and
asked whether it would be possible for him to hold these guarantees to
account in any meaningful way. I put it to the Minister and the
Committee that it would be impossible for the ombudsman to reach any
sensible conclusion on guarantees that are framed in such a wide and
unclear way. Some of these guarantees are misleading, unclear and, in
some senses, a fraud for the people to whom they are being offered. It
would be very difficult to make them meaningful and to implement
them.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012672000437"></a>Caroline
Flint:</b> When we were taking evidence last week, we asked
the local government ombudsman representative about how he and his
organisation were working with Ofsted. Did he not assure us they had
been doing extensive work together to look into the guarantees and how
they should be interpreted? The connection between a complaint going to
the local government ombudsman and that complaint being taken up by
Ofsted is very important. I asked if they were looking at different
scenarios relating to the sort of complaints with which parents could
come forward, and he said that that had been an ongoing piece of work 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column158" />Column number: 158</div>for some time, that it was continuing and that he was very satisfied
with it. He did not feel as concerned as the hon. Gentleman about some
of the issues that he is raising.</div>
<a name="10012672000079"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012672000438"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> My recollection of what the ombudsman said is
slightly different from the right hon. Lady&#146;s, although I do not
have the transcript immediately to hand. She is experienced enough to
know that, on these occasions, representatives from public bodies are
always somewhat diplomatic about what they say about legislation that
is going through this place. In the case of the ombudsman, he realises
that his job is to implement what is decided by Parliament, not to get
too involved in such debates. Nothing in the transcript gives me great
assurance that anyone would be able to make neither head nor tail of
these so-called guarantees when they are so vaguely
described.</div>
<a name="10012672000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me turn
to some of the other guarantees contained in the document, because they
raise other question marks about the way in which the Government
propose to deliver them. I am talking about those set out on page 99 of
the White Paper, which describe the important issue of one-to-one
tuition. This seems to be the guarantee to which the Secretary of State
constantly refers when he talks about them, so it is clearly the one he
regards as most important.</div>
<a name="10012672000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">There seem to
be two separate guarantees in relation to one-to-one tuition. The first
is for pupils between the age of seven and 11 who have fallen behind
national expectations and are not making good progress. It seems that
those individuals are to get one-to-one tuition, although only a set
minimum amount per pupil. The other relates to pupils who begin
secondary school behind national expectations in English and
mathematics. They are to receive one-to-one tuition, or small group
tuition. Those guarantees fall into the category of the Government
defining the input into the process, but not the output. They are not
guaranteeing whether young people will reach levels, but describing the
input&#151;and doing so in an extremely inflexible way. Why should
they dictate that there should be one-to-one tuition in a particular
setting, and one-to-one or small group tuition in other settings? I
should have thought that most head teachers would expect the Government
to set the aspiration, or to indicate their expectations for young
people&#146;s grasp of English and maths at particular levels, but
then leave the schools free within a framework with intelligent
accountability to deliver those results. They should not prescribe
numbers of hours, sizes of small groups and ways in which schools
should deliver the ultimate
outcomes.</div><a name="10012672000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
also question whether the guarantees described on page 100 of the
document are meaningful. Some bold-sounding guarantees describe access
to PE and sport, competitive sport and even to cultural activities.
They all sound quite marvellous and the Conservative spokesman for
education, the hon. Member for Surrey Heath (Michael Gove), raised some
of the supposed guarantees on Second Reading. As I recall, he
questioned whether we could be confident that there was the money to
deliver all those things. I question not so much whether there is the
money to deliver them, but whether they mean anything because when we
look at the small print, it does not say that there will be five hours
for every five to 16-year-old of high-quality PE and sport and three
hours for every 16 to 19-year-old. Nor does it say that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column159" />Column number: 159</div>there will be five hours of cultural activity in schools each week. Of
course, the press release says that. The aspiration is for newspapers
to write that up, but the words used are all about access, and
&#147;access&#148; could mean
anything.</div><a name="10012672000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
could stick a sign on a notice board advertising a sports club down the
road, and consider that that might constitute access, but I do not know
whether access means anything if the gap between what actually happens
in schools and what is framed under the guarantee is as wide as it
could be. That is just as relevant for another guarantee on page 98 of
the White Paper, which states that,</div>
<a name="10012672000367"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;every pupil
aged 14-19 has the opportunity to undertake community service...by
September
2009&#148;.</div><a name="10012672000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">What
has happened over the past year to deliver that guarantee, which was
apparently delivered by September 2009? Will the Minister
tell us whether that is just meaningless gumph or whether anything has
happened over the past year to make that supposed guarantee a reality?
To me, it could be argued that it had been delivered by sticking
something on a notice board, saying that there is an opportunity for
community service. It sounds absolutely marvellous, but is it, in
reality, completely
meaningless?</div><a name="10012672000085"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10012672000439"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Graham Stuart</b> (Beverley and Holderness) (Con): My
colleague, the hon. Member for Surrey Heath, might have been making the
point that the hon. Member for Cambridge (David Howarth) made when he
was leader of the council there, which is that policy is budget and
budget is policy. If there is no money to back up such things and if
there is not a budget to allow an improvement in the service, it is
nothing more than a deceit practised on parents and pupils. If the
Minister wants to ensure that the Bill makes a real change, he must
make a genuine improvement in provision and, without a budget to do so,
that is unlikely, whatever is written in the
Bill.</div><a name="10012672000086"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012672000440"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I entirely agree with the hon. Gentleman. I will not
be too partisan in pointing out that his party is the only one leaving
open the door to reductions in the schools budget. I certainly support
his basic argument. He knows as a member of the Select Committee that,
when the Secretary of State was questioned on that specific issue by
the Select Committee on 21 October, he was quite clear that he did not
see the White Paper that implements pupil and parent guarantees
as</div>
<a name="10012672000368"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;making new or
additional commitments that would require additions to
budgets.&#148;</div>
<a name="10012672000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">In other words, the
view set out by the Secretary of State is that there is no extra money
to go with such a provision and that it does not involve additional
commitments. I find that quite odd because, at the beginning of the
White Paper, we are told explicitly that it is a new guarantee that
delivers new entitlements. It would be helpful to find out which of
those assertions is wrong. Was the Secretary of State wrong in October
to tell us that there is nothing new in the entitlements? Is the White
Paper accurate when it says that they are new entitlements, which
presumably require
funding?</div><a name="10012672000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
leads us to funding. When we look into some of the guarantees, it seems
that it would be difficult to deliver them without additional funding.
I am thinking 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column160" />Column number: 160</div>in particular of the guarantees on, for example, careers education
information&#151;all secondary school pupils
should</div><a name="10012672000369"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;have
access to high-quality careers education and
information&#148;.</div><a name="10012672000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
would have thought&#151;I think this is the view of most people
involved in education&#151;that at present in schools, there is a
very big gap between that aspiration and the reality. It is difficult
to imagine that that will be delivered without any new funding. Yet, in
both the pupil and parent guarantees, there are explicit undertakings
to have far better quality careers advice. Indeed, the parent guarantee
states that parents should
get</div><a name="10012672000370"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;high-quality
information and advice on the career and subject choices open to their
child&#148;.</div><a name="10012672000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">While
we are on the issue of whether any of the measures are going to be
financed, there is also an undertaking that parents
should</div><a name="10012672000371"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;have
access to a range of extended services by 2010 including: information
and support on parenting skills and advice on parenting issues;
childcare; activities; and opportunities to enhance their own learning
and to learn with their
child&#148;.</div><a name="10012672000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again,
if that is to mean anything, something material will happen and be
delivered&#151; presumably within the next year. If it is to be a
guarantee, it sounds as though it will cost a lot to
deliver.</div><a name="10012672000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
main concern is not that the Department has not sought to identify some
core deliverables, but that consumers of public services should be able
to expect something, and have recourse if it is not delivered. However,
we have here a series of unfunded guarantees, where there is a lack of
clarity about whether they are new entitlements. Many of them are not
meaningful and will be difficult to enforce. In many cases, they are
simply not the appropriate guarantees that we should be
making.</div><a name="10012672000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
would be naive if we thought that in 23,500 schools, however much
funding there is, there will not be many parents and potentially pupils
who feel that they are not getting the type of education described in
the guarantees. The risk is that those parents will then go to the
local government ombudsman. The type of checks, information and
scrutiny involved in an ombudsman exercise&#151;as all of us in this
place know, having had a lot of experience, I suspect, of referring
cases to the ombudsman&#151;is far greater than the type of
information and scrutiny that is expected of a head teacher, a
governing body or perhaps even of a local authority. It would therefore
involve a large amount of bureaucracy. Also, without going back too
much to the debate about where the ombudsman&#146;s powers were
introduced in the first place, schools that believe that there may be a
referral to the ombudsman would have to compile an awful lot of
paperwork and keep an awful lot of records to be able to challenge a
decision to go the ombudsman.</div>

my hon. Friend agree that not only would there be the bureaucracy that
he describes, but in many cases, it would be impossible for the
ombudsman to access the sort of evidence that would be needed for the

<div class="Column"><a name="Column161" />Column number: 161</div><a name="10012672000342"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent"><b class="B"><a name="10012672000442"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> My hon. Friend is right. I thank her for finding the
part of the evidence that I was not able to lay my hands on earlier.
Trying to decide whether there is evidence to enforce pupil guarantee
5&#151;that every 11 to 14-year-old should
enjoy</div>
<a name="10012672000373"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;relevant and

be incredibly difficult. It would be difficult for the ombudsman to
judge whether that guarantee had been met and to gather the evidence.
We are therefore opening up a process that could be extremely
expensive. I assume the Government have given that a lot of
attention.</div><a name="10012672000398"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.15
am</div><a name="10012672000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">When
we turn to the cost-benefit analysis that comes with the Bill, we find
that there is no information provided. There is a great big hole. There
is no estimated net present cost and no estimated net present benefit.
Under &#147;Assumptions&#148;, it helpfully says that it believes
that introducing the pupil and parent guarantees will be cost-neutral,
suggesting that the Secretary of State&#146;s view&#151;that there
is not much new here&#151;is the correct view in contrast to the view
set out in the White Paper, which talks about new entitlements and a
new guarantee. It acknowledges that there may be an increase in
complaints. Indeed, in the detail of the cost-benefit analysis, it
says:</div><a name="10012672000375"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Given
that the Guarantees will clearly set
out&#151;</div><a name="10012672000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
question the words &#147;clearly set
out&#148;&#151;</div><a name="10012672000376"></a><div class="hs_brev">for
the first time, what parents and pupils can expect from a school there
may be additional costs accrued due to extra administration to deal
with an increased number of
complaints.&#148;</div><a name="10012672000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
cost could be very large indeed. We know that the ombudsman and the
Government have yet to come up with a cost estimate. It would be useful
if the Minister could tell us whether there has been an update on that
and whether there is a clearer idea of costs. We also know, although it
is not properly costed in the cost-benefit analysis, that there will be
additional costs as a consequence of advertising, or, as the
cost-benefit analysis
states:</div><a name="10012672000377"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;There
may also be cost incurred to raise awareness of the Guarantees, in
order that some of the benefits listed below are fully
realised.&#148;</div><a name="10012672000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
other words, the Government are talking about spending quite a lot of
money to tell people about guarantees, which, in many cases, are going
to be vague and unenforceable. I question not only whether the
guarantees are meaningful and whether it will be easy to police them,
but whether we want to spend additional money on bureaucracy and
advertising when we have a &#163;180 billion deficit in the public
finances.</div><a name="10012672000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
need to consider everything that is in the Bill in the context of an
environment where the Government have very little money to go round and
where we need to be spending money on the front line, not on
bureaucracy. Even without all the costs that should be in the
cost-benefit analysis, the net present cost of the Bill is in the
region of &#163;1 billion, most of which goes to bureaucracy, not to
the front line in schools. At a time when there are concerns about
budgets, we should be setting an even higher hurdle and standard in
terms of approving measures that are going to involve additional costs
without clear benefits. Those are all the reasons why we do not
want  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column162" />Column number: 162</div>to see the pupil and parent guarantees imposed in the way that is
proposed in the Bill and why we would like amendment 1, which turns
&#147;must&#148; into &#147;may&#148;, to be passed. I hope
that the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton will press that
later.</div>
<a name="10012672000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall deal
briefly with other amendments. I raised amendment 41 with the hon.
Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton earlier. I understand what he
is getting at in that amendment, which seeks to give an opt-out from
the pupil and parent guarantees to academies, city technology colleges
and city colleges for the technology of the arts. However, we are very
much opposed to picking out particular classes of schools and
suggesting that they should have powers and freedoms separate from
those of other publicly funded schools. We cannot therefore support
that amendment. We believe that the opt-out should apply to all
schools.</div>
<a name="10012672000343"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent">Amendments
42 and 125 would both provide protection from a Secretary of State who
wished to change the bodies to which the guarantees refer, and to
change those in the Bill. We agree with the hon. Member for Bognor
Regis and Littlehampton that we should resist such a provision and,
thus, avoid the Secretary of State&#146;s changing things by the back
door.</div><a name="10012672000104"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012672000443"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> May I take the hon. Gentleman back to amendment
41? I am trying to follow his logic. He does not support it because it
does not go far enough. He says that it does not provide an opt-out for
all schools because it is selective. I put it to him that a little of a
good thing is better than none of a good thing. What is his rationale?
Why can he not support the amendment for going in the right
direction?</div><a name="10012672000105"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012672000444"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> My rationale is that it is irrational to choose
certain schools and to say that they should have freedoms, but that
others should not. The Minister for Employment and Welfare Reform, the
right hon. Member for South Dorset (Jim Knight), the Minister&#146;s
predecessor, used to have a lot of correspondence with me each time a
new burden was introduced by the Government from which academies were
exempt. He never managed in any of the letters that I received to
explain remotely how the Government could justify imposing requirements
on some maintained schools and not on others. One of the best examples
was cooking, which is a compulsory subject in all maintained schools,
but from which for some reason academies can opt out. It is dotty to
give freedoms to some schools, and not to others. If anything, the only
schools that should not have such freedoms are those that are most
challenged and most underperforming. In many cases, academies will have
taken over very underperforming schools, and to give them freedoms that
are not available to high-performing maintained schools seems plain
stupid.</div><a name="10012672000106"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012672000445"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> I wonder whether I can help the hon. Gentleman
understand the issue. He has tabled amendment 155, which makes it clear
that he does not believe that the guarantees should be extended to
independent schools. Well, academies are independent schools in every
way, except that they are funded by the state. That is the whole
essence of academies. They are meant to have all the freedoms of
independent schools, but are funded by the state. That is what we are
trying to achieve.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column163" />Column number: 163</div><a name="10012672000107"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012672000446"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> There is quite a big difference. I am trying to
distinguish between the powers and freedoms that all state-funded
schools should have. The Conservatives have not put forward a strong
argument, neither have the Government in the past, for distinguishing
between the two when they are state funded. It is another matter to say
that privately funded schools should not have such impositions placed
on them, and that is what amendment 155 would
do.</div><a name="10012672000108"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012672000447"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> It strikes me more and more that the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s party is moving away from its core principles. It
used to believe in diversity. Indeed, if I recollect properly, the
actual constitution of the Liberal Democrat party is that it opposes
conformity. However, it seems to do so only in the wording of its
constitution, not in
practice.</div><a name="10012672000109"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012672000448"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> We believe in diversity for everyone, not for a
selected few. Under the amendment tabled by the Conservatives, there
would be the ability to do things differently and to be protected from
central impositions, but it would relate to only a tiny number of
state-funded schools. That is ridiculous. We are a party that believes
in freedom. We want to liberalise. We want the freedoms to be available
to 23,500 schools&#151;not 200&#151;and that is a sensible and
liberal
position.</div><a name="10012672000110"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012672000449"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> Does that mean that the Liberal Democrat
party&#146;s position is that it wants the academies&#146; movement
to be extended immediately to 23,500 schools? It is taking our policy
one step
further.</div><a name="10012672000111"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012672000450"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> We certainly want the freedoms that academies have
over things like the curriculum to be extended to all schools. We have
said that very clearly. We do not necessarily want each maintained
school to become an academy unless there is clarity over the strategic
oversight and, at the moment, I fear that there is no such clarity
under Conservative
policy.</div><a name="10012672000112"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012672000451"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> I am fascinated by what the hon. Gentleman has
just said. Will he spell out precisely how the freedom in respect of
the national curriculum would be given to all schools? Would there be
an opt-out? Would there be a formalised procedure? Would it have to go
through the governing body? Would there be a vote of parents at the
school? Would the local authority need to approve? How exactly would
the freedom from the curriculum in the Liberal vision of governance
take shape?</div>
<a name="10012672000113"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012672000452"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> What there would be&#151;if I can get away with
this without you ruling that I am out of order, Mr.
Amess&#151;is a minimum curriculum entitlement and a minimum
obligation in relation to the curriculum for all schools that would set
out what would be delivered in every school. On top of that, however,
there would not be compulsion. For example, there would be no
compulsion for cooking in every maintained school except academies.
There would be clarity in some areas where academies currently use
their powers and freedoms to do precisely the types of things that the
hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton would like them not to
do. Many academies are using their power and freedoms not to teach
subjects such as history up to age 14 and to start the key
stage 4 curriculum earlier. Academies are using flexibilities and
freedoms to drop core subjects such as history, and they are doing so
in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column164" />Column number: 164</div>much greater numbers and proportions than other maintained schools.
However, I am grateful to the hon. Member for Beverley and Holderness
for his questions. I am pleased that he is here not only to have a go
at Mr. Badman, but
to&#151;</div><a name="10012672000114"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012672000453"></a>Mr.

you.</div><a name="10012672000115"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012672000454"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I think that I would rather that Mr.
Badman remains in the spotlight as far as the hon. Member for Beverley
and Holderness is
concerned.</div><a name="10012672000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
155 is important; I want to return to that in case it gets lost in our
debate. It would ensure that private schools would not be subjected to
the potential horrors of parent and pupil guarantees, however well
meaning they are. I hope that the Minister will be able to give us a
guarantee on that issue. If he is not able to do so, it is something to
which we might want to return when considering whether we need to press
any of the amendments in the group to a
Division.</div><a name="10012672000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
177 to 179 relate to funding. Amendment 177 would oblige the
Secretary of State to carry out an audit to investigate whether schools
have the necessary resources to implement the pupil and parent
guarantees. That would give at least some assurance to people in
schools who think that some of the guarantees might involve quite a lot
of additional cost, which the Secretary of State is on record as saying
will not be funded by the Government from additional central
moneys.</div><a name="10012672000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
178 would oblige the Secretary of State to evaluate the cost
implications of pupil and parent guarantees, and to take account the
needs of different pupils, while amendment 179 would oblige him to take
account of the potential staffing and resource implications of
delivering guarantees. We hope that the Minister will find some of the
amendments helpful, as he will no doubt want clarity on the issue of
funding.</div>
<a name="10012672000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is clear
that there are particular amendments that we would like to see adopted,
but we also have a major concern about the whole thrust of the
Government&#146;s planning in this area. We do not question their
good intentions, but we believe that their proposals will lead to a
bureaucratic maze, not to better school standards for most pupils and
parents.</div><a name="10012672000120"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10012672000455"></a><b class="B">Mr.

This is my first Bill Committee since 1999&#151;I cannot understand
why, but there we
are.</div><a name="10012672000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
would like to dwell for a few moments on the question of inclusion or
exclusion from the guarantee. I am broadly in favour of the guarantees
under the Bill. I acknowledge that there will be difficulties in their
implementation, but I am quite sure&#151;I have great
confidence&#151;that our teachers, head teachers and parents will
work constructively to promote a serious, real, deep and lasting
improvement to the way in which our schools deliver for pupils and the
aspirations of their
parents.</div><a name="10012672000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to deal with the question of the inclusions of academies, city
technology colleges and city colleges for the technology of the arts.
Of course they should be included. They are the great guardians of
diversity, for which we should be reading &#147;difference&#148;,
as many parents seek not to get their children educated along with the
mass, but, in a way, to create a difference. The diversity 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column165" />Column number: 165</div>is a cloak, and I hope that as we go through the Bill, people will
recognise that we should be blunt and frank about the purposes some
have in seeking to create a difference in education to gain longer-term
life advantages.</div>

am fully in support of the Government&#146;s inclusion of academies,
city technology colleges and city colleges in their proposals for
guarantees. I hope that Labour Members will recognise this is an
important step in ensuring all children have an equal opportunity in
their schooling. The quicker we close down the differences&#151;while
of course preserving a measure of diversity for those who want
it&#151;the better it will be for all children concerned and the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012672000456"></a>Caroline
Flint:</b> It is a delight to serve under your chairmanship,
Mr Amess.</div>
<a name="10012672000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to
make a few brief points. It is still very difficult for parents to
navigate their way through what they can expect from a school. There
are some fantastic examples of schools that engage with parents and
have clear communications, but I am afraid that some schools do not. In
particular, when it comes to secondary schools, this becomes more of a
problem, although this is nothing to do with the school itself. The
nature of a secondary school means that children are going to school
more or less by themselves, so the sort of conversations that primary
school parents and teachers might have at the school gate are not as
likely.</div>
<a name="10012672000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">Speaking as
someone who considers herself confident in most situations, I saw a
very big change in the relationships that my husband and I had with
teachers and staff in primary schools compared with those in secondary
schools. It is the nature of the change that is difficult. Regardless
of legitimate concerns that hon. Members are expressing about the
meaning of the guarantees and the way in which they will be taken up by
the local government ombudsman, it is worth saying that in the 21st
century in our state supported sector, including in academies and other
schools, we should have something in place to give parents the chance
to have a worthier, more productive discussion with the school of their
choice about what their children should receive.</div>
<a name="10012672000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">To that end,
I think that the consultation that is under way on what the guarantees
should look like is important. I am sure my hon. Friend the Minister
for Schools and Learners and his colleagues in the Department will be
mindful that that piece of work is absolutely essential if we are to
have confidence about the guarantees, as are the points that have been
made about what the costs might be.</div>
<a name="10012672000128"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012672000457"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> I am listening carefully to the right hon.
Lady&#146;s comments, which are informed by her own experience. Does
she believe that there should be a guarantee that would allow a parent
to meet the head teacher of the school when they wished to do
so?</div>
<a name="10012672000129"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012672000458"></a>Caroline
Flint:</b> I do not see why not. I am going to be careful
about my choice of words here. I meet a lot of
constituents&#151;perhaps other Committee members do  as
well&#151;who lack confidence about what they can ask for within a
school. It never fails to surprise me when 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column166" />Column number: 166</div>people come to my surgery and raise issues about their relationships
with schools. I am pleased to say that it does not happen every day of
the week, but it happens occasionally. I sometimes wonder, by putting
myself in their place, why they do not feel they can ask for certain
things and are coming to a Member of Parliament to find out if they can
ask for them.</div>
<a name="10012672000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">As was said
during last week&#146;s evidence session, clearly several of these
guarantees are in place in some schools. A number of other schools are
fulfilling newer entitlements as well. This is about trying to create a
platform of clearer expectations for schools that parents can have, and
also about bringing in best practice so that it becomes the mainstream.
This issue of funding is quite important here. While some schools are
granting these entitlements and some are not, actually raising and
mainstreaming best practice is not a bad thing. If some schools are
already providing in these areas, it gives rise to the question of what
additional money is needed. Perhaps people in those schools are smarter
about how they use their resources and have looked at their guarantees
to parents as a more holistic, meaningful and integrated aspect of what
they do as a school. This is not about a separate cost measure here or
there; it is just part of the ethos of that
school.</div><a name="10012672000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
thing I have found difficult over the years as an MP and as a Minister
is seeing fantastically good practice but then pulling my hair out and
saying, &#147;Why can&#146;t we mainstream more of that?&#148;
The Government need to consider what works and help to make it more
mainstream. They should certainly give parents the tools on the ground
to demand better. The other sad fact of life is that expectations in
our poorer communities can be pretty low, even&#151;dare I
say&#151;among the public servants and bodies who are charged with
raising expectations in those communities. Sometimes the community and
parents, perhaps because they left school early themselves and did not
have a good experience, can find it difficult to ask for what they
should expect from the schools that their children
attend.</div><a name="10012672000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
think that the guarantees are at least an opportunity to try to set out
better what parents should be looking and asking for. If that is set
alongside other ways in which parents can be more fully
involved&#151;this is probably why Save the Children and the National
Children&#146;s Bureau support the guarantees&#151;that can only be
good. Having said that, the point has been raised about whether
academies should be involved. It is important to set out what everyone
should generally be supporting, but the ways in which schools go about
doing it can vary, and that is where innovation and creativity in a
school can come in. We heard a bit about that last week when we were
talking about areas of learning and cross-curriculum activities and
themes. I think schools will approach guarantees in different ways, but
the important thing is that the parent can stand back and say,
&#147;Do you know what? I am pretty satisfied about how they
supported that guarantee and made it
work.&#148;</div><a name="10012672000133"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012672000459"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> Mr. Amess, good morning to you and the
Committee. It is very good to be serving under your and Mrs.
Anderson&#146;s chairmanship. I also welcome the hon. Members for
Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, for Yeovil and for East Worthing and
Shoreham and all other members of the Committee, including my hon.
Friends.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column167" />Column number: 167</div><a name="10012672000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have had an
informative and interesting debate and I hope that we will continue in
that vein. There will obviously be points of difference, but I think
that the Committee will try to clarify certain points and to improve
the Bill where necessary. The tone of this debate represents a welcome
start.</div><a name="10012672000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">Further
to the comments made by my right hon. Friend the Member for Don Valley
and my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, North-East, the
Government are trying to lay out what the state&#146;s offer is for
the young people of this country. This radical, reforming measure tries
to pull together all the various things that we would expect to be
going on in our state schools&#151;academies, city technology
colleges and local authority maintained schools. To set that out and
say, &#147;This is what you as a pupil should be able to expect from
your school, and this is what you as a parent should be able to
expect,&#148; is a difficult and challenging task, but it is a task
from which we will not and should not shirk.</div>
<a name="10012672000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">I concede
that the hon. Member for Yeovil made one or two quite detailed and
relevant points about the nature of the guarantees, as did the hon.
Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton. There is a consultation
going on, if they want to contribute, and we will take account of
remarks made in
Committee.</div><a name="10012672000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
understand the points that have been made about entitlements and
offers. The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton was careful
about saying that he was totally opposed and he talked about an
optional process. At the end of the day, many things in the White Paper
are things that, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Don Valley
said, people expect to be going on in schools. The reality is that that
is absolutely true&#151;it is what is going on in many schools. The
aspiration of this Government&#151;and of all of us, I am
sure&#151;is that it should happen in every single school in every
single community so that no child is disadvantaged. That is what we are
trying to lay out in the document. It is a challenge; it is difficult.
The easy option would be not to do it. Not spelling out what the
state&#146;s offer should be is the easy option, but we are not
prepared to choose
that.</div><a name="10012672000138"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012672000460"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> The Minister says that many of the guarantees are
already being delivered in schools. Will he clarify and comment on the
guarantee on page 98 of the White Paper that states that every 11 to
14-year-old should enjoy &#147;relevant and challenging
learning&#148;? It states that that is to
be</div><a name="10012672000378"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;phased
in by September
2010&#148;.</div><a name="10012672000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">Is
it the Government&#146;s view that a number of schools are not
already delivering that
guarantee?</div><a name="10012672000140"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012672000461"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> One would have to say that every school is
attempting to deliver a relevant and challenging curriculum, but
whether every school is doing it to the standard that we want is
another question. We are trying to spell out for parents and pupils
that there is a standard that we want to see, and a type and quality of
education provision that we expect in a school, including through the
guarantee that the hon. Gentleman mentioned. That is the standard that
we want to see met, not only in some schools, but in every single
school. Frankly, many schools will deliver that.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column168" />Column number: 168</div><a name="10012672000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall deal
with some of the specifics that were raised. The hon. Member for Bognor
Regis and Littlehampton talked about what the local government
ombudsman can do and what the redress would be. I refer him to
paragraph 19 on page 12 of the White Paper, where the powers of the
ombudsman, which we are putting out for consultation, are laid out. The
things that the ombudsman can do, should a complaint be referred, are
clearly listed. For example, the ombudsman could recommend</div>
<a name="10012672000379"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a different
action by the school or provider, which may be appropriate when
something to which a parent or pupil is entitled has not been provided
for a significant time to their
detriment&#148;.</div><a name="10012672000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
could be the
recommendation</div><a name="10012672000380"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;that
practices be changed for the
future&#148;</div><a name="10012672000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">or</div><a name="10012672000381"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;that
the school or local authority provide additional training for its
staff.&#148;</div><a name="10012672000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
document goes on to say that the ombudsman could publish its
recommendations to the school and require it or the local authority to
publish a
response.</div><a name="10012672000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">People
might say, however, &#147;That is fine. They have published a
response, but what happens then?&#148; Several of my hon. Friends
have raised that point. Should the Secretary of State believe that the
school has failed, or be dissatisfied with the action that the school,
governing body or local authority has taken, he can direct that redress
should be taken. This is therefore not a meaningless paper
exercise.</div><a name="10012672000146"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012672000462"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> This comes to the root of the guarantees. The
Minister says that the ombudsman can publish his recommendations, but
how can he recommend a change in the approach to teaching reading in a
primary school if he does not feel competent enough to engage in
curriculum or pedagogical issues? That is the conundrum that lies at
the heart of the
guarantees.</div><a name="10012672000147"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012672000463"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> The LGO clearly is a professional who will publish
those things that he is confident about publishing and make
recommendations that he considers that he has the capacity, knowledge
and the skills to make. I want to put it on record that when the
majority of parents talk to a class teacher, matters are resolved. In a
few cases, parents will go the head of year or head of house, when the
problem is often resolved. In fewer cases, parents then go to the head
teacher or the governing body. We call that the normal complaints
procedure. I am sure that, as parents, many of us have been to school
only to ask about what is going on rather than to complain. It is only
when there is a feeling that certain things that are laid out as
guarantees have not been met that such a form of redress is given to
the local government
ombudsman.</div><a name="10012672000400"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.45
am</div><a name="10012672000148"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012672000464"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> The Minister said that he expects only a few
complaints to get through to the ombudsman level. Has the Department
come up with an estimate of the numbers we are talking about in respect
of the ombudsman and the likely
costs?</div><a name="10012672000149"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012672000465"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> A figure of about 2,200 was mentioned in the
impact assessment, which deals with complaints made to the ombudsman.
If I dig through the pages, I 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column169" />Column number: 169</div>could find it. However, perhaps the hon. Gentleman will take the figure
of 2,200 as being the number of complaints. I do not have the actual
details in front of
me.</div><a name="10012672000150"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012672000466"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> Does not the 2,200 relate to measures under the
Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Act 2009, not to the
guarantees under the
Bill?</div><a name="10012672000151"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012672000467"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> That is right. I was describing what had happened
in the past. I do not know whether the figure will be less or more, but
the figure of 2,200 applies, as the hon. Gentleman said, to previous
legislation. I was just using it to show him where we
are.</div><a name="10012672000152"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012672000468"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for being so patient,
but the figure will not be less, will it? Given that there are new
powers relating to matters that can be taken to the ombudsman, the
figure will be higher than it was under the previous Act. Surely we
need some sort of estimate of how much higher it will
be?</div><a name="10012672000153"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012672000469"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> I do not know whether the figure will be higher.
One of the things we could say, for example, is that when guarantees
are laid out with statutory force, in many circumstances, practice will
improve to the extent that people will not feel the need to go to the
ombudsman because the variability to which we have referred will not be
there. All we have done is explain the figure under the previous Act.
We are speculating about the future, but initially we expect the
schools to deal with parental complaints or concerns, and that the
majority of them
will.</div><a name="10012672000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
turn now to a broader point. The idea that because we change policy or
how we do something means that we will abolish a desire to help gifted
and talented pupils is nonsense. The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and
Littlehampton cannot be accused of wanting to abolish the desire to
help all children read because he is obsessed with phonics, but that is
the consequence of his argument. No one disagrees with the idea that
all children should read, but because we disagree with how people are
doing it and wish to see the policy change, that does not mean that we
want to abolish the objective of everyone reading. That is exactly what
we have done with gifted and talented children. We just think that
there is a better way of doing it, and that does not mean that we are
undermining our desire to help those who are gifted and talented. That
will remain our overall objective, and that is true of all our
guarantees.</div><a name="10012672000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">How
the guarantees are met will, in most circumstances, be a matter for the
schools to determine. We are saying that for the state to lay out what
is to be expected is the right thing to do.</div>
<a name="10012672000156"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012672000470"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> Guarantee 3.10 in the consultation document says
that:</div><a name="10012672000382"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;every
pupil identified as gifted and talented receives written confirmation
by their school of the extra challenge and support they will
receive&#148;.</div><a name="10012672000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">Do
I take it from the Minister&#146;s comments that that guarantee will
remain and that, despite the fact that &#163;20 million of
funding is going, schools will continue to be required to identify
those children and to confirm that in
writing?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column170" />Column number: 170</div><a name="10012672000158"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012672000471"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> Yes. That is the policy at the moment and it is
the intention to do
that.</div><a name="10012672000159"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012672000472"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I will not continue with the &#147;gifted and
talented&#148; question. However, let me ask the Minister another
question. He has just said that it will be up to schools to decide how
to deliver the guarantees. Surely that is not the case in relation to
the tuition guarantee. The Government are actually stating&#151;and
differentiating between primary and secondary schools&#151;how the
one-to-one extra tuition guarantee will be implemented. Why on earth
should the Government prescribe how that should be
delivered?</div><a name="10012672000160"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012672000473"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> On &#147;gifted and talented&#148;, which is
what I thought the hon. Gentleman was going to ask about, the money has
not changed at all: it is just a different way of using the money. This
is exactly the point that my right hon. Friend the Member for Don
Valley made, and which I was going to make at the end of my remarks but
will make now, because it is relevant. The hon. Gentleman&#146;s view
of any reform is that there must be more money. Why is it that, in a
significant number of schools up and down the country, many of these
guarantees are being implemented anyway, with exactly the same amount
of money as a school&#151;maybe a few miles away, or 50 miles
away&#151;that is not providing the same entitlement to its
pupils?</div><a name="10012672000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
one-to-one tuition, we have said to schools that, in key stage 3, we
will provide the funding for one-to-one tuition or small group work. In
key stage 2, as the hon. Gentleman said, it is one-to-one tuition.
However, as I pointed out to him on Second Reading, in key stage 1 it
is also one-to-one tuition and small group work. It will be for schools
to determine the best way to use one-to-one tuition and small group
work. I think the hon. Gentleman said we are obsessed with it&#151;I
am obsessed with it, and I know my hon. Friend the Member for
Wolverhampton, North-East is, too. All the evidence supports us. A
university&#151;from memory, Bristol university&#151;has done some
work on the impact of one-to-one tuition and small group work on
children who are behind in numeracy and literacy. I apologise to the
Committee if, from memory, I have got this wrong, Mr. Amess.
However, there has certainly been a recent piece of research from one
university that has shown the dramatic impact of that work on literacy
and numeracy.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012672000475"></a>Mr.

do not get to the point where everyone says, &#147;The Minister has
taken
hours.&#148;</div><a name="10012672000164"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012672000476"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I am very grateful to the Minister. It really is
helpful when he is willing to engage in a proper
debate.</div><a name="10012672000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
certainly am not objecting to one-to-one tuition. I am objecting to the
Government&#146;s prescribing, in a very detailed way, how it should
be delivered. Is the Minister saying to me that the moneys in this area
will not be as ring-fenced as I think, and that no particular cohort
will be required to have one-to-one tuition, rather than small group
work, if the head teacher and class teacher decide that small group
work is a better way to deliver a lesson than one-to-one
tuition?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column171" />Column number: 171</div><a name="10012672000166"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012672000477"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> I think I am saying to the hon. Gentleman
that&#151;from memory&#151;if he looks at the entitlement with
respect to key stage 1, it says one-to-one tuition and small group
work.</div>
<a name="10012672000167"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012672000478"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> It is the other way
round.</div><a name="10012672000168"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012672000479"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> I cannot remember which way round it is, without
thumbing through it. In key stage 1, it says small group work and
one-to-one tuition. With key stage 2, it says one-to-one tuition. With
key stage 3, it says one-to-one tuition and small group work. So, in
two out of the three, it says one-to-one tuition and small group work.
In one of them, it says just one-to-one tuition. As for the point that
the hon. Gentleman makes about the huge amount of additional money that
the Government are making available to primary schools&#151;and to
year 7 in order to catch up&#151;we want schools to use that, either
through small group work or one-to-one tuition in a way that will
enable those pupils who have fallen behind to catch
up.</div><a name="10012672000169"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012672000480"></a>Mr.
Purchase:</b> This question of one-to-one tuition is at the
heart of the guarantee and the resolution of difficulties. It seems to
me that one-to-one tuition and small group work are ideal ways of
resolving problems for parents who feel that their children are not
receiving the sort of tuition that will guarantee those particular
outcomes. The hon. Member for Yeovil is right to say that this is
complicated. We are laying out in detail the state&#146;s offer,
which substitutes for what the hon. Gentleman would understand as the
crude supply and demand model of the private sector, whereby a parent
simply decides, either by deep analysis or whim, that they will leave
their child at a school or take their child away. The state has to set
out that offer in detail, and that is what we are doing
now.</div><a name="10012672000170"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012672000481"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> My hon. Friend puts it extremely well. This is a
passionate debate for all of us. None of us wants to see young people
fall behind in this area. The hon. Member for Yeovil talks about
funding: more than &#163;300 million of additional investment will be
made next year to deliver the guarantee. This is a
consultation&#151;people have heard what the hon. Gentleman said
about one-to-one tuition and small group work&#151;but I wish to
confirm that, in key stage 1 the guarantee is of small group work or
one-to-one tuition; in key stage 2 the guarantee is of one-to-one
tuition; and at key stage 3 the guarantee is of one-to-one tuition or
small group work. That is where the guarantee stands at the moment. Our
key point is that the Government are investing in a tried and tested
manner to ensure that young people who fall behind are given the
support they need in order to catch
up.</div><a name="10012672000171"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012672000482"></a>Caroline
Flint:</b> We in Doncaster are in receipt of additional money
intended to support catch-up programmes. I have an
outstanding letter from the council detailing how it will support the
implementation of this. Clearly, whether it is
one-to-one tuition or small group work, it is important that there is
early assessment of whether the programme is working. I hope that local
authorities see this as part of their role as well as that of the
schools; we should not have to wait another academic year to see
whether this is working or not. From  my experience, some
intervention work can lead to extraordinary results in a matter of
months&#151;within a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column172" />Column number: 172</div>school term. I hope that will be focused on; the outcomes will be
important, but we also need to recognise that we sometimes need a
different approach to learning, especially when a child has fallen
behind and the whole-class approach is not
working.</div><a name="10012672000172"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012672000483"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> I agree with that. The prize is enormous. For
years we have been struggling with young children&#151;sometimes in
the most disadvantaged and difficult areas, but not always&#151;who
have fallen behind, particularly in literacy. Boys in particular often
have difficulties with writing. If, through the guarantee, we can do
something about that, we will do an enormous amount to break the link
between social deprivation and educational attainment and
achievement.</div><a name="10012672000173"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012672000484"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> Outside the debate, obviously I support the
concept of individual and personalised teaching. Could the Minister
give a guarantee that the money that is pledged for small group work,
for example, will not detract from effective work with parents to
ensure that work carries on at home? Particularly at key stage 1, that
must continue regardless of these extra
guarantees.</div><a name="10012672000174"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012672000485"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> That is a fair point. This is not about replacing
good practice in schools involving parents. I went to a scheme at
Wandsworth where prisoners were encouraged to talk to their sons and
daughters. All these things are important. This is not about replacing
them, it is about working alongside
them.</div><a name="10012672000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
me move on to a couple of other points. Of course we should correct
language where appropriate, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Don
Valley said. I say to the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and
Littlehampton that guarantee 2.2 is a guarantee for the curriculum, but
he will notice that it is a guarantee for the curriculum to be tailored
to the pupils. That does not mean that we are tailoring the curriculum
because pupils have not reached the appropriate level, as he
complained. As he knows, tailoring the curriculum to the particular
needs of individual pupils gives them more chance of reaching the level
that is required and expected of
them.</div><a name="10012672000401"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12
noon</div><a name="10012672000176"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012672000486"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> The guarantee says:</div>
<a name="10012672000383"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;so
that...every primary pupil receives the support they need to
secure good
literacy&#148;.</div><a name="10012672000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will
the Minister define what is meant by &#147;good literacy&#148;? If
he cannot define it, that is more evidence that the guarantees are
meaningless. I suspect that &#147;good literacy&#148; means that by
the time a child is 11, they have reached level 4 in
English.</div><a name="10012672000178"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012672000487"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> The hon. Gentleman will know that we set a target
with respect to young people and level 4. Now&#151;again this is from
memory&#151;approximately 80 per cent. are achieving level
4. That is a dramatic increase in the number of primary school children
reaching the expected level. The aim of the guarantee is to continue
that work. Of the 20 per cent. who do not reach level 4, two thirds
have special needs.</div>
<a name="10012672000179"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012672000488"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> What are the special
needs?</div><a name="10012672000180"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012672000489"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> They vary from children with significant special
needs who are in special schools to those with another form of learning
difficulty that causes them 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column173" />Column number: 173</div>problems with reading. Dyslexia is another issue, which is why we have
put investment into that. The British Dyslexia Association and others
would say that personalising learning to a greater extent than has
already happened for some young people with special needs will
accelerate their progress. As some Committee members will know, one of
the big problems with dyslexia has always been diagnosing or
recognising it. Of course, we want every young person to achieve what
they are capable of, and by tailoring the curriculum to their
particular individual needs, there is more opportunity for them to do
so.</div>
<a name="10012672000181"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012672000490"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> This is very important. Does the Minister mean that
guarantee 2.2 states is that every pupil in a school, other than those
children with a special educational need related to learning
difficulty, should be receiving a level 4 in
English?</div>
<a name="10012672000182"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012672000491"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012672000492"></a>Mr.

guarantee.</div>
<a name="10012672000184"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012672000493"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> The guarantee is to tailor the curriculum to the
needs of the individual pupil. Our target is that all pupils who are
able will reach level 4. The expectation is that the guarantee of
tailoring will enable more young people to reach the target that is
expected of them.</div>
<a name="10012672000185"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012672000494"></a>Caroline
Flint:</b> I understand what my hon. Friend says about
children with special needs and their capacity, with support, to reach
level 4. I respect organisations such as the British Dyslexia
Association. However, I hope we will be mindful of the labelling of
children.  I firmly believe that there are children in our
school system who have received the label of special educational needs
when the real issue is parenting, concentration skills, and skills
associated with early development. The right sort of one-to-one or
group work could lead to them no longer being defined as children with
special educational needs. We need to remember that, instead of
allowing labels to get in the way. I am not suggesting that my hon.
Friend is in support of this, but early labelling sometimes masks
issues that can be put right to allow children to be set on the right
track again. We have seen that with some interesting literacy projects
in schools that went back to basics to see what had gone wrong.
Children who had been regarded as badly behaved, non-attentive and
lacking in concentration skills&#151;which was barring their ability
to learn to read&#151;were completely transformed and turned
around.</div>
<a name="10012672000186"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012672000495"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> I agree with that, and of course we should never
label children. We should always try to identify any needs that they
have and ensure that the curriculum is matched to those so that they
can achieve the best that they possibly can&#151;whatever that is.
That applies as much to gifted and talented pupils as to those with
particular learning difficulties.</div>
<a name="10012672000187"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012672000496"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> The guarantee does not only say that the curriculum
should be tailored to meet every child&#146;s needs. It
says:</div><a name="10012672000384"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;so
that...they...secure good
literacy&#148;</div><a name="10012672000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
the Minister interprets that sentence, which I admit is ambiguous, to
mean that there is no guarantee in this 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column174" />Column number: 174</div>guarantee that children will secure good literacy, it is an interesting
revelation. He otherwise needs to say that he expects all children,
other than those with a statement of special educational needs for
learning difficulty, to receive a particular level in literacy,
otherwise it makes the thing pointless. Will he also tell the Committee
about the pilot that has been conducted into the guarantees, which was
referred to in the evidence
session?</div>
<a name="10012672000189"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012672000497"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> I will come back to the
pilot.</div><a name="10012672000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am sorry to repeat this, but the important point is the tailoring of
the curriculum to ensure that all pupils achieve the very best that
they can. Obviously that will be difficult for some pupils with special
educational needs, but by tailoring the curriculum, we can ensure that
more pupils reach level 4, which is the target and the standard that we
want.</div><a name="10012672000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Yeovil mentioned the issue of access, which is an
important point. Sometimes we will expect a school to be able to
deliver certain things, but in the modern world, as the hon. Gentleman
will know, many schools provide additional opportunities for their
pupils by ensuring that they have access to out-of-school clubs, which
they themselves may not run. They provide access to leisure centres and
outdoor pursuits, as I see time and again when I go out and about.
Schools provide access to opportunities, but to go back to the point
made by my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, North-East and my
right hon. Friend the Member for Don Valley, that that is often
variable. Some schools with exactly the same resources as
others&#151;</div><a name="10012672000192"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012672000498"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012672000499"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> I know that the hon. Gentleman will want to talk
about
funding.</div><a name="10012672000194"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012672000500"></a>Mr.
Laws</b> <i class="I">indicated dissent.</i></div>
<a name="10012672000195"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012672000501"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> Perhaps I misunderstood. Access to additional,
important things such as sport, outdoor adventure and foreign trips is
available to some pupils. We are trying to say through the guarantee,
&#147;Why should that be available to some and not everyone?&#148;
That is our challenge for schools.</div>
<a name="10012672000196"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012672000502"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> That is certainly an important point, but the issue
I want to raise with the Minister is not funding but what access
actually means. It sounds great to think that we can offer access and
that suddenly people will be doing a lot of sport, going to museums and
taking part in community service. However, what will a school or
college have to do to deliver access? Does that mean that pupils will
have to attend, even if the activity is out of school? Will the
requirement be met simply by sticking a sign up saying,
&#147;There&#146;s a community service if you&#146;d like to join
it and a rugby club if you&#146;d like to join that&#148;? What
sounds like a rich guarantee could be pretty meaningless. The way in
which schools deliver the access and the extent to which the process is
passive will be
crucial.</div><a name="10012672000197"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012672000503"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> It is not passive at all. The idea is to try to
make an active guarantee to ensure that this is not, as the hon.
Gentleman suggests, a case of someone putting up a notice about a rugby
club. Many schools will not do that. This is a determined, proactive
way to try to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column175" />Column number: 175</div>generate interest and information about what is available and to
encourage the attitude and desire to take advantage of
it.</div><a name="10012672000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman is a bright individual and he knows what access
means&#151;it means exactly what it says. It is not meant to be a
platitude or an empty piece of rhetoric. It is meant to challenge
schools to ask how they try to provide additional opportunities for
those young people for whom it is responsible that the school itself
might not be able to provide with its facilities. Many schools up and
down the country do that with sports and cultural activity. Through the
guarantee, we are saying that such drive, enthusiasm and determination
needs to be replicated in every
school.</div><a name="10012672000199"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012672000504"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> Does the Minister agree that the guarantee will be
incredibly difficult to police? In some areas, there will be large
numbers of people who will not end up taking up the guarantee of five
hours&#146; culture through attending museums, libraries and
performing arts organisations. There will be schools in which the vast
majority of pupils do not reach the five-hour access target. How will
it be possible for the LGO to ascertain whether that is because the
opportunities that have been offered were not taken up, or because the
school has not been serious about them? Surely the proposal will be
incredibly difficult to implement and assess in
practice.</div><a name="10012672000200"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012672000505"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> I think that shrugging one&#146;s shoulders and
saying that that is not possible for a lot of schools represents a
poverty of aspiration. I accept that it might be challenging and
difficult for some schools. Some schools have difficulty providing it,
and it is a challenge to every school. On how the LGO will look at the
issue, the ombudsman has an obligation to act reasonably and will be
reasonably able to demonstrate that a school has done as much as
possible to deliver the guarantee. That is something that I think is
acceptable.</div><a name="10012672000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
answer the point made by the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and
Littlehampton, there is an 18-month pilot of the parents&#146;
complaints service in the LGO that has arisen under the
Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Act 2009, which passed
into law a few months ago. Four areas are being piloted for six months,
and 15 other areas are being piloted for one year. Depending on the
outcome of the pilots, the measure will go nationwide in 2011. The
results for the four six-month pilot areas will be published in
September 2010, and those for the 15 one-year pilot areas will be
published in the early summer of 2011. If the hon. Gentleman was not
able to write that down, I will give him the figures again at the
end.</div><a name="10012672000202"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012672000506"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> I am grateful for that helpful
answer.</div><a name="10012672000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">Guarantee
2.3 states that every pupil should have the opportunity to learn how to
play a musical instrument. Will that be for

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012672000507"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012672000508"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> Will the Minister give way one more time?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column176" />Column number: 176</div><a name="10012672000207"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012672000509"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> Before I give way to the hon. Gentleman, let me
say that I will not give way when I make my formal remarks about the
amendments because otherwise we will never get to the
end.</div>
<a name="10012672000208"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012672000510"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I thought that the Minister was about to conclude
his speech. All I was looking for was a reassurance that he would
respond to some of the
amendments.</div><a name="10012672000209"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012672000511"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> Everyone takes the mick when people say, &#147;I
hope that no one will complain about the amount of time that I have
taken.&#148; There we go. I will now formally respond to the
amendments, take no more interventions, and finish in about 10 to 15
minutes.</div><a name="10012672000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
1 would make issuing guarantee documents an option rather than a duty
for the Secretary of State. However, a guarantee cannot be optional.
All parents and pupils must know what they can expect and what they are
guaranteed to receive from state-funded schools, including academies.
That can happen only if the document is
issued.</div><a name="10012672000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
pupil and parent guarantees build on the great improvements to the
school system of the past decade. They describe key elements of our
school system, drawing together existing and new entitlements. They
also introduce vital new entitlements in a number of important areas,
such as one-to-one tuition for primary pupils and those in year 7, and
a personal tutor for every pupil in year 7 through to year 11. It is
therefore essential that documents are issued to guarantee the
entitlements, and it is right that the Secretary of State should be
under a duty to do
so.</div><a name="10012672000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
number of the amendments deal with the schools to which the guarantees
apply. The first is amendment 41, which would mean that
parents and pupils at academies, city technology colleges and city
colleges for the technology of the arts would not benefit from
entitlements provided by the pupil and parent guarantees. The
guarantees apply to all maintained schools&#151;primary, secondary
and nursery schools&#151;as well as maintained special schools and
short-stay schools. They also apply to academies and it is right that
they do
so.</div><a name="10012672000402"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.15
pm</div><a name="10012672000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">Academies
are a valuable and significant part of our family of schools, but
pupils and their parents should have the same fundamental entitlements
in other state-funded schools. This is about what pupils and parents
should be entitled to expect from all state-funded schools and does not
threaten academies&#146; core freedoms, which we will continue to
maintain, as we know they have been key to raising standards and
improving the lives and chances of their
pupils.</div><a name="10012672000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
42 and 125 seek to remove the power of the Secretary of State to amend
by order the list of persons and bodies on which the guarantees can
impose legally binding requirements including guidance, aims and
objectives. Both amendments would also remove the power of the
Secretary of State to amend the list of types of schools to which the
pupil and parent guarantees apply. Currently the Bill places
requirements on local authorities in England, governing bodies and
other proprietors of schools, as well as head teachers.</div>
<a name="10012672000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsections
(9) and (10) are important, but we anticipate using the power within
them only rarely. They are necessary to ensure that the lists of
schools and bodies  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column177" />Column number: 177</div>to which the guarantees apply can be amended to reflect changes in the
structure of the education system. They would permit the guarantees to
impose requirements on other bodies in future if that were considered
appropriate, again to reflect changing circumstances and practice, or
to reflect the creation of a new body. By requiring  a positive
resolution of both Houses to approve any order amending subsections (2)
and (8), we are ensuring that any changes would receive the full and
proper scrutiny of Parliament, which they would deserve.</div>
<a name="10012672000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 155
seeks to amend subsection (9)(a) so that the bodies on which duties can
be placed would not include private schools. There is currently no
legal definition of private schools so its effect would be uncertain.
However, for the record, we do not intend to add heads and proprietors
of independent schools that are not state-funded to clause 1(2) or (8).
To do so would enable the guarantees document to place duties on
them.</div>
<a name="10012672000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 177
would add an additional requirement to clause 1. It would require the
Secretary of State, before issuing or revising the guarantees, to carry
out an audit of a school&#146;s capacity to comply with them. This
would include a consideration of training needs and financial and any
other requirements. The amendment argues for proper financial
consideration as we produce the guarantees and of course, that is what
we intend to give. That is why the Government have the impact
assessment process in place and why an assessment was published
alongside the consultation draft pupil and parent guarantees on Second
Reading. It is clear to me that we are following an established
process. An additional audit simply is not practical, and is likely to
be an expensive and unnecessarily bureaucratic process.</div>
<a name="10012672000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">The pupil and
parent guarantees are fully funded. As we have set out on a number of
occasions, many of the elements of the guarantees draw together
existing requirements, which have been established over the past 12
years and more, within the context of rising funding. Where important
new policies are introduced, these are fully funded. These include:
total funding for one-to-one tuition in key stage 2 and year 7 of
&#163;315 million in 2010 and 2011; funding available within the
dedicated schools grant to support personalised learning, including
personal tutors and special educational needs, of &#163;912 million
in 2010 and 2011; funding for extended services of
&#163;439 million in 2010 and 2011.</div>
<a name="10012672000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
would require the Secretary of State to assess training needs as well
as financial requirements. There is already a system in place in the
schools sector, led by the Training and Development Agency, for
identifying training needs and equipping teachers for the classroom.
None of the guarantees ask school staff to do things of a different
character and nature from what they currently deliver to a high
standard, and so we do not consider that such an audit would be
cost-effective or appropriate.</div>
<a name="10012672000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 178
would require the Secretary of State to assess the per pupil cost
implications of the guarantees, and set them out in the draft
guarantee. This would be a bureaucratic process duplicating cost
calculations which already exist elsewhere. We assess the cost
implications of all our policies and we have completed an impact
assessment for the guarantees, which is available publicly. We do not
therefore intend to include cost estimates in the draft guarantee. We
already calculate the funding provided per pupil in the school system,
and that figure 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column178" />Column number: 178</div>has risen from an average of &#163;3,030 in 1997 to &#163;6,350
today. Our intention is for the delivery of the pupil and parent
guarantee entitlements to be cost-neutral, as they bring together
existing duties with fully funded initiatives. Amendment 178 also
suggests that we should take account of the different learning and
developmental needs of pupils. Schools should have the flexibility in
the way they allocate their resources and organise themselves to
provide for their pupils, and the pupil-parent guarantees are framed
with that in
mind.</div><a name="10012672000221"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012672000512"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> Will the Minister do a U-turn and give
way?</div><a name="10012672000222"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012672000513"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> As long as I do not open the
floodgates.</div><a name="10012672000223"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012672000514"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> Has the Department made an assessment of whether
the pupil guarantees will be harder to deliver in rural areas, and
whether additional funding might therefore follow to such areas, where
access to cultural activities might involve greater transport
costs?</div><a name="10012672000224"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012672000515"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> Let me digress for a moment. I met the hon. Member
for Leominster yesterday to discuss rural areas. It was a useful
meeting. I also met head teachers and members of school governing
bodies. Aside from what we are discussing now, a review is going on of
school funding and how the cake should be divided up between the
different authorities. One debate within that is about sparsity and
whether what rural areas receive is sufficient. Alternative points of
view have been put forward in respect of other areas and such
discussion is part of the ongoing debate about the change that we shall
make to how the school grant is distributed from April 2011. However,
what the hon. Member for Leominster said yesterday will be fed into the
review and no doubt others will have heard the point made by the hon.
Member for Beverley and Holderness as they discuss the best way
forward.</div><a name="10012672000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
guarantees can be different for pupils at different types of schools
and for pupils of different descriptions. That means that the
guarantees make appropriate provision for those of different ages. The
provisions also allow the guarantees to cater specifically for children
with particular needs, such as those with SEN statements, a measure
that is fully factored into the consultation draft of the pupil and
parent
guarantees.</div><a name="10012672000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
179 would include in the guarantee provisions for schools to have
sufficient staff to meet the requirements that are imposed. Governing
bodies have a responsibility to ensure that they have enough
appropriately trained and qualified staff for the needs of their
school. That applies equally to teachers and support staff. I know that
there is a difference of view on which Opposition Members no doubt will
wish to test the Committee&#146;s opinion. Our debate has been
interesting and useful. It has dealt with some of the fundamental
issues within the pupil and parent
guarantees.</div><a name="10012672000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will finish where I started. The document is exciting. For the first
time, the state has laid out its offer to pupils and parents of what
they can expect from their schools. We want to ensure that all schools
offer the quality of education that we would all want for our own
children, and the document sets out exactly
that.</div><a name="10012672000228"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012672000516"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> The debate has been interesting. It has been
revealing. The Minister should be aware that  the guarantees
and their application to academies are 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column179" />Column number: 179</div>distressing the academies movement. It was summed
up by Dr. Moynihan in our evidence session, who said
that</div><a name="10012672000385"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
overarching thrust of the Bill is that it reduces academy freedoms; it
prescribes things that were not prescribed before and, in general for
the schools system, we believe that the guarantees and the licence to
teach are likely to be a bureaucratic
nightmare.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official Report, Children,
Schools and Families Public Bill Committee, </i>19 January 2010; c. 22,
Q32.]</div><a name="10012672000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is
the view of the measures among head teachers in the real world, who are
struggling to improve some of the most challenging schools in the
country.</div><a name="10012672000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
42 would delete subsections (9) and (10). The Minister said
that those secondary powers would be rarely used and that he needed
them to change primary legislation to reflect structural changes in the
education system. I would have thought that any such structural change
would have to be made by primary legislation, and that at that point it
would be possible to change section 1 of the Children, Schools and
Families Act 2010 to reflect those substantial changes. The fear is
that he wants to add in new schools or new organisations without any
structural changes to the education system having been made through
primary legislation, so we remain unconvinced by his response to
amendment
42.</div><a name="10012672000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
main concern relates to the debate that we have had about the general
guarantees, particularly guarantee 2.2, which
states:</div><a name="10012672000386"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
curriculum is tailored to every child&#146;s needs so that every
pupil receives the support they need to secure good literacy, numeracy
and ICT skills, learn another language and about the humanities,
science, technology and the arts.&#148;</div>
<a name="10012672000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister is saying
that that guarantee is about a tailored curriculum and not whether a
child is capable of reading properly and receives the support that they
need to have good literacy, good numeracy or ICT skills. It is not
about learning another language, about the humanities, science,
technology or the arts. It is not about learning any of those things.
All the ombudsman will consider is whether the curriculum is tailored
to every child&#146;s needs. He will go to the school, or
write  to it, and say, &#147;How are you tailoring the
curriculum in these areas to every child&#146;s needs.&#148; That
ties in with what Mr. Redmond said in his evidence to our
Committee last Tuesday. He said that the local government ombudsman
does not have the competence to look at the curriculum, pedagogy and
educational issues. It all fits in together now. What he will do is
conduct his inquiries in a tick-box approach, and say, &#147;What are
you doing, O school, to tailor the curriculum?&#148; Back
will come the response that they are doing this, this and this to
tailor the curriculum to every child&#146;s needs. The outcome of
that tailoring and of how the teaching is conducted is irrelevant. The
local government ombudsman can conduct his inquiry in the way in which
he conducts other local government inquiries, which is by looking to
see what is happening rather than looking at the outcome, and in that
way he will fulfil his duty.</div>
<a name="10012672000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">What we have
learned from today&#146;s debate is that there is no guarantee in
these guarantees as to the substance or the quality of the education
provided in our schools, which makes an absolute nonsense of all the
guarantees in the document. It is, as the hon. Member for Yeovil
suspected, just going to be one very large bureaucratic paper chase
that employs lots of people who will sit at desks in offices and send
missives 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column180" />Column number: 180</div>and e-mails, compile reports, publish recommendations, and send
directives to schools to buck up their ideas. That will be it. This is
a waste of time and a serious waste of money. The hon. Gentleman was
right to say that this is not the time to engage in huge wastes of
public money and increases in bureaucracy that will have no effect on
the quality of the education that our children receive. That is the
conclusion that I have drawn&#151;and I am sure that other hon.
Members will have drawn&#151;from the quality of this debate. We will
be pressing amendment 1 to a vote to test the views of the
Committee.</div>
<a name="10012672000234"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012672000517"></a>Mr.
Purchase:</b> Will the hon. Gentleman say a little more about
this particular subject? It seems to me that there is already in place
a professional inspection of schools, curriculum, pedagogy and so on
and so forth. Surely the job of the ombudsman will be to ensure that
the administration is being done competently and properly&#151;as he
does in every other complaint&#151;and not impede the professional
input of
teachers?</div><a name="10012672000235"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012672000518"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes my point for me. If he is
saying that the purpose of the guarantees is to ensure that other
bureaucrats in the system are doing their job properly, then that is a
different issue from what the rhetoric has led us to believe about
these guarantees. He is just asking another guardian to guard the other
guardians. If I had been educated well enough, I would have said that
in

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012672000519"></a>Mr.
Purchase:</b> It is worth discussing that point: who inspects
the inspectors? That is always the question; but in this instance we
are talking about an already very sophisticated professional inspection
system that exists to ensure that the pedagogy is correct and properly
worked out. The layout in question&#151;the ombudsman
intervention&#151;is very worthwhile. It has proved to be so in every
other area of public life. I am probably one of the few here who were
grown up when Harold Wilson introduced the ombudsman system, so I
remember well what it was about. It would be an excellent supplementary
provision, and superb for building parents&#146; confidence with
respect to their children&#146;s welfare and learning at
school.</div>
<a name="10012672000237"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012672000520"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> If all the guarantees are about giving parents and
pupils the right to complain to the ombudsman about maladministration,
I should have thought that that right already existed. It is quite
difficult, as the hon. Gentleman will know from his constituency work,
for any ombudsman to take up issues, when it is necessary to prove
maladministration. I thought that the guarantees would go one stage
further; perhaps they would, and perhaps the hon. Gentleman is arguing
that.</div>
<a name="10012672000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, from
what he has said, all that they would do is check the quantum: all the
ombudsman would consider would be the question: &#147;Are you
tailoring your curriculum?&#148; The school would respond,
&#147;Yes; this is how we are doing it.&#148; &#147;Are you
providing five hours of opportunity for cultural or sporting
activity?&#148; &#147;Yes, we are; here is the timetable.&#148;
If it is just a matter of tick-boxes for the quantum of what is
promised, that is a completely different guarantee from one about
whether  the substance and quality of what is promised is
of  high value.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column181" />Column number: 181</div><a name="10012672000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">In my
experience, parents will complain not about the quantum but about the
quality. What we have learned in the debate is that the ombudsman will
investigate not the quality or substance but solely whether the
timetable and the offer are available. Frankly, that is all the
ombudsman is competent to do, as he admitted&#151;unless educational
experts are brought
in.</div><a name="10012672000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
the right hon. Member for Don Valley made an excellent speech, and I
was interested to hear that she believed that parents should have the
right to meet the head teacher. I agree. I hear too often about parents
who have tried to meet the head and have been rebuffed. I cannot
understand why that should be. When such parents in the end meet the
right hon. Lady, who does not rebuff their request, she must write to
the school to press the head teacher for a
meeting.</div><a name="10012672000241"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012672000521"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> To clarify, and to show that I do not see a Bill
Committee as just a cosmetic exercise, I want to tell my right hon.
Friend the Member for Don Valley and the hon. Member for Bognor Regis
and Littlehampton that although that right is not in the consultation
document, I think we should consider it, and I shall consider it
further.</div>
<a name="10012672000242"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012672000522"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> Super. That is a joint victory for the right hon.
Lady and Opposition Members.</div>
<a name="10012672000243"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012672000523"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I fear that the hon. Gentleman is being sucked down
the same bureaucratic hole that he has been trying to resist. If the
cross-party consensus is delivered, will the Minister ensure that any
such guarantee is implemented in a sensible way? Parents might want to
raise the same issue 20 times with the head, and heads would not thank
us if we got the balance wrong. The right hon. Lady raised a sensible
point, but let us not implement it in a bizarre and crackpot
way.</div>
<a name="10012672000244"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012672000524"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes a valid point. The
guarantee in question is 8.3, which states
that</div><a name="10012672000387"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;parents
can contact and meet a member of staff who knows their child
well&#151;a named Personal Tutor in secondary schools or their
child&#146;s teacher in primary
schools&#148;.</div><a name="10012672000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">Thus
the wording is adequate at the moment, as &#147;to meet&#148;
implies one meeting. My complaint was that that should surely include
meeting the head teacher, as well as a named personal
tutor.</div><a name="10012672000246"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012672000525"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> The hon. Member for Yeovil has completely spoiled
what I was going to do, but I shall do it anyway: I was going to say
that I am pleased that the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and
Littlehampton is now engaging with the question of what guarantees
parents should have. It is interesting that he is joining in with that
and thinks that an opportunity to meet the head teacher would be worth
while, which of course it would be.</div>
<a name="10012672000247"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012672000526"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> I think that schools should provide it, and allow
it, but I do not think that it should be part of a legislative and
bureaucratic procedure. However, if the Government are going to get the
provision on the statute book, we may as well improve it in any way
possible.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012672000527"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I hope that I will be a harder catch for the
Minister than the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton has
proved to
be.</div><a name="10012672000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have had an extensive debate on the matter. The debate is important
because it relates to one of the central parts of the Bill, and
anticipates some issues that we will not need to return to later. I
would like to start by thanking the Minister for his generosity in
responding to all the interventions. I believe strongly that such
proceedings work best when Ministers are willing to take interventions
rather than simply read speeches into the record.</div>
<a name="10012672000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to
return briefly to a couple of issues. First,  I cannot resist
noting that the Minister rejected amendment 41, claiming
that pupils in academies had the same entitlements as pupils in all
maintained, state-funded schools. I gently point out that that is not
the case at the moment&#151;pupils in other maintained non-academy
schools have some entitlements that those in academies do not. In case
he thinks that I am arguing for more interventionism, I am not; I am
arguing for maximum
freedom.</div><a name="10012672000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have three, more substantive, points to make. I agree with one of the
points made by the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, North-East. I cannot
understand why he has not served on one of these Committees for
10 years, because he has proven to be a most loyal member of
the Government. I would have thought that that would have been noted by
the usual channels. Perhaps he will get additional opportunities in the
future.</div><a name="10012672000252"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012672000528"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> I am interested to hear the hon. Gentleman say
that he wants to have policies that will maximise freedom. However,
when questioned earlier about his views on the national curriculum,
having said that it was about giving freedom to the schools, he then
said that he wanted a smaller and narrower national curriculum
uniformly imposed. Will he support giving all schools an opt-out from
the national curriculum&#151;perhaps with a sufficient vote of
parents or the governing body&#151;to act as a safety valve when any
Government, of whatever hue, impose too much on
schools?</div><a name="10012672000253"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012672000529"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I am proposing a much smaller and more focused
minimum curriculum entitlement, rather than the huge and extensive
existing national curriculum. I am certainly not arguing&#151;I do
not believe that the Conservative party is arguing this
either&#151;that there should be no core curriculum at all. If that
is the hon. Gentleman&#146;s proposition, it is certainly not one
that I hear from Tory Front
Benchers.</div><a name="10012672000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
me return to the issue raised by the hon. Member for Wolverhampton,
North-East. He rightly said that it was important that we look, where
we have monopoly public services, at whether we can give people, who
are effectively the consumers of those services&#151;or citizens, if
the hon. Gentleman prefers that language&#151;entitlements that are
meaningful, sensible and enforceable. He also rightly points out that
not everyone can afford to go to the private sector if they do not like
what the state sector offers them, and that not everyone has a choice
of other hospitals or schools. We are not arguing that there should not
be core entitlements that are meaningful and sensible, but we are
asking whether the ones that we have are.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column183" />Column number: 183</div><a name="10012672000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our concern
with one-to-one tuition is how rigidly it will be implemented. We heard
from the Minister earlier that it would be implemented in one way in
key stage 1, another way in key stage 2 and yet another way in key
stage 3. Why implement it so rigidly? Why not fund it properly, make
the general entitlement clear and allow head teachers to deliver it in
the most sensible way? Why insist on one-to-one tuition in one setting,
and small group or one-to-one in
another?</div><a name="10012672000256"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012672000530"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> Obviously, the debate will continue. On the point
of funding, as I pointed out in my remarks, next year we are giving
funding to the tune of &#163;315 million specifically to
that area.</div>
<a name="10012672000257"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012672000531"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I understand that point. My issue is about the way
in which the guarantees are framed. I will return to the fact that some
of them are still so vague that they will be difficult to enforce, and
will give the ombudsman an impossible job.</div>
<a name="10012672000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have made
our views on that clear, which is why I will certainly support
amendment 1 if it is pressed to a Division. I also seek your
permission, Mr. Amess, to press amendment 155 to a Division.
I heard clearly what the Minister said about it, and it is clear that
at the moment, the Government&#146;s intention is to not extend the
powers to private schools. However, if that is the Government&#146;s
view, I would rather have that guarantee in the Bill, as would the
independent and private schools that have contacted us about the
issue.</div><a name="10012672000259"></a>

escalation of language, the degree of promise and the move into the
world of the courts that is the hallmark of the policy behind the pupil
and parent guarantees. It is as though the Government, having failed to
deliver on the entitlements and promises in their manifesto, have
decided simply to exaggerate the language, like a miscreant child who
promises &#147;I really, really will be good this time.&#148; My
hon. Friend the Member for Surrey Heath said on Second Reading that the
guarantees</div><a name="10012672000388"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;are
not just expectations that he is laying down as a political hope that
he will fund; they are not even matters inspectable by Ofsted, which
might lead a school into special measures if they are not provided.
They are legal guarantees&#151;far stronger than any of the other
obligations placed on schools. If a school breaks this guarantee, it
will presumably be breaking the
law.&#148;</div><a name="10012672000314"></a><div class="hs_Para">He

litigation into the hearts of our teachers.&#148;

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012672000551"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> We have heard a lot about the
&#147;whingers&#146; charter&#148; and the likelihood of
increased bureaucracy, complaints to the ombudsman and the rest, but is
it not also possible that the guarantees could have an impact on the
behaviour of schools, and not in a benign way? If the guarantees do
have bite, as we have often seen, schools might react by trying to
exclude certain pupils&#151;they might be more likely to take such
action if they believe that failing to do so may lead to problems. We
know of cases from the home education element of the Bill whereby
schools have actively encouraged parents to take their children out of
school to reduce truancy statistics. Will my hon. Friend comment on the
possible malign impact of the guarantees on the behaviour of schools?
Could they result in the reverse of the Minister&#146;s intentions by
having a negative impact on the most vulnerable pupils in our
schools?</div><a name="10012672000318"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012672000552"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> My hon. Friend makes a good point. If the guarantees
are interpreted in the way that we illuminated in the previous
debate&#151;as being simply a quantum&#151;the ombudsman would look
only at whether something is being offered. It could be the case that,
to avoid the possibility of litigation, schools might decide to offer
things by putting invitations on the notice board, having timetable
provisions or providing the possibility of music lessons, but without
actually delivering them, in order to fulfil the tick-box requirements
that they might face from the local government ombudsman, which might
result in a challenge in the courts. A lot of effort and time will be
spent offering those choices and providing the paperwork that makes it
appear that they are being offered, when the reality is something
different. It is a retrograde step to force schools to take an almost
Soviet 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column186" />Column number: 186</div>tractor-factory approach to our education system, whereby they tell the
guardians that they are doing such things, but everyone knows that that

want these to be guarantees for all pupils and all parents, not just

451.]</div><a name="10012672000321"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
all about political positioning, and playing the game of creating
dividing lines in politics. It is nothing to do with raising standards
in our schools. Passing laws guaranteeing things cannot be a substitute
for real policies. If we go through the so-called guarantees in the
Bill, it is hard to disagree with them, but let us use measured and
realistic language and not let legislation be used to promote soundbite
politics.</div><a name="10012672000322"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012672000553"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> What will worry parents and constituents the most
is the discrepancy between the language that we hear in this
place&#151;it is all too present in the Bill&#151;and the reality
on the ground. I want to apologise for leaving the Committee a little
earlier. I had a meeting with representatives of the Joint Epilepsy
Council, which is a group of 20 charities. One of the ladies who works
with epileptic children for one of the charities told me that she has
two pupils who, because they were given only one option for education
last year, which could not be delivered, have been at home without
education since September. Two epileptic children have not been
educated since September. Meanwhile, Ministers are talking ever more
about the high standards and guarantees that they will bring to
children. There is a yawning gap between the rhetoric we hear&#151;I
know the good intentions of Ministers&#151;and the reality on the
ground for vulnerable children who are often let
down.</div><a name="10012672000323"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
appeal to the Minister, although perhaps it is too late. Thank God, it
is the fag end of this particular Government. I say instead to my hon.
Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, whom I hope and
assume will become the Minister, instead of the shadow Minister, for
Schools in due course, that we will have a new Government who cease to
use rhetoric and start to work on the detail to support schools and
local authorities. Children need to know that they will have access in
their schools to cultural activities. They need to know that they will
be in a safe and disciplined environment. They need to know that they
will have access to language tuition, as I think the paper
outlined.</div><a name="10012672000324"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to pick up on languages, in which I am interested. When the right
hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, West and Hessle (Alan Johnson) was
Education Secretary, I remember asking him to review his decision 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column187" />Column number: 187</div>in 2004 to stop languages being mandatory. The truth is that, here we
are six years on, and there has been a collapse of one third in the
number of children taking GCSE language examinations. The figure is now
less than half. While nine out of 10 private schools ensure that their
pupils take a language GCSE, we are now down to two out of 10 state
schools.</div>
<a name="10012672000325"></a><div class="hs_Para">Schools in
the poorest areas, which struggle most to meet the results demanded of
them, have been particularly prone to reducing language teaching. That
is at a time when employers are particularly keen on languages, and in
many cases insist that people have language skills before employing
them. We have a discrepancy between guarantees promising access to
languages and the reality, particularly for the most vulnerable
children, that language courses are simply not being taught. Children
are being pushed into easy subjects so that the schools look good,
while pupils&#146; entitlement has actually
disappeared.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012672000554"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> Is the hon. Gentleman therefore suggesting that
languages should once again be compulsory to the end of key stage
4?</div>
<a name="10012672000327"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012672000555"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> The hon. Gentleman is right to ask
that&#151;that is exactly what I am suggesting. It is not the
position of my Front Benchers, but that can change. I welcome the
Government&#146;s move to make languages mandatory in primary
schools. We have had a load of measures to encourage language skills,
but not the follow-through to GCSE. I have tabled an early-day motion
on the matter. Members from all parties can, in the same independent
spirit that I am exercising, join me in calling on the Government, of
whatever hue, to reverse the 2004 decision to revoke the mandatory
nature of languages at GCSE, and ensure that we are not in a position
whereby the most privileged children in our society almost always do
languages at GCSE while the poorest children increasingly fail to be
given that education at precisely the time when, in pursuit of
employment, they need that
skill.</div><a name="10012672000328"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012672000556"></a>Mr.
Purchase:</b> Selective memory is wonderful. I will say two
words: league tables. The hon. Gentleman&#146;s Government, under
Mrs. Thatcher and others, introduced league tables,
poisoning the atmosphere in schools through what they had to do to show
that they were better and different from the school next door. My
party, unfortunately, has continued with that poisoned chalice, but we
are at least, and have been for some time, trying to back away and make
matters more rational by recognising that schools will do almost
anything to move up the league table. That has meant sacrificing
certain subjects in which it is more difficult to achieve good
results.</div><a name="10012672000329"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012672000557"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. We have been making splendid progress
this morning, but we are drifting away from the precise entitlement of
the
amendments.</div><a name="10012672000330"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012672000558"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> Thank you, Mr. Amess. I will try to
come to a close. What we always have in this House is an entitlement to
hear dinosaurs on the other Benches. If, in the 1980s, people had
continually referred back to the 1950s, they would rightly have been
laughed out of this place. We have people now, going on 13 years into a
Labour Government, blaming Mrs. Thatcher, who has not been
in power for nearly 20 years, for the fact that this Government keep
that policy. However, the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, North-East
makes a good point. We need a framework for the system. If you 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column188" />Column number: 188</div>accept that there must be transparency and we must allow parents to see
the performance of schools, we must ensure that the potentially malign
impact of the pressures created by league tables does not lead to
undesirable outcomes. That is exactly what happens now. The policy of
the hon. Gentleman&#146;s Government has been to stop mandatory
languages at GCSE at the same time as maintaining league tables, and
therefore the schools under the greatest pressure, threatened with
national challenge, have driven the children who most need a rigorous
education and access to languages away from that on to courses that
flatter the school but undermine the potential and chances of the
children. That has been the result of his Government, and that is why I
hope we can close the gap between the rhetoric and the reality on the
ground, which all too often is
gaping.</div>
<a name="10012672000331"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012672000559"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> The hon. Member for Beverley and Holderness has
made an interesting contribution to an interesting debate. He wants
students to be excited and inspired by languages and to enjoy language
learning. Far be it from me to defend his Front Benchers, but it may be
that they consider&#151;as I do&#151;that one can achieve that
objective in a different way. The hon. Gentleman mentioned that to
guarantee languages, as we are&#151;and this should not be an
entitlement, which is why I oppose the amendments&#151;is one of the
ways forward. Associated with that is the change to the primary
curriculum, which will ensure that languages are taught in primary
schools. If it comes to a choice about how one gets more people to do
more languages to a higher level, my view is that it should be done
through inspiring young children and changing their attitude and the
culture around language learning in primary school.</div>
<a name="10012672000332"></a><div class="hs_Para">There will be
a difference of view in and between parties because everybody has the
same objective of more people doing foreign languages. We have a
cultural issue with that in this country which we need to address.
Personally, I do not think that making it a compulsory GCSE overcomes
the problem. The guarantee and the national curriculum changes that the
Bill proposes in order to ensure that primary school children learn a
language may well be a better way of achieving our mutual
objective.</div><a name="10012672000333"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012672000560"></a>Caroline
Flint:</b> I agree with everything my hon. Friend has said.
However, is it not the sad truth&#151;and this is why literacy is so
important&#151;that if you are not confident with the language of the
country you live in, in this case English, then the leap to learn
another language is even more difficult? Some of these things are about
getting the basics right, and the enthusiasm and confidence to take on
another language or challenge is part of what comes along the way. Let
us be honest: where there are children who do not feel confident with
their English skills, either verbal or written, it is a big ask for
them to take on another language. That was one of the problems with the
way in which modern languages teaching was structured. There is nothing
to be gained by forcing children into doing a subject in which they are
not interested, and from which they come out with a qualification that
is not worth the paper it is written on.</div>
<a name="10012672000334"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012672000561"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> I agree. At the end of the day, the guarantees and
the changes in the national curriculum are about trying to change
attitudes. It is through 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column189" />Column number: 189</div>this that we will address, to a significant degree, some of
the difficulty we have with learning languages in our
country.</div>
<a name="10012672000335"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012672000562"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> The right hon. Member for Don Valley, who always
makes thoughtful contributions is, in this case, entirely wrong. What
has been shown is that learning a foreign language can often increase
language skills and confidence in one&#146;s own language. The idea
that languages are alien to such children is wrong.</div>
<a name="10012672000336"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would like
to put it to the Minister that, when looking back at the history of
this Government, we have had a collapse of a third in children doing
GCSE. It is particularly pronounced among children from vulnerable
backgrounds, who most need it. If the Minister cannot come forward with
a credible plan, my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and
Littlehampton doubtless will. I am sure that my hon. Friend will
convince me, when there is a Conservative Government, how an
alternative approach can lead to the language 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column190" />Column number: 190</div>flowering that we all desire. However, right now, I would like the
Minister at least to acknowledge that what we warned against in 2004 is
precisely what has happened. There has been a collapse in language
learning across the state sector, particularly in the poorest
neighbourhoods. It is a disaster.</div>
<a name="10012672000337"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012672000563"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> Actually, if we look at the figures, from memory,
there may have been a decline in GCSE up to the age of 16, but there
has been an increase in the post-16 take-up of languages.
<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> At least it is an increase. The
bigger issue is the one about primary schools.</div>
<a name="10012672000338"></a><div class="hs_Para">Just to show
