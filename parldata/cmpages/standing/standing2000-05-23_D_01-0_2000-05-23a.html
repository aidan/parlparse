<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Home Office (Mr. Charles Clarke):</B> I beg to move,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>That during proceedings on the Criminal Justice (Mode of Trial) (No. 2) Bill, the Committee do meet on Tuesdays at half-past Ten o'clock and at half-past Four o'clock and on Thursdays at half-past Nine o'clock and half-past Two o'clock.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I welcome you, Mr. Maxton, and your colleague, Mr. Sayeed, to the Chair. I am confident that under your guidance the Committee will be able to make rapid progress with full and proper discussion of the issues.
<P>
The Bill is an important part of the Government's programme to modernise the criminal justice system so that it is fair to defendants but also fair to victims of crime. The ability to elect jury trial has been used by many defendants in criminal cases to bring about delay in cases that were more suitable for hearing in a magistrates court. The Bill will benefit victims and the criminal justice system generally by ensuring that cases are not delayed and that the time of the Crown courts is not wasted.
<P>
I am aware that some members of the Committee are concerned about the effects of the Bill on the principle of trial by jury. Those arguments were put fully on Second Reading and I am sure that they will be reflected in the Committee's debates. However, I ask members of the Committee to give the Bill proper consideration. We listened to the concerns voiced about the original Bill in another place, and made changes. We responded to the fears about the potential effects of the provisions relating to reputation and livelihood in the original Bill. Under this Bill, the courts will consider the circumstances of an offence, not the circumstances of the defendant.
<P>
We have also improved the safeguards for mode of trial. Magistrates will be required under the Bill to give reasons for their decisions. We also intend that appeals should be determined by a resident judge or his nominated deputy. That would ensure consistency and raise the standard of decision making in the courts.
<P>
Our aim is to modernise the criminal justice system. We believe that it must belong to the whole people, not be simply the property of lawyers. It is important to acknowledge that police, magistrates, victims and local communities will gain from the Bill—something that many have acknowledged as they have moved forward. Although there have been legal concerns, we are implementing the views of the Lord Chief Justice and the royal commission. Legal opinion is divided and I am aware that many legal organisations are concerned about what we have to say. However, we must not forget that our duty is to build a criminal justice system in which the whole community can have full confidence.
<P>
The sittings motion proposes that we meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays in the morning and afternoon. We are demonstrating our determination that the Committee will have a proper opportunity to examine the Bill fully and in detail. I hope that the motion finds favour with members of the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick Hawkins </B>(Surrey Heath): I echo the Minister of State's words of welcome to you, Mr. Maxton, and to your fellow chairman, Mr. Sayeed.
<P>
It is fair to say that the Minister is putting forward the Government's interpretation of what they propose to do. He said, fairly, that he is aware of the division of opinion in the legal profession and among other commentators on the Government's proposals. However, the hon. Gentleman glossed over the fact that there is a huge division of opinion on the Government Benches in both Houses. When we discuss the Bill and the divisions of opinion in greater detail, it will become clear that the Bill is controversial. Those divisions were extremely evident on Second Reading, when hardly a single speaker Labour Back Bencher had anything good to say about it and, of course, the Government's earlier attempt to change the procedure for trial by jury in their first Bill did not survive the other place. Nevertheless, I am sure that our Committee proceedings on these important issues will be conducted in a civilised way under your chairmanship, Mr. Maxton. I hope that we shall have high-quality debates and that we shall endeavour to ensure that the proposals are properly analysed, because the Bill has significant weaknesses. The Government are chipping away at the principles of trial by jury and eroding an important citizens' right. We shall ensure that the Committee properly scrutinises the proposals, which significantly undermine a fundamental principle of British justice.
<P>
As I have said, I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Maxton. We shall have some sensible debates under your chairmanship, and that of Mr. Sayeed. I do not oppose the sittings motion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes </B>(Southwark, North and Bermondsey): My hon. Friend the Member for Taunton (Jackie Ballard) and I are happy to be members of the Committee under your chairmanship, Mr. Maxton. Mischievously, I reflect that it may occasionally be helpful to have the benefit of Scottish experience when considering the Government's argument that Scotland does not have the same jury trial system as the rest of the United Kingdom, and that we may be able to move in that direction. My hon. Friends and I do not accept that argument, nor did the rest of the House when the Government put the proposal before Parliament. We shall expose the fallacy of the Government's argument when the time comes.
<P>
I have no problem with the proposed sittings motion, but I seek clarification of the position on the Thursday morning sittings. Will they end at 11.25 am in time for hon. Members to do their duty on the Floor of the House?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The Standing Orders state that the Committee must finish at 11.25 am.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> Thank you, Mr. Maxton. Thursday is the last day before the short, late spring recess and I understand that we shall sit in the morning but not in the afternoon, which would be sensible. That is of less personal interest to me than to other members of the Committee because my constituency is in London; it would be unreasonable to expect hon. Members who live further afield to stay on beyond the rising of the House. I hope that the Minister will confirm that the Committee will not sit on Thursday afternoon.
<P>
The Minister summarised the Government's case, which they put in the first Bill and on which they failed to persuade the other place; they also failed to persuade many of their colleagues on the No. 2 Bill.
<P>
It is proposed that the method for choosing members of Select Committees should be adopted for Standing Committees—that is, that they should be in the gift of the House and not of the parties. The differences of views within parties should be reflected in Committee. Committee selection does not entirely take into account the weight of opinion on the Floor of the House. The hon. Member for Surrey Heath (Mr. Hawkins), accurately reflected that there was not a chorus of Labour voices supporting the Government on Second Reading. Indeed, there were only two, who just happen to be on the Committee, on which there are few voices of opposition.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike Hall </B>(Weaver Vale): They did not volunteer to serve.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes: They did not volunteer.</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hall: They were asked, but they said no because they were working in the courts.</B><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman: Order. We should revert to having silent Whips.</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes: Inquiries can be pursued through the usual channels, or otherwise.</B><P>
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Taunton and I, and, I anticipate, the hon. Member for Surrey Heath, will not play games in the Committee by tabling amendments to clauses that are fundamentally flawed. The amendments tabled by the right hon. and learned Member for North-East Bedfordshire (Sir N. Lyell), are perfectly proper, but there will be a better forum for discussion on Report, which will engage more of those Members who have an interest in the matter. We shall debate the principles of the Bill and the details of each clause then. It is no secret that we will oppose the principal clauses, but we will not take up the Committee's time by amending them when we believe that the whole structure is fundamentally wrong. That debate can properly be pursued in the Chamber, but more importantly, we hope that the other place may reach a similar successful conclusion with this Bill to that which it achieved with the Criminal Justice (Mode of Trial) Bill.
<P>
The Minister enjoys making the point that on one side of the argument in Home Office matters are arrayed the forces of light and righteousness, and on the other side are the lawyers. Of course, some of us represent both sides. Although one should take into account the views of lawyers from the Lord Chief Justice down, they are not the be-all and end-all of the argument. The lawyers are clearly divided on the issue. The test of the measures should be based on not only the Government's plans on entering office and the interests of the individuals involved in the criminal justice process, but, most importantly, on the Government's confused argument that the measure will benefit the criminal justice system, because some gain will compensate for the loss of liberty. We do not accept that. A cost cannot be placed on slicing away people's liberties.
<P>
As I have said elsewhere, we did not think that it was proper not to debate the subject or examine evidence on it, but we debated the different arguments internally and reached the clear view that small potential savings and an alteration to the numbers convicted—which was unproven—could not significantly contribute to the criminal justice system or the detection and conviction of criminals. Our debate went against the consequential loss of choice and liberty brought about by the Bill. We will make the arguments against the Bill and we look forward to a healthy debate, but this will not be the last word.

<P>

<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell </B>(North-East Bedfordshire): I am happy to follow the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey (Mr. Hughes) and my hon. Friend the Member for Surrey Heath. I join in welcoming you, Mr. Maxton and Mr. Sayeed, to what I hope will be not an overlong but a carefully thought-through and constructive Committee.
<P>
The Bill is extraordinarily important. I have every respect for the Home Secretary and the many others who support it, but they are deeply mistaken. The Bill is a serious and profound attack on the liberties of ordinary people.
<P>
I doubt that the sittings motion will take us all morning. I do not intend to detain the Committee long, but as we are considering how long we should sit, it will be helpful for those listening to the debate or reading it if we highlight some key points on which we should focus.
<P>
The first and most fundamental issue is the liberty of the subject. The Bill places under attack the ancient freedom of the people of England and Wales. It is not just me saying that; history produces loud and clear warnings on that point. I wholly agree with what the Minister said earlier, and ask him to focus constantly on his words. He rightly said that justice in this country belongs to the whole people, not just the lawyers. That theme is central to my argument, to that which Lord Devlin put so eloquently in the famous book of his Hamlyn lectures on trial by jury, and to that made in the 1760s by one of the greatest legal commentators, Sir William Blackstone. It goes back to the Magna Carta in 1215, which is the foundation of many of our liberties.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I have taken the trouble to read a great deal around the Bill. It has frequently been said that the idea that the right to trial by jury is ancient is mistaken and that it actually developed from a compromise in 1855. Indeed, the Home Secretary says that today in The Times. The article is on page 3 in the law section, with an attractive photograph of the Home Secretary peeping around a door. He says that the right to trial by jury dates from a compromise reached in 1855. That is not correct. In 1855, the right to trial by jury—a right that no citizen could abrogate or deny—was modified to the extent that the citizen was, in cases of either-way offences, given the right to choose trial by jury.
<P>
Modern jury trial developed slowly out of the Magna Carta, and was beginning to develop well by the 14th century. It continued to develop, perhaps crucially, through the 16th and 17th centuries and into the 18th century at the time of Sir William Blackstone. Until 1855, trial by jury was for all serious crimes. Of course, crime has changed in modern times, but that would cover the vast majority of what are currently known as either-way offences. There was an absolute right to trial by jury. Indeed, a citizen had no choice: the only method of trial was trial by jury.
<P>
If the Minister thinks that I am wrong, he will correct me in due course. I am willing to learn, but I am pretty confident that I am right, because I have taken a lot of trouble to research the subject. Until 1855, there was an absolute right. All that changed then was that the citizen had a choice and an opportunity to say: ``No, I don't want this case to go to trial by jury and require a judge and an assize''—oyer and terminer as it was called—``I am happy for the magistrates to deal with this matter.''
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I am grateful to my right hon. and learned Friend for giving way, because what he is saying is extremely valuable and important. Like him, I have done a lot of reading around the subject. Would my right hon. and learned Friend agree that one of the further historical proofs that the Home Secretary's analysis of the history is mistaken is that Lord Erskine, who became Lord Chancellor in 1806, took trial by jury as his motto?
<P>
In addition, long before the mid-19th century compromise that the Home Secretary mentions, Lord Camden said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Trial by Jury is indeed the foundation of our free constitution; take that away, and the whole fabric will soon moulder into dust. These are the sentiments of my youth—inculcated by precept, improved by experience, and warranted by example.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Does not that reinforce my right hon. and learned Friend's point?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before the right hon. and learned Gentleman responds, it might be useful if I make it clear now that, throughout the Committee, I expect interventions to be brief. That intervention was not brief.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I am extremely grateful. May I make a confession? I am slightly deaf, which is why I was passing notes to my hon. Friend the Member for Surrey Heath asking him to speak up. I would very much like to hear everything that is said.
<P>
I agree with my hon. Friend. Erskine is one of the greatest lawyers in our history. He defended Thomas Paine and his words are weighted in gold.
<P>
The Minister said that justice belongs to the whole people and that we should regard the Bill in that context. The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey kindly referred to my few brief amendments, which I tabled largely as probing amendments. I am prepared to acknowledge that now. I hope that the Minister will argue, in relation to amendment No. 3, that the same rights to aid by solicitor and counsel will remain.
<P>
<B>Ms Hazel Blears </B>(Salford): If the right hon. and learned Gentleman believes, with respect to his amendment, that justice belongs to the whole—
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I shall stop this immediately. We are starting a debate that it is appropriate to conduct later. Members of the Committee have started debating an amendment, but we are presently debating the sittings motion.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I wish to remain in order, Mr. Maxton. However, the sittings motion deals with the amount of time that we need for proper debate. I have no wish to detain the Committee unduly, but it is important for the fundamental principles of the Bill, which are not well understood in the country, to be rehearsed in Committee.
<P>
The Minister rightly said that justice should belong to the whole people. As Lord Devlin says, every jury is a little parliament, and my second amendment focuses on the issue of—
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The right hon. and learned Gentleman is straying into debate on his amendments once again. I repeat that we will debate amendments only when the sittings motion has been dealt with. I should be grateful if he would concentrate on the sittings motion, not his amendments. He may talk in general terms about the Bill, but not about his amendments.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I follow your guidance, Mr. Maxton. I sought to refer to the amendments rather than debate them. I was trying to be helpful and focus the Committee on what is to come.
<P>
When the Minister affirmed that justice belongs to the whole people, he touched on the essence of trial by jury. Yet much of the debate so far has lost sight of that crucial point. The Home Secretary and the Government have seriously lost sight of it and few Government Members have spoken in support. When the right to choose trial by jury is removed, it removes not only the rights of citizens who stand accused—some of whom may be frequent offenders, but that should not deny them their rights—but the rights of the public at large, represented by a jury drawn at random, to set standards of justice in this country in all serious cases.
<P>
The Minister will know—he has seen the questions that I have raised since this Bill was first mooted last year—that it is difficult for people engaging in the debate to know how widespread either-way offences are. On the basis of reading the article the Home Secretary's article in The Times today, one would think that either-way offences were comparatively minor, but that is simply not true. Either-way offences—though they do not include murder and rape, which are indictable only—include extremely serious offences that are liable to long terms of imprisonment and are well suited to trial by jury only. Yet the right of citizens to judge those offences is being removed.
<P>
There is a real danger in incremental change in this area. The fact that criminal damage up to £2,000 can now be tried only in the magistrates courts is used as a foot-in-the-door argument. Under the Bill, that figure will rise to £5,000. Insidiously, magistrates will take back more and more cases under their control. They will be pressurised into doing so by the Government who will tell them that there is not enough money. The Government will organise the methods of defence so that that will happen. I do not want to quote at length, as I do not want to be called to order, but equally I want to get on the record perhaps the most important passage on the liberties of the subject that has been drawn together in the 20th century.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Leigh </B>(Gainsborough): Before my right hon. and learned Friend reads out that passage, would he reflect on the fact that a right that has existed for seven centuries, perhaps going back to Anglo Saxon times, will be dispatched by a Committee in the House of Commons sitting in a couple of weeks? Is that not a sign of our times?
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I fear that my hon. Friend may be right. It may be a sign of the times, but it is one that has been warned against many times over the last century. It was warned against by Lord Devlin himself. Lord Devlin described the jury as the lamp of freedom. I will not read it all but I am quoting from page 164 of his book on trial by jury. He opens as follows:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Each jury is a little parliament. The jury sense is the parliamentary sense. I cannot see the one dying and the other surviving. The first object of any tyrant in Whitehall would be to make Parliament utterly subservient to his will; the next to overthrow or diminish trial by jury, for no tyrant could afford to leave a subject's freedom in the hands of twelve of his countrymen.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I pause there to emphasise those points. It is the right of 12 of our countrymen to set the standards of justice in this country that protect our liberty.
<P>
The hon. Member for Salford (Ms Blears) looks at me in uncomprehending amazement, her lips pursed as if I were some kind of crank. [Interruption.] She has just given a little look to confirm that. I have been reading from Lord Devlin. I do not know whether she has ever heard of him, but he was one of the most famous jurists of the 20th century. He was well known for standing up for freedom. One of my greatest pieces of pride is that he was the head of my chambers: his name was at the top of the list when mine was bottom as the most junior member. That is a piece of personal conceit by association on my part. His celebration as a jurist may be equalled, but it is not frequently surpassed.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I have been tolerant, but we are debating the sittings motion, and should not therefore have a Second Reading debate. Most chairmen allow a certain amount of laxity on the first day of a Committee to allow hon. Members to put some general points, but the right hon. and learned Gentleman is straying into a detailed speech. He will be able to make all his points in later stages of our consideration of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> Your guidance, Mr. Maxton, is extremely valuable as ever. I am sure that I will have an opportunity to make these points at a later stage in the Bill. On the other hand, and this is not to go against your guidance but to seek to illuminate the Committee, it is sometimes valuable to look ahead to what is going to be said to assist those who are assisting the Minister. Let me switch my tack for a moment and look ahead to one or two other areas.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
One of the reasons for the Bill, which the Minister mentioned this morning, is the delay in justice and the length of time that it takes to hear short trials. The Committee should tease out, albeit reasonably succinctly, the evidence that the Bar Council produced in February this year, which shows that the Crown courts can currently hear short trials almost twice as quickly as the magistrates courts. The Minister must explain how the magistrates courts can be adequately equipped to hear a significant number of short but none the less much more important trials than they have been accustomed to hearing.
<P>
The next point that the Minister made this morning, which is frequently made and was made by the Home Secretary in the same article, is that the Bill is part of the Government's programme for modernising justice and saving cost. The cost savings have been put at £120 million, but the Committee needs time to tease out how that sum is made up. It appears from parliamentary answers, although they are not sufficiently widely understood, that £83 million is the savings in prison costs as a result of shorter sentences. We must know from the Minister and the Home Secretary what sentences have been given for what types of offence. If the effect of the Bill is to cut sentences for a whole range of serious offences, including burglary and sexual offences, it is a matter of penal policy that is not the direct and stated object of the Bill and which must be properly looked into on its own merits. I hope that we shall have an opportunity to tease out the underlying facts from the Minister.
<P>
I tabled a detailed question yesterday to test the cost savings, pursuant to the answer that was given to my right hon. Friend the Member for Maidstone and The Weald (Miss Widdecombe), explaining how the £120 million was made up. The answer was helpful as far as it went, but anyone reading it would instantly recognise that it cries out for further detail. I look forward to the reply. I have asked for it by Thursday. I assume that the Home Office has the answers because my question asks about the assumptions that were made in building up that £120 million. It must know what they were or it could not have built up that sum in the first place. In 1999, I asked a series of questions about how cost savings were made up, virtually none of which received any practical answer. The answer tabled by the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey elicited the answer that the Home Office did not know and was still working it out.
<P>
I have given notice about the equality of arms point, and the fact that those who are tried before a magistrate should be as well defended and have the same degree of disclosure as those who are tried before a jury. The other point that we need to know about is change of plea. A heavy part of the Government's argument is that defendants are abusing the system. They plead not guilty before the magistrates court to waste time, frighten off witnesses and cause cases to collapse through delay. They subsequently change their plea. We need to know the factual basis for these answers. I am grateful for your guidance, Mr. Maxton. I shall not say too much more on these aspects although they are serious points.
<P>
I conclude by referring to Sir William Blackstone, who was an immensely respected legal commentator. Looking back over this country's legal history in his ``Commentaries''—I quote from page 165 of Lord Devlin's book—he wrote:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>So that the liberties of England cannot but subsist so long as this palladium—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
the ``palladium'' is the right to trial by jury—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>remains sacred and inviolate; not only from all open attacks (which none will be so hardy as to make), but also from all secret machinations, which may sap and undermine it;<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is the danger of a Bill such as this, although I do not believe that either the Home Secretary or the Minister of State wish to attack full frontally but they should take guidance from the wisdom of the past. The passage continues: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>by introducing new and arbitrary methods of trial; by justices of the peace, commissioners of the revenue, and courts of conscience. And however convenient these may appear at first (as doubtless all arbitrary powers, well executed, are the most convenient), yet let it be remembered, that delays and little inconveniences in the forms of justice, are the price that all free nations must pay for their liberty in more substantial matters<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Those are important words. This is an important Committee. I am sure that we shall receive tolerance, care and respect as we try to tease out these points, which are essential to the liberties of the people of this country, when seeking to do what the Minister says we ought to do—ensure that our justice system belongs to the whole people.
<P>
<B>Ms Bridget Prentice </B>(Lewisham, East): On behalf of the volunteers in the Committee, I welcome you again, Mr. Maxton. We seem to be making an enjoyable habit of this. We volunteers look forward to sparring with the Opposition on many issues. I felt obliged to bring in the Scottish dimension as early as possible because the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey mentioned it. I look forward to enlightening him on some of the merits of the Scottish judicial system.
<P>
There are more lawyers on the Opposition Benches than on the Government Benches. This makes me wonder, cynic that I am, whether it is another case of their looking after their own interests rather than having a wider perspective. But perhaps that will be revealed. It is fascinating to hear Conservative Members reminding us of people such as Tom Paine. This is an unusual trait that they have developed in opposition. We look forward to debating some of those issues with them. I shall take particular pleasure in debating the history of the jury in the coming few weeks.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Minister outlined all aspects of modernisation of the justice system, including trial by jury. The right hon. and learned Member for North-East Bedfordshire (Sir N. Lyell), who spoke about the history of the jury, will remember its origins. It is bizarre that the jury's role was not to defend the rights of the defendants—in fact, it was quite the opposite. It will be interesting and useful to have lessons in mediaeval and early modern history.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> As the hon. Lady looks back over history, does she have time to explain why, if modernisation of the jury trial system is so important, the Labour party opposed it at the last general election?
<P>
<B>Ms Prentice:</B> The hon. Gentleman should be aware that the issues need to be viewed in the round and several changes have occurred. We shall return later to what my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary said in previous debates. He at least has the honesty and confidence to say that, after examining the issues in detail, he is capable of changing his mind. He should be congratulated on that. There is a view that the Home Secretary sometimes allows his liberal tendencies to show too clearly, so I put that on the record and we shall see whether it happens again.
<P>
<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> This has been an entertaining and exhilarating run around the sittings motion. I shall respond briefly to the various points that were raised.
<P>
The hon. Member for Surrey Heath referred to divisions on our side in both Houses. It is not out of order to point out that there are divisions among Conservative Members and, if the Conservatives had been elected at the previous general election, they would almost certainly have implemented a similar measure.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> If the Minister believes that we would have implemented the Bill if we had won the previous election, he is gravely mistaken. I was in a central position in the previous Government and I am confident that that would not have happened. The Minister should also remember that even my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Folkestone and Hythe (Mr. Howard) does not support the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> I am aware of that. My point was that there was, and perhaps still is, a viewpoint on the Conservative Benches that the Bill is a good one. My helpful, rather than politically partisan point, was—
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Luff </B>(Mid-Worcestershire): It is simply wrong.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> I am always guided by the Opposition Whip. There have been divisions of opinion throughout the House, which is why it is so important to have a full debate. In response to the hon. Member for Surrey Heath, we should discuss the issues openly and seek to avoid adopting narrowly political partisan lines. We must examine the merits and demerits of the case.
<P>
I shall now respond to the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey. You, Mr. Maxton, clarified one important procedural point that he raised. To clarify a further point, we intend to meet this week only in the morning on Thursday. I was pleased to hear that the hon. Gentleman does not intend to table amendments and prefers to debate the clauses, which is a positive and helpful way of proceeding. I was also pleased when the right hon. and learned Member for North-East Bedfordshire made it clear that his amendments were intended as probing amendments.
<P>
It was striking to hear the Liberal Democrats relying, as the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey made clear, on an unelected Chamber. I had thought that his party was traditionally committed to elective politics. I do not accept the presumption of his final remarks—that the Bill entails a loss of liberty and that trade-off is involved. It is, of course, a legitimate issue to debate, but I do not accept that our proposals will undermine liberty.
<P>
I shall return to the matters raised by the right hon. and learned Member for North-East Bedfordshire at the appropriate point in the Bill. I place on record, for the avoidance of doubt, that all photographs of the Home Secretary are, by definition, attractive. There is no dispute about that.
<P>
The freedom of the subject will be a central part of our debate. The freedom to live a life undisturbed by crime is an important part of that freedom, but freedoms must be balanced, and that is a matter for the House to consider.

<P>
I am looking forward to our discussions about history, although I will not pursue the matter now. We shall no doubt discuss later what happened—and when—in the evolution of such an important institution. I do not agree with the right hon. and learned Member for North-East Bedfordshire that the jury is simply the expression of the people. ``The people'' have a variety of different interests in the criminal justice system; the jury is one aspect of it, but not the only one.
<P>
The right hon. and learned Gentleman's argument about incremental change could end up as the ultimate conservative argument that no change can ever be justified because of the danger of any particular small change. My view on the modernisation issue is that we must look properly at change and its implication. I acknowledge that some of the right hon. and learned Gentleman's questions inform that debate, but I do not agree with him that any change is dangerous.
<P>
The right hon. and learned Gentleman was uncharacteristically rude about some of my hon. Friends in his assertion of knowledge, or otherwise, of Lord Devlin. In 1972, I appeared as an advocate before Lord Devlin because on the first day of the hearing I got so fed up with the lawyer representing my case that I sacked him and represented myself. Appearing for the other side was a young lawyer, now Lord Alexander of Weedon. Lord Devlin, in a kind remark at the end of the hearing, said that lawyers did not always make the best arguments in those circumstances. I did what I did in that case because I thought that junior lawyers deferred too much to Lord Devlin because of his authority and status and simply would not take him on because his name was up in lights, which was not right. We should consider his remarks correctly and historically, as the right hon. and learned Gentleman has done, but see how they inform the modern debate, rather than simply taking them as sacred text, which should remain unchanged through time.
<P>
The right hon. and learned Gentleman's points about cost are legitimate and we shall discuss them later; we shall also discuss his argument about equality of arms in the debates on his amendments. The right hon. and learned Gentleman is a distinguished public servant and he is entitled to advance his legitimate arguments, which the Committee will discuss. However, he is fundamentally opposed to the Bill, as is the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Lewisham, East (Ms Prentice) drew attention to a matter that is not sufficiently understood: that members of my party are committed to the measure, not because of party loyalty, like sheep going into a pen, but because their experience of the criminal justice system means that they think that the criminal justice system should serve the people not the lawyers' debate. Of course, there is room for argument about the merits of the case, but any suggestion from the Opposition that my hon. Friends are not fully committed to the reform is insulting and wrong. I hope that such remarks will not be a characteristic of our debates.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> I hope that the Minister will elaborate later. At what stage after the general election did the widespread consultation of his party's members take place that resulted in the sudden conversion of almost everyone to the Home Secretary's view?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> Unlike the Liberal Democrats, everyone in our party has a view and expresses that view. There is a wide variety of opinion on all our policies, and rightly so. I know that the Liberal Democrats have one view and one leader—or so it is purported—but the fact is that Labour Members strongly support the Bill. I am confident that it will be passed.
<P>
I hope that the Committee will support the sittings motion.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
