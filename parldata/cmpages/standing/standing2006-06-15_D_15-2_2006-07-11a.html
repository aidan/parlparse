<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071249000409"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> This is a complicated clause, in what is clearly
the controversial part of the Bill. It replaces the existing no
conflict common law rule and covers all conflicts between the interests
of the director and the company. A significant change in subsection (4)
is that independent directors can authorise another director&#146;s
conflict. In the case of a public company, such authorisation must be
allowed by the company&#146;s constitution. In the case of a private
company, authorisation can be given by the directors so long as nothing
in the company&#146;s articles invalidates such authorisation. By
virtue of clause 156(2)(a), this duty is extended to former directors
in relation to</div> <a name="06071249000050"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
exploitation of...property, information or opportunity of which he
became aware at a time when he was a director&#148;.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column607" />Column number: 608</div><a name="06071249000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Law
Society, among others, has pointed out that there is a significant
difference between the common law rule on conflicts of interest and the
wording of clause 161. Notably, the common law rule maintains a
negative position, whereas the clause imposes a positive duty. That is
a key concern that has been raised by many stakeholders. There is a
fear that this positive duty might impact on the ability of a director
to assume multiple directorships, which is a feature of the UK company
system and provides a number of benefits to companies of all sizes. I
should like to quote from a briefing that we have received from the
City law firm, Allen and Overy. It
states:</div><a name="06071249000351"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;At
present, a director may comply with the duty to avoid conflicts of
interest by taking appropriate action to ensure that a company is not
disadvantaged by any conflict of interest the director may have i.e. by
not taking part in a particular matter. Based on the current
formulation, which is widely expressed to avoid a situation where there
is, or may be, a potential conflict, there is arguably no place for
multiple
directorships.&#148;</div><a name="06071249000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
believe that it will be more difficult for directors to hold multiple
directorships, and that could affect the pool of non-executive
directors, which is itself a current problem. This is of particular
concern to the private equity and venture capital industries, where
executives of private equity firms routinely hold multiple
non-executive directorships. The British Venture Capital Association
made the point clear in a letter of 12 January to Lord Sainsbury of
Turville. It stated that the clause</div>
<a name="06071249000053"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;may result in individuals
refusing to hold multiple directorships. If this happens, it will
affect the private equity industry&#146;s ability to attract
non-executive directors who can sit, or may want to sit, on multiple
boards.&#148;</div><a name="06071249000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">It continues by
saying that is it important that the clause</div>
<a name="06071249000055"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;is amended to avoid any
uncertainty in relation to this issue.</div>
<a name="06071249000056"></a><div class="hs_brev">It is standard practice within
the UK private equity industry for a private equity fund to have the
right to appoint one or more non-executive directors
(&#145;NEDs&#146;) to each company that the fund is providing
investment to. Invariably, the private equity firm that has organised
the company&#146;s investment by the private equity fund will select
the NEDs and these will either be executives of the private equity
house or independent experts who may have industry-specific knowledge.
The effect of this kind of industry arrangement is that often these
executives or independent experts will hold non-executive directorships
in a number of companies associated with the private equity firm and
the funds of which the private equity firm
manages.&#148;</div><a name="06071249000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
letter then says that the clause</div>
<a name="06071249000058"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;places an absolute obligation on
a director of a company to avoid a situation in which the director has,
or can have, a direct or indirect interest that conflicts, or possibly
may conflict, with the interests of the company. In practice, taking on
any additional directorship is likely to give rise to difficulty under
this provision as almost any additional directorship &#145;possibly
may&#146; conflict. Although this duty will not be infringed if the
situation cannot &#145;reasonably be regarded as likely&#146; to
give rise to a conflict of interest...it will not always be easy
for a director to be able to rely confidently on this safe harbour when
accepting an additional
directorship.&#148;</div><a name="06071249000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
letter goes on to state that the other safe harbour provided in
subsection (4)(b)</div><a name="06071249000060"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;which
allows the other directors to authorise the &#145;matter&#146;,
would appear to require specific permission to be given to each
additional directorship at the time it is taken on. This would, in
effect, amount to a need for an NED to seek permission each and every
time he wants to accept an additional NED post, which is not
practicable. It needs to be clear at the outset that the NED can take
on other directorships, subject only to having to disclose
them.&#148;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column608" />Column number: 609</div><a name="06071249000373"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.45
pm</div><a name="06071249000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">The letter
continues:</div><a name="06071249000352"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;If
a person holds more than one non-executive directorship and a conflict
arises but the person cannot explain the reason for the conflict (e.g.
because the information giving rise to is confidential or price
sensitive), it seems that the director&#146;s only option will be to
resign rather than to absent himself of herself from decision making as
would be the case at
present.&#148;</div><a name="06071249000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
letter urges that the clause should be amended</div>
<a name="06071249000353"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to provide a mechanism for a
person to be able to take on multiple directorships and for a person
who holds multiple directorships to be able to deal with conflicts in
the same way as they can
now.&#148;</div><a name="06071249000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">It goes on to say
that it</div>
<a name="06071249000354"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;should state that a
director of a company (the &#145;first&#146; company) should be
able to accept an additional directorship with another company (the
&#145;second&#146; company) if at that time of his or her
appointment as a director of the second company, there is no actual
conflict with the interests of the first company. If a conflict arises
after the director has been appointed as a director of the second
company, the director should be able to absent himself or herself from
decision making or obtain authorisation from the directors of the
relevant companies as envisaged
by&#148;</div><a name="06071249000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">subsection
(4)(b).</div><a name="06071249000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those concerns
should not be taken lightly. Private equity and venture capital are
growing industries in the UK, and more and more of our successful
companies are being financed by private equity. The industry has been a
valuable driver of business growth. We should not put barriers in the
way of those who want to invest in UK companies, particularly the small
start-ups that are often the target of venture capital
investment.</div> <a name="06071249000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those who
practise law in this area have also raised concerns with us. As a City
lawyer said to me, the key issue is that, currently, a director in the
conflict position can manage the problem by removing himself from the
company&#146;s decision-making process when a conflict arises. The
draft new law seems to go much further, imposing a duty to avoid the
possibility ofa conflict in the first place. If that is not
the Government&#146;s intention, an explanation should be provided as
to how directors of more than one company can manage a situation in
which duties to those companies will conflict. As the Government have
not been forthcoming with an explanation, we tabled the amendments to
rectify the problem. Amendment No. 167 would meet the concerns by
stating that if there is no disadvantage to the interests of the
company, a director may hold multiple directorships.</div>
<a name="06071249000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 257 would allow
directors to exercise their subjective judgment as to whether a
situation is likely to give rise to a conflict. We should show UK
company directors that we have faith in their judgment, but the
Government seem not to be doing that with this clause.</div>
<a name="06071249000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 255 was drafted
for us by the Law Society. A similar amendment was rejected by Lord
Goldsmith in the other place, and both the Conservative party and the
Law Society sincerely hope that the Government will reconsider their
position. The Law Society is clear on this point. In its June 2006
Commons briefing, it
states:</div><a name="06071249000355"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;As a
matter of principle, we do not think that a director should be at risk
of being in breach of duty in a case where he may be unable to prevent
the breach arising, because the breach arises as a result of an action
by a company of which he is a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column609" />Column number: 610</div>director, rather than because of an action that he has taken
himself...We are very concerned that the effect of Clause 161 will
be to make it almost impossible for a director of more than one company
to manage conflicts which may arise between the interests of the
companies of which he is a director. At present, it is normal for a
director who finds himself in such a position to manage the conflict by
absenting himself from meetings at which the matter giving rise to the
conflict is discussed. Only in the most extreme cases would a director
be expected to resign. It is by no means clear that such an approach
will be possible in future. As a result, it is likely not only that
directors will be required to resign from multiple boards more
frequently, but also that individuals will be very reluctant to put
themselves forward to take up non-executive
posts.&#148;</div><a name="06071249000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
tabled amendment No. 322 to make the clause slightly less onerous. The
clause could be used against directors&#146; future conflicts of
interests, or in relation to conflicts of which they were not aware.
The amendment would limit the scope of the clause to the period when
the director seeks authorisation. Similarly, we have tabled amendment
No. 323 to remove wording that could be used to threaten directors with
possible future conflicts of interest. That would be an onerous
requirement for a director to take account of and is not commercially
realistic.</div> <a name="06071249000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 256 has been tabled to allow directors to take all reasonable steps
to avoid a conflict of interest. That is a fair allowance for directors
who will be running a day-to-day business and should not be unfairly
pressured to research every possible conflict of interest that might
arise. In his response to amendments to clause 161 in the Lords Grand
Committee, Lord Goldsmith said that a director who obtains his
board&#146;s consent to another appointment will be entitled to
assume that that consent &#147;franks&#148; any subsequent conflict
that arises in practice. In our view, and that of most experts, it is
far from clear that that will be the case. If that is what the
Government believe, however, we would like them to clarify it
inthe Bill.</div>
<a name="06071249000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause refers throughout to
authorisation of &#147;the matter&#148; by the board. It is hard to
imagine that, when a specific conflict has arisen between two
directorships, a court will take &#147;the matter&#148; to mean the
director&#146;s original appointment to the directorship giving rise
to the conflict, rather than the circumstances of the conflict. If our
concerns are correct, it is unlikely that board approval would be a
realistic option in many cases, given the confidentiality obligations
to which the director is likely to be subject. In real life, the
director will owe duties of confidentiality to each company of which he
is a director. In such a case, we fear that the only course open to him
in practice will be to resign.</div>
<a name="06071249000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">The change may have a
significant effect on the availability of suitable non-executive
directors for company boards. The introduction of words that
specifically provide for general consent will go some way towards
alleviating that difficulty. The Minister has heard arguments from
legal practitioners with many years&#146; experience, the Law Society
and the venture capital industry. Lord Goldsmith said that he thought
he was steering the right course between placing burdens and
restrictions on enterprise and looking after the interests of
shareholders, but we suggest that he has veered too far in the
direction of restrictions. A great number of highly successful
businesses will be affected by the provision, and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column610" />Column number: 611</div>because of it, many smaller businesses may not receive the funding and
expertise that they so greatly need.</div>
<a name="06071249000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government fail to
appreciate, first, that companies often want non-executive directors
who are successful in another company in the same sector to enjoy the
benefit of their experience, and secondly that such directors will have
much to learn and benefit from by seeing other companies in action. The
clause could threaten that.</div>
<a name="06071249000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">The United Kingdom Shareholders
Association and others have objected to subsection (4)(b), which allows
directors to authorise the conflict of interest situation without even
informing shareholders. The UKSA recommends that such authorisation
should at least appear in the company&#146;s next annual report.
Under the provision, directors can still authorise the conflict of
interest situation without informing shareholders, if the company
constitution allows. Any conflict should be reported in the
company&#146;s annual report in the case of public companies, but the
requirement might be a burden for smaller private companies.</div>
<a name="06071249000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">Norton Rose in its report also
had something to say on the
matter:</div><a name="06071249000356"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
new clause permits a company&#146;s rights to be waived by the prior
consent of the board, provided in the case of a public company, that
such board approval is permitted by its constitution. The company can
nevertheless provide in its articles of association that shareholder
approval is required. In practice, smaller private companies are likely
to welcome the ability to sanction a transaction involving a possible
conflict by board
resolution.&#148;</div><a name="06071249000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will the
Government please explain why, if they are committed to encouraging
people to become non-executive directors, they do not support our
position on that
issue?</div><a name="06071249000077"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071249000410"></a>Mr.
Davies:</b> My hon. Friend has raised an important point, and
I hope that the Government will satisfy him that the clause will not
prevent people from holding multiple directorships. It would deal the
most devastating blow to the way in which business is run, make an
exception of this country in the western world, and be a great handicap
to business. It would make matters impossible if the results that my
hon. Friend foresees were ever to come about. I am sure that the
Government recognise that.</div>
<a name="06071249000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is a benefit if one sits on
more than one board, because one takes different perspectives. One sees
different sectors of activity and has many of the same classic business
problems in different circumstances. One can be much more useful as a
director if one has those different perspectives, rather than the
limited experience and vision from one company in one sector. It is
none the less important to avoid conflicts of interest in life in any
role in which one has a fiduciary responsibility, and the role under
discussion has an important fiduciary responsibility.</div>
<a name="06071249000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">When I read the clause, I
thought that it was severely drafted. Amendment No. 257 would go quite
a way to making it look more reasonable. I took some comfort when I
first read the draft that subsection (4)(b), taken with subsection (5),
would provide the obvious solution: if a member of a board wants to
join another board, he must not only declare the interest but clear
that new membership with both boards. That is a practice that all of us
who have been in business have 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column611" />Column number: 612</div>automatically adopted in such circumstances for years. I cannot imagine
anyone wanting to do anything else.</div>
<a name="06071249000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">I cannot quite
remember&#151;the hon. Member for Cambridge may remind
me&#151;whether the situation is the same in this country as it is in
France, where I also sit on a board. In France it is an absolute
requirement that any other directorships held by a director must be
declared in the annual report and accounts. That seems a very sensible
provision, which we should adopt if we do not already have it here
formally as part of law. It is certainly good practice. There should be
a declaration of interests. There may be circumstances in which, having
declared an interest that may be in conflict, one wants to remind
one&#146;s board colleagues about it. Even if the interest has been
declared at the outset and one has their consent to hold both
directorships, there may be circumstances in which people might feel
that they do not want to take part in a discussion on a particular
matter because there could be a conflict. That arises in many other
fields than just business. It could arise in many contexts in politics,
in government, in managing a charity and any other field where one has
fiduciary
responsibilities.</div><a name="06071249000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
hon. Friend has raised an important issue. It would be extraordinarily
perverse and I simply cannot believe that the Government would allow a
situation to arise in which it was not possible to be a director of
different companies at the same time. I do not think that one should be
a director of 55 different companies, and I cannot conceive of a
scenario in which one can do a proper job on behalf of shareholders of
so many companies, even if there is a very small number of shareholders
or they are wholly owned subsidiaries.</div>
<a name="06071249000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not see the need to
provide for blanket authorisations for people to be members of any
number of boards without getting consent in each case. It is absolutely
elementary that if someone is going to have two different fiduciary
responsibilities, they should declare to both groups of people on
behalf of whom they exercise those responsibilities that they have the
other responsibility too, and to seek authorisation on every occasion.
I do not think that that will be very onerous. I do not think that
anyone can do a serious job in business if they have such a large
number of directorships that it becomes a real problem to seek
authorisation each time they take up a new one. I am not entirely
persuaded by my hon. Friend on that point, but the main thrust of what
he said is extremely important, and I hope that the Government will be
able to come up with some satisfying and convincing answers to
it.</div><a name="06071249000083"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071249000411"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> There is no problem with people holding
multiple directorships. I can see that there may be quite substantial
benefits in that from time to time, depending on the circumstances. It
certainly is the case in venture capitalism and the way in which
private equitable capital is developing that a number of people hold
quite a few multiple directorships. All that is required is the
exercise of a reasonable amount of diligence and care, getting the
proper authorisation and letting people know what is going on. There
are clear duties here. I do not think that anyone disagrees with those
duties. It is necessary, however, for people to be properly informed
about what the interests of directors are. They should have an 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column612" />Column number: 613</div>obligation to avoid conflicts of interest unless those conflicts are
clearly in compliance with the law and they have gone through the
appropriate procedures in order to get them
authorised.</div><a name="06071249000084"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071249000412"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> If what the Solicitor-General says is the
case&#151;I tend to agree with him&#151;does he agree that we need
to delete the words &#147;or possibly may conflict&#148; in the
second line of subsection (1), because the director will not know when
he becomes a director what may conflict in the
future?</div> <a name="06071249000374"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6

obligation on a director to be diligent and take account of the
circumstances that he faces. The possibility of his interests
conflicting with those of the company ought to be reflected in statute.
The phrase &#147;or possibly may conflict&#148; reflects the way in
which the courts have expressed the principle. It is current law, not
something

The clause reflects current law and is derived from the expression of

fiduciary</div><a name="06071249000357"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;shall be

conflicts, as well as actual conflicts, may put at risk or appear to

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071249000417"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> Several Members wish to intervene, but
it will be better if I set out my argument and then take some
interventions to deal with the points that have arisen. I might be able
to deal with some of them as I
progress.</div><a name="06071249000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was asked
about people absenting themselves from a meeting. People will not be
able to do that as of right. They cannot just walk out of a meeting
without declaring that they have interests. If they have been
authorised, in advance or at the time, to have a particular interest,
there should be no difficulty with them merely absenting themselves
from a particular directors&#146; meeting. In the vast majority of
cases, an appointment will be made on the basis that a director will be
able to withdraw. He will have declared his interest and should
therefore be able to do that.</div>
<a name="06071249000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have no problem with
non-executive directors holding company directorships or with multiple
directorships. The clause broadly reflects the current 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column613" />Column number: 614</div>situation, and subsection (1) in particular follows what is regarded as
the classic statement of the current duty by Lord Chancellor Cranworth.
He was followed by Lord Upjohn, who said in the House of Lords in the
case of Phipps <i class="I">v.
</i>Boardman:</div><a name="06071249000359"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
whole of the law is laid down in the fundamental principle exemplified
in Lord Cranworth&#146;s
statement.&#148;</div><a name="06071249000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">The statement
from Lord Cranworth was thereby backed up in the House of Lords. As
Jonathan Parker pointed out in the 2003 Court of Appeal case of Bhullar
<i class="I">v. </i>Bhullar,</div><a name="06071249000360"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
rule is essentially a simple one, albeit that it may in some cases be
difficult to apply. The only qualification which is required to Lord
Cranworth&#146;s formulation of it is that which was supplied by Lord
Upjohn in Phipps <i class="I">v. </i>Boardman, where he said
this:</div><a name="06071249000361"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#145;The
phrase &#145;possibly may conflict&#145; requires consideration. In
my view it means that the reasonable man looking at the relevant facts
and circumstances of the particular case would think that there was a
real sensible possibility of
conflict&#146;.&#148;</div><a name="06071249000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
therefore have clear guidance, and as Lord Upjohn also pointed out in
Phipps <i class="I">v.
</i>Boardman:</div><a name="06071249000362"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Rules
of equity have to be applied to such a great diversity of circumstances
that they can be stated only in the most general terms and applied with
particular attention to the exact circumstances of each
case.&#148;</div><a name="06071249000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">Flexibility
of application is the essence of the rule, which is why subsection (1)
is expressed in general terms. It will be for the courts, as it is now,
to determine its detailed application. It seems to me that the general
aim behind the Conservative amendments is to water down the duty
currently owed by directors. The Conservatives seem to want directors
to be free to have conflicts of interest, provided that they have
declared them generally. Such a watering down of the law could expose
members of companies to unscrupulous directors all too easily. We want
directors to be scrupulous and careful and show due diligence, but we
also want to ensure that, providing they act in the way that I have
described, they can have multiple
directorships.</div><a name="06071249000097"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071249000418"></a>Mr.
Davies:</b> The Pepper <i class="I">v. </i>Hart rule that I have
referred to already provides Ministers with the chance to clarify some
of those problems in the course of the debate and will give their
explanations a particular importance.</div>
<a name="06071249000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">In that spirit, I put to the
Solicitor-General a question: clearly, there are many obvious
situations in which there is a conflict&#151;a director of Shell
cannot be a director of BP, and a director of Tesco cannot be a
director of Sainsbury. Nobody can predict the future kaleidoscope of
business transactions and relationships. Strictly speaking, the words
&#147;possibly may conflict&#148; might make it an offence under
the law to take up a directorship that leads to conflict, competition
or a dispute between two company directorships. A person would then
have committed an offence even though they could not reasonably have
predicted that such a conflict would arise. Will the Solicitor-General
give a clear assurance that a person could not be convicted in such
circumstances?</div><a name="06071249000099"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071249000419"></a>The

<a name="06071249000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">So the circumstances of each case have to
be considered. Directors can put themselves quite easily in a position

Solicitor-General:</b> The hon. Gentleman must let me answer
his question before he tries to intervene again. If he does not like
the answer, I shall give way again. We had a long debate on the last
issue, and I am trying to make some progress now so he should allow me
to set out the argument&#151;it might help
him.</div><a name="06071249000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause

conflict of
interest&#148;.</div><a name="06071249000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">For as long as
that remains true, the director will not be in breach of the duty, even
if it turns out that the situation did give rise to a conflict, or was
likely to do so. If the director knows that there is a conflict, it is
a different matter and he will have to do something about it. However,
the director will not be in breach if, as set out in subsection (4)(a),
it could not be reasonably regarded as being likely to give rise to the
conflict.</div><a name="06071249000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">If a person
cannot possibly foresee a situation, it cannot be reasonably regarded
as being likely to give rise to a conflict of interest. On the other
hand, if they can foresee it, the director or members of the company
should be able to make an informed decision about whether it is an
acceptable conflict of interest or whether the matter should be dealt
with in accordance with applicable provisions under the
company&#146;s
constitution.</div><a name="06071249000106"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071249000422"></a>Mr.

response was of no help at all. It is no use quoting the jurisprudence
that is anterior to the potential passage of the Bill. When the Bill
becomes an Act, it mightwell be deemed by a court to have set
the previous jurisprudence aside. The second part of his explanation
was, however, extremely helpful, and I am grateful for that. I think
that it has gone a long way to solving the
problem.</div><a name="06071249000107"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071249000423"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> The provision will not be lacking in

Gentleman described it. I quoted Lord Upjohn, because it was
relevant.</div><a name="06071249000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 256 would allow directors to be in unauthorised conflict regardless
of the company&#146;s wishes as long as the director has taken
&#147;reasonable steps to&#148; avoid it. That would be the impact
of the Conservative proposal. Under the current law, there should never
be an unauthorised or potential conflict. That principle exists for the
protection of the company and its members.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column615" />Column number: 616</div><a name="06071249000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">An amendment to that strict
rule, so that a director is not in breach so long as he takes all
reasonable steps to avoid it, would be a change to the current law. I
emphasise that the Conservatives are proposing a change to the current
law, to water it down and to put company members and the operation of
UK company law at risk. That is what they are proposing. It would
significantly weaken the duty and the protection currently given to
companies and ultimately to their shareholders. Unless the matter is
authorised or dealt with in accordance with a company&#146;s
constitution, companies are entitled to expect from their directors an
element of loyalty. The ability of a company to rely on this should not
be made dependent on the exercise of reasonable care about whether the
director has avoided a
conflict.</div><a name="06071249000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 323 seeks to delete the words &#147;possibly may

this principle and deleting them would depart from the current law.
Potential conflicts, as well as actual conflicts, may put at risk or
appear to put at risk the loyalty that the company can expect from its
directors. The company should not have to wait until there is a
conflict. This provision has to be read in conjunction with subsection
(4).</div><a name="06071249000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">As for amendment
No. 322, the clause already recognises that unexpected circumstances
can arise. Not all conflicts or potential conflicts are foreseeable. I
have already set out why I believe that the director has an obligation
to make it clear to his company what those potential conflicts are and
to go through the authorised procedure. If he cannot foresee a
situation, it cannot reasonably be regarded as being likely to give
rise to a conflict of interest. If a person can foresee a situation,
the directors or members of the company should be informed about that
and can then act accordingly. That is the situation and we want it to
continue.</div>

one of the issues that I want to deal
with?</div><a name="06071249000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
322 fails to take into accountthe ongoing nature of the duty.
It would allow unauthorised conflicts to occur as long as they are not
identifiable at the time that authorisation was given. This would be an
unacceptable change in the law. It would leave companies to bear the
risk of whatever unforeseen circumstances might arise, whether or not
the company regards them as acceptable. That is the very opposite of
the current position where all conflicts, whether they are originally
identifiable or not, are unacceptable unless authorised in some way by
the company, be that through its directors, its members or its
constitution.</div><a name="06071249000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">I turn
now to amendment No. 257. The March 2005 White Paper version of this
clause contained an exemption in which there was no real possibility of
a conflict of interest. That was based on the way in which this duty
has been formulated by the courts in Phipps <i class="I">v. </i>Boardman.
However, in the light of the consultation 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column616" />Column number: 617</div>responses, this was replaced with an exception where the situation
cannot reasonably be regarded as likely to give rise to a conflict of
interest. This already makes a situation easier from the point of view
of the director.</div>
<a name="06071249000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 257 would go
still further and would weaken the protection that this duty provides
for companies and ultimately for their shareholders. It would replace
the current objective test with a partial subjective test. That would
be a significant departure from the current law, watering down the
protection that members have. It would make it much harder for the
company to enforce the law. The company would be able to enforce the
law in regard to the director only if it could show that the
director&#146;s belief was unreasonable or that he was not acting in
good faith. Again, the Conservatives are trying to water down the
current law. They are exposing members to problems. I do not think that
they want that. The problem is that they have not thought this
through.</div> <a name="06071249000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall deal
now with amendment No. 255. The clause provides a new statutory
mechanism for the authorisation of conflicts of interest by those
directors who are not interested in the matter. Subsection (5) requires
the matter to be proposed to directors and authorised by them. The
directors should be able to give informed consent to their fellow
director if he is in a situation in which he has or can have a direct
or indirect interest that conflicts or may conflict with the interest
of the company. The company law review recommended that the
authorisation should be reasonably specific. The clause does not go
that far, but nor does it provide for the blanket authorisations
envisaged in amendment No.
255.</div>
<a name="06071249000375"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.15
pm</div><a name="06071249000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
255 would allow the rule on conflicts of interests to be effectively
set aside in an extremely wide manner. The ability to disclose by way
of general notice is appropriate in relation to transactions within a
company, and clauses 163 and 168 deal with such matters, allowing
interests to be declared in the appropriate way, as does current law.
It would be going too far to allow authorisation to be given by way of
some general notice on other conflicts of interest that may arise. The
purpose of a general notice on company transactions is to put the
company on notice that a director has an interest in a transaction. The
company can then decide whether to take steps to safeguard its
interests. As the company is a party to the transaction, it will be
aware of its terms, even if not of all the details of the
director&#146;s
interest.</div><a name="06071249000119"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071249000426"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> The Solicitor-General is talking about general
disclosure on a transaction. What if a director were to give a general
disclosure on the fact that he was interested, or had other
directorships, in a certain
sector?</div><a name="06071249000120"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071249000427"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> When it comes to other conflicts of
interest, the company will not necessarily have all the additional
information to hand. For example, it might not know about the property,
information or opportunity to which such a conflictas the hon.
Gentleman describes relates. A generalnotice might therefore
give the company insufficient information to reach an informed
decision. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column617" />Column number: 618</div>Amendment No. 255 would leave the company in the dark, which is what he
proposes. It would do away with any need for the directors to be
properly informed to give authorisation. A general notice, it seems,
would suffice.</div><a name="06071249000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under
clause 171, a general notice gives notice that a director has an
interest as a member, officer, employee or otherwise of another company
or firm, or that he is connected with another person. The notice must
also state the nature and extent of the director&#146;s interest in a
company or the nature of his connection with a person. That is it.
General notices do not need to give any other information. That would
not be enough under clause 161. That level of information&#151;to be
more accurate, the virtual lack of it&#151;is likely to be completely
insufficient for directors to determine whether they should be
concerned about a conflict of interest that might arise. By agreeing to
a general notice, directors would be authorising every conflict of
interest arising in relation to the matter disclosed in the notice.
That would leave companies vulnerable, as directors would be able to
agree to the setting aside of their duty in an extremely wide
manner.</div><a name="06071249000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
255 would also provide for authorisation to be given unconditionally,
or subject to such conditions or limitations as the directors specify.
That is unnecessary. The clause already allows the authorisation given
by directors to be unconditional, or subject to restrictions. It is not
necessary to make express provision to say
so.</div><a name="06071249000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">On amendment No.
167, there is currently no absolute rule prohibiting directors from
holding multiple directorships&#151;I have made that clear&#151;or
even from engaging in business that competes with the company. However,
a tension results from that tolerance on one hand and the
director&#146;s fiduciary duties on the other. The clause does not
prohibit a conflict, or potential conflict, of interest, as long as it
is authorised or the director acts in accordance with the provisions on
such matters in his company&#146;s constitution. The situation is
perfectly straightforward: a director can hold multiple directorships
and do business. The clause presents no challenge to current law or the
opportunities for venture capitalists or others to develop a range of
companies and do a good job of promoting our
economy.</div><a name="06071249000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is surely
right that a company should be given the chance, through its members,
directors and constitution, to decide whether conflicts or potential
conflicts are acceptable. They will be given that chance, but the
Conservatives seem to propose watering down the protection that members
of companies have, which is utterly unacceptable. The risks associated
with conflicts of interest and the duties arising from multiple
directorships are precisely the type of situation that the duty in the
clause is intended to catch. The Government wish to widen the pool of
potential non-executive directors, but not against the wishes of the
companies of which those people are already
directors.</div><a name="06071249000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 167 would create a new exemption to the duty to avoid conflicts of
interests, which would change and water down current law and would
conflict with the way in which the duty has been described by the
courts over many decades. I could quote at length from Lord Justice
James in Parker <i class="I">v. </i>McKenna, but I 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column618" />Column number: 619</div>shall not. It is clearly an inflexible rule that the Conservatives seek
to water down.</div>
<a name="06071249000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 167 would weaken
the duty owed. Before the company could deal with a director, it would
have to show that it had suffered a disadvantage. That is not required
at the moment, and it can be difficult to prove in questions of real or
apparent bias and perhaps divided loyalties. The duties do not leave
everything in the hands of the director concerned. The fiduciary duties
were developed precisely because the vulnerable party&#151;in this
case, the company, its members and its shareholders&#151;needed
protecting from the directors. It is not enough to say that a conflict
of interest may take place because, in the mind of a director, it will
be all right. The company, through its members or the other directors,
should be able to make that decision.</div>
<a name="06071249000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">I get the impression that there
has been a lot of lobbying from a bunch of directors who have
particular fears. I hope that I have reassured them and told them that
they can continue with multiple directorships. In some circumstances,
there are benefits and they can be encouraged. However, companies have
a right to know about multiple directorships when they arise.</div>
<a name="06071249000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall deal with whether there
is a negative or positive test, which the hon. Member for Huntingdon
asked at the beginning. The courts have on occasion characterised some
of the rules on directors&#146; interests as negative rather than
positive&#151;disabilities rather than duties. The Bill does not do
that. Clause 156(4) requires the courts to have regard to the rules and
principles of the statutory statement of general duties. That may
include any characterisation of any aspect of those rules and
principles as negative disabilities rather than positive duties, and
any consequences flowing from that in the interpretation and
application of those rules and principles.</div>
<a name="06071249000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">It would be wrong to label
clauses 161 and 162 as disabilities. The courts have never suggested
that the entirety of the rules reflected in those clauses should be
treated as a disability rather than a duty. The leading case is Movitex
<i class="I">v. </i>Bulfield, which was primarily concerned with a conflict
relating to transactions with a company. Such conflicts fall within
clause 163, which simply requires disclosure. More recently, the Court
of Appeal has questioned the distinction between duties and
disabilities in relation to such conflicts of interest. In the case of
Gwent Valley Development Company <i class="I">v. </i>Koshi, it was said that,
whether viewed as duties or disabilities, all such incidents are
aspects of the fiduciary&#146;s primary obligation of loyalty. That
is an important point and the general duties should be considered
together.</div> <a name="06071249000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
I have satisfied the hon. Gentleman about the way in which the director
may perform. He will need to ensure that he is properly authorised for
conflicts of interest. If he receives authorisation, does it properly
and the company knows about it, he can do it. If he does not, he may
well be in trouble. However, the important point is that he would be
now. If the Conservatives were to change it, they would put members and
companies at risk.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071249000428"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> The Solicitor-General&#146;s full response is
appreciated. It will need careful review. However, he 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column619" />Column number: 620</div>started by saying that there is no problem with people holding multiple
directorships. That is simply not the case. People have been telling us
that there will be exactly that problem. It is yet to be seen whether
what he just said will satisfy stakeholders, but I doubt it. He has not
helped to allay my concerns that a director will have a real problem
avoiding a situation that, possibly, may conflict. If, for instance, I
were an electronics expert and a director of an electronics company
looking for a non-executive directorship in the electronics field, it
could be argued that, if I took up such a post in a field similar to
the company in which I was a director, future conflict would be
likely&#151;through competition, one company buying another or any
number of other possibilities. I would know that that situation could
arise, but as things stand it would not present a problem because
people declare interests when they need to do so. That point was made
clearly by my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford, who
spoke with an authority that comes from experience. He explained how he
has found conflict situations work in practice. For the most part the
existing system works pretty well.</div>
<a name="06071249000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are some way from the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071249000447"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 155, in
clause 162, page 71, line 31, after
&#145;benefit&#146;, insert &#145;of more than
&#163;1,000&#146;.</div><a name="06071249000159"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071249000448"></a>The
Chairman:</b> With this it will be convenient to discuss
amendment</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column620" />Column number: 621</div><a name="06071249000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">No. 154, in
clause 162, page 71, line 44, at

not infringed if the acceptance of the benefit is approved by the board
of the
company.&#146;.</div><a name="06071249000161"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071249000449"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> The clause introduces a duty on directors not to
exploit their position for personal benefit. They will be liable only
if accepting the benefit would give rise to a conflict of interest, in
which case they will be caught under that duty and that in clause 159.
By virtue of clause 156(2)(a), the duty is extended to former directors
in relation to</div><a name="06071249000366"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;things
done or omitted by him before he ceased to be a
director.&#148;</div> <a name="06071249000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although that
duty is clearly based on the common law duty to account for any secret
profit, there is no exact corresponding duty to the duty in this
clause.</div><a name="06071249000376"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.30
pm</div><a name="06071249000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">Lord Freeman
moved a probing amendment toleave out this clause. It aimed to
obtain a definition of benefit and to find out whether an indemnity to
a director from a third party relating to the performance of his duty
or non-financial benefits would be caught by the clause. Lord Goldsmith
responded that benefit under the clause covers all forms of benefit
given to a director as a result of him being a director. We do not
think that the Lords amendment needs to be raised again, but we have
concerns and have therefore tabled other
amendments.</div><a name="06071249000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Law
Society&#146;s parliamentary brief raised the point that a director
should be able to obtain approval of a proposed benefit from the board
or shareholders. Furthermore, where a joint venture company has been
established, benefits provided by one of the parties, who may not be an
associate for the purposes of subsection (2), to a director may be
caught under the prohibition. Norton Rose&#146;s briefing note states
that the prohibition in clause 162 will give rise to debate and some
uncertainty over what benefits may be regarded as likely to give rise
to a conflict. Directors will therefore need advice as to what benefits
may be accepted. I should be grateful if the Solicitor-General told us
whether he has given any thought to that
matter.</div><a name="06071249000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">The CBI fears
that the clause may make directors reluctant to delegate authority to
committees. Amendment No. 154 would therefore insert an approval
mechanism. Finally, we wonder whether the clause should apply to de
minimis amounts. MPs have limits beneath which they do not need to
declare sums. Why should not directors have that? We suggest excluding
small amounts and &#163;1,000 is proposed purely on a probing
basis.</div><a name="06071249000166"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071249000450"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> Our approach to theconflict of
interest duties reflects the approach by the company law review. In the
words of the review, it strikes the right balance between encouraging
efficient business operations and the take-up of business opportunities
on the one hand and providing effective protection against abuse on the
other. The reviewwas rightly concerned that a strict
no-conflict rulemight fetter entrepreneurial and business
start-up activity by existing company directors. It is therefore
recommended that, in relation to the personal 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column621" />Column number: 622</div>exploitation of corporate opportunities, it should be possible for the
company&#146;s rights to be waived by the board acting independently
of any conflicted director. That approach was followed by clause 161,
which introduces the new statutory mechanism for the authorisation of
conflicts of interest by those directors without an interest in the
conflict.</div> <a name="06071249000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">The same
arguments do not apply in respect of the acceptance of benefits from
third parties in the clause. That is why the review rightly did not
recommend that independent directors should be able to authorise
acceptance of benefits from third parties. The issue is not the
relative seriousness of the abuse, although the acceptance of a bribe
by a director can certainly be a serious abuse. Rather, it is about
whether other considerations, particularly those relating to the need
to encourage entrepreneurial activity and business success,
counterbalance the need to provide effective protection for companies
against the risks of conflicts of interests by their directors. Those
other considerations do not arise to the same degree when it comes to
the acceptance of benefits from third parties which should go to the
company. Therefore, the acceptance of such benefits should not be left
to the self-regulation of the directors
themselves.</div><a name="06071249000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Huntingdon asked about benefits. To some extent, his
question was dealt with by the Attorney-General in another place. A
benefit for the purposes of this duty includes benefits of any
description, including non-financial benefits. In using the word
&#147;benefit&#148;, we intend the ordinary dictionary meaning of
the word. The &#147;Oxford English Dictionary&#148; defines it as a
favourable or helpful factor, circumstance, advantage or
profit.</div> <a name="06071249000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">In Cronin
<i class="I">v. </i>Grierson, the courts had to consider the meaning of the word
&#147;benefit&#148; as used in section 2(3) of the Betting, Gaming
and Lotteries Act 1963, which
states:</div><a name="06071249000367"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
player&#146;s success at the game shall not entitle any person to, or
to exchange any prize or token for, any benefit other than those
provided for by subsection (2) of this
section.&#148;</div><a name="06071249000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">In that case
Lord Morris said that a successful player who won the jackpot was given
preferred terms for further playing and as a result was most likely or
almost certain to have further gain. He added that that was a benefit.
Lord Upjohn said that benefit is a word of wide import and that in this
context it means no more than advantage. He said that he could not
construe it as being limited to a tangible, corporeal advantage in the
sense of a prize token or article. Therefore, while the meaning of the
term will ultimately be a matter of statutory interpretation for the
courts, it is intended to include, and we consider that it does,
non-financial benefits.</div>
<a name="06071249000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">As far as the de minimis rule
is concerned, we do not agree that it is necessary. Financial
thresholds are by their nature arbitrary and sit uneasily with the
function of the general duties, which are set out as general principles
governing the obligations of directors. There is a general duty owed by
the director to a company and as such it is concerned with the
underlying harm that will be done to the interests of the company or
the risk of such harm occurring.</div>
<a name="06071249000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is no financial threshold
in the current law. The current law does not seem to need one and
neither the Law Commission nor the company law review 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column622" />Column number: 623</div>recommended that there should be one. The current law operates a much
more sophisticated test based on the risk of a conflict of interest.
That is how subsection (4) operates. A director may accept a benefit if
it cannot reasonably be regarded as being likely togive rise
to a conflict of interest in the specific circumstances of the
individual case. This is not simply a matter of the financial
value.</div> <a name="06071249000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">I happen to
have had a dinner with the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford some
years ago. He will recall the incident because it featured in the
newspapers. At one point I remember he bought a very expensive bottle
of wine. Some people might regard that as an inducement. However, most
people would regard the purchase of a mere meal as not being an
inducement or bribe of any sort. But wines varyin price. They
can be worth many hundreds andindeed thousands of pounds. What
is a benefit? The circumstances must dictate
that.</div><a name="06071249000174"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071249000451"></a>Mr.
Djanogly</b> <i class="I">rose&#151;</i></div>
<a name="06071249000175"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071249000452"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> I give way if the hon. Gentleman is
really interested in this wine
question.</div><a name="06071249000176"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071249000453"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I am. The reason why is because it is rather
proving my point. Why have all the complication of deciding whether a
wine is an expensive bottle of wine and whether it will influence
people or not? Why not just have a de minimis level under which it is
considered unnecessary to go into what the Solicitor-General called the
sophisticated
argument?</div><a name="06071249000177"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071249000454"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> The hon. Gentleman is clearly a
discerner of fine wines on the basis that he can afford them. A small
company might well find that &#163;1,000 was quite a substantial
inducement to a member of a company or a director of a company.
Companies vary in size. One thousand pounds may be a mere de minimis
amount to him. It may be simply the price of a bottle of wine to him
but it will not be for most people. For many people, particularly in a
small company, &#163;1,000 is not minimal, but significant.
Therefore, it should be for the company to determine in the particular
circumstances it faces whether a benefit was one that should concern
it.</div><a name="06071249000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">A director may
benefit if it cannot reasonably be regarded as giving rise to a
conflict of interest in the specific circumstances of the individual
case. Such benefits with a small monetary value may be effective bribes
because they take account of the director&#146;s particular interests
or passions. For example, the hon. Member for Huntingdon likes wine. I
know that the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford does. A ticket for
a one-off performance or a carefully chosen gift for an avid collector
of wine may be quite an inducement. I therefore think that we should
not have the de minimis clause; we should leave it to the company to
consider its own
circumstances.</div><a name="06071249000179"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06071249000455"></a><b class="B">David
Howarth</b> (Cambridge) (LD): Does not the Solicitor-General
consider that there might be some merit in a combination of the two
proposals? For very 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column623" />Column number: 624</div>small amounts, the directors might well be in a good position to give
authorisation. Under the ratification provisions of clause 222, the
shareholders are required to give authorisation. That seems to be a
rather cumbersome procedure for the authorisation of asmall
deal.</div><a name="06071249000180"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071249000456"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> If the company wants to set that out in
its constitution or to change things, it is able to take the steps
necessary to authorise a particular approach by
directors.</div><a name="06071249000181"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071249000457"></a>David
Howarth:</b> That raises a general issue about the degree to
which the rules in the Bill are mandatory. Clause 154, which we did not
discuss, is understood to be mandatory because all the clauses in the
Bill are considered mandatory unless otherwise stated. The
Solicitor-General&#146;s comments seemed to go against
that.</div><a name="06071249000182"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071249000458"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> A company will need to be able to
determine whether a director&#146;s benefits present a problem; it
might be concerned only about some benefits. Providing that is all done
openly, there will not be a problem that we need worry about. But the
company must have the right to intervene if it is concerned about the
benefits that a director has
obtained.</div><a name="06071249000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">The de
minimis provision presents a technical issue. What is a benefit of
&#163;1,000? What does that mean? Many benefits might not be in cash
or have a clear monetary value. Who would be responsible for assessing
the value of such benefits? The third party might choose also to pay
the benefit in instalments. What is the position if a director accepts
a payment from a third party of &#163;950 one week, and another of
equal value the next week? It is not entirely clear. There are
definitional issues here.</div>
<a name="06071249000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">The proposal by the hon. Member
for Huntingdon would produce all sorts of threshold issues and create
fresh opportunities for those who wish to evade their directors&#146;
duties. It would be possible to respond by introducing detailed
anti-evasion provisions, but that would further complicate an area of
law that we are trying to codify. We do not want to complicate that
further, so let us leave out the de minimis provision and ensure that
companies can determine the best approach for dealing with conflicts of
interest. The duty not to accept benefits from third parties should
remain on
directors.</div><a name="06071249000185"></a>

contributions that I have heard, I am not sure that we have reached the
right approach. As the hon. Member for Cambridge pointed out, the
clause could probably be improved by being more flexible. The
Solicitor-General was not necessarily without reason in querying
whether the drafting of my amendments was as fine tuned as it could
have been. However, I have made my point. We will think further about
the matter over the summer. On that basis, I beg to ask leave to

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071249000460"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> According to the explanatory notes, the clause
replaces the existing rule that directors may not have interests in
transactions. The Law Society, however, asserts that it is an entirely
new duty with no equivalent in common law. Its parliamentary brief
raises the issue that the purpose of the clause is to make a
company&#146;s board aware of the interests of one of their number,
but the clause states that declaration of interests of which the
director is unaware cannot exert influence and therefore need not be
disclosed.</div> <a name="06071249000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Law
Society asked for clarification of a couple of points. Will the clause
affect the director of a parent company who has had an interest in a
transaction of a subsidiary company? Will the interests of a person
connected to a director need to be disclosed? A report in the
<i class="I">Solicitors&#146; Journal</i> pointed out that the requirement to
disclose matters of which a director ought reasonably to be aware, is
onerous. It will require directors to keep themselves fully up to date
with the affairs of the board and its committees, which could be
difficult for non-executive directors. It would be helpful to hear the
Solicitor-General&#146;s views on those concerns.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071249000461"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> Clearly, a director is able to display
only the diligence, skill and knowledge that he has. If he does not
know about things, he does not know about things. If he is aware of
potential conflicts, he has a duty to declare an interest in a proposed
transaction or arrangement.</div>
<a name="06071249000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause replaces the
equitable principle that directors may not enter into contracts with
their company or have an interest in any of the company&#146;s
contracts. For the benefit of the Law Society, thecases
include Aberdeen Railway Company <i class="I">v. </i>Blaikie Brothers. It is the
same principle that prevents an agent from contracting with his
principal and the trustee from contracting with his trust, as set out
in Keech <i class="I">v.</i><i class="I"><b class="B"> </b></i>Sandford. Those are the authorities.
The reason for the strict rule is that the company is entitled to the
collective wisdom of its directors. If any director is interested in a
contract, his interest may conflict with his duty, and the law always
strives to prevent such conflict arising. The rule applies even if the
contract is fair. The courts will not look into the merits but strictly
adhere to the law that a possible conflict of interest and duty must
not be allowed to arise.</div>
<a name="06071249000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">It would, however, be
commercially impossible for the strict equitable principal to apply
without some qualifications. A director may therefore enter into a
contract with a company or have an interest in such a contract if he
obtains the company&#146;s consent first. Consent may be given by the
members, or in some way through the articles.</div>
<a name="06071249000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">In common law, the company is
at liberty to waive the rules protecting it as a principle in dealings
in which directors have an interest. For that reason, section 317 of
the Companies Act 1985 imposes a statutory 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column625" />Column number: 626</div>minimum disclosure requirement. There are three sets of rules about
company contracts in which a director has an interest: the strict
equitable principle, any relaxation of the principle via the
company&#146;s articles, and section 317 of the 1985 Act. The varying
requirements of each and their interaction is important.</div>
<a name="06071249000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Gentleman asked
whether directors should not be required to disclose what they do not
know. In other words, if they do not know it, how will they disclose
it? One purpose of the clause is to ensure that the board is aware of
anything that may influence decision making by individual directors,
but that is not the only purpose of the rules governing transactions
between a company and its directors. The rules exist to protect the
company. There must be no conflict or any risk of conflict, and good
faith must be manifestly applied.</div>
<a name="06071249000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the Law Commission&#146;s
review of section 317 of the 1985 Act, it noted that article 8(6)(b) of
table A excludes from the range of interests to be disclosed those of
which the director has no knowledge and of which it is unreasonable to
expect him to have knowledge. Its view was that such interests should
be exempt from disclosure, and the Bill adopts that approach in respect
of the declarations of interest required under clauses 163 and 168. As
such, it reflects the current position for those companies. I hope that
with that reassurance, the hon. Gentleman will accept that he need not
worry unduly. I hope that the Law Society is reassured,
too.</div><a name="06071249000198"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071249000462"></a>Mr.

<h4 class="hs_8Clause">Clause
164</h4><a name="06071249000009"></a><div class="hs_7SmCapsHdg">Civil

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071249000463"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> The clause states that the civil consequences of
breaching a duty in clauses 157 to 163 will be the same as for
breaching the corresponding common-law rule or equitable principle. The
Law Society&#146;s parliamentary brief points out that clause 164(2)
implies that fiduciary duties other than those codified in chapter 2
apply to directors and remain outstanding, and that that confusion
should be cleared up. Other commentators have noted that the clause is
poorly drafted, saying that it will not cover situations in which a
director has breached a statutory duty for which there is no
corresponding common-law rule or equitable principle. Norton
Rose&#146;s briefing note raises that issue, stating that it is
unclear how the civil remedies will apply as most of the duties
concerned are not identical to those established by case law. The
courts&#146; existing remedies may be inappropriate when applied to
statutory duties that have been cast in different
terms.</div><a name="06071249000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">Have the
Government considered those issues in more detail since their
consideration in the Lords?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column626" />Column number: 627</div><a name="06071249000204"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071249000464"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> The clause explains what will happen if
a director breaches his general duties. Subsection (1) states that the
consequences will be the same as those that currently apply. There will
be no criminal consequences. Subsection (2) is intended to remove any
doubt that general duties can be enforced in the same way as the
common-law rules and equitable principles that they replace. The
fiduciary remedies currently available will still be available
following a breach.</div>
<a name="06071249000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 156(3) will tell the
courts that each duty contained in the statutory statement is based on
a common-law rule or equitable principle. Where those duties have been
codified the courts will be able to identify the relevant rule or
principle. Where they have been changed the courts will need to find
the rule or principle that covers the same subject matter as the
general duty contained in the statutory statement. If necessary, the
explanatory notes and the comments made here today can assist in that
exercise. However, once the corresponding rule or principle has been
identified in the courts the question will be what the consequences
should be if it is breached in particular circumstances and whether a
general duty has been
breached.</div><a name="06071249000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 164
preserves current law on the consequences, including remedies, flowing
from any breach of duties. The fact that the general duties might
depart from common-law rules and equitable principles in certain ways
will not alter the circumstances flowing from their breach. The
question will not be whether the rule or principle has been breached
but what the consequences should be once it has been
breached.</div><a name="06071249000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
consequences of a breach of the fiduciary duty can include damages,
compensation, restoration of a company&#146;s property, rescission of
a transaction or a requirement of a director to account for any profits
made as a result. They may also include injunctions or declarations,
although those methods are primarily employed when a breach is
threatened but has not yet occurred. The consequences of a breach of
the duty of care and skill may include the court awarding compensation
or damages.</div><a name="06071249000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope
that the hon. Gentleman will feel that the Law Society&#146;s
concerns have been
met.</div><a name="06071249000209"></a>

clause will reverse the various relaxations to the strict no-conflict

advantage of the various relaxations, where their constitutions allow
it. That has the benefit of openness and transparency. It will be clear
from the charity&#146;s constitution whether it can take advantage of
a relaxation of the strict no-conflict rule. Clause 167 applies to

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071249000468"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> The clause deals with the declaration of
interest in existing transactions or arrangements and ties in with
section 317 of the 1985 Act. Rather than go over all the debates in the
Lords, I shall identify one particular point. Subsection (5) states
that a director must declare matters</div>
<a name="06071249000368"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;of which he ought reasonably to
be aware.&#148;</div><a name="06071249000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is no
corresponding requirement in section
317.</div><a name="06071249000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Law Society
stated that the requirement to declare matters of which directors ought
reasonably to be aware is particularly onerous and should be left out.
The Solicitor-General will note that I have not tabled an amendment to
that effect, but I would be grateful for his views on subsection (5)
and reasonable
awareness.</div><a name="06071249000223"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071249000469"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> The Government take the view that
directors have some substantial obligations and that they ought to
declare those things about which they should reasonably have been
aware. That is an objective test applied to directors concerned. So it
will take into account any relevant circumstances relating to that
director; it will focus on the individual director. This is the
question that will be asked: whatis it reasonable to expect a
director in those circumstances to have been aware of? For example, a
non-executive director might be expected generally to be less aware of
the individual transactions or arrangements entered into by a
company.</div> <a name="06071249000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">I repeat
that directors are not expected to disclose things that they do not
know. One of the purposes of the clause is to ensure that the board is
aware of anything that might influence a director&#146;s decision.
The director can disclose only what he is aware of, and if he is aware
of it, he ought to declare it. The clause therefore will be clear
enough, but anyone who wants clarification can read the notes on the
clause or, on the basis of Pepper <i class="I">v. </i>Hart, read my comments in

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071249000473"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> The clause contains new provisions outlining how
a director can make a declaration by notice in writing. It states that
such a declaration must be sent to other directors in hard-copy form by
hand or by post, unless a recipient has agreed to receive it
electronically. Once a declaration has been made by that method, it is
deemed to form part of the next board meeting&#146;s
proceedings.</div><a name="06071249000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Law
Society parliamentary brief proposes an amendment to subsection (2) to
require a director who makes a declaration to send the notice not only
to the other directors, but to the company secretary, if the company
has one. The secretary should be aware of declarations, and a central
record should be kept.</div>
<a name="06071249000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Law Society also proposes
an amendment to subsection (4)(b) to enable a director to send the
notice in electronic form if another director has, in general, agreed
to receive all declarations of interest in that form, and not just if
an agreement has been reached on a specific declaration.</div>
<a name="06071249000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">In a large company, almost
everything will go through the company secretary&#146;s department,
and it would probably be seen as rude to send official notices directly
to other directors. In reality, many directors will not know where
their fellow directors are half the time and they would, in any event,
see that as the role of the company secretary. I would be grateful to
hear the Solicitor-General&#146;s views on
that.</div><a name="06071249000235"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071249000474"></a>The

about any declaration of interest by a fellow
director.</div><a name="06071249000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">We do not
accept that it is particularly onerous to tell other directors of a
declaration, because they will&#151;particularly these days&#151;be
in contact with their office or place of business, and there will be a
method of sending them a letter or other communication. Directors must
already declare an interest under 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column629" />Column number: 630</div>section 317 of the 1985 Act and article 85 of table A, so it is no great
change to require them to continue todo so.</div>
<a name="06071249000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">Company
directors take decisions, sometimes daily, and they should be informed
of any issues about which they need to know. A director who declares an
interest may send the notice to the company secretary, who may then
send it to the other directors&#151;that is not a problem. However,
the responsibility for ensuring that it is sent out to the other
directors must rest with the director who sent it; he cannot abrogate
that responsibility by giving the notice to the company secretary and
saying, &#147;Right, I&#146;ve sent it to you. That&#146;s it, I
don&#146;t have to tell anyone else. It&#146;s up to you to make
sure you contact everyone
else.&#148;</div><a name="06071249000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
the director&#146;s responsibility to ensure that the other directors
are informed. If they are happy to be informed in a particular
way&#151;they might well want to be informed by the company
secretary&#151;they can authorise that, but we should not take away
the director&#146;s responsibility for telling the other
directors.</div> <a name="06071249000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman did not speak to amendment No. 275, but let me address it by
saying that clause 807 defines electronic means as including faxes. It
depends on the view of the recipient as to whether he is prepared to
receive things by fax&#151;some people are, some are not. Faxes are a
very inefficient means of communicating, as I found this morning when I
tried to receive one. The printer on my fax machine had broken down, so
nothing but a blank sheet of paper came through. If the intention had
been to inform me of a conflict of interest, I would not have been
informed.</div> <a name="06071249000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">Faxes are,
therefore, not particularly reliable. None the less, some people may
wish to receive the declaration by fax, in which case authorisation may
be given. If the recipient agrees that they will receive a declaration
by fax, that is fine; if they do not, they should receive it in the
proper form, and the director has an obligation to send it in a form
that is easily readable. Indeed, these days, e-mail is probably an
easier way of getting in contact with people than fax, but e-mails,
too, have a habit of going astray.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071249000475"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> On the latter point, I thank the
Solicitor-General, first, for reminding me that I did not speak to that
amendment. I suppose that, as far as the Government are concerned, we
now live in a post-fax age, and his view reflects that. I do not
necessarily disagree, but some people have only just moved on to fax
and have not quite got round to e-mail
yet.</div><a name="06071249000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">On amendment No.
274, we are coming round in a circle so as to decide what the

I suppose, made it clear that they are not much interested in the
officer role of the company secretary. What the Solicitor-General just
said ties in with that, in so far as he said that company secretaries
should not be responsible for sending out documents and that it is the
director&#146;s responsibility. I suppose that is in accord with
cutting out company secretaries generally. We do not agree about that,
but the debate has already taken place. On that basis, I beg to ask

February 2006 finance e-bulletin from Herbert Smith, the solicitors,
welcomed the changes that will be made to the law by the clause. It was
pointed out that insolvency practitioners find the procedure of selling
the assets of a company in administration to directors difficult, as
shareholder approval is necessary under section 320 of the 1985 Act.
That is often difficult to obtain in practice, so such transactions
must be structured to exclude any director involvement. The amendment
would simply clarify the definition used for the forms of
insolvency.</div><a name="06071249000256"></a>

amendment would go further by allowing a substantial property
transaction to take place without shareholder approval if a company was
in receivership. That could cover a wider range of situations. We do
not think that that would be appropriate, as there would be a risk of
abuse. A receiver may be appointed by a director or a connected person

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071249000484"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> The clause replicates part of the 1985 Act. Just
as with clause 180, credit transactions that were completely prohibited
by section 330 can now be approved by members. Furthermore, clause 185
applies to all companies, whereas section 330(4) applies only to public
companies. Private companies that can currently enter into such a
credit transaction would have to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column632" />Column number: 633</div>obtain member approval. That implements a recommendation of the company
law review. However, this is a deregulatory Bill, and I note that
although public companies have been given the opportunity to provide
credit, the clause now brings private companies into the net of
requiring shareholder consent. Why is this regulatory move being
made?</div><a name="06071249000271"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071249000485"></a>Margaret

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071249000491"></a>Mr.

<a name="06071249000285"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071249000492"></a>Margaret

someone were to have a credit limit for a trip abroad or something
similar, as long as they were on company business, it 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column633" />Column number: 634</div>would be appropriate to have it at that level. Clause 191 deals with

Djanogly:</b> The wording of clause 193 has been moved around,
but it is the same in substance as section 338 of the Companies Act
1985. The only substantial change is that the maximum amounts of

for the purchase of a director&#146;s residential property have been

they are welcome. Did the Government consider abolishing clauses 199 to
206? There is an exception in clause 204 for payments made under a

<div class="Column"><a name="Column635" />Column number: 636</div><a name="06071249000316"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendments concern the
indemnification ofa director of a company acting as a trustee
of an occupational pension scheme. They deal with worries that were
raised in another place. It was said that such directors perform a
vital role, often for little direct financial reward, and that
directors&#146; and officers&#146; liability insurance policies
currently available afford limited protection. We made it clear in
another place that the Government attach importance to the work of such
directors and that we were aware that it can sometimes be difficult to
recruit high-quality directors for companies acting as trustees of
occupational pension schemes. In view of that, and following
consultation with key stakeholders, we agreed in principle to table
amendments that would permit companies to indemnify the directors of
associated companies acting as trustees of occupational pension
schemes. That is what the Government amendments would
provide.</div><a name="06071249000317"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 206 has two elements. I hopethat one of them, the
indemnification of directors of associated companies acting as trustees
of occupational pension schemes, has been dealt with by the
Government&#146;s amendments. The other element would allow a company
to indemnify the directors of its wholly owned subsidiaries. We cannot
accept that. The Companies (Audit, Investigations and Community
Enterprise) Act 2004 closed what was an important loophole concerning
the indemnification of directors by third
parties.</div><a name="06071249000318"></a><div class="hs_Para">It used to be
the practice in some groups of companies for one group to indemnify a
director of another company in the same group. We do not believe that
that is acceptable as a matter of principle. If one company in the
group were not permitted to provide indemnification, it would not be
right to permit another group to do so. That is most certainly the case
when a subsidiary company is used as a vehicle for indemnifying the
director of a parent company,but we also believe that there
would be scope for potential mischief if we permitted a parent
companyto indemnify the directors of its wholly owned
subsidiaries.</div><a name="06071249000319"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
important to bear it in mind that all companies are now permitted to
indemnify directors against most third-party liabilities. That is an
important reform and it is difficult in light of it to see why the hon.
Gentleman tabled such an amendment. Indeed, I hope that he will not
press it to a Division. A parent company wishing to take action against
the director of a wholly owned subsidiary will have a number of options
at its disposal, possibly including the director&#146;s dismissal.
There seems to be little to be gained by the amendment to offset the
potential for mischief. We therefore cannot accept amendment No. 206,
but I commend the Government amendments and new clause to the
Committee.</div><a name="06071249000380"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">7.30

them over the summer. This is a complicated area of law and it is not
easy to examine the issues arising from clauses 216 and 222 in
isolation, so to discuss the amendments I shall first set out
the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column636" />Column number: 637</div>overall picture as it stands following the recent changes brought into
force by the Companies (Audit, Investigations and Community Enterprise)
Act 2004, and what changes these new provisions are designed to
introduce.</div><a name="06071249000321"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 235
defines what is meant by a person being connected with a director. For
the purposes of the clause, that may include fellow directors. If the
ratification decision is taken by way of a written resolution, the
director and his connected persons may not take part in the written
resolution procedure. That means that the company need not send them a
copy of the written resolution and they are not counted when
determining the number of votes required for the written resolution to
be passed. If the ratification decision is taken at a meeting, those
members whose votes are to be disregarded may still attend the meeting,
take part in the meeting and count towards the quorum for the meeting
if their membership gives them the right to do
so.</div><a name="06071249000322"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 222(6)
makes it clear that nothing in the clause changes the law on unanimous
consent, so the restrictions imposed by the clause as to who may vote
on a ratification resolution will not apply when every member votes,
informally or otherwise, in favour of the resolution. Subsection (6)
also makes it clear that nothing in the clause removes any powers that
the directors may have to manage the affairs of the company. Subsection
(7) explains that the requirements imposed by the clause are in
addition to any other limitations or restrictions imposed by the law as
to what may or may not be ratified and
when.</div><a name="06071249000323"></a><div class="hs_Para">In light of the
changes, companies will probably want to consider entering into
individual indemnity agreements with directors and to check their
articles of association. Most companies have indemnity provisions in
favour of the company&#146;s directors in their articles of
association. However, although the articles in effect form a binding
commitment between the company and its members, a director is not a
party to that arrangement and may not therefore be able to enforce
directly an indemnity in his
favour.</div><a name="06071249000324"></a><div class="hs_Para">In Globalink
Telecommunications Ltd <i class="I">v. </i>Wilmbury Ltd, it was held that a
company&#146;s articles of association were not automatically binding
as between the company and its officers, but could expressly or
impliedly be incorporated into a contract between the company and a
director. To mitigate the risk of not being able to enforce an
indemnity in the company&#146;s articles, directors are therefore
increasingly seeking the protection of stand-alone indemnities. Many
directors already have the benefit of indemnities in contracts with the
company&#151;for example, in their service contracts, letters of
appointment or stand-alone deeds of indemnity&#151;and companies may
want to consider amending the relevant indemnities to provide the
increased protection permitted as a result of the changes introduced by
the 2004 Act.</div><a name="06071249000325"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have
two primary concerns about this part of the Bill. The first was
expressed by our noble Friends in the House of Lords: these clauses do
not allow protection from liabilities for certain directors who should
be protected. Our second concern relates to the changes to the law on
ratification which the Bill imposes.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column637" />Column number: 638</div><a name="06071249000326"></a><div class="hs_Para">These clauses deal with
provisions that protect directors from potential liabilities. I spoke
previouslyin relation to part 10 about the importance of
maintaining a corporate environment that encourages companies to stay
in the UK rather than discouraging them from doing so. Ensuring that
the best people still wish to take on the burdens and responsibilities
of company directorships is essential in maintaining a company-friendly
environment in the
UK.</div><a name="06071249000327"></a><div class="hs_Para">During the
Government&#146;s lengthy consultation preceding the Bill, two
principal concerns were identified in relation to directors&#146;
liabilities. The first related to directors&#146; increased exposure
to liability arising from legal proceedings brought by third parties.
That is particularly relevant due to the increase in class actions
being brought against company directors in the United States. I have at
some length made the case that the combination of new provisions in the
Bill&#151;not least other provisions of part 10 working together with
part 11&#151;will, in our view, lead to further litigation against
directors.</div><a name="06071249000328"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second
major concern relates to the costs incurred by directors in defending
legal proceedings, which companies could pay only after judgment was
given in the director&#146;s favour or after an acquittal. Both those
factors have led to growing concerns among directors that the fees that
they are being paid for their services do not justify the potential
liabilities to which they are exposing themselves. That is a concern
especially for non-executive
directors.</div><a name="06071249000329"></a><div class="hs_Para">An article
in the December issue of the Practical Law Company&#146;s magazine,
written by two solicitors from the City firm Freshfields, examined how
demands for changes to the law originally started. They
said:</div><a name="06071249000371"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The risk
of a director having to bear the expense of protecting himself against
claims brought by the company, liquidators, disgruntled shareholders
(perhaps in the US courts) or a regulatory body were seen as a
deterrent to well qualified candidates being willing to serve as
directors.&#148;</div><a name="06071249000330"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
some extent, those concerns have been dealt with by the introduction of
several new clauses into the Companies Act 1985 via the Companies
(Audit, Investigations and Community Enterprise) Act 2004. It would
help if the Solicitor-General were to put on record how effective the
DTI has found those new provisions, which came into force in April
2005.</div> <a name="06071249000331"></a><div class="hs_Para">This chapter of
the Bill does not cover directors of subsidiaries and employing
companies indemnifying the directors of corporate trustees of their
occupational pension schemes. On Report in the Lords, Lord Freeman
tabled an amendment that sought to meet concerns that the Bill goes too
far in preventing parent companies from indemnifying directors of their
subsidiary companies, particularly in preventing employing companies
from indemnifying the directors of corporate trustees of their
occupational pension schemes. That is a particular problem, as the
directors&#146; and officers&#146; liability insurance policies
that are currently available give only limited protection to employee
directors.</div> <a name="06071249000332"></a><div class="hs_Para">The aim of
Lord Freeman&#146;s amendment was to aid the recruitment of and
provide protection for employee directors of subsidiary companies, and
would include 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column638" />Column number: 639</div>protection for company secretaries, who often act as directors of
subsidiary companies. Having a company secretary as a director aids
administration and compliance requirements. Furthermore, many directors
often act as directors of subsidiaries before advancing to the board of
the parent company. That common business practice is jeopardised by the
Bill.</div> <a name="06071249000333"></a><div class="hs_Para">Lord
Freeman&#146;s amendment was tabled in the Lords both in Committee
and on Report. While the Bill was being considered in Committee, the
Attorney-General sought further consultation on the problems that were
highlighted. In relation to indemnification by an associated company of
a company acting as trustee of an occupational pension scheme, the
Attorney-General agreed to accept, in principle, that aspect of Lord
Freeman&#146;s amendment. The Government accepted that the
indemnification of trustees is not otherwise a controversial practice,
and that concerns need to be addressed. Clearly, they are addressing
this issue with their amendments today.</div>
<a name="06071249000334"></a><div class="hs_Para">Despite expressing sympathy
regarding some of the concerns that were raised by those in the
business and legal communities who will be affected by the clause, the
Government seem to have done little to meet their concerns about the
other aspect of the amendment. The Institute of Directors makes that
clear in these comments to
us:</div><a name="06071249000372"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Government has said it may be prepared to extent the scope to employee
directors of corporate trustees...Without such indemnity being
available any well-informed person will be unwilling to act as a
director or officer of a subsidiary undertaking. Becoming a director of
a subsidiary is very often the route to directorship of the parent.
Without the experience and development offered in subsidiaries
directors will be less well-placed to take on the role of director of
the parent, with the likelihood that both performance and governance
will
suffer.&#148;</div><a name="06071249000335"></a><div class="hs_Para">What
is the Government&#146;s latest position on this issue? Are they
considering whether to extend the scope to employee directors and
corporate trustees? The serious concerns of the party that represents
company directors in the UK should not be treated lightly.</div>
<a name="06071249000336"></a><div class="hs_Para">I reiterate that it is
important to keep good company directors in the UK. Company directors
are vital to the running of successful companies, and successful
companies are vital to the running of the country&#146;s economy. To
bring in measures that will discourage good people from becoming
company directors because of the liabilities that they might face would
damage the economy of this country. To counter that threat, we tabled
the amendment, which was drafted by the CBI and which aims to meet the
concerns that I have outlined regarding the indemnification of
subsidiary directors. Now that I have put forward the arguments of
those at the forefront of this area of law and business, I hope that
the Government will reconsider the amendment and look upon it more
favourably.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071249000504"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> I have dealt with the amendment, so let
me reply in more general terms. Our reforms in the Bill strike a
careful balance betweenthe interests of directors and the need
to protect 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column639" />Column number: 640</div>companies and, ultimately, their shareholders. It is important that the
law is able to deal firmly but fairly with cases where something has
gone wrong, but we certainly recognise that there is a need for a
diverse pool of high-quality individuals who are able to assume the
role of company director, and for directors to be willing to take
informed and rational risks.</div>
<a name="06071249000338"></a><div class="hs_Para">A number of reforms were
introduced through the 2004 Act, and they address many of the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s concerns. It is too early to say how they have
worked, as they have only just been enacted. Let us wait and see how
they develop.</div> <a name="06071249000339"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
package of reforms is important. Companies are permitted but not
required to indemnify directors against liabilities for third parties.
It was a major area of concern, particularly in the case of companies
with a US exposure which wished to be able to indemnify directors
against liabilities arising from class actions by groups of
shareholders.</div>
<a name="06071249000340"></a><div class="hs_Para">Companies are
permitted but not required to pay directors&#146; defence costs as
they are incurred, which seems to run contrary to what the hon.
Gentleman said, unless I misunderstood him. Even if the company brings
the action or it is a derivative action, indemnification may cover
legal and financial costs of any adverse judgment, subject to
exceptions for criminal fines, penalties imposed by regulatory bodies,
the costs of criminal proceedings in which the director is convicted,
the costs of actions brought by the company when final judgment is
given against the director and the costs for unsuccessful actions for
release.</div> <a name="06071249000341"></a><div class="hs_Para">The package
of measures ought to command widespread support. It will encourage
entrepreneurial behaviour by directors and safeguard the interests of
companies and their shareholders.</div>
<a name="06071249000342"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071249000505"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> There is one point on which I should be grateful
to hear the Solicitor-General&#146;s views. In his earlier remarks,
he said that one main reason why he did not like our amendment was the
scope for abuse that might result from it. Will he explain in more
detail where the abuse is likely to come
from?</div>
<a name="06071249000343"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071249000506"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> I have set out our concerns about the
amendment. For example, if a parent company could indemnify the
directors of wholly owned subsidiaries for whatever they liked, it
would be used to get around the restrictions placed on the indemnities
that companies may give to their own directors or those of other,
associated companies.</div>
<a name="06071249000344"></a><div class="hs_Para">Group companies can be highly
interconnected, with myriad links and interdependencies&#151;often
even more so with wholly owned subsidiaries and their parents. They may
share directors and officers, and they may have entered into
cross-guarantees or made loans to each other. They are not in a
different enough position to justify their exemption from the
restriction to the indemnities that other group companies might give to
directors of companies within the group. Such exemption might even
encourage the setting up of artificial group structures to take
advantage of it. Therefore, we oppose the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
amendment.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column640" />Column number: 641</div><a name="06071249000345"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071249000507"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I am not entirely convinced by the
Solicitor-General&#146;s argument, but we will go away and think
about it. On that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div>
<a name="06071249000346"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071249000508"></a>The
Chairman:</b> It does not need to be withdrawn, because it has
not been moved, but I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman.</div>
