							<a name="07101654000347"></a>The
Chairman:
						</b> I welcome hon. Members to this first sitting of
the Public Bill Committee on the Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill.
Although I have already done so in the Programming Sub-Committee, I
welcome in particular those new hon. Members who have been thrown into
the lions&#146; den at an early stage of their parliamentary
career&#151;the hon. Members for Ealing, Southall and for Sedgefield.
I hope that they enjoy our proceedings.</div>
					<a name="07101654000007"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before we begin, I have several
preliminary domestic announcements to make. I am always pleased that
hon. Members are as comfortable as possible so, if they wish, they may
remove their jackets during our sittings. I request them to ensure that
their mobile telephones, pagers and other electronic devices that make
noise are turned off or switched to silent mode during sittings. If I
hear any intervention from such gadgets, the look on my face will tell
all.</div>
					<a name="07101654000008"></a><div class="hs_Para">I remind the
Committee that copies of the money resolution in connection with the
Bill are available in the room. I also remind hon. Members that
adequate notice should be given of amendments. As a general rule, I and
my fellow Chairman, Mr. O&#146;Hara&#151;who happens to
be in the room&#151;do not intend to call starred amendments,
including any that might be reached during an afternoon sitting of the
Committee. I hope that the lead spokesmen for Opposition parties, in
particular, will take note of
that.</div>
					<a name="07101654000009"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are still in
the very early days of taking oral evidence in Public Bill Committee
proceedings, so it might help if I explain briefly what is proposed so
that we can all be clear what we are about and how we should proceed.
The Committee will first be asked to consider the programme motion on
the amendment paper on which debate is limited to half an hour. We
shall then proceed to a motion to report written evidence and a further
motion to permit the Committee to deliberate in private in advance of
the oral evidence sessions, which I hope that we can take formally.
Assuming that that motion has been agreed, the Committee will then move
into private session. After it has deliberated, witnesses and members
of the public will be invited back into the room and our oral evidence
session will commence. If the Committee agrees to the programme motion,
it will hear oral evidence today and on Thursday before reverting next
week to the more familiar proceedings of clause by clause scrutiny of
the Bill. I call the Minister to move the programme
motion.</div>

					<a name="07101654000011"></a><div class="hs_Para">I welcome
you, Sir Nicholas, and your co-Chair, Mr. O&#146;Hara, to
the Committee. You and I have served before as Chairman and Minister in
my previous incarnation as Minister of State for Northern Ireland. You
will recall that, on that occasion, the Northern Ireland (Offences)
Bill received the unanimous support of myself and the Whip, and no one
else on the Committee. However, I am sure that this Bill&#146;s 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column3" />Column number: 3</div>objectives will achieve a much greater consensus than that, and I look
forward to our debate in Committee
today.</div>
					<a name="07101654000012"></a><div class="hs_Para">We had, I hope,
a good discussion on Second Reading and in the Programming
Sub-Committee when the programme motion was agreed by hon. Members. I
am pleased to see that, perhaps as part of a new consensus of
government, the hon. Members for Broxbourne, for Ruislip-Northwood and
for Kettering are sitting on the Government Benches, and I look forward
to their votes with the Government on the matter. I am sure that the
hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood, who has the Whip, will not feel at
all compromised by those matters in due course.</div>
					<a name="07101654000013"></a><div class="hs_Para">On Second Reading the hon. and
learned Member for Harborough made some valid points that he will
consider in Committee. As I recall, he unfairly declared the Bill to be
rather like a plum-duff. Perhaps because of my working class
background, I did not eat many plum-duffs in my childhood, but I am
sure that it will prove to be a satisfactory meal for us all during the
course of the debate.</div>
					<a name="07101654000014"></a><div class="hs_Para">The programme motion provides
two full days for oral evidence, which is a new concept. This is the
first opportunity that I have had, during the 20 or so Bills that I
have taken through as a Minister or Whip, to see this new operation
working, and I genuinely look forward to seeing how we can help to
support the passage of the Bill and get some views from members of the
Committee. I am particularly looking forward to working with my
colleagues the Under-Secretary of State for Justice, my hon. Friend the
Member for Liverpool, Garston and the Under-Secretary of State for the
Home Department, my hon. Friend the Member for Gedling. We will be
giving evidence very shortly to the Committee on those
matters.</div>
					<a name="07101654000015"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is
provision in the programme motion for nine other witnesses to give
evidence to the Committee to help us with out deliberations on the
Bill. As Members will see, the Magistrates Association, the Probation
Boards Association, the police, Stonewall, Liberty, the Local
Government Association, the Youth Justice Board and the prisons and
probation ombudsman will all give evidence.</div>
					<a name="07101654000016"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should inform the Committee
that my hon. Friend the Member for Tooting and the hon. Member for
Ruislip-Northwood have discussed whether we can add additional
witnesses, and particular mention was made of the need to include the
Evangelical Alliance to give representations to the Committee on some
clauses that will certainly create discussion and have already elicited
an interesting level of correspondence to hon. Members. I am happy to
agree to that suggestion if the Committee so wishes. If so, I will
bring back a motion either this afternoon or on Thursday morning that
will add the Evangelical Alliance to the list of witnesses and allow
them to make representations accordingly.</div>
					<a name="07101654000017"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also offer my personal
welcome to my hon. Friends the Members for Ealing, Southall and for
Sedgefield. My hon. Friend will know that it has been a considerable
time since a Member for Sedgefield last sat on a Committee of this
nature. I know that both hon. Members will make valid contributions
and, I hope, will view this as a valuable experience in coming to grips
with some of the day-to-day matters of scrutiny in the House.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column4" />Column number: 4</div>
					<a name="07101654000018"></a><div class="hs_Para">After we have taken oral
evidence, the programme motion provides for 12 sittings for the usual,
detailed, clause-by-clause consideration of the Bill. Because the
Bill&#146;s carry-over motion for the House has already been approved
and the Gracious Speech will take place on 6 November, we will take a
break for Prorogation and resume on 20 November, with the current end
date of 29 November for the completion of the Committee&#146;s work.
While that is a relatively short amount of time, I hope that the
Committee will work to that timetable and will be able to detail how it
wishes to handle the Bill, according to the demands of the Opposition.
The Government are happy to go at whatever speed Opposition
Members&#151;both official Opposition Members and the hon. Members
for Cambridge and for Somerton and Frome&#151;wish to
participate.</div>
					<a name="07101654000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
assist the scrutiny of the Bill, I wrote to you yesterday, Sir
Nicholas, giving details of amendments for consideration in Committee
that have been tabled before you today. I can give an
assurance&#151;I know that this is an issue with which you have some
concerns&#151;that, whenever possible, I will give as much notice as
possible to the Committee of any Government amendments that may come
forward. There are still some outstanding policy issues that my right
hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Justice and Lord Chancellor gave
notice of on Second Reading. We will deal with those, prior to the
tabling in Committee, as soon as possible after the drafting
instructions have been completed, so that hon. Members have an

may help all members of the Committee if I advise them that we have
divided the legislation broadly into select parts for myself and my
colleagues to deal with. Parts 1 and 2 of the Bill will be dealt with
largely by me; parts 3 to 6 of the Bill will be taken by my hon. Friend
the Under-Secretary of State for Justice; and my hon. Friend the
Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department will lead on the Home
Office provisions contained in parts 7 to

							<b class="B">Mr.
Edward Garnier</b> (Harborough) (Con): I join the Minister in
welcoming you, Sir Nicholas, and your colleague,
Mr.O&#146;Hara, as Chairmen, both of the evidence sessions
and of the main Bill Committee, starting next week. I also welcome the
Minister and his ministerial colleagues. I have done business with two
of them, but not with the Under-Secretary of State for Justice, and I
look forward to dealing with her arguments as we
progress.</div>
					<a name="07101654000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">I, too, join
the Minister in welcoming the two new Members of Parliament to the
Committee. They are under no disadvantage whatever, because we are all
new to this procedure. Whether it is any use we will 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column5" />Column number: 5</div>shortly discover. I have some private doubts as to the usefulness of the
arrangement&#151;I say that these are private doubts because we are
in Committee, so no one is listening&#151;because the Public Bill
Committee starts next week and there is, therefore, very little time
between the closing of the evidence sessions on Thursday and the
beginning of the Committee on Tuesday, for the Government to do
anything about the evidence that they have
received.</div>
					<a name="07101654000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">It would be
ridiculous and unduly cynical of me to suggest that that was the entire
point of the exercise and that this was a release valve system to allow
outside bodies to think that they are having some input into the
construction of the pudding, and for the Government to doff their cap
to democracy, then move on and do precisely as they always intended to
do. We shall see; I know that the Minister of State, Ministry of
Justice is a man of immense good will and will seek to accommodate the
criticisms, be they constructive or otherwise, that emanate from my
party&#146;s benches and those of the Liberal Democrats during the
course of proceedings. Needless to say, I am pleased that he is
contemplating, through discussions between the hon. Member for Tooting
and my hon. Friend the Member for Ruislip-Northwood, adducing more
evidence during the course of proceedings, namely from the Evangelical
Alliance.</div>
					<a name="07101654000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">I made some
suggestions to the Government in the summer about witnesses whom I
thought were appropriate for this hearing. I cannot understand it, but,
either the letter must have got lost or they did not find my
suggestions entirely happy ones. I would have thought that it would
have been useful in such a Bill to have heard evidence from, if not the
Lord Chief Justice, perhaps his deputy, Sir Igor Judge, and from
representatives from the council of circuit judges. That is, the Crown
court judges, who have to deal, along with the magistrates, from whom
we are hearing, with the bulk of first instance criminal
cases.</div>
					<a name="07101654000319"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.45
am</div>
					<a name="07101654000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">I described the
Bill on First Reading as a plum-duff. I could use any other suitable
metaphor to demonstrate that it has been pulled together without a
theme; no central argument seems to push through its core. It is simply
a collection of nice ideas, in the Government&#146;s thinking, which
have been pulled together under one title, the Criminal Justice and
Immigration Bill. It seems to me that there are a number of issues in
the Bill that should have been separated into different pieces of
legislation. That would embarrass the Government because it would take
the number of Bills from this Department and its predecessor into the
stratosphere. I do not feel that it will add to public safety or reduce
reoffending. However, we will discuss that in due
course.</div>
					<a name="07101654000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am, none the
less, content for the moment with the programme motion. I am sure that
my hon. Friends sitting on what the Minister described as the
Government Benches are merely rehearsing for what will be the
inevitable&#151;</div>

					<a name="07101654000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">Hon. Members
from all sides welcome this opportunity to expose the incompetence and
uselessness of Government legislation of any variety. We cherish, and
indeed relish, the opportunity to engage in argument, as I am sure the
hon. Member for Somerton and Frome will agree, in the most calm,
cautious, thoughtful and considered way over the next few very brief
weeks. Let us enjoy it, but let us try to produce some decent
legislation, rather than just churn out the conveyor belt of early-day
motion-style legislation, which achieves nothing except a headline in
the occasional tabloid
newspaper.</div>
					<a name="07101654000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">With those
happy remarks, on behalf of all of my parliamentary colleagues from the
official Opposition, I welcome you, Sir Nicholas, and the ministerial

							<b class="B">Mr.
David Heath</b> (Somerton and Frome) (LD): I too welcome you
to the Chair of this Committee, Sir Nicholas, along with your
co-Chairman, Mr. O&#146;Hara. I have worked with both of
you in the Chair and know that you will keep excellent order and
maintain a high level of
scrutiny.</div>
					<a name="07101654000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">There has
been a lot of talk, on Second Reading and today, about the number of
criminal justice and immigration Bills that we have dealt with. It has
been my sad misfortune, over 10 years, to have participated in most of
them. I feel that I might have heard every possible argument on
criminal justice that it is possible to adduce. The hon. and learned
Member for Harborough said that Government legislation is all useless
and incompetent. It is not all useless and incompetent; it is just
mostly useless and incompetent. Our job is to identify and promote
those parts that are not useless and incompetent and to remove some of
the surplus to another
place.</div>
					<a name="07101654000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am grateful
to the Minister and his team, who I also welcome to the Committee, for
having listened to what I said about the programme motion on Second
Reading, and for arranging an alternative to be agreed by the
House.</div>
					<a name="07101654000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">I, too, am new
to the procedure of Public Bill Committees taking evidence and I echo
some of what the hon. and learned Gentleman said. If Public Bill
Committees taking evidence is to mean anything, it is important, first,
that we hear from the people who have something that it is important
that we hear and, secondly, that we have the opportunity to deliberate
on that information to see whether it has relevance for what we do
later.</div>
					<a name="07101654000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">I must say to
the Government that it would have been far better had we not started
any of the deliberative sittings until after Prorogation. We were quite
clear that we would have evidence sessions before that. Given the
unique timing of having Prorogation in the middle, it would have been
better to have the opportunity of carefully considering the evidence
over that period, which fortuitously we have in the middle, and of
starting the line-by-line scrutiny of the Bill afterwards. If the
evidence sessions are to work, who 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column7" />Column number: 7</div>the Committee hears cannot be in the hands of the Government. I know
that there have been talks between the hon. Members for Tooting and for
Ruislip-Northwood. The hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood was kind
enough to speak to me in the Tea Room yesterday and to give me the
benefit of some of his thoughts.</div>
					<a name="07101654000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">We need a more formal
arrangement outside of the Committee, which would enable us to discuss
which witnesses it would be appropriate to call, and to take that
advice from a wider section of the Committee. When we take evidence,
the Committee does not act as a hierarchy but as a Select Committee.
Therefore it would be open for all hon. Members to suggest who might
usefully give evidence. That structure is not in place at the moment
and as a result, although I have no doubt as to the value of the
evidence that we will hear, there are certainly people whom my hon.
Friend the Member for Cambridge and I could suggest as useful
witnesses. The hon. and learned Member for Harborough has already
suggested people from the judiciary whom it would be useful to hear
from, but there is a wider spectrum of people who will be affected by
the Bill and whom we should consider.</div>
					<a name="07101654000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">Perhaps, Sir Nicholas, we can
find a way to examine the witnesses whom the Committee is to call and
to take a view on whom we would like to hear from. If the consequence
of that is that we have more evidence-taking sessions before
Prorogation, and the line-by-line scrutiny takes place after
Prorogation, to me that is no bad thing.</div>
					<a name="07101654000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are very important
matters for consideration. I am going to forswear any pudding
metaphors, but the Bill covers a wide range of issues. There is
no&#151;I think the current term is
&#147;narrative&#148;&#151;that links many of those issues, and
it is therefore important to give each and every part of the Bill our
careful scrutiny.</div>
					<a name="07101654000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are large parts of the
legislation with which I broadly agree, in principle if not in detail.
There are some areas where I will strenuously disagree with the
Minister, but that is something that the Committee will examine over
the weeks to come and I personally look forward to
it.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07101654000355"></a>The
Chairman:
						</b> May I help the Committee by responding to one or
two of the points that the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome has
raised? Of course matters relating to those witnesses who come before
the Committee can be discussed and agreed upon across the House,
outside the Committee. Such matters must then be put to the Programming
Sub-Committee which would endorse any other proposals. The Programming
Sub-Committee would then report to this Committee, which, as a whole,
could agree upon and endorse its recommendations. There is an
opportunity for flexibility and I hope that that gives some
reassurance. If the Minister would like to intervene at this stage I am
happy for him to do so.</div>
					<a name="07101654000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07101654000356"></a>Mr.
Hanson:
						</b> I should like to respond to some of the points
raised as I would not want the Committee to take all of them at face
value. There is a strong Government defence for some of those
issues.</div>
					<a name="07101654000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">First, I say
to the hon. and learned Member for Harborough that any witness who
gives evidence to the Committee will have the opportunity to raise
points 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column8" />Column number: 8</div>with the Government, the Opposition and individual Labour Members, in
order to influence the Bill&#146;s progress. Some issues may be
raised during evidence sessions that we are not able to act upon during
the Bill&#146;s initial consideration. However, the hon. and learned
Gentleman will know that there is not only the Committee stage, there
is also Report, proceedings in the other place, and Third
Reading&#151;there is a whole range of mechanisms through which we
can absorb the views that are put. If the Government and hon. Members
believe that the points raised are valid, we will consider and accept
them.</div>
					<a name="07101654000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07101654000357"></a>Mr.
Garnier:
						</b>
						<b class="B"> </b>My main concern is that the evidence
session is timetabled to finish this Thursday and the Public Bill
Committee to start next Tuesday. Would it not be more sensible to allow
a period of reflection between the end of the evidence sessions and the
beginning of the Public Bill Committee? If one started the Bill
Committee after the start of the new Session, the Government would have
the advantage. I am not suggesting that they would necessarily reach
any different conclusions&#151;that would be a hope too
far&#151;but they would at least have the opportunity of being seen
to have that time to reflect on the evidence. Therefore, my gentle
suggestion is that Ministers spend next week at the Ministry of Justice
and the Home Office reflecting on what they have heard this week rather
than going through the line-by-line discussion of the
Bill.</div>
					<a name="07101654000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07101654000358"></a>Mr.
Hanson:
						</b> I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
suggestion. However, that suggestion was not put to the Programming
Sub-Committee or indeed to the usual channels before their discussions.
I commended the programme motion before the Committee today. I say to
the hon. and learned Gentleman that the purpose of these evidence
sessions, as outlined by the Leader of the House, is to ensure that we
have some wider debate on such points.</div>
					<a name="07101654000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will make two other quick
points. There was a suggestion that the Opposition had not been
consulted about the individuals who form the Committee and that the
hon. and learned Gentleman&#146;s letter had got lost in the post. He
will know that I wrote to him about such matters before the recess, and
he will know that my hon. Friend the Member for Tooting discussed the
matter with the official Opposition. He will also know, if he looks at
his letter and file, that as a result of his representations, the
Police Federation and the Probation Boards Association have been added
to the list of witnesses for the Committee in the programme motion. The
time available to debate the programme motion prevents me from going
any further now.</div>
					<a name="07101654000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. and learned Gentleman will know that we also approached the
judiciary on his suggestion to see if they wished to participate in
evidence session. The judiciary declined to take part because of the
party political nature of some of the discussions that might take
place. He will reflect on the fact that we have considered such matters
and, in doing so, have accepted some of his suggestions. I am very
happy to do that because my hon. Friend the Member for Tooting was
exemplary in the way that he held discussions with colleagues
beforehand, as indeed were my officials, to ensure that we had a full
replication of the wishes of the Committee.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column9" />Column number: 9</div>
					<a name="07101654000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would say the same, without
being too hasty, with regard to the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome.
The same discussions were held with the official Opposition. My hon.
Friend assures me that he has had discussions with the Liberal
Democrats in relation to the witnesses and the Select Committee aspect
of the Bill. I have been assured by him that the Liberal Democrats did
not propose one single witness to attend this evidence session. I am
very relaxed about that. At the end of the day, we are a Committee and
we will seek evidence from individuals and individuals will put points
to the Committee. As a Minister, I and my colleagues will try to
facilitate the opportunity for individuals to put evidence in a
positive way to the Committee.</div>
					<a name="07101654000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">In final summation, I welcome
the fact that we can add the Evangelical Alliance. The programme motion
before the Committee was agreed without a Division in the Programming
Sub-Committee. If I can break confidences, there was very little
discussion at that stage about adding to the programme motion. I
commend the motion to the Committee and I hope that both the hon. and
learned Member for Harborough and the Liberal Democrats will understand
that the Government want to engage with them in a positive way. We want
to have witnesses. If there are lessons to be learned about this
process, then, certainly, we will try to learn them. However, I believe
that by trying to engage others in discussion, we have acted in an
honourable way. I hope that the programme motion reflects the wishes of
the
Committee.</div>

declare an interest as a practising criminal solicitor, particularly in
local youth courts. My first question is a general one, put on behalf
of many practitioners who often have to perform mental gymnastics in
straddling different pieces of legislation and working out which have
been implemented from the last criminal justice Act. They would want to
ask whether you really listen to and consult them. They are concerned
about the pace of legislative change, particularly in youth courts, and
wonder whether this extra Bill will deal with their concerns about that

We are trying to pull those measures together into a generic sentence
and to put in additional capability, particularly relating to
residential sentences, so that we can have a generic order through
which the court can determine what type of sentence should be
allocated. I appreciate that we continue to make changes regularly. I

								Mr.
Hanson:
							</b>
						</i> Alcohol is a very important issue, as it is a
driver of a large element of youth crime. My hon. Friend the Member for
Warrington, North (Helen Jones) raised this issue on Second Reading, as
did the Opposition. It is a point on which I want to reflect. With our
colleagues in the Department of Health and the Ministry of Justice, we
are considering whether we need to rectify that potential omission. I
will examine the matter in detail. In the event of our being able to do
so, I will consider how I reflect that in the Committee. However, from
my perspective, it is certainly a matter that we need to
address.</div>
					<a name="07101654000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">The order
covers a range of matters, including activities, supervision, programme
requirements, attendance centres, curfew, exclusion, local authority
residence, fostering, mental health, drug treatment, drug testing and a
range of others. There is potentially a gap in respect of alcohol. We
did not include it because, at that stage, we felt that it was not
appropriate, but I want to reflect on that. Without making a commitment
to the Committee, let me say that I will return to it in policy terms
in due course, if we reach
agreement.</div>
					<a name="07101654000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
reparation order is separate. It has been said that there is potential
to create some confusion, but I do not believe that that is so. The
reparation order is there because, in my view, reparation and
understanding the impact of the crime is central to helping to prevent
further youth crime in future. We believe that through reparation
orders we will be able to bring home to the offender some of the impact

Nick Hurd</b> (Ruislip-Northwood) (Con): First, I should like
to follow up on the question that the hon. and learned Member for
Medway (Mr. Marshall-Andrews) asked the Secretary of State
for Justice on Second Reading, which was what exactly this youth
rehabilitation order package contains that is not available to the
courts today. The hon. and learned Gentleman did not get an answer. I
should be grateful if the Minister gave the Committee an answer,
together with some sense of the evidence and data supporting the view
that the courts are crying out for this new generic
package.</div>
					<a name="07101654000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, I
should like to know about the resources available for some of the
requirements. The evidence from the Centre for Crime and Justice
Studies, on analysing community orders for adults, is that some of the
requirements, particularly in relation to attendance 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column12" />Column number: 12</div>centres and drug treatment, are not widely used because they are not
widely available. I should like to get a sense of what resource back-up
is being considered to make such things more widely
available.</div>
					<a name="07101654000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">Thirdly,
under clause 1(3)(b), as I read it, there is increased provision for
the state effectively to take people&#146;s children away. Given the
sorry track record of the state as a parent, which has been described
by a former Home Secretary of this Administration as a scandal, will
the ministerial team assure the Committee about the underlying
intentions in the Bill and say what evidence there is to support this
apparently chilling provision? Most people&#151;certainly, my
constituents&#151;would want the state to be focused more on making
parents more responsible for their children, rather than taking them
away.</div>

								Mr.
Hanson:
							</b>
						</i> I am grateful to Mr. Hurd for
raising those points. I shall respond first to the point about the
question that my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Medway asked on
Second Reading. The requirements under the youth rehabilitation order
include the range of requirements that I have just mentioned in
response to Mr. Burrowes: activities, supervision, unpaid
work, programme requirements, curfew, exclusion, residence orders,
fostering, mental health and drug treatment and so on, most of which
are currently in place. The key new element in the youth rehabilitation
order is the requirement to participate in specified activities or
residential exercises for up to 90 days. We are including in the order
a provision whereby the so-called responsible officer under the
Bill&#151;for example, a member of a youth offending team or, indeed,
a probation officer&#151;could recommend, as part of the sentence
options to the court, that an individual participate in a residential
activity for up to 90 days. The work that has been undertaken on those
issues shows that there is great potential to stop reoffending in
enabling people to feel part of a team, learn new skills and be
involved in that way. If the Committee so wishes, I am happy to supply
further evidence of the nature of the youth rehabilitation order. I
shall circulate some further information to the Committee in due
course.</div>
					<a name="07101654000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">All these
measures have considerable resource implications and we obviously need
to examine them in detail within the budget of the probation service.
In the whole of my budget responsibilities, with my hon. Friend the
Under-Secretary of State for Justice, the hon. Member for Liverpool,
Garston, I have responsibilities for secure accommodation in respect of
prisons and for probation. We will try to put any savings that we can
make by stopping people going into custody into community-based
penalties. I want to see greater use of such penalties as well as
greater use of measures to keep young people out of custody, and I need
to manage the budget accordingly. I cannot give the Committee figures
today, but when we debate such matters, I should be happy to provide
additional information about the costs. There will already be a
training cost for the new order, should it be agreed by the Committee,
and we have budgeted for it&#151;from memory, we have budgeted about
&#163;600,000 for training. I shall certainly give consideration
during our proceedings in Committee to setting out in more detail the
actual management of the probation and other relevant elements of the
order.</div>

have come through the care system&#151;they have been looked-after

suspended prison sentence until you have worked out whether that
offence, that offender and the circumstances surrounding that
particular set of facts merit a custodial punishment in the first
place. You have got to cross the custodial threshold, and it is only
when you have considered the special circumstances of the offender and
perhaps other matters that you then go back to consider whether you
should suspend that custodial sentence. It is not an alternative to a

suggested to me that a substantial number of cases where suspended
sentences were imposed were those where previously a non-custodial
sentence would have been appropriate. The figures for 2005 and 2006
show that the immediate custody rate has remained stable at 7 per
cent., whereas the usage of suspended custody orders has increased from
1 per cent. in 2005 to 3 per cent. in 2006. I am of the view that we

						<i class="I">

								Mr.

						</i> Yes. The purpose of clause 12 is that, in
extremely serious cases, the judiciary could examine the sentence
and&#151;after looking at potential discounts for guilty pleas, time
spent on remand and automatic discount&#151;decide whether the final
sentence that would be given was proportionate to the extreme level of
the crime committed. In the case of Sweeney, which occurred some months
ago in south Wales, clause 12 would have allowed the judge to decide
whether it was an extremely serious case and accordingly to consider
whether to increase the tariff to secure the above punishment and,
indeed, justice for the victim. Perhaps my colleague wishes to
speak&#151;</div>

						<i class="I">
							<b class="B">
								Christine
Stewart:
							</b>
						</i> I think that that is right. The clause
affects the way in which the tariff for indeterminate
sentences&#151;discretionary life sentences&#151;is currently set.
At the moment, when the court imposes a discretionary life sentence, it
must decide what period to set for punishment and deterrence. The
remainder of the sentence is effectively determined by the Parole
Board.</div>
					<a name="07101654000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">In setting the
tariff, the court considers what sentence would have been imposed were
it to have imposed a determinate sentence and what period would then be
served by the offender. It would look at the overall headline sentence
and then halve it, because the offender would only serve half of that
sentence. A discretionary life sentence, by its very nature, belongs in
the category of particularly serious offences. Such a sentence could
not be imposed unless the courts decided that it was a very serious
offence. In those cases, when the courts look at setting the tariff,
they look at guidelines. For example, in something like rape, including
rape of a child, the maximum sentence in the range set out by
sentencing guidelines is 19 years, which would be about nine and a half
years.</div>
					<a name="07101654000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the case of
a discretionary life sentence, there could be circumstances that
suggest that the offence is so serious that the equivalent determinate
sentence does not go far enough to mark the seriousness. In those rare
cases, the court would have the discretion to say that if that is the
starting point, it would not half the sentence&#151;it may reduce it
by a lesser proportion so that it could mark the seriousness of the
offence.</div>

introduced, our assessment is that the prison population would be
reduced. The notes for the Bill indicate that we expect about 25
additional places as a result of the application of this clause.
However, generally speaking, our assessment is that there will be a
reduction of approximately 1,300 prison places if all the measures are
implemented by both Houses. Each clause has different weights and
measures, but overall we expect a reduction of approximately
1,300.</div>

going back to the debate on the abolition of suspended sentences for
summary offences. I also have a point to make on clause 18 about the
relationship between the Parole Board and the Secretary of
State.</div>
					<a name="07101654000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">First, on
clause 10, how will the Government avoid the following problem if
suspended sentences are abolished for summary offences? The way in
which many sentencers think about the decision before them is to think
first, &#147;In or out? Is this an offence that requires imprisonment
or not?&#148; After they have thought &#147;In or out?&#148;,
they think, &#147;Suspend or not?&#148; That is the structure of
the decision. If that is how sentencers think, and if the ability to
suspend is taken away, they may decide &#147;in&#148;, and then,
with no powers to suspend, we therefore end up with more people in
prison. That is the problem. Perhaps you could answer that question and
then I will come back to my other
question.</div>

						</i> There is a difference of view on the likely
response to clause 10. This afternoon we will hear from the Magistrates
Association, which holds a similar view to that of the hon. Member for
Cambridge. Our view is that rather than up-tariffing sentences, the
measure will result in a down-tariffing to community sentences. Our
assessment is that there will be a saving of approximately 400 prison
places as a result of these measures. There is a genuine difference of
opinion. I can only give you the Government&#146;s view that faced
with that choice, sentencers will opt for a community sentence rather
than a custodial sentence. We may wish to explore as a Committee
whether sentencers share that view&#151;I suspect that the
Magistrates Association will not&#151;but that is our judgment and we
must stick with it.</div>

sentencing.</div>
					<a name="07101654000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 18
abolishes the requirement for the Secretary of State to receive a
recommendation from the Parole Board before recalling a prisoner who is

public interest to recall the offender before the Parole Board can make
a recommendation&#151;in other words in an emergency. That emergency
system will now be the overall way of doing things and the objection to
that is that it brings the Secretary of State far too much into the
sentencing process. The Government have already had severe legal
problems with the question of the independence of the Parole Board.
Will not clause 18 make that situation worse? Does it not in effect put
the Secretary of State in the position of a judge? It violates the

decisions in all other cases are currently taken directly by the
Secretary of State. Those provisions were introduced in the 2003 Act.
Clause 18 simply ensures that in even more serious cases, such as when
somebody is serving an indeterminate sentence and is likely to be
dangerous, the process can act quickly so that the offender can be
recalled. The Parole Board then focuses on the review of that decision
and takes decisions about release, but it is treating such offenders in
the same way as others. It would be slightly odd if it took longer to
recall an offender who has been given a life sentence&#151;an
indeterminate sentence&#151;than to recall an offender who has been
given a determinate

We have said in our proposals that we believe it is important to
clarify the matter. We try to ensure that we pass community sentences
rather than up-tariff suspended sentences&#151;with due respect to
magistrates&#151;because such sentences are often breached. That
ultimately means that people go to prison, and the potential for
preventing reoffending is that much more difficult. However, these are
matters for debate. I can only set out our position. We believe that it
is important that we try to encourage community sentences rather than
suspended sentences for such offences. In so doing, we are saving
prison places, and helping to prevent reoffending. Those are matters
that we will debate in due
course.</div>

								Christine

						</i> It is perhaps worth adding that about 40 per
cent. of suspended sentence orders have been imposed in respect of
summary only offences. That raises a question about their use because
such offences are less serious. We are saying that in 40 per cent. of
these cases the court has concluded that the custody threshold has been
crossed. As the Minister has already said, if you look at the custody
rates and trends, it looks as if many of these orders are being drawn
from the community order. They are offences which, in the past, would
have received a community

						</i> No. This is a decision that the court is
taking about whether, in this particular case with the offence that has
been committed, the offence is serious enough to have crossed the
custody threshold. Courts have to take that decision in order to impose
a suspended sentence order. Yet if you look back at the number of
people receiving such orders in comparison with the immediate custody
trend&#151;that has not changed&#151;it would seem to suggest that
the custody threshold has dropped because these were people who were
getting custody and now they are getting suspended custody. However, it
has not dropped. Therefore, it suggests that the numbers are being
drawn from people who would otherwise have got community

court had to say, &#147;We have tried non-custodial and community
sentences, but you keep on doing this. The only thing that we can do is
notch it up one more rung of the ladder. We will send you to prison,
but suspend the sentence. If you make a mistake again, you will go
inside.&#148; Most people who end up in front of the courts and are
given a custodial sentence, subject to the most serious offences, have
been through the courts before and the courts have decided that they
are running out of options and that custody is the next stop. A

streamlines the existing scheme by removing a number of restrictions on

						<i class="I"> </i>Not in that respect. I knew

we are replacing a drafting that is already there and that has caused a
lot of concern, we get it right.</div>
					<a name="07101654000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government still do not
consider it right that the Court of Appeal should be obliged to quash
convictions in cases where there is no doubt as to the
appellant&#146;s guilt, with certain caveats. As the Secretary of
State said on Second Reading, we want to ensure that the Court of
Appeal has a discretion to quash in a case where it is satisfied as to
the guilt of the appellant but where there has been serious misconduct
by the prosecuting authorities. That was one of the main concerns that
came through in the representations; the Mullen-type cases are the ones
that are often quoted.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column23" />Column number: 23</div>
					<a name="07101654000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">We want to ensure that that
discretion is there, so that judges can make absolutely clear, by
quashing convictions even of people who are clearly guilty, their
abhorrence for extreme wrongdoing by the state in those sorts of
circumstances. That is certainly something that we wish to do, but we
believe that there are still examples where an appellant is guilty and
a conviction should not be quashed, for example in respect of purely
procedural matters.</div>
					<a name="07101654000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">An example that springs to mind
is Regina <i class="I">v.</i> Coutts, which the hon. and learned Gentleman and
the lawyers on the Committee might be aware of. In that case, a chap
who was engaged in a violent and sexually related strangulation of a
young woman had his murder conviction quashed following the fact that
the jury was not given the opportunity to consider a manslaughter
verdict, even though no one, including the defence or the Court of
Appeal, which considered the case subsequently, thought it appropriate
that the jury should consider such a verdict.</div>
					<a name="07101654000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">So there is a narrow range of
potential cases where we believe that, if the defendant&#146;s guilt
is not in doubt and there is not some wrongdoing or a serious breach of

quash a conviction where guilt is not in

the Court of Appeal currently works? I think that the Court of Appeal
has the power to use the proviso&#151;Mr. Howarth tells me
that that is the technical term&#151;in certain circumstances. Am I
not right in thinking that the Court of Appeal can already take account
of mere procedural irregularities if there is a pressing case for
upholding the conviction? Are you not allowing your mind and your

						</i> We have drafts of drafts. Of course, there are
discussions and consultations going on about precisely how best to
achieve this aim, on the basis of what the Secretary of State has said.
I certainly hope to be able to provide a paper to indicate our thinking
early next week, in time for the consideration by the Committee of the
clause in question. I hope to produce a draft absolutely as soon as we
possibly can for the Committee to see. We are endeavouring to produce
it. Because this part of the Bill will be reached rather early in the
time that the Committee has for consideration, it might not be possible
to produce it for then, but there will be a paper that sets out in
detail the Government&#146;s thinking in draft, and we certainly hope
at the least to have produced it on Report. I understand that that is
not entirely satisfactory to hon. Members, but it is the best that I
can offer today. We are working very hard to ensure that we do
that.</div>

						</b> I have just a couple of questions. It seems a very
odd way of demonstrating the intention of giving additional discretion
to the Court of Appeal by introducing a clause which, as it originally
stated, clearly restricts the discretion of the Court of Appeal. How on
earth did we have the genesis of clause 26 in its current
form?</div>

						</i> To be honest, I am not in a position to answer
that today, because I was not in the Department when it was devised, so
I do not have to hand the background knowledge to tell the hon.
Gentleman exactly how it was devised. He will be aware, as other hon.
Members will be, that concern was expressed, both inside and outside
the Department, about the general signal that convictions are being
quashed for very serious offences that have been admitted to, and where
guilty pleas have been given, or guilt has been found by the courts.
Appeals have then been held on what would appear to an ordinary member
of the public to be a simple procedural irregularity that does not even
necessarily imply wrongdoing, and then those people have had their
convictions completely quashed and quite often went free with
compensation.</div>
					<a name="07101654000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is
the concern that gave rise to the policy formulation, and we are all
aware of that. There was a consultation document that sought views. All
that I can say today is that, as far as I am aware, this document was
drawn up with a view&#151;which the Secretary of State has since made
clear on Second Reading&#151;that it is currently drawn too widely,
and that we will seek to change it. I will, as I have said, produce
some indication in much greater detail of our thinking in terms of the
drafting next week, and will produce the new draft as soon as I
possibly
can.</div>

Heath:
						</b> May I put it to the Minister that the Bill is not
drawn too widely; it is simply wrong. It addresses an issue where the
Government have provided no evidence that there is an issue to address.
Can she provide the Committee with a list of the cases that gave the
cause for concern? She talks about Mullen-type cases, but I know of
only one Mullen-type 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column25" />Column number: 25</div>case, and that is Mullen. Presumably, the Department has a definitive
list of other cases that gave rise to concern. The Committee is
entitled to know what those cases were, and in what way the court
misinterpreted its present discretion, and
<i class="I">[</i>
						<i class="I">Interruption.</i>
						<i class="I">]</i>&#151;and, as was said from a
sedentary position; we are all sedentary at the moment, but from a
particularly sedentary position by Mr.
Garnier&#151;expressed its concern about any fettering of its
discretion. Can the Government prove that they have come up with some
other issues in the letter that has been sent to you, Sir Nicholas,
from the Government, that might represent useful additions to the terms
of the Court of Appeal, and which could replace this section? Until I
hear a rationale for clause 26 in its present form, I am not sure that
the Minister needs to make strenuous efforts to redraft it, because it
addresses an issue that very few of us see as a current problem. I hope
that if she is not ready in Committee to produce a new draft and table
it as an amendment in regular time, she will accept an amendment to
leave out clause 26 in Committee, because the present clause 26 is
simply unsatisfactory.</div>

						</i> I do not think, after what the Secretary of
State said on Second Reading, that I am disagreeing with him about the
fact that the present clause 26 is unsatisfactory. I am happy to come
forward next week with some more information about what has given rise
to the concerns that ended up in the current draft of clause 26. It is
perfectly open to him to argue that the best way out of this issue is
to remove clause 26 altogether and to table any amendments that he
wishes. </div>
					<a name="07101654000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">For my part,
the Government are still seeking to make sure that, in a narrower range
of cases where it is absolutely clear that guilt is not in issue, those
who have been found guilty or admitted guilt, often to extremely
serious charges, are not allowed to go free simply because of a
procedural irregularity. Sometimes it is worse things, such as in the
Mullen-type case, and we want to ensure that they are not allowed to go
free on what most ordinary members of the public would see as a
technicality. While I do not argue that this will affect thousands of
cases per year, because it will not, the Government still believe that
there is a loophole to be closed. I am willing to come forward next
week with a little more detail in respect of the genesis of
this.</div>

conditional cautions is to reduce the number of the children being

alternative, robust mechanism for bringing young offenders to account,
and to address some of the causes of their behaviour. The conditions
attached to the youth conditional caution must help the rehabilitation
of the offender. I am particularly keen to see safeguards to ensure
that the youth conditional caution is approved appropriately. In
general terms, we are trying to reduce the number of people who go into
custody by putting in place an alternative to custody which will
provide rehabilitation, introduce some effective measures and help to
prevent reoffending by young

practical consequences, hopefully, will be that more trials will go

with simply not turning up and that will delay the case, that will turn
out not to be so. It will send the stronger signal that there is a
presumption that trials should go ahead, whereas at present there is a
discretion that many magistrates would exercise. Our purpose is simply

reduced the net prison population and indications are coming from your
Department that the court service will be required to make court cells
available. The police will, of course, continue under Operation
Safeguard to make available police station cells to accommodate people
who cannot fit into prison. I need to know from you whether your
statement that there will be no immediate decision to increase 18 days
to some higher number means not this week or not next week. I want to
know what &#147;immediate&#148; means. Clearly, you must have
thought about it because the real issue that is affecting our criminal
justice system day by day is the overcrowding of the custodial estate.

of which we are reviewing weekly. We have had some difficulties over
the summer, partly because of things that were outside of our

to the floods and

that we are undertaking, the measures on supply that we have undertaken
and the issues that we might need to look at in the light of the Carter

the passage of the Bill in its later stages. We may need to consider
recommendations from the Carter report that might need legislative

designated caseworkers have been able to do certain types of work in

do.</div>

enable designated caseworkers to do a much wider range of work than
they have been able to do, but under the supervision of an experienced

that is at the heart of this provision. Prior to making any appearances
or doing work in the courts, designated caseworkers undertake a
two-week course that is assessed independently by the college of law in
Nottingham. They also subsequently complete e-learning courses and have
at least 15 hours of continuing professional development per year to
keep their knowledge and skills up to date. It is intended that that
type of training should
continue.</div>

professional development to give confidence and ensure that the people
undertaking the higher level of work in the magistrates court are
properly able to do so and are properly

Cohen</b> (Leyton and Wanstead) (Lab): In relation to the
offence of possession of a single extreme pornographic image, or it
could be more than a single image, what evidence do the Government have
to show that either watching it or participating in it is harmful to
adults? I am wondering that because, in August 2006, the Government
stated:</div>
					<a name="07101654000316"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Given
the many different approaches to conducting the research and framing
the questions, as well as differences in the nature of the material
examined, we are unable, at present, to draw any definite conclusions
based on research as to the likely long term impact of this kind of
material on individuals generally, or on those who may already be
predisposed to violent or aberrant sexual behaviour.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07101654000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government subsequently
produced a rapid evidence assessment in September of this year, long
after the Bill had been published and presumably intended to back it
up, which mentioned some increased risk. It is worrying that that was
produced so late in this context. In that document, however, the
Government stated:</div>
					<a name="07101654000317"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The REA found no formal
research studies of the effects on those who participate in making
extreme
pornography.&#148;</div>

								Maria
Eagle:
							</b>
						</i> The evidence is contained in that rapid
evidence assessment which, although it did not find any formal research
studies on the effect on those who participate in making the extreme
pornography, did find that there were some harmful effects on some of
those who viewed it, particularly men who were predisposed to
aggression or had a history of sexual aggression. Therefore, the rapid
evidence assessment looked around all of the research that had been
done, rather than commissioning specific research to fill gaps in the
research, and it showed that there was cause to have concern in certain
circumstances for what is, no doubt, a smallish number of the
population who might be susceptible to their behaviour being affected
by viewing extreme pornography.</div>
					<a name="07101654000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">We must remember that when we
are talking about extreme pornography, we are talking about images at
the very top end of what most people would consider viewable. We are
not talking about the common or garden porn, of which there is much on
the internet and that it is perfectly lawful for people to possess or
make under current domestic law. The proposal would make it illegal to
download and possess images that it is already illegal to publish in
this country, rather than extend the definition of what ought to be
caught by the law.</div>
					<a name="07101654000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">The concern really arises from
the increasing trend over recent years that we should seek to prevent
harm to people, particularly children. We have changed the law in
recent years to deal with images that would be illegal if they were
published or made in this country but which now, because of changes in
technological capacity, can come into the country and be downloaded,
having been published elsewhere. Therefore, we are not seeking to
extend the current law or to change the level of porn that is allowed
to be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column32" />Column number: 32</div>published and considered lawful. We are simply seeking to deal with the
technological impact that means that such material can now be
downloaded into one&#146;s own computer, despite the fact that it
would be illegal to publish or make it in this
country.</div>

						</i> The Government are concerned about all violent
imagery and there are legislative controls on violent as well as sexual
imagery through the Obscene Publications Act 1959. There are also
regulatory controls through the British Board of Film Classification
and the Advertising Standards Authority. There is regulatory and
legislative control of such images. There has been particular concern
about explicit and extreme pornographic material produced for the
purposes of sexual arousal that also includes real or very realistic
violence. That is one reason why the BBFC will not classify violent and
abusive material in the R18 category, which is reserved for
pornographic films. There is control in respect of this
issue.</div>
					<a name="07101654000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">In this offence
and this change to the law, we are seeking to catch the extreme end of

difference on precisely where the line should be drawn, most members of
the Committee and most ordinary members of the public would see
necrophilia and bestiality as something that society ought to
disapprove of and to think about controlling images of. While there
might be points of difference about precisely where the line should be
drawn for some of the other imagery, this is a practical issue. I do
not think that too many members of the public would disapprove of our
attempt to catch the most extreme end of the

assume that this is the correct time to make reference to the

is what is sometimes referred to as Megan&#146;s law or
Sarah&#146;s law, for which the enthusiasm of the Government waxes
and wanes. Is what the Ministers are introducing effectively a
Megan&#146;s law or Sarah&#146;s law? Will it provide information,
on almost a free basis, on the whereabouts of convicted paedophiles in

						<i class="I">
							<b class="B">
								Mr.
Coaker:

						</i> This is a very important part of the Bill.
The Government have arrived at the proposals as the result of a huge
consultation with people on the one hand from children&#146;s
charities, who did not want 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column33" />Column number: 33</div>anything that approached any sort of disclosure to the general public,
to people on the other side, who thought that there should be full and
open disclosure under any circumstances. With the support of
children&#146;s charities and law enforcers, the Government have
reached a coalescing of opinion around the idea that, with some
controlled disclosure, you can defend the rights of individuals while
at the same time enhancing public protection. It will not be a
Megan&#146;s law with automatic
disclosures.</div>

						<i class="I">
							<b class="B">
								Mr.
Coaker:
							</b>
						</i> There is a presumption regarding the people
within the multi-agency public protection arrangements. If they believe
that it would enhance public protection to disclose to organisations
and people that there is a sex offender in their area, there is a
presumption that they will do so. There is a duty on them to consider
that. There is not a presumption that they automatically have to inform
people. If they decide not to do so, they must record that decision so
that they are accountable for it being made. That does not satisfy
people at the extremes, but in my view, and in the view of the majority
of the people who have supported this measure, from children&#146;s
charities like the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Children on the one hand to Sara Payne on the other, it is a way of
moving the debate
forward.</div>
					<a name="07101654000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">Alongside
that particular arrangement, we are going to pilot
disclosures&#151;these will not form part of the Bill&#151;where
individual people can register a child protection interest. Again, the
responsible authorities will have a duty to consider whether they
should disclose such information and whether doing so would be in the
interests of the child. I would suggest that this is an extremely
important area of the Bill. I look forward to hon. Members from all
sides contributing and adding to the debate. I know that hon. Members
sometimes question consultation, but this consultation took place over
almost a year. People started from polarised positions and we have now
arrived not at a compromise that is a fudge, but at one that allows us
to see how well this operates, and whether it enhances child
protection. If that is the case, we can learn from it and move
on.</div>

						</i> I shall leave the point about homophobia to
Maria Eagle and I shall deal with the question on prostitution. The
proposals on prostitution in this legislation are very important. I
will say a little about them&#151;you mentioned
rehabilitation.</div>
					<a name="07101654000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Bill does two things of immense importance. First, it takes the term
&#147;common prostitute&#148; out of the law, which is something
that all the organisations which we work with have been very pleased
about, and something that in 2007 is a positive step forward. Secondly,
although soliciting and loitering remain offences, the inclusion of a
rehabilitative penalty in the Bill ensures that we have a measure that
we can use to help street workers to get out of the circumstances they
are in. Rather than fining street workers, or dealing with them in a
broad sense, we will try to look at their circumstances, their
situation in terms of employment, housing and all those other
things&#151;often drug addiction&#151;and we will try and work with
them to do something about it.</div>
					<a name="07101654000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">We also want to tackle the
issue of demand. With respect to street workers, we have done a lot
with kerb-crawling campaigns. The Sexual Offences Act 2003 clarified
the law and raised the legal age from 16 to 18, making it an offence to
purchase sex with anybody under the age of 18.</div>
					<a name="07101654000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">Trafficking is a huge issue. I
have made this point time and time again: if somebody knowingly has sex
with a trafficked person, the trafficked person is not freely
consenting to that sexual act. In my view that is rape, and as many
people as possible should be charged with rape if they
knowingly&#151;I include that word&#151;have sex with somebody who
is trafficked.</div>
					<a name="07101654000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">With
regard to the Swedish model, I am sure that all members of the
Committee know that it is an offence to pay for sex in Sweden. That was
introduced in 1999. The evidence is unclear as to whether that has led
to a drop in prostitution, or whether it has pushed it underground,
leading to an increase in off-street prostitution. We need more work to
be done on the matter to see whether we can learn anything from it.
However, one of the things that has happened has been an increase in
internet advertising to do with prostitution. That perhaps suggests
that the matter has simply been pushed underground. However, the
evidence is very patchy and it is difficult to get full information
about what the impact has been. I take the point. I can see you waving
at me, Sir Nicholas, and I will stop at this point. We must always look
at whether we can learn from examples from other countries. The
Government have made no decision about
that.</div>

hatred, we now have provision in law to outlaw incitement to hatred of
particular groups on the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column35" />Column number: 35</div>grounds of race or religious belief. We believe that it is right to
extend that protection to people who are homosexual&#151;to make it
unlawful to incite hatred of people who are homosexual. Let me make it
clear that we do not intend to place too onerous a burden on freedom of
speech. We realise that we must have a balance between protecting
homosexual people from hate crime and freedom of expression. It is not
our purpose to try to interfere with people expounding or setting out
their own religious beliefs. It is not our intention to prohibit
discussion or debate about the perceived rights or wrongs of
homosexuality, or to stop comedians from making jokes, but it is our
intention to outlaw incitement to hatred. That is what the provision
will do. We will bring forward the draft provision in time for the
Committee to consider it and at that time it will be possible to have a

judge or a High Court judge in the criminal courts, and yet you think
that it is appropriate that such applications should be made to the
magistrates.</div>

						</i> We certainly do because the original
specified offences that the hon. and learned Member for Harborough has
referred to will have been dealt with by the criminal courts as
appropriate. We are talking about an individual who is post-conviction,
whose term of imprisonment&#151;their licence period&#151;has come
to an end, and yet the assessment of the chief police officer
is that they are still a risk, notwithstanding the fact that they have
completed the sentences that the criminal courts have given them. In
those circumstances it would be appropriate for the chief police
officer to apply to the magistrates
court.</div>

law. The criminal law says that it is an offence to commit murder or to
solicit murder. Why is that not
adequate?</div>

						</i> Because we are seeking to prevent that. With
respect to the hon. and learned Gentleman, we are trying to use civil
orders to prevent future harm, whereas the debate between us is that he
would use the criminal law to deal with somebody who does something
wrong. We are trying to interdict into that period so that somebody
does not do something wrong in the first place, as well as using the
criminal law as a deterrent.</div>
