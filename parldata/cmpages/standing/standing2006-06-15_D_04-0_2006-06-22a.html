(2)'.</div><a name="06062247000027"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062247000273"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs (Vera
Baird):</b> This is my first opportunity to welcome you to the
Chair, Mr. Illsley, and to tell you how pleased I am that such an
experienced Chairman will be presiding over my first attempt at helping
a Bill through Committee.</div>
<a name="06062247000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">The. Member for Hornchurch
(James Brokenshire) had put forward his argument on the amendments.
Under the clause, anyone who wishes to use a sensitive name in their
company&#146;s name must apply to the Secretary of State, but to
support that application he must ask any public body or Department
whose sensitive words he wishes to use in his name to comment on his
application. The hon. Gentleman feels that if a public body does not
reply to such a request within 30 days, the presumption should be that
it does not object to its words being used.</div>
<a name="06062247000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have already said how
sympathetic I am to people who get held back by bureaucracy, but the
point of the clause is to prevent people from being misled by a company
having a name that wrongly suggests a connection with a public body.
The amendment would change the balance of the clause. Where a person is
looking for exceptional permission to be allowed to use these sensitive
words, public protection remains the most important thing. The
immediate mischief is that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column109" />Column number: 110</div>it would be possible to send in the application for a response in a way
that made it unlikely to get one back, perhaps by sending it to the
wrong part of the relevant organisation or by couching it in a long
letter about something else.</div>
<a name="06062247000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me set out what I think is
a greater mischief. The process in the clause is in two stages. First,
the person who wants the name writes to the body that holds the words
he wants to use. Then he sends any response that comes back to the
Secretary of State. The words &#147;any response&#148; specifically
envisage that there may be no response. That is clear. It is the
Secretary of State who is ultimately responsible for approving the
name, and although he would be assisted if there were a response from
the public body, the lack of response under the terms of the clause is
not fatal to the
application.</div><a name="06062247000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are
talking about words like &#147;charity&#148;,
&#147;nurse&#148;, &#147;police&#148;, &#147;Her
Majesty&#148;, which it would be extremely advantageous for someone
to use in their company title to try to show some connection with
totally virtuous organisations. What goes a little further than the
mischief I have described is if the application has been with the
public body for 30 days, and there is automatically a deeming of no
objection and therefore approval, it would be extremely difficult for
the Secretary of State to refuse because the public body that the
provision was trying to protect would have raised no objection and
would have been deemed to approve. How could he differ from that and
not be subject to judicial review for being unreasonable?</div>
<a name="06062247000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">The consequence, I fear, is
that as we are talking about a public body that has had the application
for 30 days and not responded, it probably has not considered it and
the Secretary of State will not be able to do so. Consequently, public
protection from the mischief would be seriously challenged by such a
deeming provision.</div>
<a name="06062247000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">The other specific difficulty
that could be envisaged is that although at the end of the 30 days no
response had been received and the body was deemed to have approved, a
long and detailed objection might be received the day afterwards from a
public body to the proposed use of its name and the Secretary of State
would not be entitled to take it into account. That would be most
undesirable, bearing in mind that the purpose is to protect the
public.</div><a name="06062247000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those
are good reasons to invite the hon. Gentleman to think again. We hope
that he will feel able to withdraw the amendment. I repeat that the
Government will not tolerate bureaucratic inefficiency. Public bodies
will be expected to respond as quickly as they realistically can. None
the less, the emphasis has to be on protecting the public and not on
facilitating people skilfully to get around the
provision.</div>
<a name="06062247000035"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06062247000274"></a><b class="B">Keith
Vaz</b> (Leicester, East) (Lab): Does the Minister know how
long it takes for public bodies to respond? What gave rise to the
concern that made the provision
necessary?</div><a name="06062247000036"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062247000275"></a>Vera
Baird:</b> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for raising that
point. I understand that it is a completely new provision, and I invite
the Opposition to comment on it. However, it was not supported or
buttressed by any pressure group&#151;not by the Law Society or the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column110" />Column number: 111</div>Institute of Directors, the company secretaries of major companies or
any list of people who might have been expected to respond if it was
likely to be a problem. It is not clear to me where the thrust of the
provision is coming from, and we have not received any
submissions.</div><a name="06062247000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall
probably serve the Committee better by setting out other words that
could be sensitive&#151;words that could imply national or
international pre-eminence. For instance, the word
&#147;British&#148; will need a significant amount of protection,
and I see that Opposition members agree. Approval of that word in a
company name would depend on how it was to be used. The Secretary of
State would normally expect the company to be British owned&#151;a
realistic thing to think&#151;and it would probably be necessary to
show that the company was pre-eminent in its field in order to merit
that epithet and description. The company would need to show that it
was pre-eminent by providing supporting evidence from an independent
source, such as a Department or trade association.</div>
<a name="06062247000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">The same goes for the words
&#147;English&#148; and &#147;England&#148;, and
&#147;Scotland&#148; and &#147;Scottish&#148;.
&#147;Wales&#148; and &#147;Welsh&#148; would probably fall
into the same category. It would be hard it distinguish them in any
realistic way from &#147;British.&#148; The same applies to
&#147;Ireland&#148; and &#147;Irish&#148;. If a company wanted
to use one of those words as a prefix to its name, similar conditions
would have to apply as apply to the word &#147;British&#148;, and
approval would have to be given for such use. The same would apply if
the word were used as a suffix.</div>
<a name="06062247000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">It will usually be possible to
get approval only if the person can show that the company has its main
business in the country concerned. It would be rather odd for a company
to call itself &#147;Welsh&#148; if its factory was in my
constituency of Redcar. I cannot think of a company in Redcar with
&#147;Welsh&#148; or &#147;Wales&#148; in its name; that was
just an example of how curious it would
be.</div><a name="06062247000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">One cannot rule
out, however, the chance that somebody might want to use the word
&#147;Welsh,&#148; perhaps to describe Welsh cakes or something of
that kind, even if they are not made in Wales, but I imagine that one
would have to go a long way before being able to register
&#147;Welsh&#148; in the name of a company, if the business was in
Redcar, or in the constituency of the hon. Member for Reigate (Mr.
Blunt). For instance, in Reigate, it would be odd to call a company
&#147;Welsh&#148;.</div><a name="06062247000041"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06062247000276"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Crispin Blunt</b> (Reigate) (Con): I am extremely grateful to
the hon. and learned Lady for replying comprehensively to the
amendments. However, I am slightly concerned that if Ministers are
going to go into such exquisite detail, the Committee will struggle to
get through the thousand or so amendments that we are likely to
consider, as well as the 925
clauses.</div><a name="06062247000042"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062247000277"></a>Vera
Baird:</b> I know that the hon. Gentleman rightly, and
compatibly with his job, has his hands on the accelerator and brakes in
the Committee. I can assure him that I am quite succinct
sometimes.</div><a name="06062247000043"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062247000278"></a>The
Minister for Industry and the Regions (Margaret Hodge):</b>
Does my hon. and learned Friend agree that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column111" />Column number: 112</div>we would make better progress if so many amendments were not identical
to those discussed in another place? They were given considerable
airing there, and little value is added by reconsidering
them.</div><a name="06062247000044"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062247000279"></a>Vera
Baird:</b> As ever, my right hon. Friend makes a strong and
important
argument.</div><a name="06062247000045"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06062247000280"></a><b class="B">Paul
Farrelly</b> (Newcastle-under-Lyme) (Lab): I want to welcome
the new approach outlined by the Opposition. Will my hon. and learned
Friend join me in hoping that, throughout the course of the Committee,
Opposition filibustering, nay hair-splitting, will be kept to a
minimum?</div><a name="06062247000046"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062247000281"></a>Vera
Baird:</b> Hair-splitting sounds like a cruel
sport.</div><a name="06062247000047"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062247000282"></a>Keith
Vaz:</b> To take us back to the substance of the
Under-Secretary&#146;s comments, she made an important point about
names because it causes a great deal of concern. Have Ministers seen
any evidence of abuse by a company registering as British, with the
word &#147;British&#148; in its name, but which subsequently was
discovered not to be British, and to have no such connections, such as
the fictional Welsh company in
Redcar?</div><a name="06062247000048"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062247000283"></a>Vera
Baird:</b> I hesitate usually to express personal opinions,
but it might be an abuse of the term &#147;Welsh&#148; if the
company were in Redcar. As I have already mentioned, however, I do not
think that there is such a company in Redcar. None of my constituents,
or anyone linked with them, bear any responsibility for the misuse of
the fine name of Wales. I shall tell you about my Welsh antecedents in
a
moment.</div><a name="06062247000049"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06062247000284"></a><b class="B">Mr.
David Jones</b> (Clwyd, West) (Con): I am grateful to the
Under-Secretary for allowing us to discuss the manufacture of Welsh
cakes in Redcar. Will she comment on the possibility of a company
obtaining registration to manufacture Eccles cakes in my constituency?
Would they run into
difficulty?</div><a name="06062247000050"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062247000287"></a>Vera

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062247000288"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. We seem to be straying a little away from
the amendment, in that Pontefract cakes are Pontefract cakes and Eccles
cakes are Eccles cakes&#151;they are not companies, they are
products. Let us 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column112" />Column number: 113</div>return to the amendments&#151;all of which were selected by me, all of
which are in order and all of which appear on the order
paper&#151;and, of course, there will be no
filibustering.</div>
<a name="06062247000054"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062247000289"></a>Vera
Baird:</b> I am very grateful. I have indicated already, Mr.
Illsley, how fortunate I am, on my first attempt to present a Bill in
Committee, to have such a fair and firm Chair. Let me return to the
words &#147;English&#148;, &#147;Welsh&#148;,
&#147;Scottish&#148; and &#147;Irish&#148;. Although I do not
want to tempt Opposition Members into too much of a frenzy, I should
have thought that the word &#147;European&#148; might have to be
equally protected. I am not sure whether they would agree with that.
Names that include the word &#147;European&#148; would not normally
be approved if they unjustifiably implied a connection with official
bodies in the European Union. If there is a genuine connection with an
official body, the name might&#151;if the body supports the
application&#151;be a perfectly realistic one to use. It would be a
question of getting support. In that and all other situations, I
envisage that the support from the public body would have to be
expressed rather than deemed, as the amendment would require it to
be.</div> <a name="06062247000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">The same can
probably be said about &#147;Great Britain&#148; and &#147;the
United Kingdom&#148;. Presumably, one would use those expressions as
a prefix, although I imagine that &#147;Eccles Cake Company of the
United Kingdom&#148; might add kudos to the manufacturer of such
cakes, as one likes to think that they are made in Britain, even if not
in Eccles; I do not want to be unduly nationalistic. The question is
whether there is a genuine connection with the official body and, if
so, whether that body takes exception to the application to the extent
that it is prevented from actively supporting the applicant or
permitting him to successfully incorporate into his company the name
that he requires.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062247000290"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062247000291"></a>The

that the speakers have taken on board what the hon. Gentleman has

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062247000292"></a>Vera

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062247000293"></a>Keith
Vaz:</b> Presumably, if the term &#147;European&#148; were
to be used to describe a company, it would be the European Commission
that would make the objection. Would it be subject to the same time
limits as a public body in this
country?</div><a name="06062247000060"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062247000294"></a>Vera

finger on why, given that a time limit is probably inappropriate
anyway, 30 days would be too short. We are to look at the list of
possibilities, each of which makes a point against the amendment.
Sending an 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column113" />Column number: 114</div>application off to the European Commission with a dead time limit of
only 30 days, after which it is deemed to support the application, is
highly likely to produce a lot of litigation and confusion. In respect
of the way in which business is conducted, it will create many of the
problems that we are trying to exclude, because in a period as short as
30 days there will inevitably be non-responses from an organisation as
big and as wide-ranging as the European Commission. The hon. Gentleman
makes a very powerful point against the amendment, and I hope that I
have made one or two myself.</div>
<a name="06062247000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">Would the EC be the appropriate
body? I am being given some helpful advice, which suggests that an
application for the word European would not necessarily have to be sent
to the Commission for approval. However, it does seem realistic that
the Secretary of State would be bound to want to consult the European
Commission, and arguably other bodies, if there were a serious
suggestion that somebody&#146;s company was of a sufficient status to
justify calling it &#147;European&#148;. I am grateful to my hon.
Friend for that point, and I am glad that he raised it just as I was
moving on to consider the word
&#147;international&#148;.</div><a name="06062247000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
one wants to use the word &#147;international&#148; as a prefix,
one will probably have to show that the major part of the
company&#146;s activities is trading overseas. It is difficult to
imagine what public body or bodies could be consulted to get approval
of the word. There must be a large number of public bodies&#151;I do
not have a specific number in mind&#151;that are international as
part of their way of being and would therefore be able to express a
view. Such bodies might take serious offence at having to give
approval, and they might not want the kudos of the word
&#147;international&#148; to be attached to some embryonic company
dealing in Eccles cakes. The word suggests a major undertaking that
operates across borders and has been working for some time to get such
a status. It gives a false picture if a company is small, not
international and operates only in
Wales.</div><a name="06062247000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am helpfully
told that not all the words in the list of sensitive words have an
automatically identifiable body whose views would be required. In a
case such as the word &#147;international&#148; it would be hard to
pin down which were the right bodies; the Secretary of State would
simply have to consider the arguments for and against the registration.
It might be easier, however, to consider the appropriate public bodies
to be approached if the word &#147;national&#148; were used. That
is the next word on the list of sensitive words that would fall under
the provisions of the subsection. The criteria for the use of the word
&#147;national&#148; for a British company would resemble those for
the word &#147;British&#148;. If a British-registered company is
called &#147;National something&#148; it implies heavily that it is
British and has a certain status in the country.</div>
<a name="06062247000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">One would hesitate to allow the
use of the word &#147;national&#148; to a company operating in a
small way, perhaps on one of the excellent industrial estates that have
grown up thanks to the stabilising of the economy and the advent of
regional development agencies, for instance in the north-east, where
industry is beginning to take off again after all the years of decline
in the steel and chemical industries. Happily, both of those are now
secure. Such a company, perhaps supported by one of the excellent
regional development grants or 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column114" />Column number: 115</div>buttressed by EU moneys to help it get off the ground but operating only
in a small way, would have inappropriate kudos attached to it if it
were entitled to use the word &#147;national&#148;. There must be a
careful screening
process.</div><a name="06062247000065"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062247000295"></a>Keith
Vaz:</b> What my hon. and learned Friend is saying is
extremely helpful and will be important to companies wishing to
register such names. Is it likely that officials acting on behalf of
the Secretary of State will have a list of the organisations to which
they will write when such names are proposed, but that the list will
not be exhaustive in case other organisations emerge as needing to be
written
to?</div><a name="06062247000066"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062247000296"></a>Vera
Baird:</b> I am not sure whether there is likely to be a
comprehensive list: as my hon. Friend suggested, it might be difficult
to formulate one. As he has also observed, such a list would be fixed
in time so that any new developments could not be accounted for. It is
clearly important that the Secretary of State should have a list of
sensitive words and names that need to be protected. I am going through
some now, which, in my view, have a powerful claim to fall into that
category and to be protected by the
subsection.</div><a name="06062247000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
words that probably also imply some business pre-eminence, or a
representative status. I further understand that the regulations
specify bodies in relation to particularly sensitive words; however, in
the case of some sensitive words on a list such as the one referred to
by my hon. Friend there would be no associated body. He is I think
correct in saying that the regulations specify a list of sensitive
words with a link to bodies. Clearly, there is likely to be an
alarm-triggering system for sensitive words that might, without having
an association to a body, still create a false impression in relation
to the status, nature, age, capitalisation or spread of the business of
one of the relevant
companies.</div><a name="06062247000068"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062247000297"></a>Keith
Vaz:</b> The thing that will really cause people concern is
the use of the word &#147;royal&#148;, or any connotations of
association with the Crown. Many people who set up companies would want
to trade on that name to further their business. Shall we have very
strict criteria for dealing with those important words, which, if
adopted, would confer a great deal of kudos on
companies?</div><a name="06062247000069"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062247000298"></a>Vera
Baird:</b> Let me just deal quickly with the words
&#147;association&#148;, &#147;federation&#148; or
&#147;society&#148;. A company wanting to use one of them would
normally be limited by
guarantee.</div><a name="06062247000070"></a>

Blunt:</b> I know that the hon. and learned Lady will be as
embarrassed as anyone else at what she is having to do. May I suggest,
having done my best to listen to her arguments, that she should accept
the amendments on behalf of the Government and, if the Government then
think that it is appropriate to revisit the matter, return to it on
Report, when there has been a chance to examine it? If we go on
examining it at this length, we shall bring the Committee into serious
disrepute.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column115" />Column number: 116</div><a name="06062247000071"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062247000300"></a>Vera
Baird:</b> I am not in a position to accept the amendment. I
think that I have made pretty forceful arguments against it and I hope
that the hon. Gentleman will be persuaded to withdraw it. I must carry
on, to try to meet the thrust of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
argument&#151;although he was able to put it more succinctly than I
can reply to it. I do not feel embarrassed, so the hon. Gentleman is
wrong.</div> <a name="06062247000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I was
saying before the intervention, a company wanting to use one of the
words in question would normally be limited by guarantee. Each member
would have one vote and the constitution would contain a non-profit
distribution clause. Such protection would be required before words of
the kind in question could be used for a company limited by
guarantee.</div> <a name="06062247000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have run
through but a few of the many examples on the pages in my hand of words
that might be used that would hit the sensitivity

<a name="06062247000102"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062247000324"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> The clause gives the Secretary of State new
powers to restrict what letters and symbols may be used in the
company&#146;s registered name and to specify a permitted format for
a name. It is a new provision and is not contained in the 1985 Act. I
would be grateful if the Minister clarifed why it was felt that the
additional clause was needed. I would also be grateful if she set out
the potential problems that the Government seek to address and what
marks and symbols she has in mind for the subsequent regulations.
</div><a name="06062247000103"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062247000325"></a>Vera
Baird:</b> The clause provides power to make regulations that
specify the characters that can be used in a company&#146;s
registered name. The primary purpose of the restriction of the choice
of name is to make it easy for the public to find information about the
company on the record. Names that use unfamiliar characters, such as
those drawn from oriental languages, or that begin with a string of
characters that are not letters apparently create confusion. They are
difficult to remember and difficult to find in an index. So,
regulations made under the clause would be of great assistance to
people looking for information about companies. The restriction on
choice would impose no cost on companies.</div>
<a name="06062247000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">We will consult on the use of
the power. That may reassure the hon. Gentleman. We intend to use it to
specify all the letters used in the official languages of the European
Union and the most familiar other characters such as currency symbols,
punctuation marks and, perhaps, the first few characters in a name
might be put in the regulations. It will also be possible to restrict
the formatting used in the name as registered. That would not affect
how companies display their name, so the use of things such as
superscript, subscripts, exotic font, mixtures of capital and
lower-case letters&#151;and even names with their characters arranged
in a circle&#151;would not be affected by the regulations. The point
is that the regulations will not make any difference to
logos.</div><a name="06062247000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">Why have
restrictions? That is the thrust of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
question. At present, they are none, but Companies House is apparently
coming under increasing pressure to accept names and characters that it
does not have the technology to handle, and the time has come for
company law to provide a power to restrict the characters that are
used. Such regulation is not unnecessary, because it is important to
distinguish between a company&#146;s registered name and a trade
mark. There are no property rights in a registered name, which is only
an identifier, so obliging companies to go through this process really
is not much of an imposition. One might ask why companies should not be
allowed to use whatever names they want. However, there will be no such
restriction, because companies are not required to use their registered
names in the course of business in any event.
</div><a name="06062247000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that that
satisfies what I guess is the hon. Gentleman&#146;s curiosity about
the need for the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column117" />Column number: 118</div>provisions, and the point is, indeed, interesting. With that, I hope
that hon. Members will agree that the clause should stand part of the

in the spirit of seeking to avoid additional regulation where it is not
required. However, I have listened carefully to the Minister&#146;s

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062247000329"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> The clause requires that private limited
companies use a particular suffix to denote their status, and the
amendments are intended to simplify it. In the days when I was learning
how to draft contracts and other legal documents, I was always told not
to use three words when one would do. Applying that logic and that
adage to the clause, I wonder why we should use three subsections when
one will do, particularly when the Bill is intended to simplify company
legislation and slim down what might otherwise be an excessive burden
of regulation. Amendment No. 124 is largely a drafting amendment to
give effect to that approach.</div>
<a name="06062247000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 125 is slightly
different. Although I welcome the introduction of greater
cross-referencing in the Bill, I do not welcome the fact that it
sometimes adds confusion. Subsection (4) says that the clause</div>
<a name="06062247000228"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;does not apply to community
interest companies&#148;,</div><a name="06062247000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">but
then invites the reader to see certain sections of the Companies
(Audit, Investigations and Community Enterprise) Act 2004. That leaves
the reader in some confusion as to whether community interest companies
are caught or not. Amendment No. 125 would make the position
definitive, but if it is not acceptable to the Minister, I hope that
she will consider an alternative formulation of subsection (4) to
ensure that there is some clarity about the scope and ambit of the
clause.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column118" />Column number: 119</div><a name="06062247000116"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062247000330"></a>Vera
Baird:</b> The existing clause is a very clear statement of
the requirement for a private company&#146;s name to end in the
appropriate statutory indicator of its status. The formulation is the
same as that in the previous clause, which applies to public
companies&#146; names. I hesitate to agree to an amendment that just
restates the existing clause, which is what it does. I can compete with
the hon. Gentleman on the verbiage point; personally, I find the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s sentence of 38 words less easy to understand than
three sentences of no more than 17 words. I hope that he is persuaded
that I have the trump card, that there really is not much point in
amendment No. 124, and that he should withdraw
it.</div><a name="06062247000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">On amendment No.
125, I can almost see the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point, but not quite.
As he says, all that it does is to remove the cross-reference to the
Companies (Audit, Investigations and Community Enterprise) Act 2004. It
does not change the position at all; it just deletes a useful
cross-reference. Since the provision in the 2004 Act requires the name
of a community interest company that is not a public company to end in
CIC, I would have thought it quite useful, at this point of the Bill,
to have a pointer across to another piece of legislation. I am a bit
hopeful that I have persuaded him to withdraw that amendment,
too.</div><a name="06062247000118"></a>

place.</div><a name="06062247000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
makes provision for certain companies to continue to use a name that
does not end with &#147;limited&#148; or any other permitted
alternative. The clause sets out certain conditions, the first of which
is that the object of the relevant company must be the promotion of
certain things, such as art, science, religion or charity. There is a
further requirement for companies&#146; 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column119" />Column number: 120</div>articles to include certain provisions, including the prohibition of
payment of any dividends and of any return of capital to its members.
In the other place, my noble Friend Lord Hodgson rightly pointed out
that the requirement prohibiting a return of capital is new and departs
from the provisions of section 19 of the Companies Act 1985. That means
that some companies would be required to change their articles to
maintain compliance with the expanded
requirement.</div>
<a name="06062247000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although I recognise that there
are very few companies still benefiting from a licence under section 19
of the 1985 Act, I was not persuaded by Lord McKenzie&#146;s reply,
in which he mentioned the deregulatory nature of the clause, as it
seems clear that the companies concerned will be obliged to change
their articles if they are to continue to rely on the clause. That may
now be easier, as exempt companies no longer need to apply to the
Department of Trade and Industry for approval when they amend their
articles, but it is slightly peculiar to suggest that that is
deregulatory, when the relevant companies will be required to take
positive steps to retain their status and will potentially incur cost
and expense.</div><a name="06062247000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">Lord
McKenzie said in Grand Committee that the change was
justified</div> <a name="06062247000229"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to ensure

the 1985
Act.</div><a name="06062247000243"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.45

Howarth</b> (Cambridge) (LD): I just want to comment briefly
on this amendment. I have had a great deal of sympathy with the
Conservative amendments so far, but I have a problem with this one, and
I ask the hon. Gentleman to reply to the following point in his closing
remarks.</div> <a name="06062247000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
is in line with a basic principle of company law: the protection of
creditors. If a company has the word &#147;limited&#148; after its
name, that puts potential creditors on notice that they might not get
their money and they cannot pursue shareholders for it. It is at least
arguable that a company that can return capital is one that puts at
risk the creditor&#146;s position. Therefore, it is reasonable for
the clause to stand as it does, because it is protecting potential
creditors from that particular possible abuse, although to a small
extent only, because there are not many of these companies. I recognise
that it will not be a very important matter in practice, but in theory
this is the right thing to do.</div>
<a name="06062247000130"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062247000334"></a>Vera
Baird:</b> I am grateful for that thoughtful contribution made
by the hon. Gentleman on behalf of the Liberal Democrats. He is correct
to say that the clause runs with the grain of company law generally.
Apparently, it is likely to affect 21 active companies&#151;that is
the number I have been told&#151;which represents a small group,
because most not-for-profit companies that are exempt from the
requirement to have the word &#147;limited&#148; are companies
limited by guarantee.</div>
<a name="06062247000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under the Companies Act
1985&#151;the present legislation&#151;none of those 21 companies
can return 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column120" />Column number: 121</div>capital to their members, because they do not have the authority in
their articles to do so, and they cannot change their articles without
consent from the DTI. However, under part 19 of the Bill, it will no
longer be necessary for companies&#146; articles to authorise
reductions of capital or to authorise companies purchasing their own
shares. Furthermore, exempt companies will no longer need to apply to
the DTI for approval when they amend their articles, although the Bill
ensures that, as at present, companies limited by shares exempt from
the requirement for their name to end in &#147;limited&#148; may
not return capital to members. I broadly embrace the point made by the
hon. Gentleman that to allow them to do so would be wholly inconsistent
with the grounds for the exemption. The amendment would remove exactly
the safeguard that he has
pinpointed.</div><a name="06062247000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">I suppose
that it is a sort of trade-off. The company&#146;s articles cannot
allow it to do inappropriate things with its money, so just as it is
inappropriate for not-for-profit companies to pay dividends it is
inappropriate for them to return money to their shareholders in other
ways, for instance by buying back the shares. There is a clear and
strong purpose for this provision to remain as it is, and I invite the
hon. Member for Hornchurch to withdraw his
amendment.</div>

provided by the hon. Member for Cambridge. We raised this point to
ensure that we were not entering into regulation where it was not
required, particularly, as the Minister rightly said, because we are
talking about only 20 companies. I know that a small number only would
potentially be affected by this provision, but this is about ensuring
that, in dealing with this type of problem, we are not using a
sledgehammer to crack a nut. In light of the Minister&#146;s

Even though I am a lawyer, I do not wish to promote arcane debates

was some doubt in the mind of Lord McKenzie at that stage. In Grand

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062247000339"></a>Vera
Baird:</b> It is true that the extra words are in the 1985
Act, but where appropriate the Bill uses clearer and more succinct
wording. The policy is that the companies to which the clause applies
should use all the money they have available in promoting their
objects, and it is our considered view&#151;even our reconsidered
view&#151;that the word &#147;income&#148; is sufficiently
general in the context to cover moneys received on the sale of assets,
for instance. Indeed, it is better, because on a sale of, say, land, we
would want all the money from the sale to be applied to a
company&#146;s charitable or similar purposes, not just the capital
profit element.</div> <a name="06062247000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
noble Friend Lord McKenzie wrote to Lord Hodgson on the subject. A copy
of the letter is in the House Library and I will supply one to the hon.

said:</div><a name="06062247000231"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
company&#146;s profit (or loss) for a financial year is the result of
deducting expenses and other losses from the income of the company,
i.e. it is a net figure. Take for example a profit on disposal of a
fixed asset. FRS 3 defines this as &#145;...the difference
between the net sale proceeds and the net carrying amount, whether
carried at historical cost (less any provisions made) or at
valuation&#146;. We do not think it is appropriate to restrict the
duty to use money to promote the company&#146;s objects to this net
figure. The policy is that all the money from the sale should be used
to promote the objects of the
company&#148;.</div><a name="06062247000143"></a>

be as clear and accessible as possible. However, I do not think that
the amendment adds to the clarity because the drafting makes the
position reasonably clear. The restriction on changing the articles
imposed by the clause applies to companies of the kinds described in
clauses 62 and 63. I would venture to suggest that the existing wording
makes it rather plainer than the suggested alternative. However, I am

having to go through the rigmarole of a special
resolution.</div><a name="06062247000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">The words

doing it. If we remove that, does it not become the case that it can
only be done in that way? However, I see the argument that the word
&#147;may&#148; is important in that
context.</div><a name="06062247000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
would remove the alternative methods of changing a name, and we want
them to work for purposes of compliance with a direction. We shall come
later, during debate on another amendment, to the point of principle
whether a change of name should generally occur by special resolution,
but the Government suggest that that part of the clause is important
and that its removal would generate uncertainty. I invite the hon.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062247000349"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I shall speak to amendmentNo. 129
and all the amendments that are grouped with it as they largely relate
to the mechanism for objecting to a company&#146;s name under the new
procedure set out in clause 70 onwards. I shall also make some more
general points about clause 70 as part of the stand part
debate.</div><a name="06062247000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
67 states at the
outset:</div><a name="06062247000236"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
company must not be registered under this Act by a name that is the
same as another name appearing in the...index of company
names.&#148;</div><a name="06062247000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">It then
states:</div><a name="06062247000237"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Secretary of State may make...regulations supplementing this
section&#148;</div><a name="06062247000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">so that certain
words, symbols, signs and other matters can be disregarded for purposes
of the section, and so
that</div><a name="06062247000238"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;registration by a
name that would otherwise be prohibited...is
permitted&#148;.</div><a name="06062247000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am concerned that the Secretary of State&#146;s approval of a name by
virtue of this clause could be seen to override the rights, or question
the ability of another person to have such rights, in connection with
that name or a similar name, to challenge the granting of the name
under clause 70. Accordingly, amendment No. 129 seeks to clarify the
point to avoid any confusion.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column126" />Column number: 127</div><a name="06062247000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 68 gives the Secretary of
State power to direct a company to change its name if it has been
registered in a name that is the same as, or in the opinion
of the Secretary of State, too like a name appearing on the
register or a name that should have appeared on the register. My
concern is the last point: which names should appear on the
registrar&#146;s index of companies that are not there? Amendment No.
130 seeks the deletion of those words, but I would in any event be
interested to hear from the Minister the circumstances that are
contemplated by them. It seems odd to legislate for something that
should be there but is not. I certainly would not wish to set a
dangerous precedent for other legislation by letting this pass me by;
hence the reason for flagging up the point and tabling the
amendment.</div><a name="06062247000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would
also be interested in the Minister&#146;s views on how the clause
would interrelate with clause 70 and the mechanism for the new company
names adjudicator. Is it envisaged that a party could apply to the
Secretary of State under clause 68 and to the adjudicator under clause
70 at the same time? Who would take precedence in such a situation? How
would any issues or disputes be resolved if a twin-track approach were
taken? It is worth gaining clarity on the issue so that we can best
understand the interrelationship between the two different regimes. It
appears that they could be used on the same occasion, and that could
lead to
confusion.</div><a name="06062247000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 131, the words of which are repeated in some subsequent amendments,
seeks to impose uniformity on the form that a direction from the
Secretary of State should take. I mentioned earlier that clause 65
makes it clear that a direction from the Secretary of State in that
context should be in writing, and I note that clause 75 also specifies
that a direction should be in writing, yet that requirement is missing
here. I believe that all such directions should be written, given the
potential sanction imposed for a breach. Amendment No. 131 would
address that
point.</div><a name="06062247000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 70
relates to the new mechanism to enable a person to raise with one of
the new company names adjudicators an objection to a company using a
particular name. Before developing some points and discussing the
amendments proposed to the clause, I want to say that I welcome the
concept of creating a means of challenge and the ideas that lie behind
the clause and the various provisions that feed into it. There are
cases of names being used inappropriately and companies to a certain
extent being held to ransom, so it is important that there is a means
of more direct redress in the Bill. However, my comments will relate to
the mechanics of the structure in the Bill. As currently drawn, that
may be somewhat cumbersome and time consuming and may lead to
unintended
consequences.</div><a name="06062247000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me
deal with a more technical point first. Amendment No. 132 is designed
to clarify that, for a person to object, the company does not have to
have exactly the same name, which is what the wording of clause
70(1)(a) seems to suggest. The amendment would make it clear that, if a
company had incorporated a name associated with the applicant in which
he had goodwill, that would give grounds for an objection. Another
aspect that concerns me is that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column127" />Column number: 128</div>there appears to be no requirement for the applicant seeking to raise an
objection to have any current or direct interest in the
UK.</div><a name="06062247000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall give an
example and I hope that you will excuse me, Mr. Illsley, if I take your
name in vain for this limited purpose. Illsley Retailers could be a
large international company that had not yet established a presence in
the UK. Illsley Retailers Ltd. could be a small high street
store&#151;say on Hornchurch high street in my
constituency&#151;which has just set itself up, completely oblivious
of the existence of Illsley Retailers, the large international concern.
The international company is able to show that it has goodwill in its
name and that the name of Illsley Retailers Ltd. is sufficiently
similar to suggest a connection with the international company,
thereby, in my view, satisfying clause 70(1) and enabling the large
international company to argue that it is considering establishing a
new chain of stores in the UK, giving it the potential right to raise
an objection.</div><a name="06062247000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">If that
happened, the now quaking Illsley Retailers Ltd.&#151;the new and
small UK company with only limited resources available to demonstrate
its situation under clause 70(4) so as to fend off the objection being
upheld automatically&#151;would have to try to demonstrate that it
did not know of the large international company so as to deprive it if
it subsequently wanted to register the name. The costs of that could be
significant, and there might be an inequality of arms between the
parties that could lead to the smaller firm being intimidated into
changing its name, even though it did not intend to contravene clause
70 and even though that action would cause damage to its own
goodwill.</div><a name="06062247000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">I give that
example with regard to ensuring that there is a direct link to the UK.
I think that the intention behind the drafting is to deal with issues
of uncertainty and with something that is misleading. However, the
existing wording does not seem right to me, so amendments Nos. 133 and
134 are designed to make it clear that there has to be a strong
connection between the applicant and its use of its name and goodwill
in the UK.</div><a name="06062247000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">It also
seems odd that the right of objection is completely open ended. There
is no limitation period at all, and I believe that an appropriate
long-stop date for a challenge should be incorporated to provide
certainty about this area of law and to facilitate speed of
administration in respect of company names and their use. Amendment No.
135 therefore proposes a limitation period of 12 months from the date
of registration of the offending company name.</div>
<a name="06062247000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 137 is a
technical amendment to ensure that the definition of
&#147;goodwill&#148; in clause 70(7) also applies to clause 73
where it is also used. However, it would be helpful if the Minister
could tell us whether any further guidance will be forthcoming on the
meaning of &#147;goodwill&#148; as referred to in this subsection
as the CBI has stated that it would be useful to give a clearer
indication as to the matters that would be covered. For example, would
a registered trademark currently in use be regarded as meeting the
definition? It would certainly be helpful if some further clarification
or guidance could be
offered.</div><a name="06062247000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
60 seeks to clarify the reference to &#147;start-up costs&#148; in
clause 70(4)(b)(ii) and to give some 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column128" />Column number: 129</div>context to the term by making reference to the company&#146;s annual
revenue and assets. Without this, it seems that the reference to
start-up costs could be highly subjective and uncertain, and I note
that the Secretary of State has not reserved a specific right to give
guidance on this term under clause 72.</div>
<a name="06062247000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">We come back to amendment No.
136 and the insertion of a new mechanism for seeking an interim order.
These new provisions are intended to address what I see as one of the
real loopholes that the current law allows and that the
Government&#146;s proposals appear to fail to address adequately and
in a timely manner even though this is precisely the type of case that
the mechanism is intended to address.</div>
<a name="06062247000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us take the example of a
public company that is in the middle of a transaction, such as a
reverse takeover where it is acquiring another company, part and parcel
of which will incorporate a resolution approving that transaction. In
the light of the different status of the new enlarged company, it might
to seek to change its name at the same time and will therefore issue a
circular to its shareholders seeking the permission to proceed with the
transaction, but also seeking permission to change its name. Therefore
a document is published, a circular is sent to shareholders giving the
background to the transaction and also seeking their approval to pass a
special resolution to change the name of the company.</div>
<a name="06062247000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">In those circumstances what
commonly happens is that a separate limited liability company is set up
and the resolution is passed and a similar resolution is also passed in
the new limited liability company. Both resolutions and the supporting
documentation are filed at the same time with the registrar of
companies so, in essence, there is a simultaneous change of name. There
is therefore no doubt that the new plc seeking to change its name is
not entitled to do so by virtue of an existing company having the
self-same name on the index of companies maintained by the
registrar.</div> <a name="06062247000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
that does not always happen. I am aware of circumstances from my
experience before entering the House where the limited liability
company may not have been established. There are people who monitor
such issues quite carefully and who then establish a new limited
liability company using the name that the public company was seeking to
adopt following on from the change of name. Challenges have been
brought through legal proceedings, but customarily in those
circumstances, given the possible time constraints and the potential
embarrassment to any parties involved, a commercial arrangement is
reached to secure the name that the plc was seeking to adopt by virtue
of its
proposals.</div><a name="06062247000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clearly, as
the timetable for an EGM is 21 days, that does not give a huge amount
of time to make any changes and to ensure that one can secure the new
name after the successful passing of the resolution by the
shareholders. Obviously when one is talking about a plc, one is talking
about filing with the London stock exchange and therefore the
high-profile nature of what is
contemplated.</div><a name="06062247000245"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.15
am</div><a name="06062247000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under the
current procedure, one is required to seek the permission of the
company names adjudicator to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column129" />Column number: 130</div>change a name. It seems that one would have to go to court if the name
was not changed; there is no automatic provision for an offending
company to change its name. The risk is that it could be expensive for
relevant companies, hence the proposal for an interim order procedure
as proposed in amendment No. 136.</div>
<a name="06062247000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not intend to take up the
Committee&#146;s time going through the provisions of amendment No.
136 in detail, but in essence it would allow a plc to challenge the use
or registration of the new name if it took place after the publication
of the relevant circular. It would ensure a swift challenge. The
mechanism would allow a means of addressing the ills that are likely to
occur within the likely time
scale.</div><a name="06062247000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is a
question of balancing the risk. Amendments Nos. 136, 138 and 139 would
allow that to be done more effectively. It is worth noting that if
there was a subsequent dispute about who has goodwill and so on, it
would be possible to seek a challenge through other procedures
contained in the Bill.</div>
<a name="06062247000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">I appreciate that I have
already taken some time, but I want to deal briefly with some concerns
raised by the CBI in connection with clause 70, which are dealt with in
amendments Nos. 252, 253 and 264. Amendments Nos. 252 and 253 seek to
make a further addition to clause 70(5). That clause deals with a
situation in which the main purpose of registering a name is to obtain
money or other consideration from the applicant, or to prevent him from
registering the name. In those circumstances, even if the relevant
exemptions in paragraphs (a), (b) or (c) of subsection (4) would
otherwise apply, an objection to a company names adjudicator would be
upheld.</div> <a name="06062247000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, the
CBI believes that further amendment is necessary to mitigate the impact
of the exemption in clause 70(4)(b)(ii) that a company is already
operating under a relevant name. Amendments Nos. 252 and 253 would
provide for a situation where consumers and members of the public, and
those actually dealing with or trading with a company, could be misled
into thinking that they were receiving information about or dealing
with a well-known company when they were not.</div>
<a name="06062247000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">The CBI states that if such a
change was adopted, it would save many well-known companies significant
amounts of management time and costs often exceeding &#163;100,000
each year in getting misleading company names withdrawn or changed.
Although some remedies exist in law for passing off and for breach of
trademark, companies will save significant sums if company law is
brought to bear and made more effective. It would also help legitimate
companies rightly concerned about damage to their reputation.</div>
<a name="06062247000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 264 makes a
slightly different point, as it addresses the potential orders that a
company names adjudicator could make. The CBI describes the current
order-making power as &#147;seriously inadequate&#148;. In many
cases, the goodwill attached to a name applies only in a particular
field or area of business that reflects the type of activities
undertaken by the relevant company. Except when a name is particularly
well-known, the use of a name outside a specified area of activity may
not be said to mislead.</div>
<a name="06062247000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 264 would
therefore give the adjudicator discretion in appropriate cases to allow
the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column130" />Column number: 131</div>respondent company to retain the disputed name as its own, but on the
condition that it is required not to operate in the relevant fields of
activity if confusion could arise as a result of the applicant&#146;s
goodwill in that particular business area. That seems a practical
proposal which would address the concerns of the applicant, yet it
would not unduly penalise a respondent
company.</div>
<a name="06062247000215"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06062247000350"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Quentin Davies</b> (Grantham and Stamford) (Con): I want to
speak to amendments Nos. 252 and 253 in my name. I am grateful to my
Front-Bench colleagues for having added their names to those
amendments.</div> <a name="06062247000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">As my
hon. Friend said, clause 70 in its present form is somewhat inadequate.
Subsection (1)(b) provides some protection for a company that finds
someone else using its name or a name very close to it such that
potential customers are easily deceived into believing that they are
dealing with a company whose goodwill already exits, when in fact they
are not. That is a real danger that we come across in many contexts,
and which gets worse with the growth of internet trading. Company law
should provide a protection or remedy against
that.</div><a name="06062247000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 70 is
rather convoluted. It starts by stating that there will be some
protection, but then withdraws a lot of that in subsection (4), which
provides for six grounds&#151;I think&#151;on which a company
complained against for having borrowed another company&#146;s name or
for trading under one that is excessively close to it, can raise an
excuse. If they can do that, there is no such protection for the person
complaining. That is not
adequate.</div><a name="06062247000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection
(5) then adds a new protection against explicit intent to blackmail a
company with substantial goodwill by setting up and trading under
another with the same or similar name simply to force the first company
to buy it in. It is in the public interest to exclude such blackmail or
greenmail, which is the purpose of subsection (5).</div>
<a name="06062247000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">The provisions do not, however,
go to the heart of the real abuse or evil. They do not mention public
protection. As my hon. Friend mentioned, the CBI inspired such an
initiative. Protection of the public is our greatest concern and we
must address it. My amendment No. 253 therefore adds the
criterion:</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column131" />Column number: 132</div><a name="06062247000239"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;if the activities of the company
using the registered name would be likely to deceive members of the
public or to cause loss or damage to persons dealing with the
company.&#148;.</div><a name="06062247000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is the
essence of the abuse, against which the public need to be protected,
and it needs to be in clause 70 explicitly and none of the potential
excuses in subsection (4) should be able to override it.</div>
<a name="06062247000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that the Committee
agrees that the amendment is sensible and makes it clear what the main
purpose of the protection should be. The clause does not mention public
interest, and it should. So far, protection in company law against that
form of abuse is
inadequate.</div><a name="06062247000222"></a>

Baird:</b> I am grateful for the clarity with which Opposition
Members have reasoned their amendments. I shall start by separating the
purposes of clauses 67 and 70. I think that that is where the hon.
Member for Hornchurch started.</div>
<a name="06062247000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 67 provides the rules
under which a proposed name is to be compared with existing names to
determine whether it is the same and thus should be prohibited. For
example, &#147;bricks and mortar&#148; would be treated as being
the same as &#147;brick sand mortar&#148;, and therefore the second
name would not be permitted. It would not even make it on to the
register. That is the important
point.</div><a name="06062247000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 70
provides for objections to a name already registered on the grounds
that it either is the same as the name in which the objector has
goodwill, or is so similar as to suggest a connection between the
company and the objector. I agree that it would be wrong if the rules
under clause 67 restricted the scope of objections under clause 70.
However, the purpose of clause 70 is to provide for objections to names
already permitted&#151;it has got over the hurdles in clause

130 focuses on a real difficulty with rules on company names regarding
names that should have been on the register, but were not. I was asked
