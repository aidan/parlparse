Government new clause 14&#151;<i class="I">Disclosure of tax information

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08013166000135"></a>The
Minister for Pensions Reform (Mr. Mike
O'Brien):</b> I welcome you, Mrs. Anderson, and all
members of the Committee back to our consideration of the
Bill.</div><a name="08013166000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will urge that clause 42 does not stand part of the Bill on the basis
that we intend to replace it with new clause 14. Clause 42 allows Her
Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs to share information with the
Pensions Regulator to enable the regulator to perform its compliance
activities. That data sharing is crucial in making sure that employers
comply with the new duties created in the Bill. It is vital that the
Pensions Regulator is aware of all employers who should register and
how to contact them, if required. HMRC is the best source of this
information because of its pay-as-you-earn activities. Clause 42 also
allows HMRC to share information about non-compliance that it has
collected through tax and minimum wage activities. This will help the
Pensions Regulator to identify which employers are more likely not to
comply with their duties.</div>
<a name="08013166000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, the
Government recognise that clause 42 has room for even tighter
safeguards. In particular, under the clause, it would be possible for
the regulator, or its agents or contractors, to disclose onwardly
information received by them from HMRC without being in breach of the
law. We have therefore tabled new clause 14 to replace clause 42 and
address its deficiencies.</div>
<a name="08013166000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause 14 would make it
even clearer that while the Pensions Regulator can make full use of
transferred 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column284" />Column number: 284</div>HMRC data for its internal functions, the onward disclosure of that data
by the regulator would be prohibited in all but a defined set of five
specified circumstances: first, when HMRC&#146;s authorisation for
onward disclosure has been obtained; secondly, when the data are needed
for any criminal proceedings; thirdly, when the regulator is involved
in proceedings, including civil proceedings, under its existing and new
powers; fourthly, when the disclosure enables or assists the Pensions
Regulator to carry out its functions; and, fifthly, when the data have
been anonymised.</div>
<a name="08013166000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause 14
would also streamline legislation providing for data sharing between
the two bodies. HMRC already shares information with the Pensions
Regulator to assist with the regulator&#146;s existing functions.
However, a single gateway for data flow from HMRC to the Pensions
Regulator would be both more transparent and more elegant than adding
multiple patches to the old gateway set out in the Pensions Act 2004.
New clause 14 would replace the existing gateway between HMRC and the
regulator with one that would allow the flow of data for the
regulator&#146;s old and new functions. There would thus not be the
difficulty of having information flowing from HMRC to the regulator
through one of two separate gateways&#151;there will be just
one.</div><a name="08013166000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">Furthermore, the
new combined gateway will improve the regulator&#146;s ability to
carry out its existing functions, making clearer the ways in which it
can and cannot onwardly disclose data received from HMRC. I am sure we
will have a little fun on data&#151;no doubt we can look forward to
that&#151;but the new clause is the result of our looking very
carefully at the wording of the old clause 42 and taking a view that we
could tighten it up to ensure that things were clearer. I hope that the
Committee will be able to support the removal of clause 42 and, in due
course, the insertion of new clause
14.</div><a name="08013166000029"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08013166000136"></a><b class="B">Andrew
Selous</b> (South-West Bedfordshire) (Con): May I also welcome
you back to the Chair, Mrs.
Anderson?</div><a name="08013166000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">Conservative
Members called for proper sharing of information between the regulator
and HMRC in earlier debates because we wanted it to be as easy as
possible for employers to provide the required information to the
authorities. We thus completely support the principle of new clause 14
and understand the reasons why the Minister wants to delete existing
clause 42. He is right, however, that I will ask him about security, in
particular with regard to data-sharing. Will there be secure
transmission? Will the data be encrypted when they are passed from one
organisation to another? This is extremely personal and private
information about how much people have paid, how long they have worked
somewhere, when they started, their home address, and so on. In the
light of recent events, we seek as much reassurance as possible from
the
Minister.</div><a name="08013166000031"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08013166000137"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Nigel Waterson</b> (Eastbourne) (Con): I am following my hon.
Friend&#146;s argument intently. Did he see, as I did the other day,
that the Ministry of Defence is apparently banning its staff from
removing laptops from the building? That defeats the object of having a
laptop, to an extent, but does he think that there should be a similar
rule for these data?</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column285" />Column number: 285</div><a name="08013166000032"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08013166000138"></a>Andrew
Selous:</b> My hon. Friend is absolutely right that laptops
are extremely vulnerable. They can be left on trains and they can be
stolen from cars, which has happened quite a lot recently. That is
exactly the sort of practical detail relating to the passing on of
these data on which it would be good to have reassurance from the
Minister. The data would include the pay details of up to 7 million of
our fellow citizens. Were something to go wrong, it would be on the
scale of the child benefit data loss earlier in the year. The Committee
is owed a full and detailed explanation of how the security will be
planned, so I look forward to the Minister&#146;s
response.</div><a name="08013166000033"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08013166000139"></a><b class="B">Danny
Alexander</b> (Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey)
(LD): It is a pleasure to welcome you back to the Chair and to
serve under your chairmanship, Mrs.
Anderson.</div><a name="08013166000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having
head the Minister, it is clear that new clause 14 is a significant
improvement on clause 42, so we endorse his plan to substitute clause
42 with that new clause. It is clear that the motivation behind that is
to ensure that there are appropriate safeguards for how the Pensions
Regulator can make onward use of the information, which makes a lot of
sense. The five reasons why the Pensions Regulator may distribute
information onwards also make sense and fit with the proper discharge
of its functions in the context of the
Bill.</div><a name="08013166000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
would be useful to hear more from the Minister on the point that the
hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire mentioned about the safeguards
for the practical transfer of data. This is not a question of having
fun. I think that over the past two or three months, not just HMRC, but
other Government organisations, have lost 33 million pieces of data,
sometimes in small numbers and sometimes in large numbers. It is not
just central Government, because the Scottish Government have had
similar failings, so there is clearly a problem with those processes
across
Governments.</div><a name="08013166000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will
the Minister tell the Committee&#151;it go on record in case the
issue ever has to be considered again&#151;what importance he
attaches to safe and secure procedures? For example, does he envisage
that the data would need to be encrypted before transfer to the
Pensions Regulator? The procedure of CDs changing hands through the
post with alarming frequency has been criticised several times, not
least in the Government&#146;s own review of the matter. Does the
Minister set the highest store by ensuring that the procedures are as
secure as possible? While the scale of potential data loss might not be
as large as in previous cases, the loss of even one piece of datum is
none the less one piece too many. Can the Minister give the Committee
further reassurance on the practicalities behind the new clause so that
it may be
welcomed?</div><a name="08013166000037"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08013166000140"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:</b> First, it is vital to ensure that data are
transferred safely and securely. That is even more the case in the
light of security breaches in recent months at HMRC and elsewhere.
However, let me put the sort of data we will need in context. We will
need the names and contact details of employers, the numbers of
employees working for those employers and the numbers of people in
pension schemes. We might need the names and national insurance numbers
of those employees, but that would probably not be necessary in the
vast majority of cases, and perhaps only when the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column286" />Column number: 286</div>regulator was carrying out a more detailed investigation. Therefore, the
data being transferred will contain somewhat limited
details.</div><a name="08013166000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is still
important, however, that the procedures for data transfer covered by
the Bill are carefully developed and agreed in the coming years so that
we can ensure that this is done properly. Those procedures will be
informed by the outcome of various reviews that the Prime Minister
commissioned following the HMRC data handling issues. We want to ensure
that there is good data safety in government and that the framework of
the Data Protection Act 1998 works. However, it is important that the
legislation is sufficiently flexible to allow operational procedures to
be refined in the light of reviews and best practice that are
applicable to both HMRC and the
regulator.</div><a name="08013166000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">At present,
the regulator&#146;s procedures include electronic transfer, when
possible, and encryption, when disk transfer is used. HMRC&#146;s
procedures already involve measures such as the monitoring and logging
of access and the protection of physical transported media.
HMRC&#146;s procedures have been newly strengthened to include using
automated electronic transfer whenever possible, encryption when
physical transfer is needed, and approval of any significant bulk
transfers from a senior member of
staff.</div><a name="08013166000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">In addition,
the Data Protection Act sets out the framework enforced by the
Information Commissioner and the courts, and continues unaffected by
the Bill. Therefore, there are new procedures coming into effect to
deal with this issue of data transfer. Current reviews have identified
changes that need to be made, and we have four years to ensure that
they are put in place. Any subsequent reviews that occur during the
coming years will also be able to identify and set out any further
changes that might be needed. We have the time to put those in
place.</div><a name="08013166000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">I can give a
lot of reassurance on transferring data because of the long lead-in
time. Current procedures will be applied, and any further new
procedures that enable us better to secure the transfer of data can be
put into place in the run-up to 2012. With those reassurances, I hope
that hon. Members will be able to approve the changes that I have
suggested.</div><a name="08013166000042"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08013166000144"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> The consideration of this
clause gives us an opportunity to ask for the Minister&#146;s
reflections on a point relating to the objectives of the Pensions
Regulator. Obviously, the regulator&#146;s involvement with personal
accounts has been widely welcomed, not just in this Committee and the
House, but by stakeholder groups. The clause inserts a new objective
for the Pensions Regulator to maximise compliance with the duties set
out in chapter 1 of the Bill, which makes a great deal of sense. The
Pensions Regulator has a very high reputation. It has been seen to
carry out its present functions very successfully, and those whom it
regulates have a great deal of confidence in it.</div>
<a name="08013166000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">The only
misgiving of any sort that has been expressed to me&#151;by industry
groups, for example&#151;relates to the role of the regulator with
regard to its new objective. Will the new objective in any way distract
from the regulator&#146;s existing objectives? Clearly, Liberal
Democrat Members would not want that to be the case&#151;nor, I am
sure, would the Minister. The Pensions Regulator should be able to
carry out its existing functions and objectives unimpeded by the new
objective.</div>
<a name="08013166000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will the
Minister assure me that appropriate additional resources will be made
available to the regulator to enable it to carry out the duties that it
will have under the new objective in such a way that it will not have
to wind down or squeeze its existing functions to make 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column288" />Column number: 288</div>more resources available to carry out the duties described in the Bill?
I hope that I know what the Minister will say, but it is important that
such questions are answered on record to ensure that confidence is
maintained.</div><a name="08013166000056"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08013166000145"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes extremely good points
and I share his concern. We need to provide reassurance to the pensions
industry that the excellent work done by the Pensions Regulator, in the
role that it has adopted up to now of giving greater confidence
regarding pensions, will continue unabated, and that the new work that
it will take on to ensure that automatic enrolment is carried out will
be properly done in addition to its current work, rather than
distracting from that. It would be tragic if there were any serious
distraction from that important existing role. I have had meetings with
the regulator&#146;s senior management, who are confident that they
will be able to carry out their new duties and maintain the quality of
work that they have done up to now in protecting and overseeing the
pensions system as a whole. The objective of the new changes to which
the hon. Gentleman refers is to give a number of different obligations
to the regulator. Basically, the changes are designed to ensure that
employers comply with their new duties. The key duties are
automatically enrolling eligible qualifying jobholders into a
qualifying pension scheme; informing the regulator about how they
satisfy that duty; and paying pension contributions to the
schemes.</div> <a name="08013166000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">The work
that the regulator will do on such matters should not be unduly
onerous&#151;it will basically be collecting and managing
data&#151;but there should be intervention when there is a failure to
comply with the requirements of the Bill. The Pensions Regulator will
discuss such issues as resources with us in the coming months. I am not

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08013166000146"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08013166000147"></a>The

clause 1&#151;<i class="I">Offence of offering financial

offence is committed if an employer offers financial inducements to opt
out of an automatic enrolment
scheme.&#146;.</div><a name="08013166000064"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08013166000148"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:</b> We want to deter employers from encouraging
workers to opt out of pension scheme membership. Clause 49 ensures that
any agreement, including those involving inducements, that aims to
limit an employer&#146;s duties or a worker&#146;s rights under the
legislation is void. Workers will remain free to opt back into
qualifying pension scheme membership and to disregard any agreement to
the contrary. Employers that refuse to accept workers into the scheme
could receive penalties for failure to enrol. As a result of the
Government amendment, they would not be able to claw back any
inducements that they had
given.</div><a name="08013166000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">We believe that
that approach, backed by an effective communications strategy so that
both employers and workers are well informed about their rights and
responsibilities, is the best way forward. We do not think that making
it a criminal offence to offer inducements is the most effective way of
deterring employers. In practice, the intention of the employer in such
circumstances could be difficult to prove&#151;there is some concern
about the mens rea
there.</div><a name="08013166000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that the
Committee will be able to accept Government amendment No. 156. I will
not be able to accept new clause 1, but I hope that the changes made by
the amendment will reassure hon.
Members.</div><a name="08013166000067"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08013166000149"></a>Andrew
Selous:</b> We certainly support the Government amendment. An
employer should not be able to take back from employees any money given
to them to encourage, persuade or bribe them to opt out of
auto-enrolment. The measure is a sensible addition to clause
49.</div><a name="08013166000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to debate
further with the Minister the question of employers offering financial
inducements to their employees to opt out of auto-enrolment. It seems
that as far as some employers are concerned&#151;hopefully a small
minority&#151;there will be a clear financial incentive to pay money
to employees so that they do not automatically enrol, given that the
employers would save the 3 per cent. that would otherwise be added to
their payroll costs year on year. They might say to an employee,
&#147;Here&#146;s &#163;100,&#148;&#151;or &#163;500 or
&#163;1,000, who knows what the figure might be?&#151;&#147;this
isn&#146;t a good deal for you and there&#146;s a lot of
administration for me; it&#146;s a silly Government scheme. Why
don&#146;t you take the money now? You&#146;ll be better off and it
will save me the hassle.&#148; Under clause 49, such an agreement
would not stand, because the employee would be able to keep the money
and then chose to enrol in the scheme automatically. The TUC
representative who gave us evidence was pleased about that and said
that there might be some smart employees who would take the money and
automatically enrol&#151;one could not blame
them.</div><a name="08013166000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
a serious point, my genuine worry&#151;I am surprised that it is not
shared by the Minister or, indeed, all members of the
Committee&#151;is that there will be some employees, who perhaps do
not pay great attention to our proceedings or watch the news that
carefully, who 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column290" />Column number: 290</div>will take what is effectively a bribe from their employer to stay out of
the scheme without realising that they have lost out on what could be
an important and meaningful pension provision. Given that the Minister
wants to discourage employers from doing that, I am surprised that he
does not want to make it an offence for an employer to do something
that is against the intention of all three parties represented on the
Committee. If such action were an offence, that would be a further
deterrent to employers and would, therefore, be a small but useful
contribution to the Committee&#146;s
objectives.</div><a name="08013166000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will the
Minister elaborate on what exactly will happen, in terms of missed
contributions, when such a deal between and employer and an employee is
uncovered? In particular, will there be an onus on the employer to make
good on the contributions that should have been paid? We have had a
useful debate on the role of the Pensions Regulator. The TUC&#146;s
briefing asked whether the Pensions Regulator will look out for
employers who have atypically high numbers of staff who have opted out.
Will it be part of the regulator&#146;s role to survey employers and
spot unusual patterns of opt-outs that suggest that such financial
inducement or bribes might be involved? Such inducements would be in
the employers&#146; financial interest but not, in the vast majority
of cases, in the interest of the employees, although that is not to say
anything against the debate that we will have shortly on means-testing.
New clause 1 would provide an extra deterrent to stop employers from
doing something that we all agree is wrong. I will be interested to
hear the Minister&#146;s
response.</div><a name="08013166000113"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08013166000150"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> I agree with much of what the hon. Gentleman
said. Government amendment No. 156 makes a lot of sense in that it
seeks to close a loophole that would have allowed employers to claim
back any inducements that may have been offered to employees to get
them to opt out of a pension scheme. It is absolutely right that an
employee should not have to repay any such fee as it is the employer
who would have broken the law and should therefore take the
consequences.</div> <a name="08013166000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">I wish
also to speak in support of new clause 1, which adds something useful
to the Bill by creating this offence. It would add something to the
range of powers in the Bill, and knowing that this additional matter
was there would add to the sense that any employer considering such a
step would have about its gravity. I do not know whether it is the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s intention to press this new clause to a vote. No
doubt he will consider that having heard the Minister&#146;s
response, which I will certainly be interested to hear.</div>
<a name="08013166000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a
further issue which Government amendment No. 156 attempts to address,
and that is the issue of inducements being offered prior to someone
accepting a contract of employment. That is quite a difficult area,
which I tried to capture in amendment No. 98, which was quite naturally
not selected for debate, but where I think there is a genuine question.
This clause, for example, relates to something being written into an
employee&#146;s contract which obliges them to opt out of the
personal account, on the basis of which they accept some additional
financial emolument. Clearly, it is quite possible that such a
transaction would be proposed by an employer before the person had
accepted the job.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column291" />Column number: 291</div><a name="08013166000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
prospective employee turns up for interview, has the interview, and
then the employer says, &#147;I have offered you the job, but I would
like you to sign this contract&#148;. The potential employee sees the
contract and says, &#147;Hold on. This is not right. I am not going
to sign away my right to a personal account. It is an offence under the
Act&#148;. No doubt there will have been a very full publicity
campaign so that potential employees will be aware of their rights. The
employer then says, &#147;Sorry, I have changed my mind, I am not
going to offer you this job. I will look for somebody else&#148;.
Clearly, the employer would be in breach of the Act. Government
amendment No. 156, if anything, tightens up that restriction. I am
concerned about the position of someone who is not yet an employee.
They may have been denied the option to take a job for which they are
eminently qualified on the basis of an unwillingness to move forward in
the illegal way that the employer has
proposed.</div>
<a name="08013166000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">I note that both the TUC and
the Engineering Employers Federation are also concerned about this
issue, albeit a blanket pre-employment right might be too broad, not
least because it would potentially allow people to go to an employment
tribunal and claim that this was the reason, even though it was not.
None the less, it would be useful if, in the context of amendment No.
156 and new clause 1, the Minister would reassure the Committee on this
point, and perhaps look further at whether the provisions he is trying
to make with amendment No. 156 could be further strengthened to take
account of the concern I have
raised.</div><a name="08013166000076"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08013166000151"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:</b> I share the concerns of the
hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire and the hon. Member for
Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey; Inverness and points beyond.
Actually, there are no points beyond, are there? Points around. Our
view is that we are better off dealing with this stage of the problem,
at least, in employment contractual terms, rather than by criminalising
the employer. It is, perhaps, an odd situation when a Labour Government
are saying, &#147;Let&#146;s not criminalise the employers&#148;,
and the Conservatives are saying we should. We have looked at this with
a lot of care. The way we have set about this will provide a
significant degree of protection. If there is, of course, an employer
who continues despite warnings and despite the intervention of the
regulator, the TPR, saying to the employer you have got to start now
properly enrolling people, complying with your obligations, fulfilling
the purposes of this legislation, then there would be a criminal
sanction if the employer continued to be in breach.</div>
<a name="08013166000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">At the particular point at
which inducements are offered at the start of the employment, our view
is that this can be dealt with by a series of employment-related
penalties that have a financial consequence for the employer but do not
result in them in ending up in criminal courts. That is basically the
way in which we want to deal with
it.</div><a name="08013166000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hear what the hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire says. He is right
to identify the issue of inducements as a very serious one. He is
right, as is the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and
Strathspey, to indicate that the TUC, the EEF and other organisations
are concerned about this area. I 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column292" />Column number: 292</div>think we are best dealing with it in the employment relationship but I
am listening with care to what Members opposite are
saying.</div><a name="08013166000079"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08013166000152"></a>Andrew
Selous:</b> I just want to challenge the Minister&#146;s
logic. He said that the regulator would be able to go to the employer
and say that people are not auto-enrolled but the employer can at that
point say, &#147;My employees have taken themselves out. They said
they do not want to be auto-enrolled.&#148; As for this private bung
of &#163;500,000 or whatever it was, the employer has probably said
to the employee, &#147;You keep this quiet, my lad. We do not want
this getting out, do we? You have a nice extra bit in your pay packet,
a couple of fivers in a brown envelope late one Friday evening.&#148;
How is anyone going to know? I understand what the Minister is saying
but I think there is a slight flaw in his
logic.</div>
<a name="08013166000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not want to criminalise
any employers but from a competitive point of view, speaking as someone
very pro-business, I want a level playing field. I want decent
employers not to be undermined. Remember, we are talking about 3 per
cent. of payroll costs, which could be quite significant. I would argue
that the Minister is being slightly anti-competitive because he could
be allowing this practice which he said he does not want. My point is
that he is not going to know it is going on just by seeing people are
not auto-enrolled. I think this would be
useful.</div><a name="08013166000081"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08013166000153"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:</b> Again, I am listening with care to what is being
said. It is the case that in our discussions with employers&#146;
organisations they expressed some concerns that we should not move too
quickly to criminalise employers. There are sanctions here. We are
going to table a Government amendment in due course which will enhance
the value of our measure as a deterrent by preventing employers from
being able to claim back payments or benefits given to their workers as
part of any agreement that is rendered void by the clause.</div>
<a name="08013166000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">At the moment our view is that
keeping this in the realm of employment law presents a strong enough
way of preventing employers from taking this action. We anticipate that
the vast majority of employers will comply with the legislation but he
is right to say that there may well be small numbers who take the view
that they can breach the law. That would not be a competitive approach
and is one which could do quite a bit of damage to the employers who
are complying properly.</div>
<a name="08013166000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am listening with care to
what he says and interested as to how hard he is pushing this
particular proposal. We have taken a view up to now that we do not want
to move into the criminal law in this area. He seems to be pressing
quite hard that we should move into that area. I will be interested to
know whether he intends to press this new clause to a Division. It
might affect my view.</div>
<a name="08013166000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">He did raise
a couple of other issues in relation to missed contributions and
whether they would be enforced. I should tell him that any
contributions that are missed would be enforced. It is the case that we
would have the ability to get the employer to move into a position
where they make up the missed contributions if a person ought to have
been automatically enrolled and would have wanted to have been part of
a pension scheme&#151;in other words, would not have opted out. In 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column293" />Column number: 293</div>those circumstances, the TPR would be able to enforce the repayment of
those missed
contributions.</div><a name="08013166000085"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08013166000154"></a><b class="B">Mr.
David S. Borrow</b> (South Ribble) (Lab): Could my hon. and
learned Friend reassure me that should the problems raised by the hon.
Gentleman turn out to be true once the legislation has gone through and
is up and running, the Minister will be able to remedy the problems
quickly without bringing forward primary legislation&#151;to do it by
regulation rather than
legislation?</div><a name="08013166000086"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08013166000155"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:</b> We would not be able to regulate to bring in
criminal sanctions like that; we would have to do that in primary
legislation.</div><a name="08013166000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am interested in how hard hon. Members opposite wish to press this. I
do not have a closed mind on it. I am happy to give way to the hon.
Member to indicate whether he, in principle, wishes to press this,
which may influence my view about whether the Government should take
this back and look at it again.</div>
<a name="08013166000088"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08013166000156"></a>Andrew
Selous:</b> I think that it is a serious issue for the reasons
that I have already outlined. If I heard him right, the Minister said
that he was prepared to go back to the Department, sit down with his
officials and perhaps look at the area again. If he is prepared to do
that, we would be prepared to bear with him, perhaps until Report
stage, to see what he comes forward with. It is an important point and
the point made by the hon. Member for South Ribble, who is behind him
now, is also important. I do not want the window of opportunity to do
something to move on and we then find that it is difficult to do
something about
later.</div><a name="08013166000089"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08013166000157"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Member. I would also

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08013166000158"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> I share the concern of the hon. Member for
South-West Bedfordshire that it is a very serious issue. If the
Minister is saying that he will take the issue away and look at it
again, perhaps with a view to coming back at Report stage or in the
other place so it can be properly considered by the Government, that
would be very reasonable. There does need to be an additional power in
the area. It seems wise not to press the matter, if the Minister is
going to go away and look seriously at how an amendment could be
framed.</div>
<a name="08013166000091"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08013166000159"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:</b> We are interested in proceeding
by way of consensus on this. The Government&#146;s view had been that
we did not wish to move into the area of criminalising employers in
this particular regard at this stage. There have been strong views
expressed by the Opposition, both Conservatives and Liberal Democrats,
on this. Indeed, among my colleagues there are some views that this is
an area where we need to have a firm response by Parliament to the view
that employers should not provide these sorts of inducements and that,
therefore, a criminal sanction ought to be given serious consideration.
Therefore, I agree to give that serious consideration to the views
expressed and take this back and talk to the various stakeholder
organisations, on the basis that there are obviously some strong
feelings in Committee today.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08013166000160"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> I simply remind the Minister that in the

issues. I hope he will answer them in the coming

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08013166000161"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:</b> I am also conscious of a point
made by the hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire that I have not yet
dealt with. He asked me whether the regulator, as part of his role,
would be looking for unusual patterns of opt-out among employers and
employees. The answer to that question is yes, he will be. It is the
role of the Pensions Regulator to monitor the data in relation to the
level of opt-outs among employers. It will vary from sector to sector,
but we anticipate there will be an average level of automatic
enrolment, and that will enable the regulator to look for unusual
patterns of high opt-outs. It will then be able to intervene with those
employers to find out why those high levels are
present.</div><a name="08013166000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">If it is the
case that there is a non-unionised, low paid, edge-of-usual sector
practice that needs investigating, we would expect the Pensions
Regulator to be in a position where it could carry out a serious
examination of the circumstances in that employer&#146;s
organisation&#151;indeed, for the very competitive reasons that the
hon. Gentleman identified
earlier.</div><a name="08013166000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey asked some
important questions about pre-employment rights. We looked at this with
a great deal of care and were pressed by the TUC to consider whether
pre-employment rights should be present, because it would be
theoretically easy for employers to say &#147;We are not offering you
a job yet, but we are interviewing you and one of our questions will
be: are you going to sign up to the whole pensions deal? If you are, we
will take a decision based on that.&#148; So, in effect, before there
is a contract of employment, or an agreement, there is a view by the
employer that he will take a particular approach to an
employee.</div> <a name="08013166000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is the
problem, and it is one of the reasons why we proposed Govt amendment
No. 156, which we just dealt with. It gives the employee the ability to
have had an inducement, to have accepted the inducement&#151;in the
sense of accepting any &#147;bung&#148;, as the hon. Member for
South-West Bedfordshire put it&#151;and then, as soon as he is
employed, to say &#147;Fine, thank you for the bung, I&#146;m going
to keep that, but I now want to be automatically enrolled in the
pension scheme&#148; and there is nothing that the employer can do
about that.</div><a name="08013166000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">If we
decided to create a new pre-employment right, then the concern of
employers&#146; organisations would be that there has been pressure
in the past to create all sorts of other pre-employment rights. While I
did not detect a great objection to this particular one, it was to some
extent a matter of principle for them, that creating a pre-employment
right in this regard would then raise the question, &#147;If you do
it on this, why are you not doing it in a whole series of other
circumstances?&#148; That would be quite a significant change of
principle in terms of the way we have operated employment legislation
heretofore.</div>
<a name="08013166000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">So I think
the best approach is to put in place mechanisms to provide back-stop
assistance for employees who wish to be properly enrolled, and ensure
that we 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column295" />Column number: 295</div>have some financial sanctions for dealing with employers who seek to
offer inducements. The Conservatives have suggested that we go further
than that, and have criminal sanctions as well, but these would relate
to post-contractual rights.</div>
<a name="08013166000101"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08013166000162"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> I do understand what he is saying, but it does
leave me feeling somewhat uneasy, because the message we are sending to
potential employees who are offered a bung is to accept it and then
deal with it once they are in the job. While I understand the pragmatic
reality of that position, for somebody who is applying for a job to be
told, &#147;If your employer is trying to do something dodgy here,
the best thing is to get into the job, trouser the cash and then get
your pension rights&#148;, there is something about that solution
that leaves me feeling uneasy. I wonder whether some wording regarding
whether pensions rights should be discussed at an interview stage could
be brought into the Bill. It would fall short of an employment right,
but would still perhaps act as a disincentive to a breach of law
occurring if employers went down that
route.</div>
<a name="08013166000102"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08013166000163"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:</b> I am not sure the suggestion the hon. Gentleman
makes, which is that pension issues cannot be discussed in initial
discussions, would fall short of a pre-employment right. We therefore
need to approach this with some caution. He is right that we are
adopting a course which is inelegant and is perhaps not ideal. We all
know that we would rather take the course of action that he suggests in
general terms, but the breach of the broad principle that there are no
pre-employment rights is regarded by employers as an enormously
important one&#151;mainly because it could lead to a lot of other
demands. There is a view in industrial relations circles that there is
essentially a balance between employers and trade unions and employees
that needs to be very carefully maintained. While this particular
change might not, of itself, damage that balance, other things might
then flow from it and that balance might be undermined.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column296" />Column number: 296</div><a name="08013166000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is a tricky
situation and I understand why the hon. Gentleman feels uncomfortable
with the position. But it is one that we have negotiated and it is, in
a sense, part of what we have talked about in the past&#151;a
consensus whereby we have got the employers on board to support this. A
number of compromises have been made&#151;the TUC, for example,
wanted to bring employment rights and they have accepted that this
compromise, although not what they wanted, is one with which they can
live.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08013166000164"></a>Miss
Kirkbride:</b> While all of us have every sympathy with what
the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey is
saying, it would not always be the case in terms of discussing the
prospect of employment that the prospective employee would not want to
discuss pensions. There will be some situations where a pension will be
part of a whole package of measures making up that person&#146;s
employment. Therefore it would not be an advisable road to go down to
say that there is no discussion of these things in advance of being
offered a contract.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08013166000165"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:</b> That is an entirely fair point. Indeed, in some
employment situations, the pensions package is a big part of the
negotiation. At the same time and in defence of the hon. Member for
Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey, he is suggesting not so much
that the pension should not be discussed, but that an offer of
employment cannot be conditional upon an employee saying that he will
not take a pension, which is a slightly different point.</div>
<a name="08013166000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">While I understand the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s point, and I have some sympathy with it, for the
reasons I have given, we are probably best preserving the consensus
with the employer on this point and accepting that it is a part of the
overall agreement which has enabled broad-based support to be given to
the Bill.</div>
