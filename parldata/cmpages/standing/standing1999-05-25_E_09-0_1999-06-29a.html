<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Home Office (Mr. Paul Boateng):</B> On a point of order, Mr. Stevenson. I should like to clarify something that I said in Committee last Thursday. My hon. Friend the Member for Stretford and Urmston (Ms Hughes) had asked whether children could be cross-examined about their previous sexual behaviour. In column 224, I explained that children under 16 are not deemed to be capable of giving consent to sexual intercourse. Their previous sexual behaviour--if any--cannot therefore be used to support a defence of consent by a defendant.
<P>
At that time, I should have referred to the Harling case and to the dictum of Mr. Justice Humphreys, which makes an exception in the case of rape. As the Committee well knows, consent, or the lack of it, is one of the key elements in the offence of rape. In every case, the prosecution must prove that the complainant--whether a child, a man or a woman--did not consent and that the crime was committed against his or her will.
<P>
Where the child is young, the issue of consent is not likely to be a very live one for the jury; it is probable that the prosecution will not need to do much more than prove the child's age to prove the lack of consent. However, the nearer a child gets to 16, the more likely it is that consent will be a live issue. As we know, children below the age of 16 engage in sexual activity and on a consensual basis. Therefore, it will continue to be possible, under the Bill, for children to be cross-examined about their sexual behaviour pursuant to a defence of consent in rape cases.
<P>
Applications to admit such evidence will, however, have to follow the procedures laid down in clause 42 and meet the criteria set in clause 40 of the Bill. We have intentionally created high hurdles, and they will have to be crossed. They will ensure that children are cross-examined about their sexual behaviour only in rape cases and when that is strictly relevant to the issues at trial.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am sure that the Committee will be grateful for the Minister's assistance on that point.
<H4><center>Clause 41</center></H4>
<H4><center>Interpretation and application of section 40</center></H4>

Amendment made: No. 26, in page 30, line 7, leave out `other than' and insert

Clause 41, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 42</center></H4>
<H4><center>Procedure on applications under section 40</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 27, in page 30, line 35, after `court' insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(but in the absence of the jury, if there is one)'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendment No. 28.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> The amendments will place a statutory requirement on judges and magistrates to give their reasons for excluding or allowing evidence of a complainant's sexual behaviour. Reasons will have to be given in open court, so that it is clear to everyone what decision has been taken. The jury will not be present, so that it is not prejudiced by any discussion on evidence that has been ruled inadmissible.
<P>
The amendments were inspired by a meeting that I had with the Campaign to End Rape, and I am grateful to Monisha Bhaumik from the YWCA for the suggestion. Clause 40 and the surrounding clauses are fairly detailed, and it will not always be immediately clear why evidence is being admitted or excluded. The requirement to give reasons will ensure transparency. It should be absolutely clear to the court why evidence of sexual behaviour is or is not being allowed. Judges would often give reasons for admitting or excluding evidence in any case--this provision simply ensures that they will always do so.
<P>
I commend the amendments to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Greenway </B>(Ryedale): It seems from what the Minister has said that these are sensible amendments. A jury should be absent from such discussions, and one might have taken that point as read. However, it is good to have that clarification.
<P>
The requirement in amendment No. 28 to give
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``reasons for giving, or refusing''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
leave relates to the need to balance the interests of justice, which we discussed previously. Requiring the court to give an explanation for its decisions will assist that process. I am therefore happy to support the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Elfyn Llwyd </B>(Meirionnydd Nant Conwy): I agree that amendment No. 28 is entirely appropriate. However, should a party be aggrieved at the decision, how will the reasons given by the court be challenged, if at all?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> As the hon. Gentleman knows, the judge's decision is not subject to judicial review or, indeed, to any form of appeal to a higher court at that stage. However, the Court of Appeal would take cognisance of any reasons given in the lower court, should the matter end up before it. Of course, the reasons may form grounds for an appeal following the Court of Appeal's decision.
<P>
However, the hon. Gentleman knows that judicial review does not exist in relation to a trial on indictment. Of course, should reasons be given in the magistrates court, it is possible to proceed to the higher court or to a form of review by way of case stated.
<P>
I hope that that satisfies the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> It does. However, I did not have judicial review in mind. I was wondering how, in the round, those reasons will be evaluated, if challenged. However, I agree with the Minister and am grateful for his response.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Amendment made: No 28, in page 30, line 36, leave out `decision to give, or refuse,' and insert `reasons for giving, or refusing,'.--[Mr. Boateng.]
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Ms Julia Drown </B>(South Swindon): We discussed warnings to juries in previous debates, in which the Minister said that a judge's mandatory warning to a jury sometimes has the opposite effect to that intended.
<P>
Will the Minister now say whether, in formulating the clause, consideration has been given to whether there should be a mandatory warning in cases in which sexual-history evidence is introduced? That warning would involve telling the jury that consent on any previous occasion should not be taken to constitute consent on subsequent occasions; it certainly merits consideration.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> Existing safeguards are more than adequate to meet the interests of justice.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 42, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 43</center></H4>
<H4><center>Restrictions on reporting alleged offences involving persons under 18</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I beg to move amendment No 74, in page 31, line 19, leave out
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`when a minor shall while that person'<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and insert `shall while he'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments:
<P>
Government amendment No. 75.
<P>
Amendment No. 83, in page 31, line 27, after `offence', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`or (ab) do not apply unless a court having or most likely to have jurisdiction in relation to proceedings arising from the alleged offence is satisfied on an application made for that purpose by or on behalf of a person referred to in subsection (2) who is not a person by whom the offence is alleged to have been committed and having regard to the particular circumstances of the case that the interests of justice, the interests of the person who is a minor and the public interest in relation to freedom of expression are better served by the application of subsection (2) than by not applying it to the particular case.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Government amendments Nos. 76 to 79, 84, 85, 94 and 40.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> Amendments Nos. 74, 77 and 78 remove references   to a ``minor'' in clauses 43 and 44. We think that these references are not necessary, as the clauses already contain references to a person under the age of 18.
<P>
Amendment No. 40 is consequential to the agreement in the other place to move the point at which the reporting restrictions imposed by clause 43 apply, from the point of allegation to the point of commencement of a criminal investigation.
<P>
Clause 43 imposes restrictions on publishing the identity of young people who allegedly are offenders, victims or witnesses from the start of a criminal investigation until the moment that someone is charged with an offence, if the child does not turn 18 first. The remaining amendments to clause 43 are relevant to victims and witnesses only.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 84, 85 and 94 clarify who will be able to give a parental waiver in respect of children who allegedly are involved as victims or witnesses in a criminal offence committed in England, Wales, or Northern Ireland. That becomes important when a child is not living with one or both of its natural parents.
<P>
It is not impossible that the person with appropriate authority for such a child will be a Scottish resident. The Bill already provides for the possibility that the media wanting to publish the information in question will also be Scottish.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 75, 76 and 79 ensure that the restrictions--unlike restrictions provided by clause 43 in respect of young offenders--should be implemented only if a draft order to that effect has been approved by affirmative resolution procedure in both Houses. We prefer that course of action to amendment No. 83, although I well understand what prompted the hon. Member for Ryedale (Mr. Greenway) to table it. The Opposition would, by that amendment, change the basis of the restrictions imposed on the identification of child victims and witnesses in the circumstances described in clause 43 from mandatory arrangements--for which exceptions have nevertheless been provided--to restrictions that can be imposed only at the discretion of a court.
<P>
In preparing the Bill, we considered both a discretionary procedure that involved a parent applying for restrictions to be imposed and a procedure that involved the parent claiming the exercise of an otherwise dormant right for restrictions to apply. We concluded that there was no fair and practical way of making such systems work without other changes--not least imposing a short period of mandatory restrictions initially, to allow parents to find out and examine their options, and putting the court system, the police and parents to a great deal of trouble and expense.
<P>
That is why we chose not to go down the route of amendment No. 83, but to follow the route of tabling amendments Nos. 75, 76 and 79. I repeat that the purpose is to ensure that these restrictions--unlike those provided by clause 43 in respect of young offenders--be implemented only if a draft order to that effect has been approved by affirmative resolution procedure in both Houses. I hope that the hon. Member for Ryedale will feel, on reflection, that that meets his purposes in a manner that is less burdensome for the system and for would-be applicants.
<P>
The Committee will want to examine the question as to why we should have any restrictions on the identification of child victims and witnesses, unless they are required to protect the privacy of a court proceeding.
<P>
Media reporting of crime is an important part of the criminal justice process. The media rightly have a privileged place in the criminal justice process, above that of individual members of the public. Their presence in court, reporting on proceedings, ensures that the wider public can be confident that justice is open and that the power of the Executive is not misused.
<P>
But with that privilege must go responsibilities, and the media--like all those who take part in this process--need to acknowledge that children involved or implicated in criminal offences may need to be protected from harm. That is not just so that children can help to obtain justice for a defendant. Children themselves deserve special protections by virtue of their immaturity and special vulnerability and their involvement in a process that is designed primarily for adults.
<P>
The importance of measures that protect children from being emotionally damaged by their experience of the criminal justice process is second only to that of preserving the right of defendants to a fair trial. Once one starts considering where the best interests of a victim or witness lie, the distinction between the investigation stage and the court process becomes less important.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
We have, however, as I have outlined to the Committee, chosen in amendments Nos. 75, 76 and 79 to suspend the implementation of these restrictions. The answer to the question why we have done that is as follows. Consideration of these objections has been a process in which scrutiny by Parliament has gone hand in hand with discussions with the print and broadcast media. Those discussions have involved both correspondence and a number of constructive meetings with representatives of the broadcast and newspaper industry at national and local level and with Lord Wakeham, the chairman of the Press Complaints Commission.
<P>
The Home Secretary, Lord Williams of Mostyn and I have all taken an active part in the discussions with the print media. I am pleased that in the course of those discussions about the various alternatives open to us it has been suggested that it may be time to look at whether the media's own regulatory arrangements to protect vulnerable children could be strengthened in a way that is specific to children who might be harmed by publicity about a crime.
<P>
For the print media, that is a matter for self-regulation and it will obviously be a matter for editors. But we are pleased that the suggestion has been made that a review of the print media's code of practice might be undertaken. That would centre on the provisions of clause 6, which protects the interests of children.
<P>
I am very pleased that Lord Wakeham has told the Home Secretary that he supports this review and consideration of the suggestion that the code might be amended specifically to protect children who could be harmed by publicity about a crime. He has pointed out that it is in many ways existing best practice to consider the vulnerable position of such children, but that the industry might well decide therefore that there is merit in codifying such an obligation. I have a copy of a letter from the Home Secretary to Lord Wakeham about these matters which Lord Wakeham has agreed to our making public to hon. Members and I will arrange for it to be placed in the Library of both Houses after this debate.
<P>
As a Government who want self-regulation to work we would be happy if editors themselves sorted out such matters rather than our relying on statute to do it. As for the broadcasters, they are regulated independently by the Independent Television Commission and it will obviously need to consider what implications our new proposals have for the broadcast industry. I know that by and large, representatives of the broadcasters thought that the amendments that we tabled in the other place reflected existing good practice and gave editors enough scope for manoeuvre.
<P>
The amendments that I am speaking to today therefore reflect the following conclusions reached after the discussions and consultations that I have mentioned. We continue to think that an extra control mechanism is necessary to encourage editors to consider how their reporting of criminal offences might affect the children who are publicly identified in the process of making such reports. But given the reach of clause 43's restrictions and the number of reports that they might affect, and given the possibility that our aims might be achievable through other means, it is right that the provisions should not be implemented after Royal Assent unless there has been a further debate in both Houses. If the amendments are accepted, we are bound to undertake to keep the case for implementation under regular review, and I am happy to give such an undertaking. I can, of course, make no other promises that might fetter the decisions of the present and future Home Secretaries. However, further debates in Parliament about the restrictions will be arranged if, on consideration of the prevailing circumstances, we believe that it is necessary. A factor in the assessment will be whether we continue to have concerns about children being damaged by media reporting of crime.
<P>
I hope that in the circumstances that I have outlined, and understanding well why the hon. Member for Ryedale tabled amendment No. 83, he and the Committee will feel that we have achieved an acceptable balance between the interests that should be protected: those of the child and those of a free and unencumbered media, both of which are vital to good order and justice.

<P>

<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> First, I declare an interest as a consultant to ITV Network Ltd, which I have been advising for many years. What the Minister said about the broadcast media's view of the clauses is correct: they hold a much more relaxed view of the proposals, especially as they will include the Lords amendments and that tabled today by the Minister.
<P>
Our chief anxiety, which is reflected in amendment No. 83, concerns the print media, especially local and regional newspapers, which report the bulk of incidents involving criminal activity in their local community. Such stories rarely reach the national media and the tabloid press.
<P>
I want to thank the Minister for the gracious way in which he referred to amendment No. 83 and our reasons for tabling it. We are not completely satisfied that a case has been made against the amendment, which reverses the process in the clause in respect of a court injunction before prohibition on publication. The Minister has not fully explained his thinking, but I am pleased to learn that great thought was given to it, because it suggests that the balance was not easy to achieve because there are sound arguments on both sides. The House will want to examine the matter on Report, given the far-reaching nature of some of the provisions.
<P>
I have given much thought to the issue, and I reassure the Minister that we agree with the Government's seeking to prohibit the publication of the identity of a child or young person who may in the end be accused of a criminal offence.
<P>
Much has been made of the case of Adam Dent, a young student who was accused of rape, which destroyed his academic career, although he was never convicted of the offence. It begs the question about anonymity in rape cases, an issue that we may wish to consider on another occasion.
<P>
I have no doubt that the Government are justified in providing for a prohibition, but I have one or two brief queries about other elements of the structure which I shall raise in later stand part debates, in the same spirit as that of the Minister when he referred to the amendment. I hope that I have made my point clear.
<P>
We still have difficulty with the Government's reason for seeking a blanket prohibition on publication when the young person concerned may be the victim of, or a witness to, an incident which subsequently becomes subject to a criminal trial. I am not convinced by the Government's arguments. The matter has been debated ad nauseam in another place and in the media and as we want to make progress I shall not rehearse the arguments now.
<P>
I want to probe the Government's reasons for tabling their amendment. The Minister referred in detail to the discussions that he, the Home Secretary and Lord Williams of Mostyn had with Lord Wakeham. I, too, have spoken to Lord Wakeham, who shares the Minister's view that the Press Complaints Commission and some sections of the press--he obviously cannot speak for them all--were happy with the scheme of things because the proposal is a better solution to the problem of a blanket prohibition than that in the original Bill, notwithstanding the amendments that were made in the other place.
<P>
One cannot conclude, however, that it is the preferred option of the print media; on the contrary, their preferred option is a revised clause 43. My gut instinct is that the press probably think that this is about as good a deal as they are likely to get; it is better than what they were faced with when the Bill was published and there is thus some contentment and a willingness to say publicly that they can live with it. That was the spin apparent from the media reports of the Government amendment. One headline in the national press said, ``Straw solves gagging clause'', or something to that effect, and it reflected the sense of relief felt by some sections of the press. The Minister will not be surprised if we do not leave the matter there.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I do intend to say much more about amendment No. 83. The Home Secretary may lay an order that is subject to the affirmative resolution of both Houses, so I take on board what the Minister said about the opportunity for further debate and reflection. However, laying an order is not the same as passing primary legislation with all the scrutiny that that entails. If at some future date--we shall discuss when that might be--the Government decide to lay such an order, the structure that will come into play will not be satisfactory. Therefore, we must consider how we can provide a better structure should such an order be laid.
<P>
The order-making power will allow the Home Secretary to range into other areas of the Bill and to amend some of its structures. It is possible that--if we should have to revisit these issues--the Home Secretary may decide not to use his order-making power and may introduce primary legislation on the regulation of the press in general. The Minister must accept that that is a possibility. Although amendment No. 76 solves the problem for now, I am more concerned about solving the problem beyond now and into the future when such an order might be laid.
<P>
Amendment No. 83 would provide safeguards for child victims and witnesses, but would reverse the process in respect of how the prohibition on the publication of their identities is obtained. I accept what the Minister says about the suggestion possibly being expensive for parents, and that is something that we need to think about. However, a prohibition on the publication of identities of children might be appropriate in a case in which there are allegations that a member of staff in a social services council-run facility has systematically abused young children. In such circumstances, one can understand why such a prohibition is appropriate. There would be a degree of control over the release of news and information to allow the opportunity for an order to be sought and obtained. That would not necessarily be a hugely expensive process, and we might want to probe that point later or on Report.
<P>
I know that the provisions will not apply to Scotland, but the Dunblane tragedy has been mentioned. They will apply to Wolverhampton, however. An attack on children and their teacher took place there and it has been frequently cited in relation to whether there should be restrictions on publishing information on such events. That case was much publicised and shocked the nation. In many instances, children who go missing have been kidnapped, and the fact that the press has published a story of the kidnapping has stirred some people's memories and has been helpful and constructive to the police in securing the whereabouts of the young person. Tragically, that does not always happen, but it has sometimes.
<P>
Opposition Members--this is my personal view too--do not believe that the reversing of the process would be too onerous. We believe that the circumstances in which a prohibition is justified include those in which an opportunity to seek a court order could be taken.
<P>
In conclusion, I want to get to the heart of the problem. In terms of simple building blocks, the Government have brought forward proposals for a complete prohibition on publication, subject to certain minor exceptions that are set out in later clauses. If the amendment is accepted, the Government have said that they intend it to have the force of law, unless the Secretary of State brings forward an order, subject to affirmative resolution of both Houses, to the effect that the provisions be enacted.
<P>
I have to tell the Minister that while that may be a neat solution to a difficulty, it begs two important questions. I want to be as sincere as possible in questioning the Minister and I would be surprised if he did not expect to be questioned. The first problem is why the provision should be included. The Government say that they do not intend to implement it, so why have it? Why is it in the Bill at all? Why are we not considering an amendment that proposes to leave the proposal out of the Bill for now?
<P>
The Minister says that when the review of the code of practice that the Press Complaints Commission currently has in place is concluded, consultation will follow and further primary legislation will be introduced. However, though we have agreed that there is a case for prohibition, in respect of young people who may be the accused or the defendant in a criminal prosecution, on securing confidentiality of identity, the Government have not made a case for the prohibition--or at least the structure for it--that they are seeking in the Bill in respect of witnesses and victims. As I said, the Minister must answer why the structure should be in the Bill at all, if the intention is not to implement it.
<P>
That leads to the second and even more fundamental question, which the Minister did not address in his remarks. In what circumstances would the Government seek to introduce an order asking Parliament to approve, by affirmative resolution, the prohibition whose structure is contained in this and subsequent clauses? I want to put this in the best possible way, so that the Minister understands what I am driving at. People want reassurance, and in the spirit of the Pepper v. Hart principle, I want the Minister to state openly for the record the Government's expectations of ever bringing forward such an order.
<P>
The local newspaper community in particular wants reassurance. If local newspapers continue to abide by the rules and to take a responsible attitude in their publication of stories in which the welfare of young children is a sensitive issue, they need some reassurance that they will not suffer because one of the tabloids makes a mockery of the PCC's code of conduct and brings the entire newspaper industry into disrepute. The better option would therefore have been for the Government to remove these sensitive proposals from the Bill and await the outcome of the review of the code of practice.
<P>
There is nothing more that I can say to explain our position. I am grateful that the Minister thought that we had acted reasonably with amendment No. 83. I hope that he feels that there is a sense of relief and gratitude that there has been a climb-down of sorts. [Interruption.] That is a fair way of describing it. There has been a fair degree of relief all round that a solution has been found. I had a brief word in the Lobby with the Home Secretary about this and had to disappoint him by telling him that I did not think that we had entirely resolved the issue.
<P>
I do not want to be churlish about what the Government have sought to do: I just do not believe that they have made a case for it and I do not think that this solution makes complete sense. On balance, the matter should have been taken away to await the outcome of the review of the code of practice. We could then have revisited it in the same spirit of co-operation and constructive consensus which I hope that I have displayed this morning.
<P>
Depending on what the Minister and others say, Mr. Stevenson, I may have to catch your eye again in this brief debate. I do not intend to press amendment No. 83 and neither will the Opposition seek to obstruct the Committee's agreement to the Government amendments. However, I want to make it clear that allowing those amendments to be accepted does not mean that we are satisfied. We shall inevitably seek to return to this issue on Report.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hilton Dawson </B>(Lancaster and Wyre): I commend my hon. Friend the Minister for amendment No. 76, which is typically well balanced and sensible. I hope that he will keep the matter firmly under review, not only in terms of the PCC's review of the code of practice but with reference to national children's organisations such as the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children which are rightly concerned about this issue.
<P>
I detected no recognition in the speech of the hon. Member for Ryedale of the way that the national and local media in this country refer to and treat children. That is a matter of tremendous concern. Children and childhood are not understood by the media. Children are treated with grotesque insensitivity in the search for lurid headlines and stories. I regret that that applies to both the national and local press. Children in care are routinely referred to as offenders when the vast majority of young people in care have never committed any offence.
<P>
Children are routinely regarded as problems and the source of problems. They are often demonised by the press, and that is the context in which we are operating. I shall cite one example from last year. The way that the media treated Mary Bell was a national disgrace. They never reflected the fact that she committed her grave offences when she was a child. The way they treated her daughter, who was entirely innocent of any crime, was a monumental disgrace that shamed the whole country.
<P>
I am pleased that my hon. Friend has brought together a balanced approach. I hope that he will keep this serious matter under close review and will certainly not be as cavalier about it as the Opposition would wish.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Bob Russell </B>(Colchester): Before I was elected to Parliament, my career as a wordsmith included periods as a court reporter, news editor of the local weekly newspaper and editor of a weekly newspaper. I do not recognise the portrayal of journalists by the hon. Member for Lancaster and Wyre (Mr. Dawson).
<P>
I do not wish to be too controversial but I entirely support the thrust of the argument advanced by the hon. Member for Ryedale. If the matter is not pressed to a vote, I am sure that we will return to it another time.
<P>
I shall be brief, as the case has been eloquently made. However, if there has been so much close discussion and liaison with the media, why was the draconian ban on reporting proposed in the first place?--[Interruption.]
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike Hall </B>(Weaver Vale): Please continue.
<P>
<B>Mr. Russell:</B> Thank you.
<P>
The proposals were draconian in the extreme. Far from wanting less court reporting, especially in the weekly and provincial media, we should be encouraging greater coverage of court cases. When the Minister returns to Committee, will he give examples to justify the original draconian ban?
<P>
In conclusion, what has happened since the Government amendments were tabled? Have there been further representations from the Newspaper Society and the Guild of Editors, which--in contrast to some of those of whom we have heard--represent those who work in the newspaper world?
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I am not quite sure why the hon. Gentleman seeks to co-operate with the Minister's absence. He must have an extremely important reason for doing so, and therefore has my sympathy.
<P>
However, I shall aid him with a brief intervention. I have received many representations from the Guild of Editors and the UK Press Gazette. Those organisations welcome the Government amendment, but state categorically that they are worried that the problem has not been fully resolved.
<P>
<B>Mr. Russell:</B> I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman's intervention, which makes the point that I was seeking to establish.
<P>
The Minister espoused the view that everyone in the newspaper world believes that the Government amendments will resolve the problem. However, that is not the case. In an ideal world, the matter would be withdrawn for the reasons given by the hon. Member for Ryedale and reintroduced at a later date so that could be debated fully.
<P>
We must accept the lesser of two evils. However, will the Minister give examples justifying the draconian ban on reporting?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I apologise for not having heard all of the hon. Gentleman's contribution. He is a force of nature; I had to respond to a call of one. He will therefore understand the reason for my absence.
<P>
I shall certainly give the examples requested by the hon. Gentleman. A child found his name and photograph on the front page of a newspaper; he was identified as the boy who saw his father kill his mother. Children were identified as the children of a couple subject to a police raid on suspicion of drug dealing. A child was identified as the subject of a neighbourly dispute involving allegations--later declared unfounded--of sexual abuse. The hon. Member for Ryedale referred to Adam Dent, who was not convicted, indeed, was not even charged.
<P>
Those examples led to the introduction last year of the proposals in ``Speaking Up for Justice''. They were the subject of consultation and the Committee is the beneficiary of a system in which hot debate and the exchange of views in both Houses of Parliament, in the wider community and in local and national newsprints leads to reflection and consideration. As a result, we have a workable and practical understanding that balances strong conflicting interests.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Lancaster and Wyre referred to the interests of children and to the strongly held views of children's charities. Their interests must be balanced with those of a free and unencumbered media. The Government of the day must give appropriate regard to both sets of interests, and that is our responsibility. It is the privilege of the Opposition to engage in a certain amount of  stirring.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stephen Day </B>(Cheadle): It is the duty of the Opposition.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> The usually silent one says that it is the duty of the Opposition to engage in a certain amount of stirring, and I do not begrudge that fact. I have been there, done that and got the tee-shirt, which I am glad to hand over to the hon. Gentleman so that he can engage in leg-pulling. I have broad shoulders and I am thick-skinned, but he should be under no illusion about our views.
<P>
I am grateful to children's charities and to representatives of the media for the contribution that they have made to the debate.
<P>
Members from all sides have received carefully argued and thought-through representations from their local media. I have been out and about in the country and I recall an incident in Wolverhampton in which points were made that I promised to consider.
<P>
My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary, Lord Williams of Mostyn and I have been involved in a process of dialogue and reflection. As a result, we have developed a view. We do not believe that the restrictions, as formulated in the Bill, are unnecessary. They are necessary and we accept the reasoning behind ``Speaking Up for Justice''. We take the view that we do not need to impose the restrictions without a debate in both Houses under the affirmative resolution procedure. It is possible to strike a balance between the two strongly held conflict interests and to safeguard the interests of all. We have already explained clearly how that position was arrived at, and I am grateful to all those who contributed to it.
<P>
As I have said, self-regulation should be given the opportunity to work. It is a preferable option and we are satisfied that the interests of children can be protected in that way--in and by the mechanisms that I have outlined to the Committee. Implementation will be kept under regular review and if the current need for the restrictions in the Bill is seen to have been addressed in practice, there will be no need to implement them. The hon. Member for Colchester (Mr. Russell), who brings expertise from his own experience as a practising journalist, therefore has no need for concern. He will understand why the restrictions will need to be built into the Bill and put on the statute book. Adequate safeguards, through the affirmative resolution procedure, will be in place to ensure that the measures are not implemented before Parliament has had the opportunity to debate them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bob Russell:</B> Does the Minister agree that the vast majority of cases involving young children are reported in the weekly and provincial press? Newspapers are often wedded to their communities, have a responsibility to them and indeed behave responsibly. Will the Minister give an assurance that the one or two occasions on which the tabloid press nationally goes over the top will not be used as an excuse for a blanket ban on the weekly press?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> It would be quite wrong for me to get involved in a spat between the local and the national press. I have the highest regard for both and, in the main, neither is responsible for the regular harm that the Bill seeks to avoid. We must do all that we properly can to protect the interests of children while ensuring a free and unencumbered media, which also have a role to play in maintaining the interests of justice.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dawson:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that both the local and national press want to report children-related issues responsibly and properly and so should start to talk to young people? If they talked to young people, and to organisations that deal with young people in care, they might gain a different perception of the reporting of young people than that expressed by the hon. Member for Colchester.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> The point is made with force. It is important for the hon. Member for Ryedale to understand--I say this in response to his questions--that I cannot bind our successors in any way. That would be quite wrong. We can say that these restrictions would not be implemented without the affirmative resolution of both Houses and without a full debate.
<P>
The hon. Member for Colchester is aware of the outcome of the debates in both Houses about these clauses. That outcome achieves a workable balance and, through self-regulation, provides us with the basis upon which we can build in a way that adequately protects the interests of children.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
In the course of our deliberations we must strike an appropriate balance. I believe that we have done that. We will keep the implementation under regular review. It is clear from the correspondence that I have referred to that there is determination on both sides to make self-regulation work. The bona fides of both sides are unquestioned and incontrovertible. In those circumstances we can rest content in the knowledge that both Houses have done their proper work. The interests of children and of a free and unencumbered media have both been adequately safeguarded.

<P>

<B>Ms Drown:</B> Clause 45 gives the power to restrict reports about certain adult witnesses in criminal proceedings and I should be grateful if the Minister could confirm that in his discussions with the media he is looking at the position not only of children in courts, but of vulnerable adult witnesses. We have said that it is vital that witnesses in rape cases are not put off coming forward, and obviously if their identity is to be revealed in court that will deter them. It is not only the descriptions given in the clause such as witnesses' names and addresses that need to be restricted; they can be identified if the media describe their journey home or identify them as a member of an ethnic minority living in a certain neighbourhood.
<P>
Will the Minister assure Committee members that he is determined that the identity of witnesses should not be revealed in the press? Will he implement monitoring to ensure that the scandalous reporting that has taken place in the past is not repeated?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> My hon. Friend's comments will have been noted by all those with responsibility in that area.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss Government amendment No. 82.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> Government amendments Nos. 81 and 82 are drafting amendments, which are, nevertheless, important.
<P>
Government amendment No. 81 replaces references to a convening officer in the Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 1992 with references to a judge advocate. The Government believe that it is important that the amendment should be seen to relate to the application of the 1992 Act, which gives anonymity to complainants in sexual offence cases. The provisions of that Act apply to those tried in the criminal courts and extend to the service courts. Following a revision to the courts-martial procedure made by the Armed Forces Act 1996, the references in the 1992 Act to a convening officer are out of date. The amendments that we are making today remedy the omission of references that should have been included in the 1996 Act.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for his explanation. I raised the question of courts-martial in relation to another matter, which the Minister intends to address on Report. However, in light of his admission that the change should have been made in the 1996 Act, I have no choice but to welcome the amendment.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 85, in page 39, leave out `subsection (9)' and insert `subsections (8A) to (8D)'.--[Mr. Boateng.]
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I am sorry to detain the Committee. However, clause 49 is a significant provision, providing important defences on which publishers will rely in relation to the provisions that we discussed earlier. I may be wrong, but I suspect that those defences will still be appropriate in relation to the prohibition of publication of matters involving children and young people who may be defendants in criminal cases. That prohibition has been introduced by virtue of Government amendments to clause 43.
<P>
We have set on one side the question of children and young persons who are victims and witnesses. When young people are the accused, the clause will provide vital safeguards for local newspapers that immediately report an incident without having had the opportunity to consider all aspects of the provisions. That could apply in the early stages after the Bill receives Royal Assent.
<P>
Will the Minister explain the intentions behind the clause? Subsection (1) provides a defence for a charge under section 48 when the person does not realise that the published report includes any matter that contravenes the prohibition. That poses the question of what would happen when a newspaper published the identity of a young person who was thought to have been a witness to an offence and spoke to a journalist--who might be on the scene as quickly as the police or emergency services, depending on the crime--and it subsequently transpired that the individual young person was not a witness but ``it woz 'im wot done it''. His identity would have been published. In those circumstances, I hope that the defence in the subsection would be adequate. I see that once again, through my colloquial expression, I have got through to the Minister the precise point that I want to make.
<P>
Subsection (2) provides the crucial defence that it is okay to publish as long as at the time of publication the publisher
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``was not aware, and neither suspected nor had reason to suspect, that the criminal investigation in question had begun.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I have been trying hard to work out when criminal investigations begin. It is a serious point. The Minister will know from the many hours, indeed days, that he has spent poring over the Macpherson report on the Stephen Lawrence murder that one of the major criticisms of the police was that they did not appreciate what they were dealing with from the moment that they arrived on the scene. The fact is that from the second that a police officer arrives on the scene to find a young person lying dead on the pavement, a criminal investigation has begun. There is no time frame in which any reporting could be allowed. That is one extreme.
<P>
There is another extreme. Last week, for example, there was another awful train crash on the west coast main line near Winsford, probably in the constituency of the hon. Member for Weaver Vale (Mr. Hall).
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike Hall:</B> Adjacent.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> Adjacent to it. In my younger days when there were steam trains, I must have spent many a happy hour on that stretch of railway line. You will recall that those were good times, Mr. Stevenson.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Steam trains have their place, but can we please return to the clause?
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> It could have transpired that a child on the train was killed or seriously injured, or that children on board witnessed what took place. Subsequently, it could have become clear that the accident happened because the driver of the train was drunk. Until that was known, a criminal investigation was extremely unlikely, but one was held as soon as that information was available. The hon. Member for Lancaster and Wyre smiles, but my point is that the proposals could send the editors of newspapers to prison. The defence advanced by the Minister needs further explanation.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Another matter that relates to clause 51(3) is that of the defence of public interest. Clause 51(2) refers to the ``open reporting of crime'' and there seems to be a contradiction. How can we be serious in providing the media with the defence of public interest in the open reporting of crime if, under subsection (2), all bets are off if the criminal investigation has begun? In many criminal cases it will be obvious that a serious crime has been committed. An investigation begins the moment when the police arrive at the scene or even when the 999 call is received at police headquarters, because that may be alluded to in the criminal prosecution.
<P>
I hope that the Minister will be able to reassure the Committee on these matters. To judge by his reaction to what I said earlier, he realises that the proposal is extremely important. What will happen if it transpires that a person whose identity is published turns out to be the perpetrator of the offence and is accused in open court? I raise these points hoping that the Minister will clarify the Government's intentions.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. His colloquialisms always get through to me, but I hope that he does not expect me to put my hands up and say, ``It's a fair cop, guv, you've caught me bang to rights'', as many in the hon. Gentleman's past life must have done, and as he faithfully recorded in his policeman's notebook. Call me old fashioned, but I do not intend to go down that road, at least, not this morning.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman makes a serious point; it is right that we should consider the defences in detail. Clause 49 describes a number of defences against conviction for breach of reporting restrictions in clauses 43 to 46, and I shall take the hon. Gentleman through them. The clause provides that it shall be a defence for anyone charged under the clause
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``to prove that at the time of the alleged offence he was not aware, and neither suspected nor had reason to suspect, that the publication included . . .''--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
the material--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``in question.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That would include not knowing that the material in question related to an alleged offence or witness or--this is the point made by the hon. Member for Ryedale--that a criminal investigation had begun. The criminal investigation is referred to in clause 43(12)(b) as the investigation of an offence
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``with a view to it being ascertained whether a person should be charged with the offence''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It must be established that there has been an offence and that the police or another investigating authority are aware of it. It will be a defence to say, ``Well, I didn't know that a criminal investigation had begun''.
<P>
We want to emphasise that the Government do not intend to make it impossible to broadcast or publish live or contemporaneous reports that inadvertently identify children involved in an incident. As the hon. Members for Ryedale and for Colchester know--they referred to the role of local newspapers--such reports can be of positive public benefit, especially when more information is forthcoming as a result, and when the information is given to the public in a way that minimises the chances of unnecessary public concern or hysteria. It obviously helps when more information can be given.
<P>
When the publication identifies a young person as the victim of or witness to an offence which is not a sexual offence, it should be a defence to show that because of the public interest of the report, as defined in clause 51, the effect of the restrictions was such as to impose a substantial and unreasonable restriction on reporting. There is thus a sensitivity and an awareness about the practicalities of doing one's job in the media.
<P>
It shall also be a defence for those who publish material that identifies a young person as a victim of, or witness to, an offence which is not a sexual offence and in which a young person is aged under 16, to show that written consent to the inclusion of the material had been given. Written consent will be an effective defence against conviction only if a number of conditions, which are in the Bill, are satisfied.
<P>
<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> Is the standard of proof in the defences that the Minister is helpfully elucidating the standard criminal proof of beyond reasonable doubt or on the balance of probability?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> A defence is being raised, so it is for the prosecution to prove its case in the ordinary way, so that the jury is sure.
<P>
<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> I am latching on to the wording of subsection (2), which states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``it shall be a defence to prove''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
To what standard does it have to be proved? The words in the subsection could be misleading.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I hope that the Committee is not misled. The defence is to be established by the defendant on the balance of probabilities; the judge or jury do not have to be sure.
<P>
For those reasons, I hope that the Committee will allow the clause to stand part of the Bill. The measure contains adequate defences and protections for the freedom of the media and to avoid the traps and pitfalls that Opposition Members have outlined.

<P>
This is a minor amendment to ensure that the clause does not inadvertently allow somebody who is not competent to give evidence the opportunity to do so.
<P>
I am grateful to Professor Colin Tapper of Magdalen college, Oxford for suggesting to us that the formula could result in someone who is able to understand questions put by the court but who cannot give answers that can be understood being deemed as competent. That would be unfortunate and it is not what we intend.
<P>
We want to ensure that as many people as possible are able to give evidence at trial and we do not want to set unfair hurdles for them. The Bill, therefore, presumes that everyone is competent unless it is shown that he or she is not. I am sure that members of the Committee share that presumption about their colleagues and opponents. In our proceedings so far, we have not been disappointed.
<P>
To be competent a witness must, in the Government's view, be able to understand questions put to him and to give answers that can be understood by the court. This small amendment makes that point clear.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) an offence which is--
<P>
(i) created by regulations made under any such rules, and
<P>
(ii) designated for the purposes of this subsection by such regulations;'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 87 to 93.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> Members of the Committee will recall that the schedule amends several pieces of legislation to bring them into line with the European Court of Human Rights judgment in the Saunders case.
<P>
The schedule will ensure that answers given pursuant to a power of compulsion under the amended enactments cannot be used by the prosecution in subsequent criminal proceedings except for very limited purposes--specifically for offences, such as perjury, arising out of the giving of evidence itself. They are characterised as sanction offences and use of the power of compulsion for these proceedings is permissible under the European convention on human rights because in answering truthfully the interviewee does not incriminate himself in relation to such an offence.
<P>
The Bill already contains several exceptions in relation to the Perjury Act 1911, the Insolvency Act 1986, the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986 and their Scottish and Northern Ireland equivalents. The amendment will ensure that all potential sanction offences are covered.
<P>
The amendments are technical. They are intended to complete, in the insolvency area, the exceptions to the prohibition that the schedule imposes on the prosecution using answers given under compulsion in a criminal trial. The exceptions are necessary for the very limited purposes of proceedings, such as perjury proceedings, arising out of the giving of evidence that can be characterised as ``sanction'' offences.
<P>
Amendment Nos. 86 and 90 provide for exceptions to be made in respect of relevant offences created by regulations made by the Secretary of State under rules in the Insolvency Act 1986. Amendment Nos. 87 and 88 provide for exceptions in relation to the Perjury Act 1911 to be extended to include section 1 of that Act, which deals with perjury committed in judicial proceedings. Amendments Nos. 89 to 93 are necessary corresponding amendments for Northern Ireland.
<P>
I hope that my explanation means that the Committee will feel able, in its heart, to accept the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> The Minister asked the Committee to have the heart to support the amendments, so we must be getting into the home straight.
<P>
I warmly welcome the changes. I shall respond with as much grace as the Minister showed when he made his request, but I would like to ask him a question. Yesterday, the House gave an unopposed Second Reading to the Financial Services and Markets Bill, and such is the onerous work load of Opposition Members that I spoke in the debate and at considerable length. I also have interests in the insurance industry.

There was a huge debate about the European convention on human rights implications of the Financial Services and Markets Bill, and I do not doubt that members of the Committee have had representations on that. Will the Under-Secretary give us an assurance that he will take an interest to ensure that the drafting of that Bill meets the convention's requirements? The legislation that the schedule amends is virtually identical to aspects of that Bill, which will create a number of draconian offences. The opportunity that individuals have to incriminate themselves because of the information that they will be required to give to comply with the provisions of that Bill will be significant, and the circumstances in which such information could be used in a criminal trial will be restricted. Therefore, will the Minister assure us that the provisions of the schedule are incorporated in the Financial Services and Markets Bill before it completes its passage through the House?

<B>Mr. George Howarth:</B> If I were to go too far along that road--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I will allow the Minister to respond, but I do not want him to stray on to a discussion of the Financial Services and Markets Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I am grateful for your guidance, Mr. Stevenson. I noticed from the Annunciator screen that the hon. Member for Ryedale spoke in the debate last night, and I was impressed by the peripatetic nature of his interests and skills. He will be aware that the cover of the Bill contains a declaration from my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary which states that, in his view, all the provisions of this Bill are compatible with the convention rights. The cover of the Financial Services and Markets Bill will contain a similar declaration from my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer. However, I assure the hon. Gentleman that there will be dialogue between the Home Office and the Treasury to ensure that his concerns are adequately covered.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
Brought up, and read the First time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss Government amendments Nos. 29 to 39.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> This group of amendments implements a Law Commission recommendation that section 69 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 should be repealed. New clause 2 will repeal that provision; Government amendments Nos. 29 to 39 are consequential amendments, relating to that repeal.
<P>
Section 69 of PACE provides that a document produced by a computer may not be adduced as evidence unless it is shown that the computer was operating properly and was not used improperly. The provision was based on the recommendations in the 1972 Criminal Law Revision Committee report and was intended to clarify the law on the admissibility of computer evidence in response to the growing importance and use of computers. Of course, comparing computer technology in 1972 with that of today is a bit like comparing the spinning jenny with a modern high-powered loom. [Interruption.]
<P>
Although sorely tempted, I shall not respond to sedentary mutterings. However, I am stung by the reference to spin-doctoring made by the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr Llwyd).
<P>
Technology has moved on, which is why we need new clause 2. The rapid advances in computer technology have made section 69 of PACE an increasingly difficult hurdle for the prosecution and defence to overcome. before computer evidence can be used, the party seeking to adduce it must prove that the computer was reliable at the material time.
<P>
Computer developments have made it increasingly impractical to examine all the intricacies of computer operation and certify that they comply with the requirement. Indeed, most Committee members know from domestic experience that one's eight-year-old child is the only person on whom one can absolutely rely to tell one how one's computer works. The younger one's children, the better they are at that.
<P>
We have been taking steps to keep eight-year-olds out of court. [Laughter.]
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> What laws would be contravened if the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, the hon. Member for North Warwickshire (Mr. O'Brien), employed eight-year-olds to work in the passport office.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> We try to extend the hand of friendship, and what do we get? That'll learn me.
<P>
Greater use of modern technology places a growing burden on business to supply section 69 certificates for criminal trials and provide members of staff to give evidence in court. For example, everyday till receipts showing the purchase of goods have required certificates under section 69.
<P>
That is a complete waste of time for the court, the prosecution and defence. In the case of evidence from the defendant's computer, it is plainly impossible for the prosecution to provide an operator's certificate that the computer was working correctly. Frankly, it is absurd that such evidence should be excluded as the result of the unavailability of a section 69 certificate.
<P>
Of course, those problems apply equally in relation to the defence. A defendant could be prevented from using computer evidence that might exculpate him, merely because he could not prove that the computer was reliable. That would be grossly unfair. The Law Commission therefore concluded that present law was unsatisfactory and recommended that the section be repealed without replacement--a view supported by the vast majority of respondents to the Law Commission's consultation on hearsay. In Scotland, New Zealand, the United States and Canada there is no separate scheme for computer evidence and no problems appear to have arisen.
<P>
The effect of repeal will be that common law will apply and, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, the courts will presume that computer systems are in order. If there is evidence that a computer may not have been working correctly, the party seeking to adduce the evidence will still need to prove the point. That is how the law currently deals with evidence from mechanical sources--for example, traffic lights and speedometers--and it works perfectly well. The Government believe that the repeal will redress the balance and enable the courts to take proper account of the increasing value of computer-related evidence. I therefore support the new clause.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause read a Second time, and added to the Bill.
<H4><center>New Clause 3</center></H4>
<H4><center>Special provisions relating to child witnesses</center></H4>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`.--(1) For the purposes of this section--
<P>
(a) a witness in criminal proceedings is a ``child witness'' if he is an eligible witness by reason of section 16(1)(a) (whether or not he is an eligible witness by reason of any other provision of section 16 or 17);
<P>
(b) a child witness is ``in need of special protection'' if the offence (or any of the offences) to which the proceedings relate is--
<P>
(i) an offence falling within section 34(3)(a) (sexual offences etc.), or
<P>
(ii) an offence falling within section 34(3)(b), (c) or (d) (kidnapping, assaults etc.); and
<P>
(c) a ``relevant recording'', in relation to a child witness, is a video recording of an interview of the witness made with a view to its admission as evidence in chief of the witness.
<P>
(2) Where the court, in making a determination for the purposes of section 19(2), determines that a witness in criminal proceedings is a child witness, the court must--
<P>
(a) first have regard to subsections (3) to (7) below; and
<P>
(b) then have regard to section 19(2);
<P>
and for the purposes of section 19(2), as it then applies to the witness, any special measures required to be applied in relation to him by virtue of this section shall be treated as if they were measures determined by the court, pursuant to section 19(2)(a) and (b)(i), to be ones that (whether on their own or with any other special measures) would be likely to maximise, so far as practicable, the quality of his evidence.
<P>
(3) The primary rule in the case of a child witness is that the court must give a special measures direction in relation to the witness which complies with the following requirements--
<P>
(a) it must provide for any relevant recording to be admitted under section 26 (video recorded evidence in chief); and
<P>
(b) it must provide for any evidence given by the witness in the proceedings which is not given by means of a video recording (whether in chief or otherwise) to be given by means of a live link in accordance with section 23.
<P>
(4) The primary rule is subject to the following limitations--
<P>
(a) the requirement contained in subsection (3)(a) or (b) has effect subject to the availability (within the meaning of section 18(2)) of the special measure in question in relation to the witness;
<P>
(b) the requirement contained in subsection (3)(a) also has effect subject to section 26(2); and
<P>
(c) the rule does not apply to the extent that the court is satisfied that compliance with it would not be likely to maximise the quality of the witness's evidence so far as practicable (whether because the application to that evidence of one or more other special measures available in relation to the witness would have that result or for any other reason).
<P>
(5) However, subsection (4)(c) does not apply in relation to a child witness in need of special protection.
<P>
(6) Where a child witness is in need of special protection by virtue of subsection (1)(b)(i), any special measures direction given by the court which complies with the requirement contained in subsection (3)(a) must in addition provide for the special measure available under section 27 (video recorded cross-examination or re-examination) to apply in relation to the witness.
<P>
(7) The requirement contained in subsection (6) has effect subject to the following limitations--
<P>
(a) it has effect subject to the availability (within the meaning of section 18(2)) of that special measure in relation to the witness; and
<P>
(b) it does not apply if the witness has informed the court that he does not want that special measure to apply in relation to him.
<P>
(8) Where a special measures direction is given in relation to a child witness who is an eligible witness by reason only of section 16(1)(a), then--
<P>
(a) subject to subsection (9) below, and
<P>
(b) except where the witness has already begun to give evidence in the proceedings,
<P>
the direction shall cease to have effect at the time when the witness attains the age of l7.
<P>
(9) Where a special measures direction is given in relation to a child witness who is an eligible witness by reason only of section 16(1)(a) and--
<P>
(a) the direction provides--
<P>
(i) for any relevant recording to be admitted under section 26 as evidence in chief of the witness, or
<P>
(ii) for the special measure available under section 27 to apply in relation to the witness, and
<P>
(b) if it provides for that special measure to so apply, the witness is still under the age of 17 when the video recording is made for the purposes of section 27,
<P>
then, so far as it provides as mentioned in paragraph (a)(i) or (ii) above, the direction shall continue to have effect in accordance with section 20(1) even though the witness subsequently attains that age.'.--[Mr. Boateng.]<P>

<H4><center>Extension of provisions of section</center></H4>
(Special provisions relating to child witnesses) to certain witnesses over 17
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`.--(1) For the purposes of this section--
<P>
(a) a witness in criminal proceedings (other than the accused) is a ``qualifying witness'' if he--
<P>
(i) is not an eligible witness at the time of the hearing (as defined by section 16(3)), but
<P>
(ii) was under the age of 17 when a relevant recording was made;
<P>
(b) a qualifying witness is ``in need of special protection'' if the offence (or any of the offences) to which the proceedings relate is--
<P>
(i) an offence falling within section 34(3)(a) (sexual offences etc.), or
<P>
(ii) an offence falling within section 34(3)(b), (c) or (d) (kidnapping assaults etc.); and
<P>
(c) a ``relevant recording'', in relation to a qualifying witness, is a video recording of an interview of the witness made with a view to its admission as evidence in chief of the witness.
<P>
(2) Subsections (2) to (7) of section (Special provisions relating to child witnesses) shall apply as follows in relation to a qualifying witness--
<P>
(a) subsections (2) to (4), so far as relating to the giving of a direction complying with the requirement contained in subsection (3)(a), shall apply to a qualifying witness in respect of the relevant recording as they apply to a child witness (within the meaning of that section);
<P>
(b) subsection (5), so far as relating to the giving of such a direction, shall apply to a qualifying witness in need of special protection as it applies to a child witness in need of special protection (within the meaning of that section); and
<P>
(c) subsections (6) and (7) shall apply to a qualifying witness in need of special protection by virtue of subsection (1)(b)(i) above as they apply to such a child witness as is mentioned in subsection (6).'.--[Mr. Boateng.]<P>

<B>Mr. George Howarth:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 96, in page 72, line 3, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>` . In section 51 (offences of intimidating, and of doing or threatening harm to, witnesses, jurors and others), for subsections (1) to (3) substitute--
<P>
``(1) A person commits an offence if--
<P>
(a) he does an act which intimidates, and is intended to intimidate, another person (``the victim''),
<P>
(b) he does the act knowing or believing that the victim is assisting in the investigation of an offence or is a witness or potential witness or a juror or potential juror in proceedings for an offence, and
<P>
(c) he does it intending thereby to cause the investigation or the course of justice to be obstructed, perverted or interfered with.
<P>
(2) A person commits an offence if--
<P>
(a) he does an act which harms, and is intended to harm, another person or, intending to cause another person to fear harm, he threatens to do an act which would harm that other person,
<P>
(b) he does or threatens to do the act knowing or believing that the person harmed or threatened to be harmed (``the victim''), or some other person, has assisted in an investigation into an offence or has given evidence or particular evidence in proceedings for an offence, or has acted as a juror or concurred in a particular verdict in proceedings for an offence, and
<P>
(c) he does or threatens to do it because of that knowledge or belief.
<P>
(3) For the purposes of subsections (1) and (2) it is immaterial that the act is or would be done, or that the threat is made--
<P>
(a) otherwise than in the presence of the victim; or
<P>
(b) to a person other than the victim.'''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendment, No. 97.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> A recent judicial decision on intimidation of witnesses through a third party, although overturned by the Court of Appeal, has raised some concerns about the drafting of the law in section 51 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994. The essence of the misunderstanding appears to be in relation to section 51(3), which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``A person does an action `to' another person with the intention of intimidating, or (as the case may be) harming, that other person not only where the act is done in the presence of that other and directed at him directly but also where the act is done to a third person and is intended in the circumstances to intimidate or (as the case may be) harm the person at whom the act is directed.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I hope that the Committee could follow that. It has been suggested that a threat to harm the witness, relayed through a third party, would not be caught by the offence. The Court of Appeal's recent ruling confirmed that it would. Nevertheless, the Government feel that we should not lose this opportunity to put the matter beyond doubt.
<P>
The amendment seeks to clarify the law as it stands. It does not in any way change the existing provisions but merely clarifies the position in relation to the intimidation of witnesses and others involved in criminal investigations and proceedings. I hope that on the understanding that this has arisen out of experience and that we feel that there is a need for this change, the Committee will feel able to support it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I recall the 1994 legislation being passed. It is staggering to think that it is five years ago. How quickly time flies. I am grateful for the Under-Secretary's explanation of the amendment. On the basis of his comment that this helps to improve and strengthen that legislation in the light of experience, I am happy to give the Opposition's support to the amendment.

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) For the purposes of the Scotland Act 1998, any provision of this Act which extends to Scotland shall be taken to be a pre-commencement enactment within the meaning of that Act.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The effect of the amendment is to ensure that the ministerial functions conferred by the Bill, so far as they are exercisable under devolved competence, would transfer automatically under section 53 of the Scotland Act 1998 to Scottish Ministers. That section provides, among other things, that the functions conferred on a Minister of the Crown by any pre-commencement enactment shall, as far as they relate to devolved matters, be exercisable by Scottish Ministers instead. Pre-commencement enactments include any Acts passed in the same Session as the Scotland Act 1998 but not Bills in the present Session--such as this one--which effectively straddle the commencement period.
<P>
The amendment ensures that for the purposes of the Scotland Act 1998 this Bill is deemed to be a pre-commencement enactment. I am grateful for the reminder on Second Reading from the hon. Member for Perth (Ms Cunningham) that this so-called deeming provision would be needed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I am happy to accept what the Minister said about amendment No. 42, but I would be grateful if he would say a few words about his proposal to omit subsection (10) of the clause.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman knows that that is the next amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I beg your pardon, Mr. Stevenson.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 41, in page 47, line 34, leave out subsection (10).
<P>
I now come to the amendment that was causing the hon. Member for Ryedale to become agitated. When the Bill started its passage in another place, subsection (10) was inserted in the usual way to avoid infringing the privilege of this House to control charges on public funds. Now that the Bill has passed to this House, we need to omit the subsection--again in the usual way--so that public funds can be used to implement the Bill.
<P>
The Bill will incur some charge on public funds, as its explanatory notes make clear. We expect part I to save more than 4 million overall, but part II is likely to cost more than 6 million. Therefore, the Bill will result in additional expenditure.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> In a momentary aberration, I thought that the two amendments to the clause had been taken together. Such a mistake is easily made, especially when one is endeavouring to reach the conclusion to our proceedings.
<P>
I understand the point that the amendment is a routine nicety. I hope that the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy is not about to leave the Room, because I think that he will agree with what I am about to say. We have a good opportunity now, which we shall not have on Report, to place on record our concerns about cost. If the measures in part I are implemented with the enthusiasm and vigour that are necessary, the Bill will prove rather more expensive than the Government suggest. The cost of establishing and running youth offending teams and the prospect of establishing, in the fullness of time, several thousand youth offender panels for first-time young offenders who plead guilty will prove more expensive than the Government admit.
<P>
<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for naming and shaming me. I am due to attend a Select Committee upstairs. However, I am pleased that I stayed here, because the hon. Gentleman's words were extremely wise.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his comment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bob Russell:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that, if the Bill works as  we hope that it does, the costs will be more than offset by fewer young people being drawn into a life of crime?

<P>

<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> That is what we hope. Individuals suffer from property crime, but the extent to which the public purse benefits from a reduction in crime is a matter that we could debate in great detail. I suggest that we do not do that now. If the hon. Gentleman is making the point that stopping young people offending will not only make life easier and more pleasant for our citizens but reduce the overall cost of crime, he is right. However, we are discussing the financial cost of specific measures in the Bill. In that regard, I am grateful for the support of the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy.
<P>
I have put down a marker, and do not intend to labour my point. Of course, we are happy to support the amendment and understand the reason for it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> A love fest seems to be taking place between members of Opposition parties.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dawson:</B> Ugh.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I agree: that is a rather horrible thought. Nevertheless, things began to fall apart when, true to form, the hon. Member for Colchester made his point. Such an event has characterised aspects of the Opposition parties' ``united'' front throughout our consideration of the Bill.
<P>
I do not want to be churlish as we reach the end of proceedings. However, let me refer the hon. Gentleman to the explanatory notes on the Bill, in which the measure's financial effects are outlined. Page 36 of that document states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Referrals to youth offender panels will save the Probation Service around 5.1 million, but will impose costs of around 0.5 million because of loss of revenue from fines.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The document goes on to state:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Clause 6 will result in some increased recruitment and training costs, which will be met by the Comprehensive Spending Review settlement for pilot youth justice schemes in 2000/2001 and 2001/2002.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That needs to be considered in relation to what the hon. Member for Colchester said about part I of the Bill reducing the costs of the youth justice system in the long term by reducing young people's offending.
<P>
I hope that I have reassured Opposition Members that we have carefully evaluated the gains and benefits of the Bill. I therefore hope that they will give the clause and the Government amendments a fair wind.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Clause 66, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
Amendment made: No. 97, in line 4, after `proceedings;' insert `to amend section 51 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994;'.--[Mr. Boateng.]
<P>
Question proposed, That the Chairman do report the Bill, as amended, to the House.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I wish to thank you, Mr. Stevenson, and Mrs. Roe and Mrs. Michie for chairing our proceedings.
<P>
Working in this Committee has been a pleasurable experience. As we said at the outset, we have endeavoured to be constructive, although--as my hon. Friend the Member for Cheadle (Mr. Day) reminded us--the Opposition have a duty to scrutinise the Bill. I hope that those outside this House who have cause to revisit our deliberations and seek greater clarity on the Bill will find our debates helpful.
<P>
We have remaining anxieties about certain aspects of the Bill, although we support its general thrust. We certainly look forward to debating matters further on the Floor of the House; I believe that that has been scheduled for next week.
<P>
However, let me reiterate my thanks for the way in which you, Mr. Stevenson, and your colleagues have chaired the Committee. I also thank the Ministers and their Back-Bench colleagues for contributing to a friendly, well ordered and constructive Committee. We shall certainly look back on our participation in it as a pleasurable experience.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> On behalf of the Government, it is my duty and pleasure to thank you, Mr. Stevenson, and your colleagues, Mrs. Roe and Mrs. Michie, for presiding over our proceedings. Yours has been a light but firm touch; you have had to rein in our enthusiasms from time to time, particularly as we scented the stables and cantered towards the end of proceedings this morning.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
At all times our proceedings have been conducted in a good humoured way. Importantly, our deliberations have gone into considerable detail on certain sections of the Bill, and we have all been aware of the seriousness of its content. I am enormously grateful to hon. Members on both sides of the Committee for their attention to our revising and amending function. I am especially grateful to my hon. Friends, who shared their in-depth knowledge of these matters while, from time to time, having to restrain themselves when they would have preferred to say more. That was much appreciated.
<P>
I am also particularly grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Knowsley, North and Sefton, East (Mr. Howarth), who shared the burden--no, it has not been a burden but a pleasure, so he shared with me the responsibility of dealing with the Committee. I also thank the silent one who sits scribbling to the end, my hon. Friend the Member for Weaver Vale. I should also like to thank the most silent hon. Member of all who, by convention, makes no contribution to the Committee, but who has been assiduous in her attention to issues involving vulnerable witnesses and victims. I refer to my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Edgbaston (Ms Stuart), whose contribution has been enormous. Much thanks to all who served our proceedings.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> On behalf of my co-Chairmen, Mrs. Roe and Mrs. Michie--to whom I wish to record my thanks--I acknowledge the kind remarks from both sides of the Committee, which are much appreciated. I should also like to add my thanks to the Clerks and to the Hansard reporters, who miraculously achieve verbatim reports of our proceedings. We are and should always be grateful to them. Finally, I thank members of the Committee for their forbearance, patience and, on most occasions, self-discipline.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
