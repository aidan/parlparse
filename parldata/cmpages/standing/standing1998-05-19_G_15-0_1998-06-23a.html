</P>

<P>
<B>The Minister for Competition and Consumer Affairs (Mr. Nigel Griffiths):</b> On a point of order,
Mr. Maxton. I should like to clarify a point concerning 
the provisions of the Bill relating to the powers of entry 
into domestic premises. During the eleventh sitting of the 
Committee, I said:

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The safeguard is that domestic premises may be entered only if 
they are also used in connection with the affairs of an 
undertaking." [Official Report, Standing Committee G, 16 June 
1998; c. 421.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I wish to make it clear that domestic premises may be 
entered if documents relating to the affairs of an 
undertaking are kept there. I am advised that the phrase 
"used in connection with" does not fully cover that latter 
point. The Bill is clear, however, in that clause 59 sets 
out both elements separately, so anyone reading the clause 
will be in no doubt.

<P>
<B>Mr. John Redwood (Wokingham):</B> Further to that 
point of order, Mr. Maxton. I find the Under-Secretary's 
change of spirit and heart disappointing. It is not a 
clarification; it is a change of view. We took his previous 
statement to be a welcome change of heart. He implied 
that unless one had an office at one's home, one's home 
would be exempt from such treatment. We now learn that 
that is not so. I fear that we shall need a further debate on 
that matter, as soon as possible.

<P>
<B>Mr. John Bercow (Buckingham):</B> Further to that point 
of order, Mr. Maxton.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. It is not a point of order. This 
is not a debate the Under-Secretary was clarifying a 
matter. I am sure that hon. Members will use their 
ingenuity to make their points in a later debate or, if 
they so wish, they can table amendments on Report.

<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<P>
Clause 69 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 70</center></H4>
<H4><center>Regulations, orders and rules</center></H4>

<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Lansley (South Cambridgeshire):</B> I beg 
to move amendment No. 188, in page 39, line 5 at end 
insert 

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(e) section 51, or'

<P>
(f) paragraph 7 of Schedule 3.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Good morning, Mr. Maxton. Clause 70 gives a power 
to make regulations and orders. Subsection (4) provides 
that, in specific parts of the Bill, statutory instruments are 
not to be made unless they have first been laid before 
Parliament and approved by resolution of each House.

<P>
My supposition is that the Government properly intend 
to bring within the ambit of subsection (4) and thus 
secondary legislation should require an affirmative 
resolution those matters that hon. members would want 
to debate before orders were made. We can reasonably 
take it as read that a negative resolution would be 
provided for if such a debate was not expected and if the 
necessity for hon. members to comment in detail upon 
the particular provisions of such secondary legislation was 
unlikely to arise.

<P>
Amendment No. 188 would insert in subsection (4) two 
further provisions, in paragraphs (e) and (f), for which an 
affirmative resolution should be provided. Perversely,
I shall not take them in order of the amendment. 
Paragraph (f) provides that negative resolution orders 
should not be made under

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"paragraph 7 of schedule 3".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
You, Mr. Maxton, will recall our previous discussions on 
the subject, which I have no intention of repeating, not 
least to avoid trying your patience. Paragraph 7 of 
schedule 3 provides that the Secretary of State may make 
an exemption in relation to the chapter I prohibition for

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"exceptional and compelling reasons of public policy".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Under-Secretary quite rightly referred to "exceptional 
and compelling reasons" in that context as being a high 
test. By implication, his argument was that if a Minister 
was so persuaded that that high test of "exceptional and 
compelling reasons" had been overcome, by definition the 
House would concur with that, and that there was 
therefore no need for the affirmative resolution procedure.

<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Boswell (Daventry):</B> My hon. Friend is 
making his usual precise argument. I seek only to clarify 
it by pointing out that, on my reading of the schedule, we 
are discussing exclusions rather than exemptions.

<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> My hon. Friend has it exactly right; we 
are indeed discussing exclusions rather than exemption 
although I shall not test the Committee's patience by 
trying to examine the implications of the matter being 
exclusions rather than exemptions. I do not think that 
anything follows from that, and the argument for 
amendment No. 188 remains the same regardless of 
whether the Schedule refers to exclusions or exemptions.

<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I am extremely sorry to intervene at this 
early point, but unfortunately the fog of confusion has 
now descended on me. Is my hon. Friend saying, in his 
usual courteous fashion, that the point made by my hon. 
Friend the Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) is right 
but irrelevant?

<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> In his helpful way, my hon. Friend has 
it just about right. If the Secretary of State were to be so 
empowered by paragraph 7 to make exemptions, it would 
have pretty much the same effect. I am not aware of
the difference, other than that in the case of an exclusion, 
the chapter I prohibition is held not to have applied in the 
first place, whereas in the case of an exemption, it is held 
to have applied but to have been disallowed. At this point 
we are discussing semantics, but as the Committee will 
know, there are different implications later in the Bill in 
relation to the varying and application of conditions for 
exemptions as distinct from exclusions.

<P>
My argument is straightforward if Ministers are 
persuaded that there are

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"exceptional and compelling reasons of public policy"
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
to exclude an agreement or undertaking from the chapter 
I prohibition and, indeed, under the paragraph to disapply 
the chapter II prohibition, there may be considerable 
implications. Under the Bill, the Government are taking 
power to disapply competition itself and to do so for

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"exceptional and compelling reasons of public policy"
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Given the wide range of existing exclusions, exemptions 
and criteria set out in the Bill, when such reasons are 
adduced and Ministers are in effect setting aside 
thepurpose of the Bill in what may be a signficant area of 
economic activity, it should be incumbent on Ministers to 
bring that decision before the House to explain 
themselves.

<P>
I do not think that it is pedantry on the part of members 
of the Committee to discuss the character of "exceptional 
and compelling reasons". When it arises, it should be 
incumbent on Ministers to explain how such a high test is 
met. The intention is not that Ministers should exercise 
that discretion on the basis of normal criteria, but that 
exceptional criteria must be met. That is likely to give rise 
to circumstances that hon. Members will want to debate. 
I therefore propose an addition to subsection (4) to 
include that.

<P>
It is difficult to make such judgments, but I was 
surprised that Minsters had not included the other area 
suggested in the amendment in the affirmative resolution 
aspects of the Bill. I was not so surprised at their not 
including paragraph 7 of schedule 3, because in that case 
Ministers are dealing with matters that lie within their 
own discretion and I know that Ministers are wont to 
regard their own discretion as entirely reasonably 
exercised in all circumstances.




<P>
However, the other part of the amendment would bring 
under the affirmative resolution order-making power the 
establishment of director's rules under clause 51. Without 
referring to the many instances in our debates so far when 
Ministers have said that all will become clear when the 
director's rules are made, it seems entirely proper that 
when such rules are made they should be subject to debate 
in the House.

<P>
Those outside the Committee who are considering the 
implications of the Bill are acutely aware that the detail 
of its implementation, in a whole range of areas that we 
have already discussed, will substantially rest on the 
making of director's rules. They are aware that the success 
or otherwise of the legislation on its own terms will often 
rest on the judgments made in those rules. Many people 
will have representations to make not only to the director 
general and the Government, but to hon. Members on the 
manner in which the director general makes those rules.

<P>
If we in this House and in another place are afforded 
no opportunity to debate the director's rules, some of the 
important and substantive issues to which we have 
referred, which have not been and cannot be satisfactorily 
resolved until the director's rules have been set out, will 
not be resolved to the satisfaction of the industries and 
companies that will be affected by them. They will feel 
that we have handed control of the legislation to a system 
that leaves them vulnerable to rules that may disadvantage 
them and that may not, in their view, adequately carry 
forward the intentions of the Bill. Given the importance 
that Ministers have placed on the making of the director's 
rules in many of our debates, I am surprised that they did 
not consider it proper to proceed by way of affirmative 
resolution procedure in respect of clause 51.

<P>
The amendment is intended to be helpful; it is intended 
to be a positive addition to the structure of the Bill.
It is also intended to be a safeguard not only should 
Ministers be subject to challenge when excluding 
agreements and disapplying the prohibition, the safeguard 
of parliamentary scrutiny should apply to the director's 
rules, which will be instrumental to the implementation of 
the Bill.

<P>

<B>Mr. Nigel Griffiths:</B> Welcome back to the Committee, 
Mr. Maxton. As I made clear when we debated clause 51 
stand part, it is right that the matters with which that 
clause and schedule 9 are concerned should be dealt with 
in the director's rules, rather than in primary legislation. 
For similar reasons, they should not be subject to 
affirmative resolution.

<P>
The rules will need to be sufficiently detailed to deal 
with different scenarios and must be able to be readily 
defined. They may well need to be amended in the light 
of experience of their operation. Rules that are appropriate 
when the regime is first introduced may need adjustment 
once it has bedded down. The benefit of secondary 
legislation is that it will provide a flexible instrument for 
keeping the rules up to date.




<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I see the point at which the 
Under-Secretary is driving. He will be aware that in 
certain circumstances in other legislation, the Government 
have provided for an affirmative resolution procedure
for the first making of orders, but negative resolution
for subsequent changes. Has the Under-Secretary 
contemplated that in this instance?

<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> The problem with affirmative resolution 
is that it would make the procedure more difficult and 
slower. In the case of a new Act, it is important that 
comments on the way in which the new regime has been 
introduced and is running can be properly addressed and 
account taken of them once the regime has bedded down, 
and that, necessary adjustments can be made. The fact that 
the rules are not subject to affirmative resolution does not 
mean that there is no scrutiny I hope that the hon. 
Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley) 
accepts that.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>


<P>
We should bear in mind that rules under clause 51 will 
only concern

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"procedural and other matters in connection with the carrying into 
effect of the provisions of this Part".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Schedule 9 illustrates some of the matters on which rules 
may be made for example, the form and manner in 
which applications are to be made and guidance given.
I accept that some of those matters may be more 
significant than others, but they clearly form a lower tier 
than either primary legislation or orders that are subject 
to the affirmative resolution procedure. For that reason, 
the amendment should be resisted.

<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for 
at least responding to the points that I made. I did not 
expect him to change his mind in relation to schedule 3, 
but I am surprised that he should seek to represent the 
director's rules as being essentially procedural. It would 
be excessive of me to go back through all of our debates 
and cite the many occasions on which the Under-Secretary 
and Labour Members have rested on the fact that the 
director general will make rules to clarify issues. They 
may be procedural in content, but they are substantive 
in effect.

<P>
It is a pity that the Under-Secretary did not answer my 
latter point that while I understand that it may be 
difficult in practice to use an affirmative resolution 
procedure on the many occasions on which the rules may 
have to be amended, that does not obviate the desirability 
of having the fullest possible scrutiny of the director's 
rules on the first occasion upon which they are made. 
None the less, in order not unduly to delay the Committee, 
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.




<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
Clause 70 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 71</center></H4>
<H4><center>Offences by bodies corporate etc</center></H4>

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the 
Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> I would like some clarification from the 
Under-Secretary about the clause and the offences under 
clauses 43 to 45, 55(8) and 65, to which it refers.

<P>
This is a useful opportunity for the Under-Secretary to 
explain in what circumstances he thinks it reasonable that 
the officer of a body corporate may find his home broken 
into in order to pursue the case against him, and whether 
he envisages any greater protection being afforded to 
people who are not deemed to be officers under the terms 
of the clause.

<P>
The clause establishes in people's minds the idea that 
a director, manager or secretary somebody in authority 
within a group or company is more responsible than are 
the run-of-the-mill employees in that company or group. 
I am happy with that concept; those who earn the higher 
salaries and have the more senior duties should be at more 
risk of interference from the competition authorities than 
other members of staff, who may not have been party to 
any offence or be responsible.

<P>
This is an opportunity for the Under-Secretary to 
explain why he has had another change of heart on the 
raiding of people's premises. When we had the original 
discussion, we were especially concerned about former 
junior employees temporary typists, secretaries or 
whatever who could find their homes raided, We were 
relieved to learn from the Under-Secretary that he did not 
have that in mind. This morning, we learn that he does. 
Why cannot he use the distinction drawn in clause 71 to 
make it clear that unless employees and former employees 
are responsible officers, they will not be at risk of such 
treatment?

<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> It gets richer and richer. The right hon. 
Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood) has today issued 
a press statement saying that we are not being tough 
enough on the water companies, and yet he argues that all 
those involved in the water industry including bodies 
such as the National Rivers Authority and the British 
Waterways board, for they are bodies corporate must be 
protected at all costs. For example, if a director gives 
papers to a secretary, for that secretary to take home with 
the express purpose of evading and concealing 
malpractice of any kind, should no action be taken to 
recover those papers from the person's property?

<P>
The press release, however, is very different; it is one 
tale for the Committee, for the right hon. Gentleman's 
colleagues and for Members of Parliament; but it is 
another tale for the press. That is typical of the right hon. 
Gentleman. I notice that he does not say when he is going 
to raise the matter. He said, "This week", presumably so 
that he can run a mile from here before the matter 
becomes subject to political scrutiny.

<P>
The clause is a standard provision. Under it, when a 
body corporate has committed a relevant offence, an 
officer of that body corporate is also guilty if it is proved 
the offence was committed with the consent or 
connivance of that officer or resulted from neglect on his 
part. The clause provides for the criminal liability of 
certain officers for offences committed by bodies 
corporate in respect of domestic and EC investigations 
under the Bill and wrongful disclosure of information 
obtained under part I of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> The Under-Secretary did not answer 
any of my questions. He made rather juvenile 
misinterpretations of both what I said before the sitting 
and what I am saying now.




<P>
The Under-Secretary must understand that the water 
industry is organised as a series of revenue-producing 
monopolies or dominant companies. One does not need to 
break down the doors of former secretaries or typists of 
water company directors to establish that fact. Everyone 
except the Under-Secretary is well aware of that. Indeed, 
there is a lot of anger out there in the country about how 
some of those revenue-producing monopolies have 
behaved. People wish to find a better way forward.

<P>
When we come to the relevant new clause I was
not able to say in my press release exactly when it would 
be debated, because it depends on your good will,
Mr. Maxton, and how long our debates will be on 
other matters I shall be happy to say how those 
revenue-producing monopolies in the water industry could 
be opened up to more competition. It will not require the 
breaking down of anyone's front door to find the 
evidence, because everyone knows that the industry is a 
monopoly and that something should be done about it.

<P>
More disappointing is the substance of the debate on 
clause 71. I welcome the sensible distinction being drawn 
between those in a company who are clearly senior and 
who can be held responsible for the actions of the 
company, if proof is forthcoming, and other members of 
staff. Why will the Under-Secretary not extend that 
principle to give junior members of staff, particularly 
former junior members of staff, protection from the 
intrusive powers, given without warrant, that the Bill 
otherwise gives the competition authority?

<P>
I cannot believe that a case would hinge on breaking 
down the door of such a member of staff. It would be 
quite easy to charge the water industry without such 
evidence. The Under-Secretary should go back to his 
previous position; he had clearly seen the point and was 
offering some comfort to those employees.

<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> I shall tell the right hon. Gentleman 
directly why we are not going to protect junior employees 
in those circumstances. We believe that the only motive 
that the right hon. Gentleman has for protecting such 
employees is to shield the people above them responsible 
for malpractice. As I said at a previous sitting, the only 
concern that the Opposition have ever voiced for junior 
employees and those on low pay was voiced in order to 
shield those on high, who may be guilty of malpractice.

<P>
I shall also respond directly to the right hon. 
Gentleman's rather florid language. I noticed that his 
exaggerated language caused you, Mr. Maxton, to roll 
your eyes. Eyes were rolling on the Government Benches 
because of the right hon. Gentleman's spirited criticism 
of the water industry. Our jaws dropped at the notion that 
he has been the consumer's champion against the water 
industry.

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I must point out to the hon. 
Gentleman that the Chairman did not roll his eyes 
Chairmen never do that.

<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> That speech by the Under-Secretary was, 
among the plethora of extremely low-grade speeches that 
he has made in Committee, his worst yet. Instead of 
engaging in downmarket abuse against my right hon. 
Friend's superior line of argument, would he exemplify 
the florid accusation that he has just made?

<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> Yes. The hon. Gentleman is the only 
member of the Committee who does not recognise that 
his right hon. Friend's references to kicking down doors 
and forcing them open with a jemmy the word he 
used are ludicrous. A secretary's front door cannot be, 
to use the phrase, jemmied open unless a High Court 
judge is satisfied that it is proper to issue a warrant for 
entry. There are three grounds for such a warrant I shall 
not detain the Committee by detailing them; they could 
not be more obvious. How can one deal with the right 
hon. Gentleman's ludicrous examples, backed up by the 
contributions of the hon. Member for Buckingham
(Mr. Bercow), who also chose to misinterpret the Bill? 
Why does not the right hon. Gentleman admit that the 
High Court judge has to issue a warrant before any door 
can be breached, in any way?

<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> That is not exactly what the Bill says. 
It also gives power of entry without warrant and makes it 
clear that people wishing to gain entry can take the 
necessary tools for the job; the Under-Secretary has not 
explained what those might be. It is unfortunate that, after 
making a mistake in Committee, he has reverted to the 
position that we find unacceptable.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the 
Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> More in the spirit of hope triumphing 
over experience, I ask the Under-Secretary if he would 
give us a little more information and reassurance about 
what is intended under the clause.

<P>
The Opposition are delighted that paragraph (1)(c) 
states that

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"nothing in this Act affects Her Majesty in her private capacity" 
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
that is entirely proper. However, I would like to know 
how far that goes in exempting the Crown I take the 
Crown to mean Her Majesty's Government from
the provisions that would otherwise apply in the Bill. Will 
the Under-Secretary explain what is meant by the phrase.

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the Crown is not criminally liable as a result of any such provision"
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
when the following subsection states that that

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"does not affect the application of any provision of this Act in 
relation to persons in the public service of the Crown"?
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Under-Secretary seems to be trying to exempt the 
Government, while leaving people employed by the 
Government at risk of prosecution. That is not a very good 
combination of powers. Would it not be better to accept 
that there are circumstances in which the Government 
could, under the Bill, be found guilty? Presumably the 
Under-Secretary would regard Ministers, rather than 
public service staff, as responsible in normal 
circumstances. We are owed clarification on whether the 
Government will be liable and Ministers will take the 
blame.

<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> The clause limits the use of the powers 
of entry under clauses 28 and 29 in respect of Crown 
premises where the infringement being investigated is not 
an infringement perpetrated by the Crown or a person in 
public service of the Crown. I hope that that clarifies the 
matter.

<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> It does not. If that is the case, I do not 
understand the force of subsection (2):

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Subsection (1)(a)" 
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
the subsection that suspends the Crown's criminal 
liability 

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"does not affect the application of any provision of this Act in 
relation to persons in the public service of the Crown."

<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> Clause 72 provides for the Act to bind 
the Crown, with three exceptions: that the Crown is not 
criminally liable as a result of any such provision, that it 
is not liable to penalty and that nothing in the Act affects 
Her Majesty in a private capacity. The Crown is therefore 
not criminally liable, but if officials lie or obstruct 
inquiries, they would commit a criminal offence; that is 
why the clause is worded as it is. Does the right hon. 
Gentleman seek to overturn that intention?
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>


<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> I would like clarification of ministerial 
responsibility. I thought that we lived in a world where, 
if an official in the service of the Crown in its widest 
sense of Government service makes a mistake or a 
problem arises, the Minister takes the blame and does the 
decent thing. Is the Under-Secretary confirming that 
where a public servant misbehaved, the Minister would 
have to take the rap?

<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> Is not the right hon. Gentleman aware 
that a very senior civil servant, George Pottinger, took the 
rap because it was adjudged that a criminal offence was 
involved? He is confusing and trying to confuse the 
Committee, although not succeeding in regard to Labour 
Members Ministers' responsibility in terms of policy, 
which is accepted, and the possible criminal activities of 
a Government servant. Naturally the extent of a Minister's 
culpability depends on the circumstances. If the Crown 
acts as an undertaking and infringes the prohibition, it 
would not be liable for penalties, but would be liable for 
damages.

<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> The new schedule replaces schedule 13, 
which deals with transitional arrangements. The effect of 
the schedule 13 amendments that were made in another 
place is to prevent the restrictive practices court from 
considering resale price maintenance on over-the-counter 
medicines. The impact of that would be, as one 
commentator put it, to throw local chemists on the
mercy of the European Commission which community 
pharmacists regard as hostile to resale price maintenance.

<P>
The Government's position on over-the-counter 
medicines is clear. We do not seek to abolish resale price 
maintenance for such medicines. As my right hon. Friend 
the President of the Board of Trade told the House on 
11 May:

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"There is no doubt that the Government strongly support and care 
about community pharmacies My right hon. Friend the Secretary of 
State has made it clear how important community pharmacies are to 
his vision of health in the next century." [Official Report, 11 May 
1998; Vol 312, c.34.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Independent pharmacies are small businesses that 
provide important services to the community. Local shops 
encourage community life and reduce the use of private 
transport and local pharmacies provide invaluable advice 
as well as medicines. My right hon. Friend the Secretary 
of State for Health has spoken of his plans to make greater 
use of pharmacies. The Government also want to support 
and encourage small businesses. When the restrictive 
practices court considers the director general's application 
under the 1976 Act, it will undoubtedly take full account 
of the role played by local pharmacies and of the harm 
that would be caused if, as they fear, many were unable 
to survive without resale price maintenance.

<P>
I would expect the court to consider fully the issues 
relating to the retention or abolition of RPM in the sector, 
including the effect on local community of possible 
pharmacy closures. As the court said in 1970:




<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Ease of access to a chemist shop is a matter of public importance, 
particularly having regard to the fact that many members of the 
public who make most use of the chemist shop are old, infirm or 
mothers of young children... A plentiful and well distributed supply 
of such shops is therefore essential."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In 317F/G, the court stated:

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"While the availability of popular proprietaries would not be 
adversely affected, the number of establishments in which other 
proprietary medicines less freely in demand by the public... can be 
bought would be substantially reduced, and this... would be a 
detriment to the public as consumers of those brands of proprietary 
medicines."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It continued:

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"perhaps more importantly, the disappearance of those retail 
chemists who fell casualties in this competition" <P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
it meant from supermarkets 

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"would result in a reduction of the number of points at which the 
public could get prescriptions dispensed... The disappearance of 
these dispensaries... would be a detriment to the public as consumers 
of prescribed medicines".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Those words are taken verbatim from the conclusions 
of the restrictive practices court in 1970, when there were 
more than 10,000 pharmacies with an NHS contract in 
England. In the intervening years, the number has shrunk 
from five figures to four figures. If the restrictive practices 
court was so supportive of a large number of community 
pharmacists in 1970, the case that community pharmacies 
have to put in the 1990s is even stronger.

<P>
The origins of the matter are to be found in a complaint 
made in 1995 by the supermarket chain Asda to the Office 
of Fair Trading and to the European Commission. Asda 
announced a decision to reduce prices on 82 brands of 
over-the-counter medicines. High Court injunctions were 
served by four drugs manufacturers and Asda was forced 
to increase its prices. The complaint has therefore been 
the subject of OFT consideration, but it has also been the 
subject of dialogue between the OFT and the European 
Commission. Therefore, I must emphasise that it would 
not be of any help to pharmacists if the court's 
proceedings were stayed. The Commission has made it 
clear that it was not pursuing its own investigations on 
the basis of action initiated by the Director General of 
Fair Trading. Moreover, article 85 is directly applicable to 
the United Kingdom. Aggrieved companies such as Asda 
could argue on that basis that restrictions on pricing are 
void.

<P>
Commissioner Van Miert has written to the President 
of the Board of Trade stating, in effect, that if Parliament 
blocks the restrictive practices court from considering 
resale price maintenance on over-the-counter medicines, 
the Commission would be likely to take up complaints 
that it has received from Asda under article 85 of the
EC treaty. However, the restrictive practices court 
proceedings are allowed to continue on the understanding 
that the Commission will not pursue the complaints, 
provided that the court's decision is acceptable.




<P>
The Commission has said that it is committed to 
decentralised enforcement of competition law. It has 
issued a notice on co-operation between the Commission 
and national competition authorities, which sets out how 
cases in which both national authorities and the 
Commission have jurisdiction should be allocated and 
how both are to co-operate in resolving a case.

<P>
The Commission is content for the matter to be dealt 
with by domestic authorities. If it subsequently takes up 
a complaint, it would be bound to give due consideration 
to a national court's findings if it is argued that they are 
relevant to the assessment under article 85.

<P>
The Resale Prices Act 1976 regime is not dissimilar to 
the regime proposed in the Bill under article 85. The Act 
also provides for a prohibition regime, in this case more 
narrowly focused on resale price maintenance, subject to 
the possibility of exemption. The consideration for 
exemption of a class of goods under the Act might be 
relevant to a decision under article 85 in respect of an 
agreement. I expect the view of the restrictive practices 
court to be an important factor in any Commission 
consideration under article 85. In the light of that, I would 
want to take a robust line with the Commission if, 
following the court's decision, the Commission took 
action that flew in the face of that decision.

<P>
On the other hand, if the proceedings were to be 
stopped and the Commission were to take action, it might 
be more rapid than some people imagine. A Commission 
investigation into the Italian tobacco sector took only 
about two years. The recent decision on Volkswagen took 
about three years. A multinational company with 
extensive legal resources and competition advice was 
found to be in breach and fined £60 million.

<P>
In the case of RPM and OTC medicines, the 
Commission would have a head start. One element of the 
understanding between the Commission and the Office of 
Fair Trading on the handling of that case is that the OFT 
would make all information obtained during the course of 
its proceedings accessible to the Commission, so that the 
Commission could step in with no loss of time if the UK 
procedure encountered any obstacles.

<P>
It must be remembered that article 85 is directly 
applicable to the United Kingdom. If an interested party 
thinks that an agreement for resale price maintenance for 
OTC medicines is in breach of article 85, it can challenge 
its enforceability in a UK court. Such a challenge might 
be prompted by a Commission statement of objections. 
Supporters of resale price maintenance should recognise 
that in such circumstances, the practice could unravel very 
quickly. We have only to remember how the net book 
agreement collapsed under commercial pressures within 
18 months, before the court case was concluded.

<P>
By contrast, we have provided in the schedule that if 
the restrictive practices court reaches a similar finding to 
that reached in 1970 that resale price maintenance for 
OTC medicines is an acceptable practice the new 
director general should not be able to intervene under the 
chapter I prohibition for a period of five years. That 
transitional protection has been widely welcomed by 
pharmacists.

<P>
The other amendments are technical, and I commend 
them to the Committee.

<P>

<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> Before the Under-Secretary sits 
down 

<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> I have sat down.

<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> It was a pity that the Under-Secretary 
sat down before taking one query it might have enabled 
us to make more rapid progress. I hope that when he 
replies to the debate, which includes the issue of retail 
pharmacies and new schedule 1, he will answer the 
question, what would Ministers seek to do in the 
circumstances he described towards the end of his speech? 
Those circumstances are where the restrictive practices 
court has considered the matter and reached a conclusion 
similar to that which it reached in 1970 that resale price 
maintenance on over-the-counter medicines is in the 
public interest for a set of good reasons.




<P>
The Under-Secretary said in his statement much of 
which I agree with that in those circumstances he would 
be robust with the Commission, and he stated clearly that 
the Commission itself has led us to believe that it would 
be strongly guided by domestic competition authorities. 
We have every reason to believe that that is true, because 
article 85 of the treaty has been directly applicable to this 
country since 1973, but no one has yet interpreted it as 
meaning the end of resale price maintenance in that 
industry.

<P>
The Under-Secretary will say that actions are triggered 
by complaints. It is true that there was complaint in 1995, 
but if the domestic authorities have investigated the 
complaint and concluded that it is not well founded, why 
should the European competition authorities want to 
pursue the case, against their spirit of subsidiarity, to 
which the Under-Secretary has referred, and given that 
they have allowed that item to rest dormant since 1973, 
when we first incorporated that treaty article into our 
partly written and partly unwritten constitution?

<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> The complaint came from Asda in 1995. 
It was a response to a complaint made then and not before, 
so "lying dormant" is not applicable. We have evidence 
that the Commission was taking the complaint as 
seriously as the Director General of Fair Trading.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>


<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> I have already covered that point.
I explained that I was talking about Commission attitudes 
and Commission behaviour. We are now meant to be 
discussing the most interesting circumstance, which is of 
the complaint being processed by our domestic court and 
the domestic court finding, as it did previously, in favour 
of the retail pharmacies and against the complainant, 
Asda.

<P>
My point is that from 1973 until 1995 the Commission 
could at any time have instituted its own investigations or 
proceedings if it had been unhappy about the practice of 
resale price maintenance in the pharmacy industry. It did 
not do so. I believe that it was right. If it receives a 
complaint, which has been investigated by our authorities 
and found to be badly based, why should the Commission 
suddenly change the habits of a lifetime by wishing to 
initiate its own proceedings?

<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> The right hon. Gentleman is saying that 
there are two sets of circumstances. Under the first set
of circumstances leading up to 1995, the right hon. 
Gentleman is suggesting that if a complaint was not made, 
the Commission should have gone on a fishing trip. The 
Commission did not go on a fishing trip it responded to 
the second set of circumstances, which was a complaint. 
If Asda had chosen to make its complaint some years 
earlier, the Commission would have had to come to a 
view then.

<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> I do not dispute that point; I am 
making a rather different point. The Commission did 
not feel so strongly that resale price maintenance was 
against the spirit of the treaty that it initiated any 
proceedings or investigations between 1973 and 1995. 
It has never initiated any investigations unprompted. If 
the competition authority in Brussels thought that RPM 
was potentially anti-competitive, it could have initiated 
its own investigation or proceedings at any point, but 
it did not choose to do so.

<P>
The Under-Secretary is quite right that when the 
Commission receives a complaint it must either 
investigate it fully and come to an answer, or, in the spirit 
of subsidiarity as we trust will happen with the Under 
Secretary's help and encouragement it will allow our 
domestic authorities to investigate. I trust, as the 
Under-Secretary trusts, that it will then be guided by the 
findings and decisions of our domestic proceedings.

<P>
<B>Dr. Phyllis Starkey (Milton Keynes, South-West):</B> As 
I understand him, the right hon. Gentleman is making a 
great deal of the fact that the European Commission did 
not embark on a fishing trip against RPM. Has he an 
example of the Commission embarking on a fishing trip 
in any other matter?




<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> That is the purpose of having a 
competition authority. The Commission was entitled to 
investigate RPM if it was thought to be a flagrant abuse, 
but it chose not to do so. It clearly did not think that it 
was a flagrant abuse.

<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Does my right hon. Friend agree that it 
is extremely important that there should not be a 
complainant's charter? What matters is not the volume of 
complaints or their frequency, but their quality or lack of 
quality. It is essential that the Committee establishes one 
simple point. If the Commission were suddenly to try to 
trample upon a verdict reached by the domestic 
competition authorities, we should have it on record that 
the British Government would fight tooth and nail against 
that disavowal of the very subsidiarity principle of which 
they are so proud.

<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> I agree with my hon. Friend's strong 
final point. I hope that we shall be further reassured. The 
Under-Secretary gave us some reassurance in his opening 
statement, when he implied that he would take a firm 
stand with the Commission. Were the British authorities 
to come to a judgment, he would want the European 
authorities to be governed by that judgment.

<P>
There is much to be said for complaints in part driving 
a system of competition regulation. I agree that we do not 
want to encourage frivolous or unreasonable complaints, 
but a good competition authority will investigate every 
complaint. Some complaints will clearly be frivolous or 
parti-pris, but they should be quickly dismissed because 
that fact should be obvious to a talented and well-briefed 
competition authority. Complaints form an important part 
of the process, because often a complainant has 
information or a hunch that needs to be properly 
investigated by a competition authority, which has 
power some would say too great a power to get to the 
bottom of it.

<P>
<B>Dr. Stephen Ladyman (South Thanet):</B> There is a 
glimmer of truth in what the right hon. Gentleman is 
saying. The European Commissioners will stand aside 
from the matter because it is being investigated by the UK 
authorities. If the Bill is passed as amended in the other 
place, will not the UK authorities step aside from the 
investigation, leaving a vacuum that the Commission 
would be forced to fill because it has been woken up by 
Asda's complaint in 1995? If the UK authorities stop the 
investigation, the European authorities will be forced
to pick it up, which is why we must accept the 
Government amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> I do not reach the same conclusion as 
the hon. Gentleman, although again there is some truth in 
what he says. We want the Government to come forward 
with guarantees that if the restrictive practices court finds 
in favour of the pharmacies, the practice will be exempted 
thereafter. That is what I was going to ask the 
Under-Secretary to do, had he given way [Interruption.] 
I will ask him to do that now, if he will listen to our 
debate. That is the crucial point on which people out there 
will be interested to hear the Government's view.

<P>
The court case is proceeding; there is a certain 
inevitability about that. The pharmacies would like the 
reassurance that if they fight and win the restrictive 
practices court case, the Under-Secretary will ensure that 
Brussels lives by that judgment and will amend the Bill 
to give them a guarantee that they can live happily ever 
after with resale price maintenance perhaps with a 
provision that it may be subject after 10 years to a further 
test or review. That might be necessary. The 
Under-Secretary does not seem to offer any such hope to 
the resale pharmacies.

<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> That is a ludicrous claim. I made the 
position very clear, but I will repeat my words because 
the right hon. Gentleman was not listening. In the light of 
a decision by our restrictive practices court in favour of 
RPM, I would want to take a robust line with the 
Commission if it were to take action that flew in the face 
of the court's decision. However, I do not expect the 
Commission to take any such action.

<P>
Will the right hon. Gentleman support us today, so that 
we can ensure that the restrictive practices court can 
continue to consider the matter and reach a conclusion, or 
does he support what the Bill provides as currently 
amended? That would mean that the restrictive practices 
court would cease to consider the matter leaving a 
vacuum, to use the word used by my hon. Friend the 
Member for South Thanet (Dr. Ladyman) and would 
hand it over lock, stock and barrel to the Commission.




<P>
The Commission has made it plain to us, and to 
pharmacists and others, that it is not pursuing its 
investigation only because the OFT is investigating the 
matter, and that it will pursue its own investigation if
the restrictive practices court does not consider it.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. That intervention was rather 
long.

<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> I admire your tolerance, Mr. Maxton. 
It was helpful that the Under-Secretary went further in 
exposing his thinking on the issue.

<P>
The Opposition do not like the Government's attempted 
answer to the problem, because it does not answer it 
properly. We want the Government to come back on 
Report with an answer that will work. I am prepared to 
accept that there are imperfections in what was agreed in 
the other place, but it is preferable to what the 
Government are trying to replace it with. It would be 
possible for the Government to come up with something 
rather better than either of the versions currently on offer.

<P>
The amendment passed in the other place successfully 
highlighted the issue and offered retail pharmacists some 
hope. If the Under-Secretary believes, as he appears to do, 
that that provision would fall foul of Brussels, it is 
incumbent on him either to show that this country has 
some influence in Brussels to prevent it from becoming a 
lethal threat to the amendment passed in the other place, 
or to table an amendment that achieves what we want for 
the retail pharmacists, while dealing with the threat that 
he perceives for Brussels. It is his problem.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> What is it exactly that the right hon. 
Gentleman wants to achieve for the pharmacies the 
continuation of resale price maintenance?

<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> Yes, that is exactly what we are trying 
to achieve I would have thought that the Under-Secretary 
might have worked that out by now. That is not too 
difficult a request. I think that that practice is acceptable, 
because I accept the judgment of the court in 1970. The 
arguments have not changed much since 1970, and I 
obviously hope that the court will come to a similar 
conclusion now.

<P>
I am pressing the Under-Secretary to say today that if 
the court reaches such a conclusion if he has his way 
and the case continues he will, as far as he can, 
guarantee two things. First I think that he has guaranteed 
this will he insist to the Commission that the court's 
conclusion must stand, that the Commission is part of the 
same jurisdiction, and that therefore what is good in 
London must be good in Brussels? Secondly, will he go 
further and amend the Bill on Report, because the 
amendments before us will not achieve the desired aim of 
endorsing and upholding the court's decision? It would be 
even better he could return on Report with a proposal that 
settled the issue there and then.

<P>
If the Under-Secretary is proud to belong to a 
Government who are meant to be at the heart of the 
European Community and able to influence and 
encourage their colleagues in the Community in the right 
direction, why is he unable to deliver on the issue? He 
has said, and the Minister in the other place said clearly, 
that a large number of retail pharmacies will close if the 
matter is determined in the wrong way. He and the 
Secretary of State for Health have said that the closure of 
pharmacies would be a blow to the health care system in 
this country; they are an important part of our general 
health care provision. He has said that the retail pharmacy 
is an important part of a local community, providing an 
important service. Often, in villages and suburban areas 
there are problems keeping high street retail outlets going, 
and it would be a big blow to such areas if they were to 
lose their pharmacies.

<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> As usual, my right hon. Friend is making 
a powerful case. I do not want to tempt him from the 
path of virtue, but I want to put a scenario to him. British 
competition authorities judge, as they judged 28 years 
ago, that RPM is in the public interest. The British 
Government are content with that, but the European 
Commission is not, and decides that, subsidiarity 
notwithstanding, it wants to ban the practice. Does my 
right hon. Friend agree that in such circumstances the 
usurpation of legitimate British decision-making authority 
by the Commission would be so monstrous that there 
would be a powerful argument for ignoring its ruling and 
telling the Commission. "We put rural pharmacies first. 
You go and do your worst"?

<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> My hon. Friend should not tempt me. 
The official Opposition will always say that we should 
obey the law, whether it is made in Brussels or in London. 
We would not urge breaking the law; the Government 
should work harder to ensure that the law is sensible and 
not an ass. In this case, the Government have a great deal 
of work to do to convince us that a sensible decision will 
be made on behalf of British people.

<P>
<B>Dr. Ladyman:</B> Prior to the right hon. Gentleman's 
diversion into the lines of Euro-scepticism, he was making 
two points with which I agree. I should like him to clarify 
the first of them. The second was that community 
pharmacies are a good thing I am sure that everyone 
agrees with that. I should like the right hon. Gentleman 
to clarify the first point. The arrangement that pertained 
for 18 years of Conservative Government, that the 
restrictive practices court would have the final judgment 
on whether resale price maintenance was in the public 
interest, was a good arrangement, and it is a perfectly 
valid way of deciding the matter. I agree with that. Will 
the right hon. Gentleman confirm that he agrees?



<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>


<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> In normal circumstances, I would have 
agreed with that. I thought that the chemists had a good 
case and that they were likely to win. However, 
circumstances are no longer normal, because the 
Government have intruded upon the argument. It is no 
good the Under-Secretary saying that it would have been 
a problem regardless of the Bill. The Bill has greatly 
increased the problem, but it also provides a mechanism 
or vehicle for tackling the problem.

<P>
The Government's unwillingness to tackle the problem 
head on in the Bill is extraordinary, given that they say 
that they are worried by the potential loss of pharmacies 
that might result from the coming change of law or even 
from a wrong decision being reached by the restrictive 
practices court.

<P>
The Under-Secretary went a little further than is 
normally warranted for a Minister for Competition and 
Consumer Affairs. He is meant to come to such cases 
unimpeded by prejudice, yet he selectively quoted from 
the good 1970 judgment, going as close as possible to 
saying that he agreed with that judgment and with the 
people making their case in court today against the 
abolition of resale price maintenance. I am glad that he 
used a little discretion in that respect, hinting to the court 
that it should come to the same conclusion.

<P>
I come back to the question: why cannot the 
government find a way to solve the problem? Above all, 
why cannot they find a way in the Bill to reassure the 
pharmacies, if they have to go through the court test again, 
and if and when they win, that all will be well and the 
Government's legal provisions will give them protection? 
The Government have made a modest offer in that 
direction, but not a sufficiently good one. Five years after 
the coming into force of the court's decision, we would 
still face the closure of the pharmacies. Their closure 
would presumably be delayed until after the election, 
which the Government worry might otherwise happened 
before the election; but it will still be the result of their 
legislation and their handling of that particular complaint, 
which started in 1995.

<P>
In conclusion, the Opposition cannot accept the 
schedule as drafted. It will make the position unacceptable 
for retail pharmacies; sooner or later, it will result in their 
closure. We may be open to persuasion on Report if the 
Government find a better way of achieving that aim than 
the amendment passed in another place. A better way may 
exist. The Government are, of course, better informed 
than are the Opposition. The nub of the issue relates to 
what the Under-Secretary thinks that he and the President 
of the Board of Trade can persuade Mr. Van Miert to 
do and what they cannot persuade him to do. The 
Opposition are clearly not privy to those interesting 
discussions when and if they occur between British 
Ministers and the competition Commissioner, but they are 
crucial to our consideration of this matter.

<P>
<B>Mr. Nigel Beard (Bexleyheath and Crayford):</B> Is not it 
the case that, if the amendment passed in another place 
stands, the court will be abolished and the Commission 
will take up that function, without the precedent of having 
a recent judgment on resale price maintenance? The risk 
it that the Commission will decide against RPM. That 
would be totally against the interests of people who wish 
to maintain resale price maintenance. There is a paradox. 
On the one hand, Opposition Members are saying that 
they want retail price maintenance. On the other hand, 
they are ready to abolish the court that would given them 
that and preserve it for five years to put it in the hands 
of the Commission, without any knowledge of what will 
happen. That seems to be merely a stunt to stage a 
confrontation with the Commission and have a row, and 
not in the interests of those who want resale price 
maintenance for pharmacies.




<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> That last comment was not worthy of 
what was otherwise a rather good intervention. I am not 
interested in using this matter to get Britain into a row 
with the Commission. Ministers regularly get into rows 
with Europe without any help from us, and it does not 
always help them much. I am worried about resale price 
maintenance and its impact on pharmacies. That is why I 
argue this case, and why I have been running this case
for several months. As soon as I read the Bill, I realised 
that it would have a damaging impact on the sector.
I subsequently discovered that people in the business were 
similarly worried. I was happy to say that the official 
Opposition would present their case to Parliament and to 
the Committee. I am delighted that several Labour 
Members also brought the case, in their own way, to the 
Government's attention, through the early-day motion on 
this matter, which they correctly signed. It is a 
cross-party worry.

<P>
The hon. Member for Bexleyheath and Crayford
(Mr. Beard) is right in one respect: if the amendment 
passed in the other place stands, it will require leverage 
or statesmanship on the part of Ministers to ensure either 
that the Commission does not interfere or that the 
Commission investigates and comes to the right answer. 
Will the Under-Secretary promise that the Government 
will argue the case for the resale price maintenance 
system for pharmacies to Brussels to try to ensure that it 
comes to the right answer?

<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> We are ensuring that the case is properly 
heard by the restrictive practices court. The right hon. 
Gentleman has it in his gift to help ensure that the 
Commission does not consider the matter. Will he ask his 
colleague, the vice-chairman of the Conservative party, 
who, as a prime mover in Asda, was responsible for the 
original complaint, to withdraw Asda's submission to the 
Commission? By withdrawing the complaint that he 
initiated, the vice-chairman of the Conservative party 
would ensure that the Commission did not have the 
complaint before it.

<P>

<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> No, I will not waste my time suggesting 
that to my hon. Friend the Member for Tunbridge Wells 
(Mr. Norman). As the dates reveal, my hon. Friend was 
not a Member of the House when the complaint was 
submitted. He and his board of directors decided that it 
was in Asda's commercial interests to submit it, and I am 
sure that the successors in executive roles at Asda would 
still consider it in their business interests to pursue the 
case. I would therefore be wasting my breath if I asked 
my hon. Friend to try to act in his Asda capacity to have 
the complaint withdrawn. I am sure that the Asda board 
would still want to pursue it, and it is their entitlement so 
to do. Businesses usually pursue their own business 
interests, and my hon. Friend has been scrupulously 
careful not to muddle his business interest on the matter 
with his position as a member of the Conservative party 
or as a Member of the House, which is also correct 
procedure.




<P>
To return to the important issue of the Commission, the 
Under-Secretary has still not revealed the position of Her 
Majesty's Government or how influential the Government 
might be. I shall give some advice for nothing. I promise 
him that the Government will have no influence on the 
competition Commissioner on this issue unless they try 
to. It will require the Government to say, loud and clear, 
preferably in public, that they want to defend pharmacies, 
will drive British policy in that direction and would like 
the Commissioner to understand that they want him to do 
that too.

<P>
The Government should explain to the Commissioner 
that, in their view, the practice has not been against the 
public interest in the past, is not against the public interest 
in the present and will not be against the public interest 
in future. If the Under-Secretary made that commitment, 
he would discover that the amendment moved in the other 
place would not seem so potentially damaging. Retail 
pharmacies would be reassured if he could go on to say 
that not only would he make that the Government's 
position, but that on this occasion, as it is a technical and 
domestic matter as far as Brussels is concerned, he is 
fairly confident although he cannot guarantee it that he 
would carry the competition Commissioner and any other 
interested commissioners on the matter. Retail pharmacies 
want to know that the Government are on their side.

<P>
It is no good the Minister in the other place saying that 
many pharmacies would close if the Government went 
ahead, and that that would be a pity because they are 
owned by jolly fine people. It is no good the 
Under-Secretary telling us hint hint, nudge nudge that 
he is really on the side of retail pharmacists because they 
are such splendid people, but that it would be nothing to 
do with him should Brussels make a move or should the 
Lords amendment result in Brussels having more 
influence than he would like.

<P>
It is the Government's duty to govern. It is their duty 
to say whose side they are on. If they stood behind the 
retail pharmacists, not only would the latter take some 
encouragement from it, but their chances of success in 
Brussels would be quite reasonable. It would then make 
the amendment passed in another place perfectly sensible. 
It would help me and my hon. Friends and, I suspect hon. 
Members from all parties, if the Under-Secretary were to 
say a little more about how he would handle that 
eventuality in Brussels, what his public stance might be
 I trust that the same would be true of his private 
stance and how much leverage he thinks he might 
obtain.

<P>
When moving the amendment and talking to the new 
schedule, the Under-Secretary did not refer to the other 
amendments in the group. To avoid delaying the 
Committee unduly, may I ask that were he to catch your 
eye again, Mr. Maxton, he might offer an explanation
of the other amendments, because I have a number of 
queries?

<P>
I am worried also about the rest of the new schedule. 
The Government imply that the only reason for the 
changes is to try to sort out a muddle of their making on 
the vexed question of retail pharmacies. That is not how 
I read it. The new schedule is extremely lengthy and 
amounts to a substantial recasting of the transitional 
provisions. It covers not only the issue of pharmacies,
but the transitional arrangements in general and the 
relationship between the existing sector regulators and the 
new regulatory framework. In effect, it is an admission by 
the Government that they were wrong in their original 
drafting of the Bill and that matters have turned out to be 
a lot more complicated than they had imagined.

<P>
Why are the Government in a muddle on transition?
As we predicted on Second Reading and subsequently, it 
is not possible simply to implement the words of the
treaty for a couple of prohibitions and end up with a 
comprehensive British competition law that meshes 
successfully with the rather more complicated 
case-by-case regime that we have lived under until now. 
Not only will all sorts of arrangements have to be made 
for continuing proceedings in cases already before the 
court, but we have rediscovered our old friend the 
Restrictive Trade Practices Act register. We suggested 
that it might be a useful device it proved to be good in 
the past and it is now to be perpetuated and form part of 
the new system.

<P>
Far from making the new system cleaner, clearer and 
simpler than the old system, the Government are grafting 
on to it a new and rather vague and difficult system, with 
some rather strong powers attached to it. The old system 
was tried and tested and was rather more sensitive to 
individual cases. There were sensible investigations and a 
sensible registration of agreements that needed suitable 
examination. People wanted comfort.

<P>
The Government owe the Committee an explanation of 
their thought processes and how they have arrived at such 
substantial changes to their Bill. It would be helpful to 
business if the Government stressed that, presumably, 
they reached their conclusions because they realised that 
more people needed more reassurances about practices 
that they were following under the old regime, and that 
they could provide those by the back door of the new 
schedule.




<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>


<P>
We are also owed some further explanation of how
the relationship between the sector regulators and the 
competition regulator will work in practice. I appreciate 
that the schedule needs to contain complicated provisions, 
because each sector regulator was set up under specific 
legislation and there are variations in their powers and 
the definition of their task in each case. We are owed an 
explanation of how those differences have been 
accommodated in the new provisions and the exact 
relationship between sector regulators and the 
competition regulator.

<P>
It is not only a question of explaining the concept of 
concurrency; it is important to explain exactly how 
businesses avoid double jeopardy under the regime and 
how any disputes between regulators may be resolved. It 
could be extremely vexatious for a business if it were 
making progress with its sector regulator and then 
discovered that the competition authority was going to 
investigate a similar or identical point, or vice versa.

<P>
It would be for the convenience of the Committee if we 
were taken through how that might work in practice, so 
that nothing slips through the competition net, but 
businesses do not face perpetual inquiry from different 
regulators trawling over similar ground. We need to 
ensure that wicked practices are caught, but we also need 
to give people immunity from perpetual investigation for 
the same alleged offence.

<P>
There are many other points, but I am conscious that 
time is pressing on, and I dare say that other members of 
the committee want to contribute.

<P>
<B>Mr. Colin Breed (South-East Cornwall):</B> I agree with 
a considerable amount of what the right hon. Gentleman 
has said, but I want to look at the matter from a slightly 
different angle. We have properly concentrated on the 
plight or otherwise of community pharmacies, but we are 
really trying to protect the consumer the person who 
wants proper access to an important service.

<P>
In their recent White Paper on health, the Government 
pledged to promote community health care. It is clear that 
pharmacists, in their wider responsibilities, are very much 
a part of that. They are becoming almost a principal point 
of access to advice with aches and pains, and coughs 
and colds, they are perhaps the principal point of advice 
instead of people going to general practitioners' surgeries, 
which are being encouraged to take on other work. In that 
way, health care provision is made that much more 
appropriate.

<P>
That valuable advice and readily available treatment for 
common ailments in community pharmacies is the real 
reason why we want to protect that service and keep it 
accessible. If it is removed to other locations and if small 
chemists in market towns and suburban areas are put out 
of business, the same level of health care will not be 
provided.

<P>
<B>Dr. Starkey:</B> I would be grateful if the hon. Gentleman 
would clarify what he means by a community pharmacy. 
My understanding is that it is a pharmacy that is in a 
community. Does he accept that urban areas, as well as 
rural areas, contain communities, and that a large number 
of pharmacies are in supermarkets? They have a role that 
is as valid as that of a pharmacy that is a small business 
in either a suburb or a rural area. His remarks should take 
account of that fact.

<P>
<B>Mr. Breed:</B> Yes, I am happy to accept that fact, but the 
actual number of pharmacies located within supermarkets 
compared with the number of chemists throughout the 
country is relatively small. By far and away the larger 
number of pharmacies are located in suburban parts of 
cities, small towns, and so on.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will 
agree that there are community pharmacies in urban areas, 
not just in rural areas; that is self-evident. Does he agree 
that it is to be hoped that the hon. Member for Milton 
Keynes, South-West (Dr. Starkey) is not scuttling away 
from her previously professed support for the retention of 
resale price maintenance, which is on the record?




<P>
<B>Mr. Breed:</B> I am delighted by that intervention, but I 
want to return to the consumer aspect.

<P>
I said on Second Reading and have said since that our 
main objective is to consider what is in the public interest. 
People should be able to access that part of the health care 
system effectively. We must therefore not define it in the 
rather narrow terms of price and market forces. From the 
consumer point of view most people are patients at 
times the major consideration is accessibility to 
medicines both on and off prescription.

<P>
We have all been sent information on the subject. One 
estimate is that up to 3,000 pharmacies may be threatened 
if resale price maintenance is abolished. The small 
pharmacies scheme does not offer adequate protection for 
a number of community pharmacies. If RPM is removed, 
thousands will be at risk of closure. If the Government 
remove RPM without providing other means of support, 
it is only to be expected that a considerable number of 
pharmacists and consumers will be fearful.

<P>
The right hon. Member for Wokingham was looking 
for security and a cast-iron guarantee not the hope that 
everything will be all right, not a promise of robust action, 
but the absolute security and knowledge that that vital part 
of the health care system will somehow be continued. The 
Government has pledged to support small businesses 
a cause that we all enthusiastically support. We should 
remember that pharmacies are a vital part of that business 
community and not only those in supermarkets.

<P>
I do not necessarily believe that resale price 
maintenance will remain for ever. I am not certain that 
our absolute support for it is in the best interests of 
pharmacists or consumers. However, it is important that 
the professional advice and contribution of pharmacists is 
recognised, is provided for and remains part of a secure 
health care provision. That could be done through the 
artificial mechanism of resale price maintenance, which 
would protect the industry's profitability and pay for the 
pharmacists, or it could be provided through the direct 
funding of pharmacists, which would enable them not to 
rely upon resale price maintenance. That must be at the 
heart of our consideration of the system's security.

<P>
I had hoped that the transition period suggested in the 
other place would allow us to give real and genuine 
consideration to how pharmacists are funded. A degree of 
rationalisation could take place, and some recognition of 
the pharmacists' role in the provision of health care. 
However, RPM will always come under pressure, with the 
potential for that safety net to be withdrawn, which would 
put pharmacists and the service in danger. I hope that the 
Government will look at this seriously and come back 
with their own way of tackling the problem.

<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman accept that 
those customers who think price is important can now go 
to the supermarket much cheaper medicines are 
available on the counters of supermarkets because they 
have found ways of competing on price and those who 
value service are happy to pay the higher prices at the 
existing neighbouring pharmacy? What is the problem? 
The position is stable, but there is choice.




<P>
<B>Mr. Breed:</B> There is a choice only for those who have 
access to both. As I said at the beginning of our debate, 
that depends on their ability to access the facility. Many 
people have the opportunity to choose to purchase their 
over-the-counter medicines at different places, but many 
consumers and patients do not have that choice for a 
variety of reasons. The Under-Secretary recognised that 
many people who go to small pharmacies tend to be 
elderly, or have children, or do not have access to a 
vehicle to go to the supermarket.

<P>
There is a growing need for the pharmacist to be part 
of the healthcare system and provide that service. I do not 
believe that the shaky mechanism of resale price 
maintenance will necessarily be the way forward.

<P>
<B>Dr. Ladyman:</B> I realise that the sky is always blue in 
Liberal Democrat land. It is easy for the hon. Gentleman 
to read out his press statement, saying what a wonderful 
thing community pharmacies are, but unfortunately he 
will not elicit any contradiction from any member of the 
Committee, because we all think that they are a good 
thing.

<P>
The hon. Gentleman must address the central point. If 
we do not allow our competition authorities to consider 
the matter and objectively to address the case against 
resale price maintenance that has been made, regardless 
of whether it is strong, the European Commissioner will 
and he may come up with a different answer from the one 
that we want him to come up with. The hon. Gentleman 
should deal with that essential matter.

<P>
<B>Mr. Breed:</B> I entirely agree. We are perpetuating the 
fear and insecurity of the system. I want the Government 
to address the current position, subject to the restrictive 
practices court ruling, and to provide a transition period 
if the ruling goes against pharmacies, taking into account 
the discussion that may take place with the Commission, 
which could go either way. Pharmacists, such as those 
who are coming up to retirement and wondering whether 
they want to continue, will leak out of the system. If such 
insecurity and fear for the future continues, several people 
will stop being pharmacists and small-time chemists while 
the matter is being dealt with.

<P>
Secure funding for pharmacists has nothing to do with 
blue-sky Liberalism: it is reality. We pay doctors for their 
professional expertise in working at the heart of the health 
service. Pharmacists deserve a similar status. They should 
be part of the healthcare provision, especially when we 
are asking them to take on more work at that front end. 
They should be recognised in that way and funded in that 
way. If they happen to be part of a small chemist 
operation that places the costs of their professionalism 
rather heavily on the shop. That burden should be 
removed so that the chemist can compete along with every 
other sort of retail operation.

<P>
<B>Dr. Ladyman:</B> I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman's 
continued patience. I made the same point on Second 
Reading. We need a better system of remunerating 
pharmacists but that is a matter for the Department of 
Health, not this Committee.

<P>
In asking the Government to guarantee resale price 
maintenance, is the hon. Gentleman saying that the 
Liberal Democrat position now is that article 85 of
the European treaty should somehow be set aside? That 
would strike me as an extraordinary position for the 
Liberal Democrats to adopt now.

<P>
<B>Mr. Breed:</B> No, it has nothing to do with that. It has 
to do with practical application and how we treat special 
cases. In many special cases in many different areas, there 
is no difference. Surely we all value and want to retain 
the pharmacies, and that has to be the best way of 
achieving that.

<P>
The transition period should be used properly; it should 
be a time to decide the future funding of pharmacists, the 
better to secure them as part of the health care system 
rather than allowing them to remain part of a system that 
is always under threat either from Europe or from other 
competition authorities. Otherwise, we shall not cure the 
problem. It will be much easier after we have the court's 
decision in a couple of years' time. The Bill and the new 
schedule will not make the position any more secure.




<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> Given the hon. Gentleman's view that 
pharmacists should be treated as part of the healthcare 
team, and therefore excluded from the normal application 
of the Competition Act regime, does he consider that 
pharmacies should be included in clause 3, which would 
offer them an exclusion in that respect?

<P>
<B>Mr. Breed:</B> That may be a technical solution; I shall 
have to check on that. I am attempting perhaps not in a 
very clear manner to consider the matter from the 
consumer's point of view. At present, the consumer is 
paying heavily for over-the-counter medicines under 
resale price maintenance. Millions of pounds may be 
involved. I understand the Government's point of view, 
which is that, if they were to fund pharmacists from the 
health budget, they would have to raise tax.

<P>
<B>Lorna Fitzsimons (Rochdale):</B> I understand the hon. 
Gentleman's genuine attempt to shed light on the issue.
I live in a rural place; will you admit that you are placing 
accessibility above affordability 

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> No, I am not.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>


<P>
<B>Lorna Fitzsimons:</B> Do you accept that affordability is 
a real issue in terms of the accessibility of pharmacies? 
When you are talking about consumers, you must bear 
that in mind.

<P>
<B>Mr. Breed:</B> That is absolutely right it is the 
affordability of accessibility, if you like.

<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?

<P>
<B>Mr. Breed:</B> In a minute. If you were in my home town, 
and wanted to get your prescription at 6 pm or 6.30 pm, 
and had been used to going to the chemist in town, if 
that chemist were not there, you could go to your nearest 
Sainsbury's. In my home town, that would mean paying 
a toll to get over the bridge and a six-mile car ride. I am 
not sure how much extra anyone would pay over a year 
on the few pence added to the cost of all over-the-counter 
medicines, but the cost and inconvenience of having to 
travel six or seven miles to Sainsbury's and six or seven 
miles back would be much higher than would the cost of 
the prescriptions.

<P>

<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that it is 
a matter for concern that views upon the matter have now 
been ascribed to the Chairman of the Committee? Would 
not it be better if the traditional invisibility and even 
non-existence of the Chairman were re-established?

<P>
<B>Mr. Breed:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman very much for 
pointing that out; that happened in the heat of the 
argument.

<P>
Neither the new schedule nor the provisions inserted in 
the other place will secure the service of pharmacies as 
part of the healthcare system. There will be uncertainty; 
people are deciding whether to continue their business or 
to retire. If we do not provide absolute security a safety 
net at least for a transitional period while the 
Government consider how they will fund the system, we 
will have a poorer Bill and a reduced ability to access 
pharmacies.

<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I am grateful for the opportunity to 
add my remarks to the debate on this group of 
amendments. I am not sure that we have considered the 
new schedule in the necessary detail; I shall come to 
that in a moment. The Under-Secretary helpfully 
explained the Government's broad intentions in 
introducing the new schedule, but we should consider 
one or two points in detail.

<P>
I do not want unduly to delay the Committee; the 
Committee agrees about the value of community 
pharmacies that agreement was also made clear on 
Second Reading. We must understand that value and the 
interaction between the existence of resale price 
maintenance and the viability of community pharmacies.




<P>
The hon. Member for Milton Keynes, South-West 
referred to pharmacies in supermarkets. She will forgive 
me for saying that, even in my constituency, which is 
substantially rural but which has its urban parts, the 
viability of pharmacies inside supermarkets is not affected 
by resale price maintenance in the same way as are 
independent community pharmacies. Indeed, if a 
substantial number of independent pharmacies closed and 
supermarket-based pharmacies took over their role, we 
could potentially see a quite different categorisation 
between the medicines offered by pharmacies and those 
offered on the supermarket shelf.

<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I firmly agree with my hon. Friend's last 
point. In the event of the disappearance of community 
pharmacies, not only might the range of structure of 
operation of the pharmacies within supermarkets change; 
it is also reasonable to suppose that the supermarkets' 
policy of widespread discounting would change. The 
market would be clear and supermarkets might 
substantially raise prices at that stage.

<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> Indeed. We could speculate on how 
things would change. In the supermarket context, the sale 
of generic or non-branded goods might overtake the sale 
of branded goods, sometimes to the exclusion of some of 
those branded goods. It is not necessarily true to say that 
branded goods do not have the additional customer benefit 
of presentation or product characteristics. The philosophy 
of substituting generic or non-branded medicines may go 
further than is necessary and may not be in the consumers' 
interest; but to go too far down that line would be without 
benefit to our debate.

<P>
<B>Dr. Starkey:</B> Will not the hon. Gentleman admit that 
any pharmacy can sell generic non-branded goods and
that the sensible consumer asks for the non-branded 
equivalent, which is usually exactly the same as the 
branded one but without the pretty packaging and, in 
small pharmacies and in supermarket pharmacies, is 
considerably cheaper? We need to make a distinction 
between what a pharmacy sells and pharmaceutical 
products that can be sold on open shelves without the 
advice of a pharmacist.

<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> The hon. Lady makes an interesting 
point. Perhaps we will not be wasting our time if we 
pursue the matter; which brings me to a particular 
instance. As a hay fever sufferer, I am aware that it is 
possible to buy a generic product. I could buy some 
anti-histamine. However, it is an instance of the market's 
competitiveness and of the value of branded goods that 
hay fever sufferers can debate the relative merits of the 
particular formulations of a variety of branded products, 
which are all anti-histamine but which often include 
paracetamol or other active ingredients.

<P>
I submit that one is not simply dealing with directly 
substitutable generic products, but that the formulation, 
the presentation, the advice offered and the circumstances 
in which it is provided, and the manner in which a 
particular product is to be taken it may have to be 
inhaled or swallowed are all important. The way in 
which the industry presents itself through branded goods 
to the consumer is important. We should not 
underestimate that importance.

<P>
That brings us to another important point in relation 
to RPM and over-the-counter medicines. It is sometimes 
falsely assumed that RPM denies competition in relation 
to such products and that a balance has to be struck 
between lack of competition on the one hand and public 
interest benefit on the other principally a public health 
benefit. We should not give ground to that argument. 
Even within the over-the-counter medicines market, there 
is substantial competition. As a result, we have a whole 
string of medicines for hay fever sufferers medicines 
such as Clarityn, Allereeze, Triludan, Telfast and 
Beconase. Anyone who suffers from that discomfort will 
know that those medicines are all different, and that 
different sufferers gain different benefits form the 
different formulations of different branded products. It is 
a very competitive market. It varies year by year.




<P>
On the face of it, it appears perfectly possible that the 
restrictive practices court will find that the operation of 
resale price maintenance in the industry is justified, even 
though, as we must acknowledge, it is the remaining 
instance of RPM, which has previously been ruled out by 
the courts. We cannot determine the outcome.

<P>
My right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham and 
the hon. Member for South-East Cornwall spoke about 
the general importance of the matter to the viability of 
pharmacies, but we need to recognise the particulars.

<P>
<B>Mr. Beard:</B> If the hon. Gentleman believes that there 
is a strong chance that the courts will rule in favour of 
maintaining retail price maintenance all members of the 
Committee are looking for a way to maintain it I do not 
understand why he wants to jeopardise the outcome by 
taking the issue from the court and giving it to the 
European Commission.

<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I was not suggesting that I could 
prejudge the outcome of the restrictive practices court. On 
the face of it, the court has been moving in the direction 
of abolishing resale price maintenance we have seen that 
in relation to other agreements. Therefore, prima facie, 
resale price maintenance is under threat. My point is that 
there are valid counter arguments. I will certainly answer 
the hon. Gentleman's point, but I shall come later to
the question of simply handing the case over to the 
European Commission.

<P>
<B>Dr. Starkey:</B> If I understand the point that the hon. 
Gentleman is making, he is arguing from the abolition of 
the net book agreement that the restrictive practices court 
will move on to get rid of RPM. Nobody could argue that 
individuals have the same emergency need to nip off to a 
bookseller to get a novel as they do to go to a pharmacy 
to get a drug. The one does not follow from the other.

<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I should not have given way to the hon. 
Lady, because I made it perfectly clear in response to the 
hon. Member for Bexleyheath and Crayford that in other 
cases although not comparable cases the court has 
been moving towards the abolition of resale price 
maintenance. We have to be aware of the threat to resale 
price maintenance. For precisely the reasons to which I 
was referring, there are good counter-arguments in the 
case of over-the-counter medicines.

<P>
No one can really argue that we can prejudge the 
outcome of the continuing proceedings of the restrictive 
practices court. There is no value in our attempting to do 
so; if we try to do so, we may find that our deliberations 
have been ill-founded.

<P>
Last Wednesday, I visited the Gamlingay pharmacy in 
my constituency. It is more than three miles from the 
nearest pharmacy in the next village. The village is large; 
it has a bank, a post office, a newsagents and other stores, 
but there is no other pharmacy and no supermarket.

<P>
Many elderly people who often make the greatest use 
of the pharmacy to provide them with their prescription 
and non-prescription medicines do not have their own 
transport and cannot readily go to a supermarket, which 
would involve a drive of seven or eight miles. They 
cannot rely on an adequate bus service to the 
neighbouring village; there may be two or three buses a 
day, but they do not necessarily run when they would 
want to go, and they would have to spend some hours in 
the other village before making their return journey.

<P>
The pharmacy says that its viability is threatened by the 
loss of resale price maintenance. The owner and manager, 
the pharmacist, Mr. Feldman, estimated that he could lose 
one third of his present return on turnover as a 
consequence of the aolition of resale price maintenance.
I am sure that the Coommittee will be aware of the 
relatively low rate of return on NHS prescriptions and that 
there is a overall impact, in which the more commercial 
mark-up a non over-the-counter medicines must, from
the pharmacist's perspectives, be taken together with the 
lower mark-up on prescriptions.



<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>


<P>
If Mr. Feldman were not available in that village to 
provide that service, many elderly people would not have 
a readily available service for providing medicines. As the 
hon. Member for Milton Keynes, South-West rightly said, 
it is not like popping down to the newsagents to buy a 
magazine. People often go to a store to buy something 
that relieves discomfort and often need the medicines that 
they buy at the time that they buy them.

<P>
The loss of value to the health service in that village is 
most significant. The creation of primary health care 
teams is, by the Government's own admission, an 
objective that we should all value. In that context, the 
pharmacist plays an important part. Mr. Feldman 
estimated that he saw no fewer than 15 people a day, to 
whom he gave advice which, in his absence, would 
require a general practice consultation. Even on that 
modest basis, therefore, perhaps an hour and a half of a 
general practitioner's time is saved by the presence of a 
pharmacist. We all know that, roughly speaking, there are 
two occasions of people buying over-the-counter 
medicines to treat themselves for every one occasion that 
a common illness is presented to the NHS requiring 
treatment by that route.

<P>

<B>Dr. Ladyman:</B> When giving examples, it is important 
that we all understand what they mean. In testing that 
example, I do not mean to impugn the hon. Gentleman's 
constituent in any way, or to suggest that he is not a 
valuable pharmacist. First, am I right in thinking that the 
hon. Gentleman's constituent would be recognised as part 
of the essential pharmacy scheme because of his position 
and the nature of his business, and is therefore already 
guaranteed a given income for his prescription business 
by the Department of Health? Secondly, the hon. 
Gentleman's constituent estimates that he might lose a 
third of his turnover as a result of the abolition of resale 
price maintenance. Is that because he is assuming that all 
his over-the-counter medicine business will now be lost 
and will go elsewhere, or because he believes that he may 
have to lower the price to some extent and is therefore 
calculating the lower price at which he will have to sell 
goods in future? Which of those two is the case?

<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> To answer the second question first, it 
was not that Mr. Feldman would lose the business, but 
that he would operate on a lower mark-up at a lower price 
for over-the-counter medicines. It was not a third of his 
turnover, it was a third of his present rate of return on 
turnover. I am not talking about the reduction in turnover, 
but the rate of return on turnover.

<P>
To answer the first question, I talked to Mr. Feldman 
about the essential pharmacy scheme. His view is that the 
scheme is inadequately funded for the purpose. There is 
no pledge from the Government to provide the resources 
through the essential pharmacy scheme to make up 
anything like the loss of net profit to him that would be 
occasioned by the abolition of resale price maintenance. 
If the Government were to pledge such money, he asks 
whether that would be the best way, in the public interest, 
to pursue that objective. Large numbers of pharmacies 
would operate in the long run on the basis of not a 
commercial marketplace, but a subsidy from the 
Exchequer. His view, with which I am temperamentally 
inclined to agree, is that it is better for it to be a 
commercial operation over time he can see that even the 
prices of over-the counter medicines have been pushed 
down by competition in that marketplace and that even 
when RPM applies, prices have been constrained by 
competition between branded goods. Mr. Feldman is 
aware that he operates in a commercial marketplace; he is 
aware of his independence as a pharmacist, and he wants 
to maintain that.

<P>
I do not wish to detain the Committee further on the 
question of the viability and importance of pharmacies in 
local communities; I hope that that much is established. 
To return to the point made by Labour Members, how do 
we safeguard the future of community pharmacies? We 
must delve into new schedule 1 for a moment. As I 
understand it the Under-Secretary will correct me if
I am wrong the Government have gone some way to 
meet some of the objectives that were achieved by an 
amendment that was accepted in the other place. Rather 
than proceeding by way of staying proceedings and 
moving to a transitional period, the Government propose 
to apply a specific transitional period to the continuing 
proceedings before the court. Of course, if resale price 
maintenance is justified before the court, it could then 
benefit from the transitional period.


<P>
As I understand it, the Government are considering a 
five-year transitional period. On the face of it, that is a 
generous period for the purpose, although I suspect that 
many in the industry would say that it is generous only if 
one is aware that at the end of it RPM has to go. We 
must then ask: is our objective to assume that retail price 
maintenance will go, and to give the industry a reasonable 
period in which to adjust to that prospect; or is it to 
safeguard the future of community pharmacies through 
the retention of resale price maintenance, if we believe 
that to be proper in the public interest as I do? I think 
that our objective should be the latter.

<P>
In parenthesis, when reading the new schedule I was 
pleased to see that, although there are provisions in 
paragraph 37 for the director general to apply for a review 
of a transitional period, that is specifically excluded under 
paragraph 39 in relation to the five-year transitional 
period for goods subject to a section 14 exemption under 
the Resale Prices Acts, so we have some assurance on 
that point.

<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I agree with the logic of what my hon. 
Friend is saying. Does he agree that if our intention should 
be to preserve resale price maintenance, because it is in 
the public interest, a five-year period of deferral a 
five-year stay of execution would be regarded by 
community pharmacies not as generous, but merely as a 
way of telling them, "You are to be hanged, but only in 
five years' time."

<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> My hon. Friend would indeed get 
something of that reaction from community pharmacies. 
Also, in the commercial market, where a stay of execution 
is known, that is anticipated and adjustments are often 
made that have exactly the same effect, but earlier.

<P>
<B>Mr. Beard:</B> I do not understand why it should be 
assumed that there is only a stay of execution. In five 
years' time the pharmacies could be investigated under 
the provisions of the Bill by the Office of Fair Trading 
and the whole thing be judged to be in the public interest 
and beneficial. It is not at all obvious why anyone should 
assume that there is only a stay of execution, and that in 
five years' time the agreement will go.

<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> The hon. gentleman is right, but as things 
stand, the industry is concerned. The hon. Gentleman 
ought to apply his criticism to those on the Government 
Front Bench. The implication of what the Under-Secretary 
was saying is that if it was left to the European 
Commission to pursue what was effectively an article 
85-style investigation against resale price maintenance, 
the industry would be under greater threat than if it simply 
proceeds under the current legislation to the restrictive 
practices court.

<P>
Unless the hon. Gentleman can enlighten me otherwise, 
the Bill will introduce into the United Kingdom through 
the chapter I prohibition an article 85-style investigation 
and, by extension, exactly the same sort of risk to resale 
price maintenance as applies under an investigation by 
the Community.

<P>
<B>Mr. Beard:</B> It is not exactly the same sort of risk, 
because even in five years time it could be investigated 
by the Director General of Fair Trading under the Bill 
rather than being investigated in 18 months or two years 
time by the European Commission under article 85.

<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> Yes, but the hon. Gentleman is going 
back to the point that he made earlier, which I promised 
I would try to answer. If the choice is between the 
Commission investigating in a shorter period under article 
85-style powers, or the matter becoming subject to 
investigation by the Director General of Fair Trading after 
a transitional period of five years under the chapter I 
prohibition powers, it would be better for the pharmacies 
for it to be done in a domestic context, using the chapter 
I prohibition powers.

<P>
The hon. Gentleman will agree, however, that at least 
in theory the outcome of the two investigations should be 
the same. Just as the director general, in applying the 
chapter I prohibition when looking at competition, would 
consider also the benefits to consumers by taking account 
of the public health benefits and the other public benefits 
of retaining community pharmacies, so the Commission 
would look not only at the competition aspect of article 
85 but, in theory under article 36, at some public health 
considerations.




<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Would not my hon. Friend concede that 
the respective British and European powers of 
investigation are not mutually exclusive? It is therefore 
possible to envisage a scenario in which the British 
competition authority had determined that resale price 
maintenance should be retained because it was in the 
public interest or whatever form of words it chose to put 
on its findings and that RPM was therefore secure at 
least for five years and possibly for longer, but that the 
European Commission had decided in the intervening 
period to hold its own investigation. That would be a 
matter of great regret to hon. Members of both sides of 
the House.

<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> Yes, my hon. Friend makes an interesting 
point. I am not sure whether the Under-Secretary can 
exclude the possibility of the Commission seeking to take 
over after the transitional period, on the basis that it was 
a matter that affected trade between member states, to the 
extent that the over-the-counter medicines to which RPM 
applied came from outside the United Kingdom and were 
not wholly within the domestic context.

<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Far be it from me to dwell again on the 
doctrines of subsidiarity or proportionality, but does my 
hon. Friend agree that if the Commission were to get itchy 
feet and indicate an interest in investigating the matter, 
the doctrine of subsidiarity would not protect us? I hope 
that the Under-Secretary is aware that that doctrine is 
subject to the "general provisions and objectives" of the 
treaty of Amsterdam. In other words, the Commission 
could easily justify a decision to investigate the matter, 
saying that doing so did not conflict with the principle 
of subsidiarity.

<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> My hon. Friend knows that I sympathise 
with that view, but even the Commission is enjoined by 
the treaty of Rome to have regard to public health 
policies. However, although the Commission's 
competence extends to some public health matters, it is 
recognised in the treaty that member states have the power 
to take measures to promote their own health policies. I 
hope that the Commission would tend to the view that it 
should try to take over an investigation that had such an 
interplay with a member state's health policy.

<P>
As the hon. Member for Bexleyheath and Crayford and 
others have made clear, at the heart of the matter is the 
question, should we rest upon the schedule as it stands, 
saying that the five-year transitional period is better than 
was previously anticipated; that fact that the director 
general cannot interrupt, reduce or review that transitional 
period is a better safeguard than we had in the original 
schedule schedule 10, if my memory serves me right 
and that, in the absence of that safeguard for the industry, 
the Commission would take over the matter earlier, and 
the same threats would apply? The answer is that that is 
good only as far as it goes; we could go further. That is 
our response to what the Under-Secretary said in moving 
the amendment. We look beyond that to what more the 
Government should do. The Government could do more 
in the new schedule.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>


<P>
In paragraph 36, the Government propose to take power 
to extend transitional periods I do not think that the 
criteria for doing so are specified but not in the case of 
a five-year transitional period. It may be desirable to 
extend the transitional period, so my first question to the 
Under-Secretary is, why not use paragraph 36, or at least 
leave in paragraph 36 the possibility as in other 
transitional periods of extending the transitional period 
beyond the original five-year term? Secondly, why do we 
have to go down this route?

<P>
Let us return to the original amendments, which the 
Government resisted. For all the Government's rhetoric, 
and the Under-Secretary's rhetoric in opposition, about 
the desirability of protection community pharmacies, in 
another place, the Government resisted amendments 
designed to provide a specific exemption for community 
pharmacies. Ministers have the power to provide an 
exemption, to take specific legislative cover for an 
exemption or to use the powers in the legislation to 
exclude such agreements.

<P>
Without specific result, we have debated what are the

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"exceptional and compelling reasons of public policy"
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
why Ministers should provide for an exclusion from the 
chapter I prohibition. Given that current legislation allows 
resale price maintenance only for medicines, does that 
give rise to

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"exceptional and compelling reasons of public policy"
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
for Ministers to exclude such agreements from the scope 
of the chapter I prohibition?

<P>
If Ministers will not legislate to exclude those 
agreements, will they at least use the discretion that they 
have taken to themselves in the Bill to continue RPM? 
The industry will feel much more sure of its position if it 
is excluded or provided with a specific exemption than if 
it is subject to a serial test whether, first, it can win its 
case in the restrictive practices court, and then, only a 
short time thereafter in commercial terms, run the second 
jeopardy of resubmitting itself not to the current 
legislation but to the new chapter I prohibition.

<P>
We should recognise what the Government have done 
in the new schedule, which is different from and better 
than what was proposed before. However, it is still not 
enough more could be done.

<P>

<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> The House of Lords was right on this 
subject; to date, the Government have not got it right. We 
are concerned that there is a still a serious threat to the 
position of small pharmacies. It is right to emphasise that 
we are talking not just about rural pharmacies, but about 
urban pharmacies. I say that to reassure the hon. Member 
for Milton Keynes, South-West, and the hon. Member for 
South Thanet who referred to this point on Second 
Reading.

<P>
As so often, the House of Lords was in touch
with public opinion in a way that the House of Commons 
has not yet shown itself to be. [Interruption.] I shall 
deal and it is not difficult with the hon. Member for 
Milton Keynes, South-West, who giggles inanely from a 
sedentary position in response to that point. That is a 
source of regret. The House of Lords got it right;
it listened with respect to the representations that it 
received; it held an intelligent debate on the matter;
it reached a verdict, reflected in the vote, which was 
widely welcomed. It would be welcomed by a number of 
the pharmacies in the hon. Lady's constituency. If she 
thinks that that is a matter for levity and disrespect, that 
is regrettable; it is not. We should acknowledge that the 
House of Lords attended to the matter seriously and 
reached a judgment with which many people will agree.

<P>
<B>Dr. Starkey:</B> rose 

<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> If the hon. Lady has a serious response 
to that, I am happy to give way.

<P>
<B>Dr. Starkey:</B> I doubt whether pharmacies in my 
constituency, or indeed in the hon. Gentleman's would be 
incredibly pleased at the effect of the amendment made 
in the other place, which might be to put them at greater 
risk earlier from the European Commission than they 
would otherwise be through the procedure that the 
Government propose in the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> As I rather suspected, the hon. Lady has 
now shifted her position. Obviously the message has been 
received on the pager. The knock on the door, perhaps 
even in the middle of the night, from a representative of 
Her Majesty's Whip's office, has ensured compliance on 
the part of the hon. Lady. I shall turn in due course to the 
question of the position of Labour Back Benchers.

<P>
I emphasise at the outset the value of the existing 
community pharmacies. There are two principal aspects 
to that value. The first is the quality of the service that 
they provide a point that has been made by hon. 
Members on both sides of the Committee, but not 
necessarily during the proceedings of the Committee. 
Several hon. Members have, in one way or another, 
declared their support for community pharmacies in recent 
months. It is regrettable that, although to date Labour 
Members have referred to the subject, usually when 
intervening on my hon. Friends, none of them has yet 
devoted a speech to the subject. As I said, I shall return 
to that point.

<P>
The service is invaluable and of particular importance 
and value to the elderly, to the sick, to the disabled, to 
mothers and to those without transport. That is the first 
point that is to be established beyond doubt; if 
counter-arguments are to be put, let us hear them. 
However, I hope that no Labour Member will dispute the 
valuable role that those pharmacies perform.

<P>
<B>Ms Jackie Lawrence (Preseli Pembrokeshire):</B> We 
have heard mention of the early-day motion supporting 
community pharmacies. If it is so wonderful, why did 
only three of the 150-odd Conservative Members sign it?




<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Conservative Members have found many 
ways to express their support for community pharmacies. 
We have been doing so throughout the proceedings of the 
Committee. The challenge to Labour Members is, why 
did they sign up to an early-day motion to satisfy their 
constituents and subsequently fail to say anything 
concrete in support when they had the opportunity to do 
so?

<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> My hon. Friend is right. labour 
Members have, foolishly, forgotten, but does he also 
remember that the Opposition moved a reasoned 
amendment on Second Reading, incorporating the very 
words of their early-day motion? We all voted for it 
where were they?

<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Precisely; my right hon. Friend is entirely 
correct. That was on 11 May, and he is right to draw 
attention to that important fact. By then, Labour 
Members' heads were well and truly below the parapet. It 
is a classic example of the distinction between the gesture 
fetish politics that they pursue and the practical attempt at 
worthwhile reform and protection of valued interests that 
Conservative Members pursue.

<P>
The second aspect of the valuable role that community 
pharmacies perform is how they reduce the burden on 
GPs. That already substantial burden would be much 
greater if it were not for a decent network of community 
pharmacies in urban and rural areas. Conservative 
Members support a nationwide network of community 
pharmacies. Labour Members said that they backed such 
a network. The difference is simple. Our support is 
undeniable; their support is, for the most part, largely 
undetectable. [Interruption.] I can see that I have now 
pricked the conscience of the hon. Member for Hastings 
and Rye (Mr. Foster), to whom I happily give way.

<P>
<B>Mr. Michael Jabez Foster (Hastings and Rye):</B> The 
hon. Gentleman says that many of us have changed tack. 
That is simply not the case. As he will know, many of 
us very much subscribe to the well being of community 
pharmacies. The problem that some of us have, with 
which he could perhaps help us, is how does he persuade 
the hon. Member for Tunbridge Wells to withdraw his 
attack on community pharmacies? That attack is behind 
the reasoning as to why many of us believe that the only 
way forward is to go along with the Government's 
proposals so that the community pharmacies have at least, 
because of the good argument that they have presented, 
five years. If we allow the hon. Member for Tunbridge 
Wells to pursue his campaign unheeded, the difficulties 
for pharmacies will be greater.




<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Unfortunately, the hon. Gentleman is 
using a hopeless smokescreen. He knows well that it is a 
smokescreen and hopeless. The reality is simply stated: 
my hon. Friend the Member for Tunbridge Wells was not 
a Member of Parliament when that complaint was made. 
[Interruption.] I would be grateful if the hon. Member for 
Hastings and Rye (Mr. Foster), could contain his 
impatience and exercise whatever degree of self-restraint 
he can muster in the circumstances. My hon. Friend the 
Member for Tunbridge Wells was pursuing his 
commercial interests. In that context, it would be 
interesting to establish whether Labour Members now 
advance the doctrine that people in business should 
pollute their business interests with political 
considerations. Is the hon. Gentleman seriously arguing 
that business men who make a judgment about the 
interests of their companies and shareholders should be 
told what to do by members of the Committee? That 
would be wrong.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The Committee is beginning to 
stray from the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Mr. Maxton, I shall comply immediately 
and enthusiastically with your wise guidance on this 
important matter. The real issue is not the activities of 
my hon. Friend the Member for Tunbridge Wells but the 
position of the Government. Are they simply playing for 
time and sitting on the sidelines? Are they prepared to 
wait for the judgments of others or to behave as a 
Government should behave to take a stance, to offer a 
view, to seek to influence, to try to ensure that action is 
taken? My right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham, 
from a sedentary position, shook his head and said that he 
did not think that the Government were prepared to take 
a stand. I fear that he is right; but the betrayal and 
abdication of responsibility are not less because they are 
largely predictable.

<P>
<B>Dr. Ladyman:</B> It will not be Europe I believe that 
my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary may be wrong on this 
point that will ultimately destroy resale price 
maintenance in over-the-counter medicines. The lessons 
of history especially those of the net book agreement 
suggest that the trade will break ranks, break the law and 
bring the law into disrepute until resale price maintenance 
is abandoned. That is exactly what happened in the case 
of the net book agreement. If the matter is not brought 
before the restrictive practices court, the European 
Commission will not have enough time to consider it, as 
the trade his hon. Friend the Member for Tunbridge 
Wells and his cronies at Asda will destroy it by other 
means.
<p><b>Mr. Bercow: </b>I always enjoy the hon. Gentleman's 
contributions 

<P>
<B>Mr. Nigel Griffiths:</B> Because they are good.

<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> They are good, but on this occasion the 
hon. Gentleman is looking into a crystal ball. I would 
prefer not to try to undermine the position of community 
pharmacies by predicting the demise of arrangements that 
I want to uphold. I very much hope that those 
arrangements will not be undermined by aggressive and 
predatory behaviour by large supermarkets. I do not know 
whether resale price maintenance will be destroyed; all I 
know is that I am fighting to retain it because I believe in 
it. I am not interested in predicting who will win. I am 
not taking a bet or behaving as a punter; I am arguing the 
case as members of the Committee should as an 
advocate.

<P>
I want briefly to return to some of the arguments for the 
retention of resale price maintenance for over-the-counter 
medicines. First, it keeps a number of small pharmacies 
viable. The reality is that if resale price maintenance is 
abolished a substantial number of small pharmacies, in 
urban and rural areas, will suffer. The likelihood is that 
they will suffer to the extent that they are driven out of 
business. The hon. Member for Watford (Ms Ward) looks 
rather quizzical about that point I am not sure why.
I readily concede that I do not base my case on personal 
experience of having run a pharmacy but on having 
listened with some respect to those people who do. Their 
concern is that they will be driven out of business. The 
community pharmacy action group calculates that about 
3,000 pharmacies are at risk.

<P>

<B>Mr. David Borrow (South Ribble):</B> If it is so important 
to the Opposition that resale price maintenance continues 
in perpetuity, why did the representatives of the 
community pharmacy action group who came to see me 
recognise that it should be phased out? Their main 
concern was the way in which it was to be phased out and 
the transitional arrangements that were to be put in place 
to ensure the existence of a good network of community 
pharmacies. They were not arguing for the permanence of 
resale price maintenance, which is what the hon. 
Gentleman seems to want.



<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>


<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> The answer is that I do not know the 
particular representatives to whom the hon. Gentleman 
refers. The likelihood is that they knew that it was a lost 
cause trying to argue the case with him the dedicated 
supporter of the Government Front Bench that he is and 
they were arguing for the least worst option. I assure the 
hon. Gentleman and the Committee I am certain that my 
right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham will 
support me in this that our discussions with the 
community pharmacy action group made it clear that there 
is not the slightest doubt that its preferred position is the 
retention in perpetuity of existing arrangements, with 
which it is thoroughly content.

<P>
It may be that, as a matter of tactics, the community 
pharmacy action group sought to minimise the pain by 
saying to a Government supporter, "Well, if this is going 
to happen, can you ensure at least some modest protection 
for us?" The truth of the matter was eloquently illustrated 
by the hon. Gentleman's unwise intervention. The group 
knows that if it wants sturdy and robust support for its 
preferred position, it must seek meetings with and engage 
in correspondence with Conservative Members. If it 
wishes to minimise the pain and draw some crumb of 
comfort from the table occupied by the unswerving 
Back-Bench supporters of the Government, it must seek 
a meeting with the hon. Gentleman. But that is a 
secondary option which the group knows will not give it 
as much help.

<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> Bearing in mind the absence of sensible 
contributions from Labour Members on a matter that is of 
great importance to their constituents, would my hon. 
Friend conclude that, unfortunately, it has been a waste of 
time lobbying any of them?

<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> That is undoubtedly true. The reality, as 
my right hon. Friend knows and has stated, is that Labour 
Back Benchers, who seemed so concerned to protect 
community pharmacies a few months ago, are now 
entirely quiescent. They take their lead from the 
Government.

<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> In that regard, does my hon. Friend recall 
that the hon. Member for South Thanet, who argues for 
community pharmacies, made it clear on Second Reading 
that resale price maintenance should be replaced by an 
increment to the essential pharmacies scheme? The view 
of the community pharmacy action group was that it 
wanted an exemption for resale price maintenance.




<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> The hon. Member for South Thanet will 
not be surprised to know that I have recorded his words 
on Second Reading on 11 May. I think that they were 
important. I am happy to advise the Committee that the 
hon. Gentleman's retreat and expression of fealty to the 
Government began at column 105 after a long panegyric 
on the importance of community pharmacies. He said:

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Resale price maintenance is not necessarily the best way in 
which to help them." [Official Report, 11 May 1998; Vol. 312, 
c. 105.]
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That little remark, couched in the midst of a long and 
eloquent speech on Second Reading, was the start of the 
hon. Gentleman's backtracking. It is scandalous that it 
came after he had signed the early-day motion committed 
to the protection of resale price maintenance on 
over-the-counter medicines because it was important to 
the preservation of community pharmacies.

<P>
I do not wish to impugn the hon. Gentleman's motives. 
He is a fine and courteous contributor to our debates. 
However, it is not unreasonable to suppose I fear that 
some less than charitable souls will so suppose that, 
during the period between the hon. Gentleman signing the 
early-day motion and Second Reading on 11 May, a 
member of the Government Front Bench might have 
advised the hon. Gentleman of the unwisdom of his action 
if he entertained hopes of elevation.

<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> Has my hon. Friend also noticed the 
retreat line that emerged from the Government during the 
early stages, when they appeared to turn to an enhanced 
subsidy scheme for pharmacies that they were otherwise 
mugging? We would not have recommended that 
measure, but it would have been better than nothing. 
Because the incipient rebellion of Labour Members was 
burnt off quickly, those Members no longer have even 
that which the Government were thinking of offering to 
them.

<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> My right hon. Friend is entirely correct.

<P>
I want briefly to underline some of the arguments.
I referred to the community pharmacy action group's fear 
that 3,000 community pharmacies were at risk. That fear 
is well founded because the figure has not been plucked 
from the air. The dire prognosis is based on a calculation 
that 20 per cent. of the customers of those small 
pharmacies would shop instead in supermarkets in the 
event of the abolition of resale price maintenance.

<P>
No one could accuse the community pharmacy action 
group of overstating its case. The 20 per cent. estimate is 
substantially lower than that made by the Offic
e of Fair Trading, which estimated that 36 per cent. of 
customers would shift to large supermarkets if resale price 
maintenance were abolished. The community pharmacy 
action group's fear that 3,000 could go under may indeed 
prove to be a very conservative estimate. The damage 
wrought by abolition could be much greater.

<P>
This country is not excessively endowed with 
pharmacies about 10 per cent. of rural parishes have 
them. The two small towns in my constituency, which 
otherwise consists of over 120 villages, have invaluable 
pharmacies. Community pharmacies in the small market 
town of Buckingham which is an admirable place that 
hon. Members are welcome to visit at any time and in 
the even smaller town of Winslow, want those pharmacies 
to be preserved. They support the retention of resale price 
maintenance and over-the-counter medicines.

<P>
I can assure the hon. Member for Milton Keynes, 
South-West that community pharmacies will be deeply 
unimpressed by her pusillanimous approach to this 
important subject. The margins enjoyed by small 
pharmacies are among the lowest in the European Union, 
as are the over-the-counter prices for medicines in that 
sector. Many low-income households are nevertheless 
prepared to pay a little extra because of the excellence 
and the convenience of the local small pharmacy service.




<P>
Given the inadequacy of the Government's position on 
this important matter that of playing for time without 
declaring their hand we must deal with the question of 
the performance of Government Back Benchers. It is fair 
to refer, and I do so non-pejoratively, to the early-day 
seven by which I mean those Labour Members of the 
Committee who signed the early-day motion to support 
the retention of resale price maintenance, and who thereby 
sought to protect the continuing role of small community 
pharmacies. They were the hon. Members for Bexleyheath 
and Crayford; for South Ribble (Mr. Borrow); for 
Hastings and Rye; for Middlesbrough, South and 
Cleveland, East (Dr. Kumar); for South Thanet; for 
Plymouth, Sutton (Mrs. Gilroy) and for Milton Keynes, 
South-West.

<P>
The Committee's proceedings should record, and 
thankfully will now record, that none of those hon. 
Members has made a speech in Committee in support of 
the unequivocal, and preferably permanent, retention of 
resale price maintenance.

<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> My hon. Friend referred to the fact that 
no member of the Committee has spoken in support of 
community pharmacies. Does he recall the fact that on 
Second Reading the hon. Member for South Ribble made 
an important and useful speech on that subject? The hon. 
Gentleman made it clear that if the restrictive practices 
court did not sustain resale price maintenance, he wanted 
an assurance from the Government that there would be a 
substantial increase in the value of the essential pharmacy 
scheme. However, the hon. Gentleman did not comment 
on that he simply said, "Oh well, we will have a 
transitional period, after which everything will be all 
right."

<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> In previous debates, my hon. Friend the 
Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin) referred to the 
emerging telepathy between him and me I seemed 
continually to anticipate what he was about to say, and 
vice versa. Such is true of the continuing and fruitful 
relationship between my hon. Friend the Member for 
South Cambridgeshire and me. I was about to move on to 
the point that he has just made.

<P>
I must refer and I say this with no hint of sarcasm 
to the very important contribution that the hon. Member 
for South Ribble made on Second Reading. I remember 
the occasion, and I enjoyed his speech 

<P>
<B>Mr. Nigel Griffiths:</B> Because the hon. Gentleman has 
it in his records.

<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> As the Under-Secretary correctly infers, 
I have it in my records.

<P>
I hope that the hon. Member for South Ribble is 
flattered to learn that his words are carefully recorded by 
Conservative Members [Interruption.] for posterity, 
as one of my hon. Friends put it. I shall consider whether 
I can include in my collection the remarks of the hon. 
Member for Bexleyheath and Crayford we shall see.

<P>
I want to refer to the contribution that the hon. Member 
for South Ribble made on Second Reading and, to save 
Members of the Committee the trouble of shifting through 
the Official Report of that debate, his remarks are at 
column 91. He said: 

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the Government still have a responsibility to ensure that a 
network of community pharmacies continues to exist."
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He did not content himself with that exiguous comment; 
he continued:

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The £4 million that is given to maintain essential community 
pharmacies is but a small part of what might be needed if resale 
price maintenance in that sector were removed." [Official Report, 
11 May 1998; Vol. 312, c.91.]
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The hon. Gentleman was signalling to the Government 
the fact that he would prefer to preserve resale price 
maintenance that much is not in doubt; he signed an 
early-day motion to that effect. He went on to say that if 
it were removed, the Exchequer had better cough up a 
substantial sum of money to protect many retail 
pharmacies.

<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> I have been pondering how this could 
have happened. Could it have resulted from a pager 
mistake? Perhaps the first line of the message read,
"You must not," and the second line continued, "vote for 
early-day motion" whatever number it was, but the first 
line somehow got omitted. Labour Members therefore 
only got the instruction to vote for the early-day motion.




<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> My right hon. Friend offers an ingenious 
explanation. It is a sign of his compassionate tendencies 
that he is seeking to find an explanation for the 
extraordinary behaviour of Labour Back Benchers. I know 
not what motivates them.

<P>
The hon. Member for South Ribble made a worthwhile 
contribution on Second Reading but, frankly, his plea for 
a larger essential pharmacy scheme was not realistic. He 
knows full well that it will not be provided. I do not doubt 
for a moment I shall stand corrected if I am wrong, but 
I very much doubt that I am that he will have issued a 
press release on his speech on Second Reading to all his 
local papers, and he probably had himself pictured as the 
avowed defender of the interests of the community 
pharmacy. He will have said to his constituency Labour 
party, "Here am I, standing up for the interests of local 
pharmacists." What has he done in Committee? His 
"standing up" amounted only to a brief intervention. We 
know not whether any Labour Member plans to make a 
further contribution.

<P>
Of the seven early-day motion signatories, resale price 
maintenance was not mentioned on Second Reading by 
the hon. Members for Bexleyheath and Crayford, for 
Plymouth, Sutton and for Milton Keynes, South-West.

<P>
<B>Dr. Starkey:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman accept that 
many hon. Members including some opposition 
Members see no point in repeating in a debate a point 
that has already been made? The purpose of Second 
Reading debates is to allow the maximum number of hon. 
Members to speak. If every hon. Member simply repeated 
points that had already been made, there would be fewer 
contributions to the debate.

<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> That is an extraordinarily feeble 
explanation from the hon. Lady. She felt sufficiently 
strongly about the subject to sign the early-day motion, 
and about the Bill to make a speech on Second Reading, 
but out of her extraordinary consideration for the 
interests of other hon. Members she has declined to refer 
to the centrality of resale price maintenance.

<P>
It being One o'clock, The Chairman adjourned the 
Committee without Question put, pursuant to the 
Standing Order.
