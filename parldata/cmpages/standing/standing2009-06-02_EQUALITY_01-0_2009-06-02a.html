<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060261000366"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Before we begin, I have a few preliminary
announcements to make. The Programming Sub-Committee met earlier this
morning and agreed a revised resolution. Copies of the new resolution
are available in the room. Members may, if they wish, remove their
jackets during Committee sittings. Please ensure that mobile phones and
pagers are turned off or switched to silent mode. I remind the
Committee that there is a money resolution in connection with the Bill,
copies of which are available in the
room.</div><a name="09060261000008"></a><div class="hs_Para">Adequate
notice of amendments must be given. To be eligible for selection at a
Tuesday sitting, amendments must be tabled by the rise of the House on
the previous Thursday. For a Thursday sitting, amendments must be
tabled by the previous Monday, as a general rule. I and my fellow
Chairman do not intend to call starred
amendments.</div><a name="09060261000009"></a><div class="hs_Para">Not
everyone is familiar with the process of taking oral evidence in Public
Bill Committees. It might help if I briefly explain how we will
proceed. The Committee will first be asked to consider the programme
motion on the amendment paper, for which debate is limited to half an
hour. We will then proceed to consider a motion to report written
evidence, and then a motion to permit the Committee to deliberate in
private in advance of the oral evidence sessions, which I hope we can
take
formally.</div><a name="09060261000010"></a><div class="hs_Para">Assuming
that the second motion is agreed to, the Committee will move into
private session. Once the Committee has deliberated, witnesses and
members of the public will be invited back into the room and our oral
evidence session will commence. That will be at about 11
o&#146;clock. If the Committee agrees to the programme motion, oral
evidence will be taken today and next Tuesday, and the Committee will
revert to the more familiar proceedings of clause by clause scrutiny
next
Thursday.</div><a name="09060261000011"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
call the Minister to move the programme motion. I remind the Committee
that the text of the motion is printed on a separate
paper.</div><a name="09060261000012"></a>

Chairman:</b> Thank you very much. The Committee will ask a
series of questions. Before we commence, may I ask whether you have
submitted written evidence?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column4" />Column number: 4</div><a name="09060261000047"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah
Spencer:</b></i> We gave a short paragraph that summarises
the many issues on which our member organisations have a consensus,
welcoming the Bill and raising several points where we could see it
improved&#151;two or three paragraphs that we were asked
for.</div><a name="09060261000048"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Wadham:</b></i> The Equality and Human Rights Commission has
circulated this document, which is in a better colour than this
photocopy. Secondly, we have sent a specific submission to the
Committee. Thirdly, there is a specific submission from the disability
committee, which is part of the commission. All Members should have
three documents from us. If you do not, we can get them circulated
after the
session.</div><a name="09060261000049"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kevin
Sadler:</b></i> We have supplied the Committee with two
paragraphs, which explain the role of the Tribunals Service and welcome
the
legislation.</div><a name="09060261000050"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060261000370"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Thank you very much. We will start with the
questions
now.</div><a name="09060261000051"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
2</b><a name="09060261000371"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Mark Harper</b> (Forest of Dean) (Con): Thank you,
Mr. Benton. I want to start with the socio-economic duty.
There is a clear problem with socio-economic inequalities. Just looking
at the views of Cabinet Ministers, Alan Johnson and Alan Milburn have
come out with memorable quotes about the fact that it is more
difficult, and becoming even more so, for people from poor backgrounds
to escape their upbringing. The obvious question is not that there is a
problem, but how one deals with it. Perhaps the witnesses could explain
whether they think the approach that the Government have taken in the
Bill is the right one and is likely to be effective.</div>
<a name="09060261000052"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah
Spencer:</b></i> We think that it is a helpful but modest
measure. It does not have any enforcement provisions, but it is a
measure that will encourage strategic bodies simply to think about the
importance, as you said, of addressing socio-economic inequality. It
does not require the bodies to do anything specific other than ensure
that they have regard to the need to do that, whatever their functions.
We think that the Bill is proportional and useful, but
modest.</div><a name="09060261000053"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Wadham:</b></i> We have set out in our briefing the fact that
we also support the development of the socio-economic duty. In our
analysis of the issues relating to our core mandates&#151;race, women
and gender, disability, sexual orientation, religion, belief and
age&#151;the key factor in many issues that people face is,
unsurprisingly, poverty. Their discriminatory treatment has significant
socio-economic consequences. Therefore, it is not too much of a leap,
from our perspective, to ask the question whether more needs to be
done, not only for any particular group, but for the groups in general,
to ensure that they are in a better position and can compete on equal
terms with
others.</div><a name="09060261000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">Nor
is it a big leap to ask public authorities&#151;particularly the
strategic ones&#151;the question whether they are delivering their
services in a manner appropriate to everyone in their area,
particularly in the context of poorer groups. I think it is a sensible
way forward, which the commission supports. The commission&#146;s
remit extends beyond what we might call the traditional strands and ask
questions about inequality in general. That is why we will promote the
provision.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column5" />Column number: 5</div><a name="09060261000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">To deal with
your second question on how effective the Bill will be, that depends on
the extent to which the public authorities understand how it works and
the extent to which they can use it effectively. That would be the
$64,000 question. As Sarah said, it is a modest development because it
says only that they need to consider the issue when they are making
decisions about their overall policy. I see no reason why that is not
going to benefit the people it is designed to
benefit.</div><a name="09060261000056"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kevin
Sadler:</b></i> I am not sure whether there is anything I can
add. I am chief executive of a public authority and will therefore be
bound by the
duty.</div><a name="09060261000057"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
3</b><b class="B"><a name="09060261000372"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> I will come back with one further question, if I
may, Mr. Benton. If the Bill is not effective and is no more
than political posturing, how will it drive organisations to do things
differently from what they are doing today? If they are doing this
already, the measure will be meaningless and have no effect. In what
way will it change how public sector organisations
behave?</div><a name="09060261000058"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Wadham:</b></i> We have seen some good examples of the
general public sector duty in relation to equality when, in initiating
new policies, public authorities ask the extent to which they relate to
race, gender or disability. Evidence shows that that is making a
difference. It seems that that is the best example we have of such a
duty, and I see no reason why it will not be effective. The cost
implications will be relatively small because the public authority will
have to ask how it is delivering to all the people entitled to its
service.</div><a name="09060261000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
could be said that that is something that public authorities should be
doing in any event&#151;in other words, asking themselves questions
not only about equality strands, but about socio-economic issues. It
seems to promote a public duty on them to concentrate their minds. I am
sure that there will be examples when people look again and services
are developed that do not currently exist or different approaches will
be taken when people who are discriminated against&#151;those who
suffer socio-economic disadvantages&#151;become better
off.</div><a name="09060261000060"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah
Spencer:</b></i> If the Committee wants to be extra sure that
the Bill will have an impact, the place to look is transparency to see
whether there should be a requirement in the specific duties under the
regulations for bodies to say what they are doing with the provision.
Rather than coming as an enforcement measure, that requirement would
shine a little light on what the bodies were doing and it would be
easier for organisations to ask appropriate
questions.</div><a name="09060261000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">Like
the commission, we are relatively confident that the provision, such as
it is, will ensure that organisations take such matters into account.
It will also enable people to ask the right questions of the authority
about whether it is taking those matters into
account.</div><a name="09060261000062"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
4</b><a name="09060261000373"></a><b class="B">Lynne
Featherstone</b> (Hornsey and Wood Green) (LD): Do any of you
have concerns about the discretionary powers that are given to
Ministers under the Bill, and the instability that that might cause in
equality law, which the Bill will hopefully sort out for the next 20
years? The Government of the day may change. Quite a lot of powers in
the Bill are left to the discretion of Ministers in the
future.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column6" />Column number: 6</div><a name="09060261000063"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah
Spencer:</b></i> We would probably want to highlight the
exemptions to the age provisions. We attach huge importance to how the
Bill extends protection from discrimination to older people in the use
of services. Clause 193 gives the Government carte blanche to design
the exemptions, and that is unfortunate. We understand why they are
doing it. They want to consult during the summer. We suggest that,
having consulted on the exemptions, they table appropriate amendments
to the Bill in the autumn when it is discussed in the Lords, so that
matters are specified in the Bill rather than leaving them all to
subsequent
regulation.</div><a name="09060261000064"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Wadham:</b></i> I am generally in favour of having many of
the measures in detail in the Bill. It is an impressive Bill. Those who
helped to draft it can be proud. The issue for me is at what point
during that process we stop. In an ideal world, it would be good if the
issues of age and exemptions were in the Bill. There is no doubt about
that, and I hope that age discrimination provisions in relation to
goods, facilities and services can be in the law as soon as possible.
However, I understand why that was not possible given the timetable for
the Bill&#146;s publication, so the key question is whether we shall
get this Bill or have to wait. It would be better for us to get the
Bill and for Parliament to scrutinise the exemptions in the best way
that it can, given that they will be dealt with under secondary
legislation.</div><a name="09060261000065"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
5</b><b class="B"><a name="09060261000374"></a>Lynne
Featherstone:</b> Sorry, but I thought that it had been a long
time in gestation, and that there had already been a lot of
consultation.</div>
<a name="09060261000066"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Wadham:</b></i> There are people here closer to you than I am
who will understand more about the timetabling of the Bill. I am not
here to defend the Government&#146;s
position.</div>
<a name="09060261000067"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
6</b><b class="B"><a name="09060261000375"></a>Lynne
Featherstone:</b> No. I am concerned about anything that is
kicked into the long grass in case it does not happen. I was trying to
see whether you felt likewise.</div>
<a name="09060261000068"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Wadham:</b></i> I absolutely want to see provisions put in
place as soon as possible. We know, particularly for older people but
for young people too, that there are issues about ensuring that we do
not lose the positive benefits that currently exist. Therefore, there
will be processes of negotiation and consideration. It is a balance.
There will always be a time when the Bill needs to be published, and we
must get on with that.</div>
<a name="09060261000069"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
7</b><b class="B"><a name="09060261000376"></a>Lynne
Featherstone:</b> Perhaps a commencement date in the Bill
might be the
answer.</div><a name="09060261000070"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Wadham:</b></i> I should declare a conflict of interest
because the commission is charged with producing statutory guidance as
well as other guidance. We want to ensure that when the Bill is
enacted, there is as much information as possible so that everybody,
whether they are employers, employees or public authorities, can
understand what it means. For many people, even lawyers, it is
difficult to understand what it means, and we want to do the best job
we can. If the Bill were enacted in two weeks&#146; time, I do not
think that our guidance would be ready. We want it to be introduced as
soon as possible but only in the context of having material that
enables people to understand its
effects.</div><a name="09060261000071"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
8</b><a name="09060261000377"></a><b class="B">Sandra
Osborne</b> (Ayr, Carrick and Cumnock) (Lab): Can you see how
the socio-economic duty applies to Scotland? Does it apply to both
reserved and devolved areas? If not, why not?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column7" />Column number: 7</div><a name="09060261000072"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah
Spencer:</b></i> We do not cover Scotland in that
respect.</div><a name="09060261000073"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Wadham:</b></i> I can report only what I know. I understood
that the Scottish Government have decided that this should not apply to
Scotland. There are continuing negotiations with Parliament and the
Government aimed at ensuring that it does. Our approach would be that
if the legislation is justified in England and Wales, it is justified
in Scotland. Issues of devolution must be sorted out in relation to
both devolved and non-devolved matters and I hope that those matters
can be sorted out. Whether that is done by the Westminster Parliament
and Government, or those in Scotland, this should apply to all
strategic public authorities across all three countries as soon as
possible.</div>
<a name="09060261000074"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
9</b><b class="B"><a name="09060261000378"></a>Sandra
Osborne:</b> So, is the commission not involved in
negotiations with the Scottish Government on this matter?</div>
<a name="09060261000075"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Wadham:</b></i> My Scottish colleagues are talking to both
the Parliament and the Government, as well as to the Government in
Westminster, to see whether we can ensure that the legislation covers
all public authorities across all three countries in the same way. We
will continue to do that. My colleagues have started to think through
how that might be possible.</div>
<a name="09060261000076"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
10</b><a name="09060261000379"></a><b class="B">John
Howell</b> (Henley) (Con): In the recent Work and Pensions
Committee inquiry into the Equality Bill, one of the consistent
criticisms made about the existing duties on public sector bodies was
that there was little recognition of the difference between outputs and
outcomes. Given the nature of socio-economic inequality, will it be
easy for public sector bodies to appreciate that
aspect?</div><a name="09060261000077"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Wadham:</b></i> It is much easier to concentrate on outputs
in the public sector and to measure what has been done. Inevitably, it
is more difficult to demonstrate an effect in the real world, but we
welcome the public sector equality duties as set out in the Bill on the
basis that they will have a more significant effect in the real world.
The job of the Equality and Human Rights Commission will be to enforce
those public sector equality duties. We do not have the same
enforcement powers in the Bill in relation to socio-economic duties
but, as Mr. Harper said, the real test is about whether this
will make any difference in relation to the effectiveness of the
duties. I am confident that it will have an effect. The question for
all of us is how effective the duties are going to be. That is a
challenge for public authorities and the Government in relation to the
guidance or regulations that they then make.</div>
<a name="09060261000078"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah
Spencer:</b></i> The wording in respect of public duties
makes a shift in the right direction for the real problem that you
identified. The fact that the duty is now not just to promote equality
but to advance it, makes it clear that the intention is to get
somewhere with this, not just to do something. The fact that the clause
spells out some of the outcomes that are intended, which was not in the
previous legislation, and the fact that it is a single duty now, rather
than public bodies having to deal with a lot of separate duties, are an
advantage. Having said that, we need to look carefully at the specific
duties in the consultation on that over the summer to see whether they
focus on procedures, which 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column8" />Column number: 8</div>has been a problem in the past, or whether they facilitate a focus on
outcomes. I emphasise the importance of transparency. We need to see
the position that the public body started with, where they have now got
to and what steps they have taken in
between.</div>
<a name="09060261000079"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
11</b><b class="B"><a name="09060261000380"></a>John
Howell:</b> May I pursue that, particularly in the context of
health inequalities, which make up a big part of the socio-economic
side of it? You are probably as aware as I am that many county councils
have created the post of a director of public health in association
with their primary care trusts and are focusing on addressing health
inequalities within their area in a very aggressive way, which is to be
much commended. What additionality do you see this providing in that
sort of
situation?</div><a name="09060261000080"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah
Spencer:</b></i> Are you now talking about the socio-economic
duty?</div><a name="09060261000081"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060261000381"></a>John
Howell:</b>
Yes.</div><a name="09060261000082"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah
Spencer:</b></i> What both sets of duties should provide is a
catalyst that requires the public bodies to take into account the need
to achieve these outcomes. They are so important, relative to the old
system of anti-discrimination which rested on remedies. These duties
put the responsibility on to the service provider to look at the
question of whether we are delivering equality. Until this
socio-economic clause was included, the question would have been
whether we were delivering equality on grounds of race, gender and so
on, but it now includes that additional dimension so that service
providers have to ask themselves that question. That should act as a
catalyst to them to do what we would all expect them to do anyway,
which is to ensure that they are providing a fair service to everyone,
but it is a provision which requires them to ask themselves that. What
is particularly important is that it requires them to look at the
evidence and then have a proportionate response to it. It should be a
driver of
actions.</div><a name="09060261000083"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
12</b><b class="B"><a name="09060261000382"></a>John
Howell:</b> May I pursue that further? Are you making the
criticism that not enough public bodies&#151;particularly local
authorities&#151;are taking this into account, and therefore it is a
general criticism of what they are doing, or are you pointing to
something that is going to be achieved as a result of tackling
socio-economic inequality through this Bill that is additional to what
they are doing
now?</div><a name="09060261000084"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah
Spencer:</b></i> The view is that, if we look at the evidence
on health inequalities, for instance, we can see that there are sharp
disparities between different sections of the public. Health providers
are the bodies with the greatest capacity to do something about that
and this is providing them with a duty to do so. It is not necessarily
suggesting that the performance of every health provider at the moment
is inadequate, because there are clearly some very good performers, but
it is a measure that should help to raise the performance of others so
that they are all working towards that objective and we can see if they
are doing it.</div>
<a name="09060261000085"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Wadham:</b></i> We have looked at the ways in which the
current three equality duties are taken account of in relation to
public authorities, and unfortunately it is sometimes an add-on.
Sometimes it does not inform the decision-making process that leads to
the policy and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column9" />Column number: 9</div>therefore affects the substantive policy. It is a case of, &#147;Now
let us look at what the effect is in relation to women, race and
disability.&#148; What we need to do with the socio-economic duty is
to ensure that the question is asked at the point in time when people
are designing their policies, rather than afterwards. If we can get
public authorities to do that&#151;I am not saying it is easy, in
relation either to the equality duty or to this new proposal&#151;the
chances of this working and delivering greater and more effective
outcomes are significant. How do we measure that? I cannot comment on
the example you gave as to whether it would make those bodies better,
but I would be surprised if the public authorities that do this
properly did not deliver better outcomes for people who are
disadvantaged because of their socio-economic status. Invite me back in
five years&#146; time and we shall find
out.</div><a name="09060261000086"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
13</b><a name="09060261000383"></a><b class="B">John
Penrose</b> (Weston-super-Mare) (Con): May I pick up on those
answers and push a little further? Do public authorities not already do
this? Do they not already worry&#151;in some cases, obsessively, and
rightly so&#151;about socio-economic inequality and whether they are
achieving the right set of outcomes? Health outcomes, as John Howell
was saying earlier, are particularly intractable. Are health
authorities already worrying about whether they are putting the right
level of resources into an area with high indices of multiple
deprivation?</div><a name="09060261000087"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Wadham:</b></i> The commission has not done a lot of work on
the socio-economic duty because it has not existed before and the
commission has existed for only 18 months. However, going back to the
comparison with the equality duties, I can say that there are different
groups of public authorities that perform in different ways.
Some&#151;the good ones&#151;will be asking the question whether
there are any other duties, but others will
not.</div><a name="09060261000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
socio-economic equality in relation to how services are delivered and
policies decided, my guess is that that may be determined, to some
extent, by the political make-up of a local authority or whatever else
it is. The issue for the Equality and Human Rights Commission is that
this is a key issue of equality and how we ensure that everyone
delivers. Therefore, it needs to be written into the law; in other
words, &#147;You must take due regard of this factor when making
decisions about policy or delivery of those
services.&#148;</div><a name="09060261000089"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
14</b><b class="B"><a name="09060261000384"></a>John
Penrose:</b> I am sure that no one would argue with the
importance of achieving that. What we are discussing is whether it will
make any difference and whether it is the right method for achieving
that. A question to all three of you: do you have any evidence that
could be submitted to the Committee in the next little while of public
authorities that are not considering the issue adequately, in your
view?</div><a name="09060261000090"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Wadham:</b></i> I shall certainly go back and talk to my
colleagues and ask whether we have such evidence. As I said, it is
currently not a duty, but evidence that I can produce at the moment
relates to the equality duties, for which there are examples that
delivery of services for whichever group&#151;gender or
race&#151;has
improved.</div><a name="09060261000091"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
15</b><b class="B"><a name="09060261000385"></a>John
Penrose:</b> Put that aside for one second. What I am
concerned about is that if there is no evidence that you are aware
of&#151;clearly it is important for the Committee to see such
evidence, if it exists&#151;it is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column10" />Column number: 10</div>entirely possible that the very real problem of health inequalities, for
example, which we have just been discussing, although there are many
other examples, arises not because of a failure to consider it. In
fact, given the terms of political debate, it has, quite rightly, over
many years in this country, been something that has been considered
very carefully and very deeply by a very large number of
people.</div><a name="09060261000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
could be that what is involved is not a failure to consider, but the
actions taken being the wrong ones, rather than people not being
worried about the issue in the first place. In that case, this would be
entirely the wrong policy approach to take. We should be focusing on
actions rather consideration. We should be saying, &#147;We know that
there is a problem with health inequalities.&#148; The problem is
with something that the health authorities are doing, in spite of their
best efforts and endeavours&#151;something that they are getting
wrong. Asking them to consider the matter again is not going to get us
anywhere.</div><a name="09060261000093"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Wadham:</b></i> There may be all kinds of other things that
can be done, and I am not suggesting that they should not also be taken
forward, but in the context of the Bill the question for me is,
&#147;Can the law help?&#148; That is what the Bill is about. It
seems to me that the answer is, &#147;Yes, it can&#148;, because it
will then ensure that people have to take the issue into account. Of
course, there is a secondary issue about whether they are doing the
right things and how effective they are, but that is not something a
Bill can resolve, is
it?</div><a name="09060261000094"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060261000386"></a>John
Penrose:</b> No, and that is rather the point&#151;if it is
not the secondary
issue.</div><a name="09060261000095"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah
Spencer:</b></i> I do not see this as either/or. Surely the
Bill is simply a helpful measure to ensure that public bodies give
consideration to this. It redresses a balance because the law says very
clearly that you must consider gender, disability, race and so on. We
also want them to consider socio-economic disadvantage, so it is simply
saying you must consider that as well. If there are other
things&#151;or, indeed, a range of specific measures&#151;that it
ought to be doing, that may encourage them to think of those, but there
is nothing to stop those being done
separately.</div>

time?</div>
<a name="09060261000097"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Wadham:</b></i> But is not that precisely the problem? One of
the virtues of these duties, whether they are the equality or the
socio-economic duties, is the fact that if people take them seriously
it is likely that they will involve a different, although not
necessarily greater, allocation of resources. Therefore, it is likely
that the consequence of that will be a need to concentrate
people&#146;s minds on this being something that they have to think
about. It is really saying, &#147;Think about this&#148;. There is
no doubt whatever that there will be public authorities that are not
taking this properly into account. I would be surprised if there were
no examples
whatever.</div><a name="09060261000098"></a>

an issue of evidence. Nevertheless, I would be surprised. As Sarah was

with  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column11" />Column number: 11</div>the service, to ask the question&#151;there is a duty&#151;have you
considered that duty? So, it is an issue not just about the law but
about effectiveness and
transparency.</div><a name="09060261000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
a person who lives in London, I would want to ask the London

point of exhaustion on this. Other people want to ask questions. I call
Tim Boswell.</div>
<a name="09060261000103"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
18</b><a name="09060261000391"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Tim Boswell</b> (Daventry) (Con): If I may, following the
questions so far, and then perhaps asking Mr. Sadler, who is
somewhat beached at this discussion. The first issue is on the question
of the socio-economic duties. Do you envisage that this will end up
with a series of plans, which individual authorities will produce, or
explanations as to where they are, rather along the lines of, say,
disability awareness plans? Otherwise there will be no template to know
what they are doing and whether it could even be
sufficient.</div><a name="09060261000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
realise that there is no action in private law envisaged, but there
could be a judicial review that in effect says, &#147;You have not
tried.&#148; In a sense, your being a lawyer, Mr. Wadham,
and my not being, you are not really seeking to get this into court,
but you are at least trying to influence the action of authorities. How
do you see the drivers of this
working?</div><a name="09060261000105"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Wadham:</b></i> I am sure that in extreme cases people will
use this to take judicial review proceedings, where public authorities
have failed. In demonstrating whether a public authority has taken the
action necessary, I would prefer transparency rather than a separate
process. Perhaps amendments could be put together to ensure greater
transparency.</div><a name="09060261000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">When
the business plan, the three-year strategy or whatever the public
authority plans is integrated within the process, you can see the
transparency because you can see the questions that they have asked
themselves in the documents, strategies and business plans that they
are already
producing.</div><a name="09060261000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
anxiety is not to create a culture where there is a plethora of other
ex-post facto justifications or tick boxes. The key question is, when
planning services for the next year or three years, how do you take
that into account? I would hope that the business plan or the annual
report would set out how they have done so for the services or the
policies that are crucial in this context. That is what I would hope,
and people could measure that. Whether there are transparency measures,
or whether in extremis they think that there is a complete failure to
follow the duty, they are entitled to take judicial review proceedings,
which I guess is likely to be
rare.</div><a name="09060261000108"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060261000392"></a>Mr.

Spencer?</div><a name="09060261000109"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah

many other issues in the Bill.</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column12" />Column number: 12</div><a name="09060261000110"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
19</b><b class="B"><a name="09060261000393"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> Okay. We come quickly to two other points. The
first came out of Mr. Wadham&#146;s earlier remarks. Do
you see the Equality and Human Rights Commission as the custodian in
relation to developing inequalities? Is there a possibility of
identifying separate protected characteristics that might need
protection, especially in the Bill as drafted? If, for example, caste,
or something dreadful such as being an MP in current circumstances,
were to be regarded as grounds of discrimination&#151;or harassment
even&#151;would you consider that the sort of machinery that would
bring matters forward to the attention of
Ministers?</div><a name="09060261000111"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Wadham:</b></i> The Equality and Human Rights Commission has
statutory duty to monitor the law, which, in one sense, is why we are
here today. Talking to my colleagues from other
countries&#151;somebody visited me from Australia&#151;they have
different lists of protected characteristics or grounds. We need to
explore the extent to which those are necessary. The vast majority will
be captured by the nine grounds set out
here.</div><a name="09060261000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are issues. For instance, one of the things that we are concerned
about, which we are not in a position to make suggestions about, is the
issue of genetics and discrimination&#151;in others words,
pre-employment screening and so on. That seems to be an obvious issue
that we need to debate for the future. The commission will look
carefully at issues of that kind and make proposals when we have
considered all the issues that such a proposal might
raise.</div><a name="09060261000113"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
20</b><b class="B"><a name="09060261000394"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> Perhaps this is a lawyer&#146;s point, so I
will ask you before I pass it to Mr. Sadler&#151;the
question about principles. I know the Equality and Human Rights
Commission wanted a principles clause, and I spoke up for that on
Second Reading because I am familiar with the one in the mental
capacity legislation. Is there a fear among Government lawyers that it
will end up as a kind of double jeopardy? If they cannot get you under
the exact terms of the Equality Bill, they will have a go at you
because it is inconsistent with the principles. What is stopping a
principles clause, and is it important to you that we should have
one?</div><a name="09060261000114"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Wadham:</b></i> There are two parts to our proposals. The
first is what we call an equality guarantee, and the second is a
purpose clause. They are different. For various complicated reasons to
do with particular provisions in the European convention on human
rights, there is no constitutional equality guarantee. You may say that
there is no
constitution&#151;</div><a name="09060261000115"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060261000395"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> You mean there
is?</div><a name="09060261000116"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Wadham:</b></i> There is none in this country. The Human
Rights Act 1998 and the convention, principles and articles have taken
a step towards giving us the fundamental rights and protection that the
commission believes we should have, but the equality provision in them
is not as strong as it should
be.</div><a name="09060261000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am sure that members of the Committee have read the Bill in detail, and
are asking themselves the question, as we are, &#147;What does this
mean?&#148; That is what the courts will be doing. Where there are
provisions that need help in interpreting what they mean and what the
effect is in this or that particular circumstance, it would be
important, first, to have an equality guarantee. So, secondary
legislation would take second place to the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column13" />Column number: 13</div>provisions and the principles in our proposed equality guarantee, as is
the case with the provisions in the Human Rights
Act.</div><a name="09060261000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
in the context of equality itself, it would be helpful if we had a
purpose clause, so that when there is a debate in the courts, where the
lawyers are considering what the Bill means, it will be clear that they
are talking about the fact that this is a significant 21st century Bill
that will make a difference to equality across the board. Then the
courts and others will not have to look at bureaucratic and mechanistic
approaches to the interpretation. That works in other countries, and I
am very surprised and disappointed that my colleagues will not adopt
it. Nevertheless, I hope that they will change their mind as the Bill
goes through. It will make a significant difference, which is why we
suggested
it.</div><a name="09060261000119"></a>

21</b><b class="B"><a name="09060261000396"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> Mr. Sadler, if I may, do you have a
word about the likely load on tribunals if the Bill is passed? Will it
create an excessive work load? Perhaps to save time, I might ask
another question. I am familiar with special educational needs
legislation, and there is some disparity between what goes through the
tribunal route and what goes through the courts. There is a similar and
related issue in Scotland. Will you talk to your colleagues and try to
ensure that wherever possible those matters hinge reasonably and there
is equal access? Finally, there should be at least some opportunity for
mediation in cases, without having to force the issue where that is not
appropriate.</div>
<a name="09060261000120"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kevin

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060261000397"></a>Mr.

<a name="09060261000122"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kevin
Sadler:</b></i> Yes. On the second point, we have recently
introduced judicial mediation in employment tribunals in England and
Wales, and it is coming in Scotland as well. Together with existing
arrangements with ACAS, it aims to help people to afford a tribunal
hearing where it is sensible for them to do
so.</div><a name="09060261000123"></a>

22</b><b class="B"><a name="09060261000398"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> Clearly, it is not your direct area, but I have a
question about the awesome business of having to go to a county court.
For example, there might be a discrimination issue in further education
or in the universities. Do you talk to the Courts Service regarding its
approach on that?</div>
<a name="09060261000124"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kevin

judicial training.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
23</b><a name="09060261000400"></a><b class="B">Dr.
Evan Harris</b> (Oxford, West and Abingdon) (LD): I want to
ask about harassment. Perhaps we could start with John Wadham and ask
whether you think that it is satisfactory for there to be no protection
from harassment on the grounds of sexual orientation or religion for
captive populations such as school children.</div>
<a name="09060261000127"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Wadham:</b></i> The commission has been thinking about that
precise issue, and trying to resolve what some people might see as a
contradiction between the need for robust debate and freedom of
expression regarding some of those issues, and the issue of harassment.
It 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column14" />Column number: 14</div>seems to me that there might be some possibility of making a distinction
regarding the extent to which goods, facilities and services harassment
provisions could be extended to sexual orientation and religious belief
in some areas and not in others. You mentioned a captive population,
but the same could be true of other public sector providers, rather
than the private sector, which might be in a different situation. The
commission does not have a fixed position on that, but I hope that we
can continue to discuss it and produce a policy during the
Bill&#146;s progress through this House and the
next.</div>
<a name="09060261000128"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
24</b><b class="B"><a name="09060261000401"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> Obviously, I understand the need to preserve space
for debate, but if someone is looking for a hotel they can shop around.
If they are in school, they are in school and have no way of escaping
harassment on the ground of sexual orientation, unless it is so severe
that it becomes discrimination. I would be interested in Sarah&#146;s
view on that, as it seems peculiar to have the same lack of protection
for schoolchildren&#151;who are particularly vulnerable&#151;and
users of public services as for users of commercial services, who are
adults in a grown-up world.</div>
<a name="09060261000129"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Wadham:</b></i> I would favour that kind of approach. We have
evidence in the public domain that relates to bullying and children,
and particularly homophobic bullying. Some issues apply directly to
schools, which are, as you say, captive populations, and social
services and the public sector more generally. That does not apply if
someone can choose between Sainsbury&#146;s and another provider,
where they are not locked in in the way you are thinking about. That is
a direction of travel that the commission needs to think through, and I
hope that the Committee will discuss that matter during the passage of
the
Bill.</div><a name="09060261000130"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
25</b><b class="B"><a name="09060261000402"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I am sure that we will be keen to hear from you
when we have a detailed discussion.</div>
<a name="09060261000131"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah
Spencer:</b></i> I think this is definitely something that
needs to be looked at. We are puzzled as to why it should be lawful to
harass in schools on grounds of sexual orientation, religious belief
and gender reassignment when it is not on grounds of race, disability
and gender. Oddly enough, looking at the examples given in the notes on
the Bill, it is suggested that a pupil could bring a case if he had
suffered harassment on grounds of sexual orientation, which implies
that the examples went in and perhaps such matters came out of the Bill
at a later stage. We are puzzled and concerned about why the sexual
orientation of someone should be
exempted.</div><a name="09060261000132"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
26</b><b class="B"><a name="09060261000403"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> May I ask John Wadham about the definition of
harassment? It has been argued that the current definition of
harassment used historically from the origins of racial harassment is
quite wide. There has been a disjunctive provision under clause 24
where the harassment either violates B&#146;s dignity, which is hard
to define unless you are B, or creates
an</div><a name="09060261000340"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;intimidating,
hostile, degrading, humiliating or an
offensive&#148;</div><a name="09060261000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">environment.
&#147;Offensive&#148; is rather in the ear of the recipient. An
environment to some people could easily be offensive. We could argue
that humiliation or degradation is never acceptable, and that some
people can easily be offended. If we intend to extend protection from
harassment, but still seek to protect free speech and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column15" />Column number: 15</div>debate, is there a case for having a narrower definition of harassment
for the more tricky areas that we have just been discussing, assuming
that that is allowed within the terms of the directive?</div>
<a name="09060261000134"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Wadham:</b></i> Subject, as you say, to the terms of the
directive, it is difficult to see how action that was intimidating,
hostile, degrading or humiliating could be justified, but I accept
that, in the context of being offensive, some will say that people are
entitled to make offensive statements about sexual orientation or
particular religions or beliefs. That is what article 10 of the
European convention on human rights is about. So if we try to craft a
provision to ensure that people are protected from things that are, in
fact, damaging and, in the context, discriminatory because they have a
discriminatory effect on how people feel that they can take advantage
of the service or whatever, that is different from being offensive.
Whether this Committee or the other proceedings on the Bill will ensure
that there are two separate rules for harassment is a more complex
matter.</div><a name="09060261000135"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
27</b><b class="B"><a name="09060261000404"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> There are two at the
moment.</div><a name="09060261000136"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Wadham:</b></i> You are absolutely right. One of the key
virtues of the Bill, and why I hope that it will be supported not only
by us and parliamentarians but by those outside the House, is its
simplicity. I am not saying that that is necessarily a trump card, but
the more complex the Bill becomes, the more difficult it will be for us
or others to give guidance. I am not saying that it should not be more
sophisticated, but we would be very happy to give our views in more
detail as the measure
continues.</div><a name="09060261000137"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah
Spencer:</b></i> This is also something that we have looked
at carefully. Clearly, it is important that the provision does not go
too far. We are confident that, not only does it have to be compatible
with the European convention on human rights, but because of the terms
of clause 24(3) of the Bill in deciding whether the contact has that
effect, there is an objective criterion. Not only is it the perception
of the victim who feels that that has happened to them, but whether it
is reasonable for the conduct to have that effect. We feel that that
provides a sufficient qualification and that it will not be used too
widely.</div><a name="09060261000138"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
28</b><b class="B"><a name="09060261000405"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> It is one factor. I am surprised that you say that
it is sufficient. If you are a devout Muslim, you might be offended. It
would be reasonable if you were particularly devout to be offended by
something that someone else would not find offensive. Objectively,
given your devoutness, it is reasonable that you would be offended, but
that still does not necessarily solve the problem of certain people
being particularly sensitive and someone saying something without
knowing that a particular sensitivity is out there. That objective test
could be argued not to be sufficient to protect free
speech.</div><a name="09060261000139"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah
Spencer:</b></i> In those circumstances, it would still have
to be compatible in relation to the freedom of speech provisions under
the European convention on human rights. Even if the courts took it
only as reasonableness in terms of the victim, rather than the wider
definition of reasonableness, you would still have that balance under
the Human Rights Act.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column16" />Column number: 16</div><a name="09060261000140"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
29</b><b class="B"><a name="09060261000406"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> So you would just rely on the courts at the end,
after hundreds of
trials.</div><a name="09060261000141"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Wadham:</b></i> The issue is not quite that, though, is it?
One of the virtues of the Human Rights Act is precisely that it allows
whoever is interpreting, whether it is a school, its lawyers or the
courts, to ask that question. In other words, the provisions of article
10 need to be read into the matter, whether or not it is amended. I am
not suggesting, therefore, that we should not do our best to make it
compatible in the first place, but there is a long-stop&#151;that is,
as I said, the virtue of the Act. It protects the freedom of expression
in that context, which will exist regardless. If you get the
legislation right, and you do not have to rely on that, it is obviously
better. That is something I am happy to talk about in more detail, or
to make further submissions to get it right. It is important to
consider the matter, and it is quite difficult to get it
right.</div><a name="09060261000142"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
30</b><b class="B"><a name="09060261000407"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> Thank you. Some people worry about relying on
European or Strasbourg jurisprudence. But that is not your
problem.</div><a name="09060261000143"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Wadham:</b></i> That is not my position or the position of
the
commission.</div><a name="09060261000144"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
31</b><b class="B"><a name="09060261000408"></a>The
Parliamentary Secretary, Government Equalities Office (Maria
Eagle):</b> I want to move on to disability discrimination. My
interpretation of the concerns that have been sent to us so far is that
there are two major issues about the Bill. The first is that it blurs,
in some way, the current asymmetry between disability discrimination
and other strands. The other is that the Bill represents some kind of
regression from the current position. The Government position is that
we are in favour of retaining asymmetry&#151;that is
important&#151;and that there is no regression. I know that the
commission has put in some evidence about the matter. Mr.
Wadham, is there anything you can tell us? Perhaps Sarah also has
something to say. What are the precise concerns that you have about
regression?</div>
<a name="09060261000145"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Wadham:</b></i> I repeat that our overall impression of the
Bill, including provisions relating to disability, is generally 99 per
cent. right. The question that we are asking is about the other 1 per
cent. We have the one chance now, at least in the foreseeable future,
to get it right. Therefore, we want to ensure that there is a proper
debate in Committee on some of the issues. In that context, because the
words in the Bill are not words that we as lawyers are used to, we must
look carefully about what their meanings are. To take the example that
we were all surprised about, Malcolm <i class="I">v.</i> Lewisham, the courts may
sometimes take a different approach. It is worth it for all of us to
spend some time to check whether the provisions in the Bill are exactly
right. I do not apologise for not having all the answers, but I should
say that if there was an equality guarantee or purpose clause, I
understand that Malcolm would not have been decided in the way it was.
I hope that we can debate
that.</div><a name="09060261000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
also hope that those approaches will be successful. Inevitably, the
approach taken to harmonise in the Bill is a different approach from
the one we have taken so far. That is because of the development of the
equality law in relation to race, gender, disability and others. It has
been to craft measures that work as best as they can 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column17" />Column number: 17</div>for the group in question, whereas, actually, it is absolutely right for
the Bill to look across the board to say, as far as it is possible to
do so, whether we can ensure that there is one provision&#151;whether
that is in clause 13, regarding direct discrimination&#151;that will
cover all. My colleagues in the disability committee and other
colleagues in the commission more generally want to spend more time
looking at those proposals. We have raised a number of questions, but
those questions are not such that we say the law should therefore
definitely be changed. But we ask the Committee to debate the matter
and for us to provide more detailed submissions as we go through
them.</div>

me. But to take the more general question about whether &#147;on
grounds of&#148; as opposed to &#147;because of&#148; is better
or worse, I am afraid I am not sure I know the answer to that. I do not
know whether I understand the reasons for that process. I think we need
to think a bit more carefully about that, and that applies more
specifically because of the asymmetry to the disability
provisions.</div>

that?</div>
<a name="09060261000152"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah
Spencer:</b></i> The main issue that is raised by the
disability organisations and our membership is the difference between
the public duty on disability and the current wording in the proposed
new single equality duty&#151;specifically that it does not make
provision for disabled people to be treated potentially more
favourably. As I understand it, you do not intend that to be
regression. There is a concern that, in practice, it is regression. But
as our member, RADAR, is coming to give evidence to the Committee, I
want to leave it to them because they can explain it much more clearly
than I
can.</div><a name="09060261000153"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
35</b><a name="09060261000412"></a><b class="B">John
Mason</b> (Glasgow, East) (SNP): On the question of the public
sector duty, we are planning to include religion and belief as well as
sexual orientation. I think there has been some fear expressed that the
authorities are going to choose between the different strands which one
they want to promote more than another, and some would be afraid that
they would promote religion at the expense of sexual orientation.
Others would be afraid that they promote sexual orientation, and
religion would be at the bottom of the pile. Do you have concerns about
any of
that?</div><a name="09060261000150"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Wadham:</b></i> I understand why there are concerns. But I
think it is important to concentrate on what the clause is about.
Clause 143(1)(b), which I think is the issue, is about the advancement
of equality of opportunity. It
is</div><a name="09060261000341"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;equality
of opportunity between persons who share a relevant protected
characteristic&#148;,</div><a name="09060261000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">rather
than the religion. So the issue of equality of opportunity is not to
promote religions equally; it is to promote equality of opportunity
between people who share that belief or non-belief.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column18" />Column number: 18</div><a name="09060261000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I said
earlier, we will be able to help in relation to guidance, and in
relation to the enforcement process. I hope that public authorities
will ask themselves questions about whether they are advancing equality
of opportunity between the persons who have those beliefs or
non-beliefs, or shared characteristics in relation to sexual
orientation, rather than saying that they have to promote one
particular philosophical or religious belief as opposed to
another.</div>
<a name="09060261000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some of the
criticisms suggest that there is a duty to promote one religion rather
than another, and so I understand why people are concerned. But I am
not concerned, particularly because&#151;I would say this,
wouldn&#146;t I?&#151;we hope to help the provision by setting out
sensible advice for public authorities and those that have to exercise
this duty, so that they are clear about what they should and should not
do. Drafts of that guidance will be produced and we hope that other
people will be able make
contributions.</div><a name="09060261000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
we get the law right, which I think the Government have in relation to
this clause, we can help to make sure that it works in principle and
helps to resolve some of the difficult issues that public authorities
are currently having to wrestle with. Irrespective of this duty, public
authorities need to try to serve all their customers as best they can.
They have to resolve some of these things. I think that this is a
sensible approach. In my view, it is difficult to see how we can
justify a public sector equality duty that does not cover the key
protected grounds and somehow says, &#147;It is all too difficult;
let&#146;s not bother. Let&#146;s leave two out because then we do
not have to resolve
them.&#148;</div>
<a name="09060261000158"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah
Spencer:</b></i> The balance of my answer would be the same.
The majority of our member organisations attach a lot of importance to
the public duty, including extending it to religion and belief, because
of the importance of ensuring equality for people of different
religions and beliefs. However, there are organisations in the
membership that have a concern that it could be misconstrued, and that
public bodies might misinterpret it to mean promoting equality between
religions or religious groups. In practice, that could mean that
religious groups are given a much greater voice and say in consultation
and have more influence than they should. So the matter of concern is
implementation. As John said, the statutory code of practice and the
issued guidance making it absolutely clear what this is about will be
important. It seems important to us to ensure, as John said, that all
the protected grounds are covered, because there is clearly evidence of
inequality for people in relation to their religion. However, some of
our members are concerned about implementation and
practice.</div><a name="09060261000159"></a>

Mason:</b> I want to make a wider point, too. Ms Spencer, you
are part of an organisation to do with equality and diversity. There is
a lot about equality in the Bill, but is there enough about diversity?
I want a society in which you have a strong Muslim group, a strong this
and a strong that, and in which we are all working together, rather
than ending up with some kind of grey mass. Are you comfortable with
that?</div><a name="09060261000160"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah
Spencer:</b></i> I cannot see anything in the Bill that
interferes with that. This particular provision is intended to ensure
that, where there is evidence of discrimination and inequality
associated with religion or belief, public bodies take that into
account, addressing it in planning their services and employment. It is
not about in any way creating a melting
pot.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
37</b><b class="B"><a name="09060261000414"></a>John
Mason:</b> An example is adoption agencies&#151;would it not
be good to have an adoption agency that just deals with Muslims, or one
that deals with Christians? As long as the local authority dealt with
all of them equally, that would be one interpretation of equality, or
are we saying that every adoption agency must be exactly the
same?</div><a name="09060261000162"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah
Spencer:</b></i> Do not forget that there are three limbs to
the duty. First is non-discrimination, so your model there would
provide for discrimination by all these different groups. The third
limb is about promoting good relations, and your model does not seem to
help there either, so I am not sure that that is what we are going to
end up
with.</div><a name="09060261000163"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Wadham:</b></i> The Equality and Human Rights Commission is
in favour of diversity, not surprisingly. One of the issues for
me&#151;I speak as someone who does not have religious
belief&#151;is that I do not think that religious organisations and
people&#146;s celebration of and freedom to express their religion is
as well protected as it should be. That is despite article 9 of the
European convention on human
rights.</div><a name="09060261000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
is a step forward, because the issue is that although some religions
are more significantly protected and involved&#151;bigger religious
organisations perhaps need less protection&#151;smaller organisations
and smaller groups of religions need to be protected. We need to be
able to celebrate people&#146;s wish to believe in religion. That is
not to say, therefore, that that allows people to discriminate, but it
does mean that as a society we need to take that approach. That is why
the provisions in clause 143 are about taking a step towards that
approach. We can respect and celebrate each and every person&#146;s
religious, non-religious or philosophical approach to life, rather than
saying it is all
grey.</div><a name="09060261000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
I do not think that the next step is to say that, therefore, if people
are providing what are the equivalent of public services they can
discriminate against one group rather than another. There is an issue
about having exceptions in the context of the working of the religion
itself, whether that is about the priests and bishops or about
something else, but that is not the same as the provision of a public
service, which needs to be provided to everyone equally, as far as it
is possible to do
so.</div><a name="09060261000166"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
38</b><a name="09060261000415"></a><b class="B">Lyn
Brown</b> (West Ham) (Lab): Unfortunately, Dr. Evan
Harris was not at our pre-meeting, so he was unaware of the question
that I was going to pursue, but I would like to go back to where he
left off in terms of schools and their captive audience. I would like
to ask you about enforcement around this. Is one of the reasons why
this has been exempted that young children who are being harassed on
grounds of religion, belief, sexual orientation or gender variance
might not find themselves with an able or willing advocate to guide
them through a process that could involve action against an institution
where the teachers and ancillary staff were responsible for, or
complicit in, the harassment that the pupil was experiencing?</div>
<a name="09060261000167"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Wadham:</b></i> I would divide that into two questions. The
first is to try to avoid and eliminate systemic issues that cannot
always be resolved by individuals taking up such cases. That is why
there would be a virtue in extending the law, so that people can devise
their policies to ensure that the example you gave does not happen. I 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column20" />Column number: 20</div>would be surprised if people did not already have policies in place
relating to other legislation to ensure that that happens. Obviously,
the Bill could help with that if that direction were taken.</div>
<a name="09060261000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">Often, it is
the systemic changes that make the most difference most quickly. People
who take up individual cases can often motivate us all to try to make a
difference in relation to more systemic changes. Under the
circumstances that you have described, it would be difficult for an
individual child to take up such a case, but that is not an argument
for saying that they should not have that right. It is not correct to
say that just because people do not take up their rights, those rights
should be abolished or not given in the first
place.</div>
<a name="09060261000169"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
39</b><b class="B"><a name="09060261000416"></a>Lyn
Brown:</b> May I follow that up? I want to mention an
interesting article that I saw, which is one of the reasons I got
interested in this area. It was in <i class="I">The Independent on Sunday</i>
last July, I think. It mentioned that nearly half those children who
are transgendered had attempted to commit suicide before their 18th
birthday. That suggests that perhaps there is something systemically
wrong with the way in which we allow our children to be treated, and
bullied and harassed in our schools.</div>
<a name="09060261000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would like
to know whether there are any other data that the Committee could look
at showing evidence within our schools regarding the types of bullying
that children experience, and the impact and effect of that bullying on
their lives. I go back to the matter of enforcement, as it is often
class actions together&#151;people unifying underneath a trade union
movement, for instance, or an interest group&#151;that can form the
law, or allow it to be framed and understood by the wider general
public and different institutions. Given that these are isolated
children in difficult circumstances, who will take the class action for
them and enable our society to understand the damage that such
harassment and bullying can have on individual children&#146;s
lives?</div><a name="09060261000171"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Wadham:</b></i> I take the point about the issues of data and
will get back to you about that. For children who are going through a
process of working out their identity, that is a pretty tough thing,
irrespective of whether they are being harassed. Very few people will
understand that.</div>
<a name="09060261000172"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060261000417"></a>Lyn
Brown:</b> Indeed.</div>
<a name="09060261000173"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Wadham:</b></i> The first question that is beyond the Bill is
about how we identify and provide people in those circumstances with
support. They will not identify themselves, so how do we provide them
with support? The next question is about how we can construct systems,
policies and procedures to ensure that the school, other people, staff
and so on, support and protect such people from harassment.</div>
<a name="09060261000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the
specific issue about class action, the commission is there to enforce
the provisions&#151;I would say that wouldn&#146;t I? It can take
proceedings in its own name to ensure that the law is respected,
whether or not there are any victims. That is obviously something that
Parliament has given us and, if there were sufficient examples of that
and it was not being dealt with, we would take
proceedings.</div>

you.</div><a name="09060261000176"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah
Spencer:</b></i> May I add that Stonewall is giving evidence
to you and that it was responsible recently for a rather impressive
survey on bullying on the ground of sexual harassment in schools? It
may be necessary to look at the definition of gender reassignment in
the Bill because it does not appear to cover the young people whom you
are talking about. It covers only people whom you are proposing for the
process of having surgery. It is worth discussing
that.</div><a name="09060261000177"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060261000419"></a>The

On behalf of the Committee, I thank you for your very informative
evidence. It was much

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060261000420"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I welcome our witnesses. Thank you very much for
your attendance. The Committee will be putting questions to you over
the next 60 minutes or so. We shall begin with Mr. Mark
Harper.</div><a name="09060261000180"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
40</b><b class="B"><a name="09060261000421"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> I want to probe three areas. I shall try to keep
them focused so that I do not overrun my time. I come first to age
discrimination, particularly in respect of clause 190. It is probably
more directed to Help the Aged and Age Concern, although not
necessarily. It seems that the Government have identified a number of
good aspects of age discrimination, such as some of the business
ventures in which Saga is involved. There are some other positive
things. There are some policy initiatives such as bus passes and TV
licences. What they want to do is to keep all the good things and get
rid of, if you like, bad age discrimination. But it seems that they
have not worked out a way of drafting that, which is why there is no
clause in the Bill to define those things properly.</div>
<a name="09060261000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">What the
Government have come up with is something that I find unsatisfactory,
which is a clause that gives Ministers lots of powers to pass
regulations, seemingly on a case-by-case basis, when somebody comes up
with a good piece of age discrimination that they want to allow. That
does not seem to be a good way of doing it. That is my first point. Who
wants to tackle that
first?</div><a name="09060261000182"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Andrew
Harrop:</b></i> I represent Age Concern and Help the Aged.
First, I should say that we very much welcome the Bill and the
provisions on age discrimination outside the workplace. However, we
share the concern about clause 190 and its proposed sweeping powers.
The approach that has been taken effectively delays the drafting that
we would ideally like to see happen. The Government have said that they
have not made the policy decisions and they need to legislate. Our
response is that the Bill is a long one, with carry-over. There is no
reason why an amendment could not be tabled during its passage to put
that on to the face of the Bill, rather than having such a sweeping
power.</div>
<a name="09060261000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">We know that
there will be a consultation in the summer on age, and there is already
a review being carried out by the Department of Health. It can report
in October, ready for Third Reading, so that you might have some proper
drafting to insert into the Bill. Alternatively, it is important that
draft regulations are made available to parliamentarians so that you
can 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column22" />Column number: 22</div>properly scrutinise what the provision will actually do in practice. At
the moment, you have no indication of what it
means.</div><a name="09060261000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our
general approach on exemptions to age discrimination is much more
relaxed than some observers, because the Bill also includes the power
of objective justification. That means that any service provider can
justify direct age discrimination if they can show it is a
proportionate way of responding to an issue that they face. Clause 190
is belt and braces, and we think that in many respects it would be
overkill to also have case-by-case exemptions, given the general
exemption of objective
justification.</div><a name="09060261000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
some instances, such as concessions, there is such public concern about
whether they will carry on when the Bill comes in that we understand
why the Government wish to be completely clear in legislation rather
than have test cases. But we think that those instances should be
limited.</div><a name="09060261000186"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
41</b><b class="B"><a name="09060261000422"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> Does anyone else have a burning desire to tackle
that? No.</div>
<a name="09060261000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">We talked a
little about public duties in the previous evidence session, and my
second question is about the disability equality duty. What was the
evidence about the effect on the delivery of public services of the
implementation of the disability equality duty? What lessons might the
Committee take from that when we are thinking about how the general
public equality duties might work? Perhaps you might want to take that
up, Ms
Gooding.</div><a name="09060261000188"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Caroline
Gooding:</b></i> First, may I say that RADAR very much
welcomes the opportunity to give evidence on the Bill? RADAR has
collected evidence directly from our members&#151;we have more than
500 groups around the country and we talk with them extensively. We had
a large and successful public meeting this January on the public sector
duty. Disabled people and disability groups are very attached to the
disability equality duty, and feel that it has helped them in their
day-to-day lives&#151;but not always. There is always a problem of
implementation and enforcement&#151;that is probably the biggest
problem. One of the strongest elements of the disability equality duty
is in the specific duty, which the regulations introduce. That is a
strong requirement that disabled people are involved in the way in
which the equality duty is implemented and how public services are run.
That has been tremendously important.</div>
<a name="09060261000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">What has been
extremely important for us is the very clear indication that, in
relation to disability equality, the duty may require different
treatment in order to deliver appropriate services. I formerly worked
for the Disability Rights Commission and I was in charge of
implementing this aspect of the law. When we consulted on our statutory
code, it was amazing. Public authorities came to us and said,
&#147;What are you talking about, &#145;more favourable
treatment&#146;? That is not what the law requires. This is going
above and beyond what is required.&#148; That very clear statement of
what was required, on the face of the Act, made a huge difference. We
are very concerned, as I think some of the previous speakers noted,
that that statement is not adequately reproduced in the present Bill.
In particular, there is not a sufficient emphasis of the
distinctiveness of disability equality and the extent to which that
different treatment is at the heart of disability equality in a way
that it simply is not in relation to other grounds.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column23" />Column number: 23</div><a name="09060261000190"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ruth
Scott:</b></i> I would simply add that within the current
drafting of the public sector duty, it has effectively shifted the
requirement for more favourable treatment to become a discretionary
decision on behalf of the duty holder, and that is the area that really
concerns us. It must be very clear on the face of the Bill that that is
something that public sector authorities &#147;must do&#148; where
it is appropriate to delivering equal outcomes for disabled people, as
opposed to &#147;can choose to
do&#148;.</div>
<a name="09060261000191"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
42</b><b class="B"><a name="09060261000423"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> Do you agree that, in terms of the specific
requirements that are laid down under the duties, the one about
involving people in service delivery has been one of the very important
things, because at the moment we do not have the detail about what
those specific factors will be. Probably one of the things that we will
discuss in Committee is the extent to which Ministers bring full draft
proposals, which we can then consider to see what they are thinking of.
Would you agree with that?</div>
<a name="09060261000192"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ruth
Scott:</b></i> Yes, I would. As Caroline says, the importance
of involvement of disabled people in developing disability equality
schemes and developing the kind of activities that disabled people
think are important and think will make a difference has been a
fundamental aspect of the relative success of the disability equality
duty to date. We would certainly like to see that replicated.</div>

At the moment employers are allowed to ask various questions at the
employment stage, before they get to an offer decision. A number of
people have suggested&#151;I know the Work and Pensions Committee
has&#151;that the law should be changed so that pre-employment
questions and questionnaires are not allowed, in the same way that they
are not allowed in the US. You would still be able to make a decision
at the offer stage if someone then disclosed a disability or a health
condition that actually did impact on their ability to do the job, but
you would not be able to ask about those facts during the employment
process. Can I ask whether you support such a restriction on
pre-employment questionnaires?</div>
<a name="09060261000194"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ruth
Scott:</b></i> We are looking at drafting a proposal for an
amendment that would specify the circumstances in which pre-employment
disability-related questions would be reasonable. Obviously there are
issues in relation to making reasonable adjustments for somebody at an
interview in relation to equal opportunities monitoring and whether
that information is kept confidential. However, we certainly share
concerns that a kind of open-ended ability to ask disability-related
questions pre-employment is of concern and should be restricted to
quite specific arenas, where that is going to be helpful in terms of

met.</div>
<a name="09060261000195"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Caroline
Gooding:</b></i> We think that, in relation to the employment
of disabled people, that is probably the single biggest difference and
improvement that could be made through the Equality Bill. It is not
just a question of whether the employer discriminates. It is whether
merely asking the question or being required to fill in a very
complicated health form actually deters people from applying in the
first place. There is a lot of survey evidence that that is the case.
People with health histories, who expect discrimination, will simply
put the application 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column24" />Column number: 24</div>form in the bin. It was quite striking in the evidence taken by the Work
and Pensions Committee that the CBI and the Employers Forum on
Disability were in favour of this sort of
approach.</div><a name="09060261000196"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">

Featherstone:</b> I am concerned about the compulsory
retirement bit and I wondered whether you could give any examples of a
case where compulsory retirement has led to detriment and
harm.</div>
<a name="09060261000197"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Andrew
Harrop:</b></i> We do not have an accurate estimate of the
number of people being forced to retire, but we believe that it is in
the thousands each year. An example that crossed my desk last week was
that of a woman who was a cleaner for an NHS trust in the north-west.
She had an exemplary work record but was forced to retire several
months ago, and was told that that was only because of her age. She
wrote to me because of the publicity surrounding our test case on this,
which is judicially reviewing the existing age regulations, and said
that her situation was having a massive impact on her
pension.</div>
<a name="09060261000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">Many people
work in their 60s because they have inadequate savings and pensions and
wish to improve their income for the rest of their life. That is why
work for people around the age of 65 can be so important&#151;because
of its long-term impact. We support what you have said, and would like
to see an amendment to schedule 9 that removes the default retirement
age.</div>
<a name="09060261000199"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
45</b><b class="B"><a name="09060261000426"></a>Lynne
Featherstone:</b> I am sure that we will try to help you with
that. I have two or three small points. In terms of children&#146;s
rights, I am trying to find out where the desire of society to protect
children starts and young people&#146;s rights begin. Could there be
examples of that? When we get to Committee stage, I will need to argue
the point with examples.</div>
<a name="09060261000200"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mike
Lindsay:</b></i> I am Mike Lindsay from the Children&#146;s
Rights Alliance for England. I am also here on behalf of the Young
Equals campaign, which seeks to stop age discrimination. It includes a
number of major organisations such as the British Youth Council, the
Children&#146;s Society, the National Children&#146;s Bureau, the
National Youth Agency, Save the Children and so on.</div>
<a name="09060261000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">We want to
see protection for children from age discrimination regarding the
provision of goods, facilities, services and public functions as set
out in clause 26. We believe that there is good evidence and have
provided written evidence to the Committee in our &#147;Making the
Case&#148; report that sets out examples of age discrimination
experienced by children. We recognise that children require reasonable
protection in the provision of goods, facilities and services. We do
not argue that they should be treated the same as adults. Equality laws
are not about treating everybody the same; they are about treating
everyone as having equal worth. That is what our organisation seeks for
children.</div>
<a name="09060261000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are
opposed to discrimination against children and young people on the
grounds of age only in so far as such treatment cannot be objectively
justified. That is the case that we would make in relation to
protection. That issue is obviously receiving a lot of attention and
consideration at the moment, and there is a lot of focus arising from
the Lord Laming report and the baby Peter case. One point we would
make&#151;and one of the reasons why we would encourage the
Government to think 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column25" />Column number: 25</div>again about the issue of age discrimination as it impacts on
children&#151;is that child protection services are
disproportionately provided to children in this country on the grounds
of age, as are a number of other children&#146;s services. That is
not only discriminatory, but is potentially harmful to a number of
children, particularly older children.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
46</b><b class="B"><a name="09060261000427"></a>Lynne
Featherstone:</b> That is helpful and I will certainly take a
closer look at the arguments you make and the evidence you have given.
My last question is to Caroline. Are you satisfied that the Bill fully
addresses the chasm in the disability and equality law created by the
Malcolm ruling?</div>
<a name="09060261000204"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Caroline
Gooding:</b></i> No, we have concerns about that. We are
pleased to see that there is a specific clause in the Bill that
attempts to capture the equivalent of disability-related
discrimination. However, we have two concerns about the way it is
drafted at the moment. One is the introduction of a clear knowledge
requirement, so that the service provider has to know that the person
has a disability before they can potentially be guilty of
discrimination. Taking the case of large organisations, they will often
have that knowledge in one part of them&#151;a local authority will
know in one part that the individual is disabled&#151;but another
emanation may not. That makes it more difficult, in many circumstances,
for individuals to seek protection under the
law.</div><a name="09060261000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
other way in which we are not quite sure, and about which we want to
have more discussions with officials, is how the Bill is drafted at the
moment. Will the provisions work adequately to move away from the
comparator approach that the House of Lords introduced? The decision by
the House of Lords in the Malcolm ruling basically brought the
disability-related discrimination provisions close to those for direct
discrimination, requiring like-by-like comparators. We think there is a
danger that, as it is presently worded, that may be the
consequence&#151;unintended, I am sure&#151;of the present clause.
We would like to explore the wording in more
detail.</div><a name="09060261000206"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060261000428"></a>Lynne
Featherstone:</b> Thank you. It does need probing,
yes.</div><a name="09060261000207"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
47</b><a name="09060261000429"></a><b class="B">Nia
Griffith</b> (Llanelli) (Lab): I would like to start by asking
about views on positive action, how you see the place for that in the
Bill and how it is in your opinion going to improve
matters.</div><a name="09060261000208"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Caroline
Gooding:</b></i> I can start with disability, which is
different from the other strands in that way. At the moment there are
no real restrictions in relation to positive discrimination under the
Disability Discrimination Act 2005. The Act only protects disabled
people from discrimination so, if you are non-disabled, you cannot take
a case under it. A number of large employers have made very good use of
that provision. Centrepoint, for example, a few years ago, advertised
purely for disabled people to come and work at its call centres, and it
had a separate stream of training and support for them to engage in.
So, there is very generous provision for positive discrimination at the
moment. In some circumstances it may be a legal requirement in relation
to reasonable adjustments. We have some concerns that the Bill&#146;s
current drafting does not seem to signal adequately 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column26" />Column number: 26</div>that that very broad approach to positive discrimination in relation to
disability will continue. We do not think that it is clear enough on
that absolutely crucial point. Again, that is an area that we want to
have discussions on and probing about. We are confident that it is not
an intention of the Government to restrict positive discrimination, but
we do not think that how it is worded at the moment captures
that.</div><a name="09060261000209"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
48</b><b class="B"><a name="09060261000430"></a>Nia
Griffith:</b> So what improvement would you suggest? How would
you suggest changing
things?</div><a name="09060261000210"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Caroline
Gooding:</b></i> We think that the Bill should be more
explicit about that and signal more clearly that disability is
different. In relation to direct discrimination, clause 13(3)&#151;I
have to say that it is one of the most difficult-to-understand clauses
I have yet had to read in any equality provisions. We think that it
needs to be a lot
clearer.</div><a name="09060261000211"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ruth
Scott:</b></i> The way in which the positive action clause is
described at the moment includes disability, but the extent of the
positive actions allowed is quite restrictive, because it applies to
all strands. We would like to see that clarified, as to whether
disability belongs in the positive action clause at all. Perhaps it
would be preferable to delete it, to ensure the signal that positive
discrimination across the board around disability is necessary to
preserve the asymmetry of the
legislation.</div><a name="09060261000212"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Andrew
Harrop:</b></i> When it comes to age positive action, we do
not have enough experience of the 2006 regulations in force to say with
any certainty how that is working in the employment
sphere.</div><a name="09060261000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
aspect of the Bill that we welcome is the extension of positive action
beyond the employer relationship. The particular issue that has come up
over the past three years has been further education colleges, which
have had legal advice that they cannot use positive action provisions.
That has meant that they have removed reduced fees for over-65s to
participate in IT classes and things like that, because they felt that
they could not redress educational disadvantage under the age
regulations. The Bill will resolve that
anomaly.</div><a name="09060261000214"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
49</b><a name="09060261000431"></a><b class="B">Mrs.
Sharon Hodgson</b> (Gateshead, East and Washington, West)
(Lab): I want to talk about carers and the provisions in the
Bill about discrimination by association. Do you believe that that will
provide carers with rights to request further provision such as
flexible working? Do you think that that is an area into which the Bill
should be
moving?</div><a name="09060261000215"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Imelda
Redmond:</b></i> I am Imelda Redmond. I am from Carers UK.
Carers UK really welcomes the Equality Bill, particularly its
recognition of carers and discrimination by association. We hear a lot
about carers experiencing discrimination at either pre-employment or in
employment. This would help. I am not sure that it would help a great
deal with extending flexible working because separate legislation deals
with that, but it would raise a lot more awareness among employers that
it is a group within their work force that can be discriminated
against.</div><a name="09060261000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
sorts of cases that we get are of people who feel very sidelined in
organisations and are overlooked for promotion, and who are not
selected and told that it is because of their caring responsibilities
if they had disclosed that at interview. The Bill would help with that,
but not necessarily with increased
flexibility.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column27" />Column number: 27</div><a name="09060261000217"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
50</b><b class="B"><a name="09060261000432"></a>Mrs.
Hodgson:</b> Is there any other aspect in the Bill about
carers that you think we should be looking at
further?</div><a name="09060261000218"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Imelda
Redmond:</b></i> It is quite complicated because of the way
in which the Bill is drafted. It is about the discrimination that
carers experience because of their association with a disabled person,
not about the discrimination they experience in their own right as a
carer. When you are looking at, for example, how to improve the lives
of carers, lots of carers will say that they feel that the health
service will discriminate against them, particularly in terms of
looking after their own health. But because the law comes through the
association with the disabled person, it is only at the point at which
the disabled person is discriminated against that it knocks on to them
and has an impact.</div>
<a name="09060261000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us
consider a carer who looks for more flexibility. A woman whom we know
was having surgery. The hospital would not be flexible about the date
of her surgery and the respite care home would not be flexible about
when her husband went into respite care&#151;and the two did not meet
That is one sort of problem. To be fair, it was not discriminatory. It
was just treating her very badly. The whole issue of discrimination by
association is quite difficult. It is a good step forward, but it is
complex.</div><a name="09060261000220"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
51</b><b class="B"><a name="09060261000433"></a>John
Howell:</b> May I go back to age discrimination in the
workplace? Andrew, when we were last in this position you were quite
forceful, in that there were a huge number of opportunities to increase
employment for people between the ages of 50 and 69. I would like to
get a feel for whether you think that concentrating on removing
barriers between that age is likely to improve outcomes for older
people, rather than concentrating on adjusting or abandoning the
compulsory retirement
age.</div><a name="09060261000221"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Andrew
Harrop:</b></i> They are both important. The default
retirement age is not just an issue for people over the age of 65; it
has a chill effect on the labour market in the years leading up to the
age of 65. People find it harder to move jobs, so employers could get
stuck with someone. They find it harder to get training and new
opportunities within the workplace because employers do not perceive
that as a good investment. It is not necessarily appropriate to
disentangle the default retirement age from the general suite of
policies that the Government need for older workers, particularly those
aged
55-plus.</div><a name="09060261000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clearly,
lots of other things are important, including decent Jobcentre Plus and
skills offers for the over-55s out of work, who are currently facing
significant barriers and massive age discrimination in the recruitment
market, practised by both employers and recruitment agencies. I do not
pretend that a default retirement age is the only answer, but it is a
big part of the jigsaw.</div>
<a name="09060261000223"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
52</b><b class="B"><a name="09060261000434"></a>John
Howell:</b> If the default retirement age proves politically
more sensitive, is it still possible to adjust and account for other
age discrimination in the 50 to 69-year-old bracket that will still
have a positive effect on outcomes for older
people?</div><a name="09060261000224"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Andrew
Harrop:</b></i> It is still hugely welcome that we have age
discrimination legislation in the workplace.  It is only three
years old, and although its impact has been felt, there is a lot more
to do. As I just said, the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column28" />Column number: 28</div>recruitment market is still profoundly ageist. It is as important that
we focus on raising awareness and the implementation of the law that we
have extending into new areas, as the Bill will
do.</div><a name="09060261000225"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
53</b><b class="B"><a name="09060261000435"></a>John
Howell:</b> Thank you. My last question is about the meaning
of disability. We have seen that quite a debate takes place between the
medical and social models, and we have a sort of hybrid in the Bill.
Does it deal adequately with the differences between those and, if you
do not think so, where would you like to see the boundary
shifted?</div><a name="09060261000226"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ruth
Scott:</b></i> We still have concerns. I represent the
Disability Charities Consortium, which is an informal coalition of
seven major disability organisations. We still have concerns that the
&#147;long term&#148; requirement in the definition excludes
significant numbers of disabled people from the protection that
legislation provides. We, and particularly colleagues working with
people with mental health conditions, talked about the issue of
depression during the passage of the DDAs in 1995 and 2005. There was
discussion about how we could overcome the 12-month requirement to
prove that a condition or impairment was long standing. Depression is
one of those conditions that tend to fluctuate, and people find it
difficult to reach the requirement or threshold for proving that they
qualify under the terms of the Bill. Disability Rights Commission
research suggested that one in four disability discrimination cases
failed as a result of people not meeting the definition, so such
consideration is
important.</div><a name="09060261000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the other hand&#151;we would like to see the matter resolved&#151;I
do not think that it is possible to remove the long-standing
requirement because it is reflected in the UN convention on the rights
of persons with disabilities and other existing human rights
legislation. However, clarifying the term &#147;long term&#148; so
that it includes fluctuating conditions would introduce a specific
recognition that that term would cover somebody whose impairment
fluctuated and was not necessarily able to demonstrate that they met
the terms of the Bill for a consecutive 12-month period. That would
open a way of capturing and including that group of people who are
particularly vulnerable to
discrimination.</div><a name="09060261000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
would like to see the definition of &#147;substantial&#148;
included in the Bill. We know that the intention of the definition of
&#147;substantial&#148; is to be defined as more than minor or
trivial, but we have concerns that the way that is interpreted by the
courts can often be considered much more significant than more than
minor or trivial. We would like to see that stated explicitly to ensure
that there are no inconsistencies of interpretation, which could impact
negatively on disabled people&#146;s ability to claim their
rights.</div><a name="09060261000229"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060261000436"></a>John
Howell:</b> Thank you. Does anyone else want to chip
in?</div><a name="09060261000230"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Caroline
Gooding:</b></i> We support both those
points.</div><a name="09060261000231"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060261000437"></a>John
Howell:</b><b class="B"> </b>I thought you
might.</div><a name="09060261000232"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
54</b><b class="B"><a name="09060261000438"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> May I first ask Ruth to say a little more about
the interaction of a positive action taken by anyone, and whether the
disability equality duty is adequately reflected in the new duty?
Dealing with that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column29" />Column number: 29</div>point first, I take it that it would be all right if public authorities
used positive action to achieve an equality of outcome. The inference
of your earlier evidence was that there was some concern that public
authorities might think that they were entitled to opt out of positive
action. Do you read it that nobody is suggesting that you must take
positive action if that may not be the best way, but that you should
take it if it produces the
outcome?</div><a name="09060261000233"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ruth
Scott:</b></i> There are two concerns. The first is that, in
terms of the public sector equality duty, the duty to treat more
favourably is now worded in a way that suggests that it is
discretionary, as opposed to it being something that you should do, if
that is the best way of achieving the outcome that you want. That is
problematic because, essentially, it leaves the decision as to whether
or not that is a justified course of action to the duty holder, as
opposed to making a very clear statement that that is what they should
provide. Secondly, the positive action
clause&#151;clause 152&#151;specifically talks about where positive
action might be permitted. Our concern is that that muddies the water
in relation to the asymmetry of disability discrimination legislation,
which is required to allow us to treat disabled people differently or
more favourably in order to achieve the appropriate outcome. People
might look at clause 152 and think that the way in which they can treat
disabled people is restricted in the same way as it is restricted to
other grounds and characteristics. That will result in people becoming
quite confused and assuming that there are restrictions on the level of
positive discrimination and positive action that they are able to
undertake.</div><a name="09060261000235"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
55</b><b class="B"><a name="09060261000439"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> That is helpful, because you just used the phrase
&#147;in order to achieve the appropriate outcome&#148;. Presumably
some kind of clarificatory amendment along those lines might be the way
of taking the trick. I do not think that anyone doubts the intention
behind the proposal, but we need to ensure that we do not impose
restriction by
accident.</div><a name="09060261000236"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ruth
Scott:</b></i> We support the creation of a more streamlined
and harmonised Bill that is simpler to understand, but our major
concern is that, in harmonising, we should not lose the really
important and unique distinctiveness of disability discrimination
provision. The ability to treat people differently and more favourably
is fundamental to being able to achieve the outcome that disabled
people
need.</div><a name="09060261000237"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
56</b><b class="B"><a name="09060261000440"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> May I turn to a more general issue about
outcomes? Inevitably, and partly because of the long history of this
and the fact that there are two different regimes in relation to gender
discrimination, issues such as equal pay come up quite a lot. Some of
us are equally concerned about disability
discrimination&#151;functional discrimination&#151;regarding both
pay levels and outcomes. We all appreciate that you cannot wish those
away through an Act of Parliament, but is there anything else that we
can do in the Bill to beef up that provision without imposing
unreasonable burdens on employers who would have to make the reasonable
adjustments to do it?</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column30" />Column number: 30</div><a name="09060261000238"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ruth
Scott:</b></i> I have noted that there is an amendment on
extending the duty to report on equal pay for disabled people, which is
something that we are interested in. However, our major
concern&#151;it is disappointing for us that it is a major
concern&#151;is to ensure that there is no regression on the rights
that disabled people currently enjoy under the DDA. The
coalition&#146;s focus is to ensure that those rights are reflected
as clearly and uncontroversially as possible in the new Bill to ensure
that judgments such as Malcolm cannot occur again. However, I agree
that there is a need to look at the issue of unequal pay and unequal
promotion&#151;the glass
ceiling.</div><a name="09060261000239"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
57</b><b class="B"><a name="09060261000441"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> So might that be reporting or other demonstrative
action to show that employers are being
compliant?</div><a name="09060261000240"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ruth
Scott:</b></i>
Yes.</div><a name="09060261000241"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Caroline
Gooding:</b></i> There are elements within the present public
sector duty requirements of reporting in relation to employment that
might, if adequately enforced, give that sort of transparency about the
proportion of disabled people at the higher levels of an organisation
as opposed to at the lower end, for example. We would not want to see
those requirements
lost.</div><a name="09060261000242"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060261000442"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> So there is no question of their being
diluted&#151;at least in the terms of the Bill as drafted&#151;but
they might not be as effective as you would have liked in terms of
achieving an outcome in the public sector, because the position there
seems to be as bad as it is in the private sector.</div>
<a name="09060261000243"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Caroline
Gooding:</b></i> There might be a chance that those
requirements will be diluted because they are in the specific duty
regulations. We are waiting for the consultation on those regulations,
so we will need to have a look at that to see whether there is a danger
that we may go backwards in relation to transparency on the employment
of disabled
people.</div><a name="09060261000244"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ruth
Scott:</b></i> One of the issues in relation to the DDA that
the coalition has been looking at for a number of years is the
possibility of including volunteers within its scope in some way.
Volunteering is obviously a particularly useful route into paid
employment for some disabled
people.</div><a name="09060261000245"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060261000443"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b><b class="B"> </b>Particularly if there is a mental
illness.</div><a name="09060261000246"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ruth
Scott:</b></i> Indeed. We would be interested in considering
any ways in which we could improve opportunities, through
anti-discrimination provision, for disabled people to access
volunteering opportunities that could lead into paid work
opportunities.</div><a name="09060261000247"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Andrew
Harrop:</b></i> May I endorse that? There is a similar issue
regarding volunteering for older people. Both the age lobby and the
disability lobby would really like to see some measures in the Bill
taking account of the widespread evidence of discrimination in
volunteering.</div>
<a name="09060261000248"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
58</b><b class="B"><a name="09060261000444"></a>John
Mason:</b> Going back to young people, would your argument be
that we should just do away with the 18 limit altogether? If we could
push it down to 16, would that be a step in the right
direction?</div><a name="09060261000249"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mike
Lindsay:</b></i> That is not the case that we are arguing. We
argue that children and young people should be included in the
protections that are provided within 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column31" />Column number: 31</div>legislation. We were talking before about positive discrimination.
Perhaps children are the greatest example in this country of positive
discrimination, particularly in relation to going to school. We have to
discriminate in their favour to provide them with such services as free
education. Also, we are not arguing against the use of classifications,
such as in relation to cinema and alcohol and all the other things that
are very specifically not in children&#146;s interests.</div>
<a name="09060261000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">Part of the
reason why we are making the case, and why we would encourage you to
look again at the aspects and implications for children, particularly
around how the public sector equality duty applies to children in
schools and children&#146;s homes, is that there is a strong argument
for saying that it should apply to children in schools. We would like
to encourage children as citizens in their own right, and as aspiring
adult citizens, to have equal regard for each other in terms of worth
and value.</div>
<a name="09060261000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">In relation
to children&#146;s homes, there is something slightly incompatible
between the provisions in the Bill and those only recently set out in
the Children and Young Persons Act 2008. The Government are trying to
encourage greater stability in the placements for children in the care
system and trying to encourage more placements with siblings in care,
but that could be undermined if children&#146;s homes are encouraged
to think that it is okay to make decisions based on age discrimination.
For argument&#146;s sake, it is possible, perversely, for any
children&#146;s home in this country to decide that a 14-year-old is
apparently too old to continue to live in a children&#146;s home,
which means that they have to move on.</div>
<a name="09060261000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">We will
encourage you to look at some of those incompatibilities. There are
incompatibilities with the provisions of the Childcare Act 2006, which
makes a stronger commitment in relation to children in the
determination of these issues. That is broadly the case that we are
trying to make. We do not believe that there is a case for arguing that
a burden is attached to this. The vast majority of schools and
children&#146;s homes in this country already positively encourage
the fostering of good relations. Again, this is most explicitly
demonstrated by children&#146;s homes. Fostering good relations in
children&#146;s homes has been the bedrock on which all guidance
issued by Government on permissible forms of control and good behaviour
management has been based for decades or
generations.</div><a name="09060261000253"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
59</b><b class="B"><a name="09060261000445"></a>John
Mason:</b> I take the point you are making. However, I wonder
if we should not move on the 16 to 18-year-old age group, which most
people would consider to be pretty much an adult age group. Do you feel
it has to be all or
nothing?</div><a name="09060261000254"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mike
Lindsay:</b></i> There are good examples in relation to 16 to
18-year-olds. Are they children or adults in relation to child
protection legislation, their entitlement to receive services under
mental health provision and their entitlement to independent
accommodation, particularly if they are care leavers or without goods
and provisions? There a number of young people in this country who,
because of age alone, fall between too many gaps in services that they
should be entitled to. Our argument is that most of those services
should not be dependent on age-related guidelines that are often
arbitrarily
contrived.</div><a name="09060261000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have a perverse situation that for a children&#146;s home to be
registered in this country, it has to agree the conditions under which
it will be registered. That includes 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column32" />Column number: 32</div>age, which could be limited to between 10 and 14. By definition, that
would split up siblings and force children and young people to leave
those facilities for no better reason than
age.</div><a name="09060261000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our
argument is that children&#146;s needs should be judged, based and
assessed purely on merit. Generally, whether they need mental health
services, children&#146;s social care services and a number of other
services should be based on an assessment of their needs. The merits of
children&#146;s needs should not be based on the rather crude
criterion of
age.</div><a name="09060261000257"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
60</b><b class="B"><a name="09060261000446"></a>John
Mason:</b> Thank you. My other point is more on disability.
The word &#147;reasonable&#148; is used a lot. Clause 19 speaks of
making &#147;reasonable adjustments&#148;. I wonder if that word is
too weak in practice. Do you think that it is the ideal word or the
best we can come up with? A lot of organisations have been at the
slower end of reasonable. It is a vague word in my
mind.</div><a name="09060261000258"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Caroline
Gooding:</b></i> I have looked at a lot of evidence relating
to a large number of cases that have been brought under the Disability
Discrimination Act and to people who have not brought cases because
they have managed to resolve things amicably. The word
&#147;reasonable&#148; is not usually the stumbling block. As Ruth
said in relation to employment, the stumbling block has been the
fixation on the &#147;Are you disabled or not?&#148; issue, rather
than whether it is reasonable. The guidance that has been put out over
the years and good sense in many cases have been adequate to deal with
reasonableness.</div><a name="09060261000259"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
other stumbling block which means that the law is not implemented,
particularly in terms of goods and services, is enforcement. There is a
very weak and difficult enforcement regime. The Employers Forum on
Disability gave evidence to the Work and Pensions Committee. There is a
risk that the part of the Disability Discrimination Act relating to
services will be discredited because there simply is no real sanction
at the
moment.</div><a name="09060261000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is no risk of a service provider being taken to court, apart from in
very unusual cases in which the Equality and Human Rights Commission
gets involved. It has been involved in some cases, which is very
welcome, but it is simply not possible for it to support all the people
who need to be supported. The barriers to justice in that regard are
too great at the moment. That is much more of a stumbling block than
the word &#147;reasonable&#148;, which has worked relatively
well.</div><a name="09060261000261"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ruth
Scott:</b></i> I absolutely concur with Caroline on the
difficulty of enforcing access to goods, facilities and services. The
word &#147;reasonable&#148; seems to provide the necessary
flexibility and understandability. People can judge what is reasonable
and what is
not.</div><a name="09060261000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are concerned that under the current drafting, clause 19 on the duty to
make adjustments has changed the emphasis from removing barriers to
avoiding barriers. We are concerned that that represents regression in
relation to the level of protection that we have with the Disability
Discrimination Act, so that duty holders can now almost work their way
around a physical or service barrier, as opposed to first and foremost
being required to remove that barrier, and then taking some alternative
steps if that is not reasonable. We would like to see that issue
addressed and the strength of the DDA duty to remove barriers
reinstated.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
61</b><b class="B"><a name="09060261000447"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> I want to probe the issue of positive
action and positive discrimination that Ruth and Caroline have both
mentioned and Tim has already explored a bit. One plank of what you are
concerned about is that positive action, being new, might look like a
weaker version of positive discrimination to the casual observer who
has not yet had the benefit of the commission&#146;s guidance. But as
I understand it, that is not your main point and I would not think it a
good idea to remove disabled people from the positive action provisions
because I can imagine that they could be
useful.</div>
<a name="09060261000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">Is your real
point that that adds an extra complexity to the lack of clarity that
you perceive in the Bill about the availability of positive
discrimination, as we know it, in the old Act? If that is your
point&#151;that it is less to do with the problem of the new positive
action provisions, and more to do with that might just complicate what
you think is not clear enough already&#151;how do you think that it
could be clarified so that everybody is satisfied that positive
discrimination is just as available as it always was? As you rightly
perceive, that is the intention.</div>
<a name="09060261000265"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ruth
Scott:</b></i> Our concern is in relation to the wording of
clause 13. That is where we feel that the clarity around the asymmetric
provision for disabled people is not expressed clearly enough. As
Caroline said, that clause is quite confusing and we would like to see
it reshaped to make it much more explicit, so that there is a
difference of approach in relation to disabled people and that that is
backed up in clause 14, which is specific to disability.</div>
<a name="09060261000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our concern
with clause 152 is almost that positive action is unnecessary in
relation to disability&#151;if there is clarification and positive
discrimination is permitted in relation to disability in any context
where that is appropriate. Further, given the lack of clarity in
clauses 13 and 14 at the moment, clause 152 may lead to
people interpreting the restrictive way in which positive action is
allowed to apply to disability. That will therefore lead to people
making judgments as to what it is that they can and cannot do in
relation to positive action, whereas the asymmetric nature of
protection for disabled people ought to allow them to do anything that
is justified in terms of achieving the appropriate outcome for that
individual.</div>
<a name="09060261000267"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Caroline
Gooding:</b></i> Just to back you up, the danger is that
authorities, employers and service providers may look at clause 152 and
think that that same positive action regime and restrictions, which
will remain in relation to the other strands, applies across all of the
strands
equally&#151;</div><a name="09060261000268"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
62</b><b class="B"><a name="09060261000448"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> As it does, it is just that there has
got to be an additional, or separate, provision for positive
discrimination. Are you saying that we are not declaring that second
limb, or are you saying that your preference would be to withdraw the
disability strand from the positive action provisions, which looks like
not a good thing to do? Would you not still want some additional
clarity in the
definitions?</div><a name="09060261000269"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Caroline
Gooding:</b></i> We are broadly in favour of withdrawing from
clause 152 because we think that it suggests that the same restrictions
on positive action apply across the strands. The clarity that you would
need in relation to positive action on disability is purely 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column34" />Column number: 34</div>in relation to allowing certain groups of disabled people to be
advantaged over other groups of disabled people, where that is
appropriate. There is no requirement to have an explicit clause that
allows disabled people to be more favourably treated than non-disabled
people, because that is the way in which the whole Act is
crafted&#151;it is asymmetrical. It is misleading to have a separate
clause alongside the other strands that says that it is okay to treat
disabled people more favourably, and it will send the wrong message to
people.</div><a name="09060261000270"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
63</b><b class="B"><a name="09060261000449"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> The positive action provisions will
apply in very specific situations, will they not? Then you have the
wider position that we are all used to under the DDA.</div>
<a name="09060261000271"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Caroline
Gooding:</b></i> Exactly. If you have the position where
there is wide scope for positive discrimination, why do you need the
narrow clause that says that it is okay positively to discriminate in
specific situations? That is confusing.</div>
<a name="09060261000272"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ruth
Scott:</b></i> The most important point is that we need
clarity in clauses 13 and 14 so that the asymmetric nature of the
disability protection is unchanged from the DDA&#151;that is the main
point. Caroline made a good point about positive action, but it might
be important to clarify where it is appropriate to take positive action
in relation to one group of disabled people rather than another. For
example, if one group is particularly under-represented, you might
choose to appoint somebody with a mental health condition over somebody
with a physical impairment. But Caroline&#146;s point about general
positive action is that this is so restrictive that it sends the
message, &#147;Is this restricted or isn&#146;t it?&#148; in
relation to disabled people. That is what we are concerned
about&#151;that there will be confusion in
interpretation.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060261000450"></a>The

I should point out that we conclude our proceedings at 1

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
64</b><b class="B"><a name="09060261000451"></a>John
Penrose:</b> So reminded, I want to go back briefly to carers.
I was taken by the comment about something that was not necessarily
discriminatory, but which was jolly bad treatment of carers&#151;I
think that the example was health inequalities and problems with
respite care. Obviously, this is not a discrimination Bill&#151;it is
an equalities Bill&#151;but is there anything else that you would
like to see? Are we missing a
trick?</div><a name="09060261000275"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Imelda
Redmond:</b></i> The Bill as it stands does not cover
indirect discrimination against carers, and we would like it to. Carers
can find it difficult to look after their own health where public
services do not provide them with equal access because of their caring
responsibilities. Health is the primary issue, but services may also
not be provided appropriately for people with disabilities so that the
carer can get on with their own life. An example that came to us quite
recently was of a young person with severe disabilities who had been
refused the surgery that they needed&#151;there is a whole disability
discrimination issue there. As her health deteriorated, her mother
ended up giving up work, and no consideration was given to the impact
that that would have on her and her family. We see a lot of carers,
particularly in the health  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column35" />Column number: 35</div>service, who are unable to protect their own health, and that has a
knock-on effect on the person they are looking
after.</div>
<a name="09060261000276"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
65</b><b class="B"><a name="09060261000452"></a>John
Penrose:</b> So broadening discrimination by association

want to go?</div>
<a name="09060261000277"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Imelda
Redmond:</b></i> Yes, we think that would
help.</div><a name="09060261000278"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mike
Lindsay:</b></i> May I make a quick point in relation to that
question, and that is to recognise that a significant number of carers
in this country are actually children themselves? It is not clear
whether enough recognition is given to whether their needs are being
met. We know of a number of cases where that has been brought to the
attention of local authority services. They have assessed 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column36" />Column number: 36</div>the needs of the adult parent, but not necessarily the needs of the
child specifically as a child in need. There are examples where
children&#146;s needs should be incorporated and taken fully into
account in these provisions.</div>
