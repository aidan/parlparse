<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">191</b><b class="B"><a name="10012880000403"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I welcome our witnesses to this sitting of the
Crime and Security Public Bill Committee. You will be getting questions
from practically all the members of the Committee during your time with
us. Sadly, we have to complete this part of our sitting at 2.30 prompt.
Will our three witnesses please introduce themselves to members of the
Committee?</div><a name="10012880000009"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Edmund
King:</b></i> My name is Edmund King, and I am president of
the Automobile Association. I have been involved with monitoring
clamping on private land for far too long&#151;well over 10 years. I
have made various documentaries on the issue, and representations to
Governments of all shapes over the years, so it is an issue in which I
have an immense interest.</div>
<a name="10012880000010"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012880000404"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Before I turn to Councillor Shona Johnstone, I
have to say that Edmund King has anticipated what I was going to say
next about briefly indicating an overview. You started by indicating
the length of time you have been involved with the issue. Before I ask
Councillor Shona Johnstone to introduce herself, will you complete the
AA&#146;s overview of the Bill in 60
seconds?</div><a name="10012880000011"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Edmund
King:</b></i> Our overview is that something desperately
needs to be done about wheel-clamping on private land. We get far too
many cases of pensioners and individuals being fined &#163;400,
&#163;500 or &#163;600 for straying on to a bit of private land
that might not have been well signed. The punishment does not fit the
crime. In this Bill, licensing of companies itself will not, on its
own, make a difference. There are two crucial points. For the Bill to
be effective, the code of conduct, whereby you set levels of fines and
a means of operation, is absolutely crucial. Licensing itself is not.
Secondly, there really must be an independent appeals process as there
is with on-street parking, which works very effectively. If our members
get a ticket on the street, they can apply to the local authority. If
they are not satisfied with the response, they go to a parking
tribunal, and that works extremely well. For this legislation to work,
you need both those things in
place.</div><a name="10012880000012"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Shona
Johnstone:</b></i> I am Councillor Shona Johnstone, and I am
a county councillor in Cambridgeshire. I was the lead member for
environment and transport for some eight years, and introduced
decriminalised parking in Cambridge city. I sit on the Local Government
Association&#146;s regeneration and transport board, and have done
since its inception.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column96" />Column number: 96</div><a name="10012880000013"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Patrick
Troy:</b></i> Good afternoon. I am Patrick Troy, chief
executive of the British Parking Association, which has established
what one might describe as some self-regulation in this field, because
we are very anxious to see regulation through Government in the area.
We have what we call an approved operator scheme, of which
the&#151;dare I say it&#151;good guys are members, but we are
concerned that the industry is beset with a poor media image, and that
a number of clamping companies, and companies that deal with ticketing
on private land, are not up to the same standard as members of the
scheme, so we are keen to see
movement.</div><a name="10012880000014"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012880000405"></a>The
Chairman:</b> The questioning will be started by Tony
Baldry.</div><a name="10012880000015"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">192</b><b class="B"><a name="10012880000406"></a>Tony
Baldry:</b> My questions will be mainly for Professor King. I
must declare an interest. I, and I suspect like other members of the
Committee, am a member of the AA.</div>
<a name="10012880000016"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clearly,
there is a public mischief that needs to be dealt with, otherwise we
would not be here, so I think that we can take that for granted. I
understand that whereas at present individuals are licensed, all the
Bill does is license
businesses.</div><a name="10012880000017"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
report issued last year
said:</div><a name="10012880000375"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Home Office wants to set a maximum penalty charge&#151;likely to be
&#163;135&#151;to stop cowboy clampers fleecing the
public.</div><a name="10012880000376"></a><div class="hs_brev">Clamping
firms will also have to prove vehicles had breached parking
restrictions and will be forced to make warning signs more obvious and
visible.&#148;</div><a name="10012880000018"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
Home Office press notice
stated:</div><a name="10012880000377"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Proposals
within the bill will make it mandatory for all wheel clamping
businesses to be licensed under the terms of a strict code of conduct.
The code will include a cap on fines, time limits on towing cars
unreasonably quickly after being clamped...Ministers are also
looking to introduce an independent appeals process for motorists who
feel unfairly penalised by firms and their
employees.&#148;</div><a name="10012880000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">None
of that is in Bill. I was wondering, Professor King, whether the
AA&#146;s lawyers could be kind and draft and send to us what the AA
feels should be in the Bill. I am sure we shall get undertakings from
Ministers, because they are decent guys, about the code of conduct and
so forth, but the Security Industry Authority is not a subject for the
Minister. Could you share with us, as soon as possible, what you
believe should be in the Bill, simply to deliver what
Ministers&#151;if one believes their press, which I am sure one
does&#151;want to
achieve?</div><a name="10012880000020"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Edmund
King:</b></i> I think that is vital, because without it this
is just an enabling Bill that will not necessarily change anything. It
will not work. If it is just about licensing a company, we licensed
individual clampers in 2005 and, frankly, it was a licence to print
money. Once they had a licence they could do what they wanted and if
the police were called, they said they had a
licence.</div><a name="10012880000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have another concern about just licensing the business. From our
investigations of clamping companies over the years we have found that
once they are investigated by the media or organisations such as ours,
they often change the name of the company and their post office box
number, but tracking back, the same people&#151;the same
individuals&#151;are involved. We are concerned that even if the
company were licensed, once it breached the licence the people involved
would just fly by night, set up a new company and start operating
again. That has certainly been the practice in the past. We need
something to stop that happening.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">193</b><b class="B"><a name="10012880000407"></a>Tony
Baldry:</b> I return to my original point. The AA has big
resources. Could your lawyers and your legal team give some thought to
what you feel should be put in the
Bill?</div><a name="10012880000023"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Edmund
King:</b></i> We can certainly give some thought to the areas
that we would like covered. Regarding how it would fit with the Bill, I
am afraid that even at the AA we do not quite have the legal expertise
to do that, but we could outline the elements we feel should be
covered, such as a maximum fine, for example, and the way that people
can pay. Currently, people are forced to pay cash. Clampers in
Doncaster wanted to take a three-year-old girl hostage until her mother
went and got cash. There are all sorts of things that we would like to
see in the Bill. Whether they are practical I do not know, but I would
be willing to put those areas to the
Committee.</div><a name="10012880000024"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012880000408"></a>Tony
Baldry:</b> If you come up with the areas, we will do our best
to draft suitable amendments at least to test in Committee the extent
to which we can include in the Bill the things Ministers are purporting
to try to
achieve.</div><a name="10012880000025"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012880000409"></a>The
Chairman:</b> May I say, Mr. King, that if you
supply information it must be available to all Committee members? If
you sent it to the Clerk of the Committee, that would be appropriate.
Copies will then be provided for every member of the Committee,
including the
Chairman.</div><a name="10012880000026"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">194</b><a name="10012880000410"></a><b class="B">Tom
Brake</b> (Carshalton and Wallington) (LD): Mr.
King, have you just said&#151;albeit couched in diplomatic
terms&#151;that the measures will not work and will be bureaucratic
and a fudge? Should we not do it properly and look instead at only
allowing local authorities, or people they have subcontracted, to carry
out the work? I am interested in Councillor Johnstone&#146;s response
to that, and Mr. Troy&#146;s, because I am sure that his
association would not support that proposal, although he has a local
authority background and may view it more sympathetically from that
point of
view.</div><a name="10012880000027"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Edmund
King:</b></i> We put other proposals to the Home Office that
we felt would be more effective, but they were turned down. One was
that you license the land rather than the companies. That is something
that local authorities could have potentially carried out; they license
other things, such as licensed premises, pubs and so on. There would
then have been some control. If you license the land and there are
abuses, you can withdraw the licence from that piece of land. We
believe that would have been more effective. We are where we are with
the Bill, and we would certainly like to see action that takes effect.
In our view, no, the Bill is not perfect, but it is better than
nothing. If we can build into the Bill safeguards on things such as a
code of conduct and independent appeals, I think it could
work.</div><a name="10012880000028"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Shona
Johnstone:</b></i> The main issue for me and the local
government world, if we were to operate the sort of licensing system
that you are suggesting, would be how it might be resourced and the
priorities we would give to resourcing it as against resourcing public
land, particularly highway land. Perhaps there is an alternative way.
Very few local authorities use immobilisation, because for most of them
the issue is keeping traffic moving, and if you immobilise a vehicle,
it completely defeats the object. But there is a code of conduct on
parking policy enforcement that we abide by, and using that on private
land might be an alternative way forward.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column98" />Column number: 98</div><a name="10012880000029"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Patrick
Troy:</b></i> I agree with the general sentiment. I have a
local authority background; indeed, half the British Parking
Association&#146;s members are local authorities, so there is a lot
of synergy between what goes on in the local authority sector and what
goes on in the private sector. However, my main concern is that the
Bill does not address the whole issue, which is parking on private
land. Clamping is one means of controlling parking on private land.
There are a number of others, the main one being ticketing, which is a
growing area, where private companies issue tickets to vehicles parked
unlawfully. We need to tackle the problem of parking on private land
and how it is regulated. Clamping is just one element. That is what I
would like to see the focus upon, as well as the issue of an
independent appeals system. You are absolutely right to draw attention
to that, because the independent appeals system needs to apply equally
to someone who is clamped, someone who has been ticketed or someone who
has been
removed.</div><a name="10012880000030"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">195</b><b class="B"><a name="10012880000411"></a>Tom
Brake:</b> Are you saying in effect that if this goes ahead,
all that will happen is that people who were clamping before will
switch to ticketing, so the problem will remain as big as
ever?</div><a name="10012880000031"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Patrick
Troy:</b></i> I think there is a real danger of that and that
we are distorting the market. The BPA is an accredited trade
association, by which I mean that we are accredited by the Driver and
Vehicle Licensing Agency in respect of the ticketing side. That means
that our members must comply with our code of practice to gain access
to the DVLA, or keep a record in order for them to conduct their
business. At the moment, there is no regulation of clamping companies,
so they sit outside that area. As a result, some ticketing companies
start to think about clamping because they will be unregulated. My
concern is that if you simply start regulating  clamping and
forget about the ticketing side, you will see a movement back and
forth. The whole needs  to be
addressed.</div><a name="10012880000032"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">196</b><a name="10012880000412"></a><b class="B">James
Brokenshire</b> (Hornchurch) (Con): I want to take a slightly
different line of questioning on enforcement. For the licensing regime
as contemplated by the Bill to work, it would have to be enforced in
some way. The presumption is that it would be through the SIA, but
there is also a clear overlap with the work of trading standards. How
would the panel envisage the current proposals being practically
enforced? Would they actually be enforced as
anticipated?</div><a name="10012880000033"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Edmund
King:</b></i> That is a very important question. Currently,
there is no enforcement at all. Some trading standards officers take an
interest and some do not; the situation is, therefore, quite haphazard.
Under the Bill, as I see it, if a company did not have a licence, it
would be a criminal offence for it to clamp. Therefore, an individual
motorist could ask to see the licence and if the company did not have
it, the individual could call the police. Apart from that, I do not
think that enforcement is inherent in the
proposals.</div><a name="10012880000034"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Shona
Johnstone:</b></i> Issues around enforcement might replicate
the position of local authorities with the independent appeals process.
That would be the line that local government would, ideally, like to
see taken.</div>
<a name="10012880000035"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Patrick
Troy:</b></i> The enforcement side is absolutely critical. We
recognise that with our scheme we are moving forward significantly, as
we speak, to include additional compliance auditing of our members, to
ensure that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column99" />Column number: 99</div>they comply with our code, and to ensure that we have in place what we
are calling a series of sanctions&#151;operators that do not come up
to scratch and breach our code would have sanctions against them, which
could result ultimately in expulsion. The solution is to base the model
on the DVLA-accredited trade association status, where the SIA engages
an accredited trade association, with a code of practice, which can
demonstrate that that association is properly ensuring that each
operator is compliant and that it is taking action when operators do
not comply. That seems to be one way of enforcing the scheme without
expecting the SIA to step in on every
detail.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">197</b><b class="B"><a name="10012880000413"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> It seems to me that there are a number of
different issues: whether an individual officer who seeks to clamp or
enforce a ticket is licensed, whether they are acting for a firm that
is licensed and whether the land that they are seeking to enforce a
ticket on is private land, because it may not be and, therefore, the
local authority will need to become involved to assess whether it is
private or public land&#151;there is potential for disputes. It is
not simply the licensing, but whether an officer is abiding by or in
material breach of the code itself. Should they then be party to it? It
seems that there are various associated facets, which would need a
joined-up approach among the SIA, local council trading standards, and,
potentially, the police as
well.</div><a name="10012880000037"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Patrick
Troy:</b></i> It is very important that when an operator
applies for a licence, they are doing so on land on which they are
authorised to act. What I mean by that is that, at the end of the day,
this is about landowners&#146; rights. The landowner will normally
employ an operator. Obviously, the landowner can control the land
themselves&#151;the pub landlord is a classic example. Generally, we
are talking about private companies setting themselves up as operators,
engaged by the landowner, hopefully through a competitive process, to
carry out parking enforcement or whatever on their land. There has to
be a link between the two. We require our members to identify the
landowner&#151;their client&#151;as part of that process.</div>
<a name="10012880000038"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Edmund
King:</b></i> There are problems though. We have exposed
cases of clampers clamping on land where they do not have permission to
clamp. That is the criminal offence of obtaining money by deception,
and clampers in Slough have been jailed as a result. However, it is
incredibly difficult for the individual motorist to find out, after
they have been clamped late at night and charged &#163;500, who owns
the land and who has authorised the clampers. In another case, a
clamping firm clamped 100 cars parked in a disused office block in
Bristol. It clamped the whole lot of them, but it did not have
permission to clamp there. There are
problems.</div><a name="10012880000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
problem we have seen so far, even with the ATA, is that even members of
the ATA have not always followed their own code of practice. We have a
number of cases in which the company has belonged to the ATA, but it
has clamped and then towed away immediately to charge more money, which
goes against the voluntary code of practice. That makes my point that a
voluntary code of practice is nonsense; it will not work at all. It has
to be a mandatory code and it needs an independent appeals process to
police it. In terms of paying for that, with on-street parking, the
independent parking tribunal is paid for from a proportion of the
ticket paid on the street. I suggest that if a company wants a licence
to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column100" />Column number: 100</div>clamp on private land, a proportion of the money for the licence should
go to an independent tribunal to make it self-funding, because there is
no way that the state should pay. It should come from the
clampers&#146;
resources.</div><a name="10012880000040"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">198</b><b class="B"><a name="10012880000414"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I should be interested to hear from
Councillor Johnstone on that. It seems as though local authorities
might get drawn into the whole enforcement process, even though it
would seem to be the SIA that would take the lead, simply because local
motorists do not know who else to make a complaint to. Generally, these
sorts of things end up on the doorstep of the local council.</div>

Johnstone:</b></i> You are absolutely correct. Local
authorities often do get the flak, because there is not an
understanding by the public about who controls the activities of some
private companies. If there was a system of local authority licensing,
it would be something that we would be prepared to consider and to take
on if required to do so. Again, it comes back to resource&#151;how
the system would be funded and financed. I would go back to the point
Mr. King made about its being resourced through the
companies themselves, not through the taxpayer and the general revenue
system.</div>
<a name="10012880000042"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">199</b><a name="10012880000415"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Douglas Hogg</b> (Sleaford and North Hykeham) (Con): Is there
any merit in requiring those who have a licence to register their names
and addresses with the local authority&#151;maybe it already
happens&#151;so that a motorist who has been clamped in the way we
have been describing can ascertain the identity of the company
involved?</div><a name="10012880000043"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Edmund
King:</b></i> Under the current system, where the individual
clamper is licensed, the motorist can check with the SIA whether that
individual has a licence. Having said that, it is normally pretty
difficult, because they normally clamp late at night and you do not see
the clamper. Even if you are sitting in your own car with  the
engine running, they clamp you and run off. It is quite difficult to
ascertain who exactly did clamp you and whether they have a
licence.</div>
<a name="10012880000044"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">200</b><b class="B"><a name="10012880000416"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> Would it, therefore, be a good idea to require the
occupier to display, on the premises where clampers operate, the name,
address and contact numbers of the clamper, and if that is not done, to
make that omission an
offence?</div><a name="10012880000045"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Edmund
King:</b></i> I certainly feel that that would be helpful,
because quite often there is a lack of information about what to do at
midnight when your car has disappeared. The first thing that most
people do is call the police to see if the car has been stolen, because
quite often there is not that information on a sign that the car has
been clamped and towed away. So, yes, I believe that the more
information there is in the car park, the more useful it will be to the
consumer.</div>
<a name="10012880000046"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012880000417"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Thank you. I am spreading the questions. I know
that Tom Brake and Tony Baldry want to come back in again, but Andrew
Rosindell has also caught my eye.
Andrew.</div><a name="10012880000047"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">201</b><a name="10012880000418"></a><b class="B">Andrew
Rosindell</b> (Romford) (Con): Thank you, Sir Nicholas. I
think that probably all of us here understand why this is an issue
about which people get extremely angry. We all get letters from
constituents who have been clamped and charged huge sums of money to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column101" />Column number: 101</div>unclamp their vehicle when they have simply parked for a few moments,
unwittingly, not knowing that the land that they are parking on is
subject to clamping. Clearly, all three of our witnesses today have
said that we need to go further, and that the Bill, as it stands, does
not go far enough in making sure that it is
effective.</div>
<a name="10012880000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">My question
is at the nub of the whole thing. Who is going to administer, regulate
and control this? Should it be local authorities? Obviously, at the
moment local authorities do not have a direct remit but, as
Mr. Brokenshire has made clear, local authorities get the
blame or the headaches, even though it is not necessarily down to them
to deal with it. If there is to be an authority that regulates and
manages this and deals with appeals, should it be local authorities or
some other body, bearing in mind that local authorities work to
boundaries? Companies and clampers will go beyond a boundary, and
boundaries can sometimes be very peculiar. What would be the solution
to
that?</div><a name="10012880000049"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Shona
Johnstone:</b></i> I am not sure that giving the
responsibilities to local authorities is necessarily what is required.
From a local government perspective, the system of controls and
independent appeals that we have to abide by, could be applied to the
private industry. That is the difference: not necessarily that local
government should take over responsibility for licensing, but that the
code of conduct that we have should be applied to the private
industry.</div><a name="10012880000050"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">202</b><b class="B"><a name="10012880000419"></a>Andrew
Rosindell:</b> So you would set up another body to deal with
that?</div><a name="10012880000051"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Shona
Johnstone:</b></i> If that were within the SIA&#146;s
remit. I do not think that just giving it to local authorities
necessarily solves the
problem.</div><a name="10012880000052"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">203</b><b class="B"><a name="10012880000420"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Edmund King, do you have a view, although you
are not directly local
government?</div><a name="10012880000053"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Edmund
King:</b></i> The beauty of the local authority doing it is
that it knows what land is in its local authority. Therefore, if it
oversaw a system, with the traffic penalty tribunal&#151;which deals
with on-street parking&#151;and if the system were linked to the land
and the clamper had to pay the local authority enough money to get the
licence to administer the scheme, it could be effective.</div>
<a name="10012880000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have to
understand the opportunist nature of clamping. We have to put this into
context. The clampers make most of their money, not in car parks, but
on a twilight piece of land behind the estate agent&#146;s, next to
the cinema, where it is unclear whether you can park or not. If there
were really a parking problem there, they would put up a fence. If they
had to go to the local authority to get a licence to clamp on that
twilight piece of land and it cost them &#163;5,000 or
&#163;10,000, they would not do it, because parking there is not a
big enough problem to pay &#163;10,000.</div>
<a name="10012880000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">We felt that
if there were a stricter licensing system based on the land, linked to
the local authorities, it would drive out the two-bit cowboys, because
it would not be to their benefit to do it because they would not make
any money. That would get rid of them overnight. If they clamped
without having the local authority licence, there could be a criminal
prosecution and the police could take
action.</div><a name="10012880000056"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">204</b><b class="B"><a name="10012880000421"></a>The
Chairman:</b> What does the trade association of the clampers
think?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column102" />Column number: 102</div><a name="10012880000057"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Patrick
Troy:</b></i> Mr. Rosindell puts his finger on the
issue. The local authorities have boundaries and the companies do not,
and that immediately creates a problem. We have given considerable
thought to the solution, and the local authority one is clearly a
solution. Our concern is that it has to apply across all local
authorities, which means that it has to be mandatory; it has to be a
duty on local authorities, not a power. Otherwise, clamping companies
will simply move between local authorities in order to transact their
nefarious business. There is a case for a national solution and that is
probably best supplied through the SIA, issuing licences to companies
but ensuring that there are some teeth to that solution. That is why I
think that the only sensible way forward would be to use some kind of
national structure, and the SIA comes close to fitting the
bill.</div><a name="10012880000058"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">205</b><b class="B"><a name="10012880000422"></a>Tony
Baldry:</b> I was concerned by Mr. Troy&#146;s
suggestion that in this part of the Bill we were simply displacing
clamping to private firms&#146; ticketing. It would be helpful if we
could remind ourselves where we are. This is a trespass. It is a civil
tort. It is not a criminal offence. Professor King in his opening
comments talked about the punishment not fitting the crime. There is no
constitutional right for a private citizen to punish another private
citizen. We are where we are because of the case of someone who parked
in Exeter: the divisional court said that if you park where a
sufficiently clear notice is placed, you are inviting someone to clamp
you. But that case gave no authority for fines. It gave no authority to
impose a ticket. Otherwise you have to go to the small claims court or
prove damage. What possible authority, Mr. Troy, do your
members have to impose tickets on individuals? If you are to go around
imposing tickets on individuals, clearly the Bill needs to deal with
that as well, does it
not?</div><a name="10012880000059"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Patrick
Troy:</b></i> Absolutely. It should deal with both issues in
order to control both issues. This is an entirely unregulated sector.
What the private companies do on private land is unregulated both from
their perspective and from the public&#146;s perspective. Therefore,
there needs to be some form of regulation. Through the DVLA route some
legitimacy has been given to ticketers because only those ticketers
that are members of an accredited trade association can access keeper
details. That gives the ticketing fraternity some legitimacy. But the
Bill needs to address both these areas if it is to control parking
properly.</div><a name="10012880000060"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">206</b><b class="B"><a name="10012880000423"></a>Tony
Baldry:</b> But if I park on your land and you send me a
ticket in the post, which I tear up and then throw away, your only
redress is to issue proceedings against me in the small claims court
where you have to prove that I caused damage by parking where I parked
and you have to prove the measure of that damage. That is right, is it
not?</div><a name="10012880000061"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Patrick
Troy:</b></i> That is absolutely right and it goes deeper
than that. Our concern is that, currently in an unregulated
environment, the person who committed that act&#151;the
driver&#151;is liable and the operator does not know who the driver
is. So they will obtain keeper details from DVLA and will write to the
keeper saying, &#147;The driver has committed a contravention here.
Who is the driver, please?&#148; The keeper can say, &#147;I
don&#146;t know who the driver was&#148; and not admit that they
were the driver or that they know who the driver was. The difficulty is
that eventually operators will say that if 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column103" />Column number: 103</div>they cannot recover their outstanding due, they will have to
switch to some other form of enforcement, which is clamping. That is
what I was saying earlier about distorting the two sectors. There needs
to be regulation for the whole sector and not just one element of
it.</div>
<a name="10012880000062"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012880000424"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I shall take Tom Brake, but then I shall come to
Shona McIsaac and I apologise for my delay in calling
her.</div><a name="10012880000063"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">207</b><b class="B"><a name="10012880000425"></a>Tom
Brake:</b> Mr. Troy, you are clearly an enthusiast
for the SIA to be issuing the licences. What evidence do you have that
it has the capacity to deal with this effectively? Do our other
witnesses have any evidence to underline the fact that the SIA might
not have the resources to do this and might not be able to
cope?</div><a name="10012880000064"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Patrick
Troy:</b></i> I would not say that I am an enthusiast for the
SIA, but from a selection of options, it probably fits best. I cannot
comment on whether it has the resources. Clearly the resources would
need to be put in place but it does have the capacity to issue licences
for this type of work at the moment in that it issues licences to
individual clampers. So it is an expansion of that existing activity
which does not seem to me to be a huge issue in that the people it is
already dealing through issuing clamping licences, are the very people
it will issue licences to under this proposal.</div>
<a name="10012880000065"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Shona
Johnstone:</b></i> I apologise if I sound like a cracked
record, but if local authorities were to take over this responsibility,
we would do it, but it would have to be a properly and fully funded
scheme. As local authorities, we frequently take over additional
responsibilities and they are not funded and we have to squeeze
resources more and more. I do not believe that we would be popular with
our electorate for taking over this responsibility if it was not
properly
funded.</div><a name="10012880000066"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">208</b><a name="10012880000426"></a><b class="B">Shona
McIsaac</b> (Cleethorpes) (Lab): My questions will mainly be
directed at Mr. Troy. First, I want to ask about your
association members. Can you give me some idea of how many complaints
are made against your members, how you go about investigating them and
what sort of penalties you have for
misbehaviour?</div><a name="10012880000067"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Patrick
Troy:</b></i> Complaints are always in two forms. There are
the complaints about the fact that a ticket has been issued or a clamp
has been applied, and mitigation has been put forward by the recipient
of that action. That is where we think that the independent appeal
service can assist. When a motorist draws to our attention what would
be described as a breach in our code&#151;someone who has flagrantly
charged more than our code entitles them to, or has not put up
sufficient signs in a car park&#151;we will then take action against
that member in a variety of ways. As we sit here now, we have
terminated two members&#146; membership as a result of information
sent to us by
motorists.</div><a name="10012880000068"></a>

company gives rise to the vast majority of complaints from my
constituents. One has come in in the past couple of days. These notices
look very formal. The charge is &#163;100. You were talking earlier
about what is a reasonable amount; frankly, my constituents do not
think that that is reasonable. They describe these people as cowboys.
They resent these companies, which they see as cowboys, using
intimidatory tactics to get hold of their personal
details.</div><a name="10012880000083"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Patrick
Troy:</b></i> Two things that consumers most when they use
car parks, whether local authority car parks or private. One is the
size of the penalty charge and the other is the lack of signage. We
tackled those two issues head on in our code of practice. You will find
that the charge is more or less similar to that in the local authority
sector. We try to base it, as far as possible, on
that.</div><a name="10012880000084"></a>

that, because you will always have private car parks and you will
always have local authority car parks. In developing our code of
practice, when dealing with the level of charge, we tried to reflect
what goes on in the wider regulated world, and I think we have done
that. That is not to say that no more can be done&#151;more can
certainly be done. I have said several times that our scheme is not

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">221</b><b class="B"><a name="10012880000441"></a>Shona
McIsaac:</b> Is it part of your code&#151;this relates
across the board to clamping and anything we introduce in the
future&#151;for companies to put on parking charge notices or
anything else what people can do to seek redress? Why is it not part of
your code to say, &#147;If you have a complaint about this charge,
please contact us&#148;? There is
nothing.</div><a name="10012880000099"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Patrick
Troy:</b></i> There certainly should be, and I would be
interested to see that. There is a requirement in the code for the
operator to have in place a dispute resolutions process, whereby the
recipient of the ticket is able to discuss the issue with the operator.
As I said earlier, I do not think that that is sufficient; I think that
there needs to be an independent appeals service to deal with that,
because clearly the operator has a vested interest in the outcome. If
that information is not on there, please let me know and I will
investigate.</div>
<a name="10012880000100"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012880000442"></a>Shona
McIsaac:</b> It certainly is not on here. UK Parking Control
Ltd is one of the biggest private parking companies in the country, I
believe, and as I said, one of its biggest customers is
McDonald&#146;s, so if it is issuing these notices, it is doing so
the length and breadth of the country and is therefore breaking your
code of
conduct.</div><a name="10012880000101"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Patrick
Troy:</b></i> Please let me have that
notice.</div><a name="10012880000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">You
mentioned fast food outlets. The other point that I was going to make
is that landowners have a role to play in this too. Landowners often
require the operator to carry out certain activities, even though the
operator might advise against doing so. From a commercial perspective,
I would not have thought that there was any value in a company hugely
penalising its customers, so the company must think that it is
penalising people who are not its customers. We clearly need some
proportionality. In trying to find a resolution to this problem, we
need to understand that it is not only the operators who are involved,
but the landowners who employ them.</div>
<a name="10012880000103"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012880000443"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Shona, would you like a response from Councillor
Johnstone? I ask only because Mr. Troy has mentioned certain
regulations and standards, and I wonder whether Edmund King and the
Councillor Johnstone have any evidence that would either substantiate
or in fact contradict what Mr. Troy has said in answer to
your question.</div>
<a name="10012880000104"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012880000444"></a>Shona
McIsaac:</b> That is absolutely fine, Sir Nicholas.</div>
<a name="10012880000105"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Edmund
King:</b></i> We have a lot of evidence that big car parking
companies do not abide by the code. I have here a receipt from Parking
Control Management. The other issue relating to charging is
double-charging, and in this case, there is a wheel clamp release fee
of &#163;130. Despite the fact that the individual in the case was
going to the library to pay the 15p fine on her library books and was
only away for 20 minutes, she was also charged a &#163;200
removal fee straight away and then a &#163;40 storage fee. So the
total charge was &#163;370. That was automatic double-charging.
Again, there is nothing whatsoever on this receipt that says anything
about an appeal or anything else.</div>
<a name="10012880000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is a
major problem. Many of the companies can just make up the charges. We
know of companies that, if you call the police, will impose a
&#147;call police nuisance&#148; charge, which can be anything from
&#163;50 to &#163;150. Another 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column107" />Column number: 107</div>company will have a &#147;swear box&#148; charge that they add on to
a charge. That shows that the charges are absolute
nonsense&#151;people just make them up. We have certainly had
complaints about members of the accredited association not abiding by
the code of conduct. That makes the point that any code must be
absolutely mandatory and it must be
enforced.</div>
<a name="10012880000107"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10012880000445"></a><b class="B">Dr.
Brian Iddon</b> (Bolton, South-East) (Lab): I am getting the
impression that wheel-clamping should be banned completely and that we
should move entirely to a ticketing programme. If someone&#146;s
vehicle is causing an obstruction, the police will remove the vehicle,
whether it is a private vehicle or a company vehicle. The police would
have the power to remove a vehicle under the law as it stands
now.</div>
<a name="10012880000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not see
any point in allowing clamping to take place. What is the opinion of
our three witnesses? I ask, because the advantage of moving to a
ticketing system is that, in order to get the information from the
DVLA, you have to be a pukka company and not a cowboy company. If you
laid down a code of conduct, you could police that code of
conduct.</div>
<a name="10012880000109"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Edmund
King:</b></i> If the problem is illegal parking, to
immobilise a vehicle to ensure that it is parked illegally for a long
period of time is absolute nonsense. The courts in Scotland in 1991
actually found clamping on private land to be extortion and theft. In
our view, many cases in England and Wales are extortion and
theft.</div>
<a name="10012880000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">When
wheel-clamping was outlawed in Scotland, landowners employed other
means to protect their land, which they have a right to
do&#151;motorists should not park wherever they want, whenever they
want; we are absolutely clear about that&#151;but there has not been
a massive outcry in Scotland since 1991 when clamping was outlawed.
People put up fences or tackle the problem in other ways. I would
suggest that in a civilised society, immobilising a pensioner&#146;s
car and towing it away after 20 minutes is outrageous. The best thing
would be if clamping could be
outlawed.</div><a name="10012880000111"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">222</b><b class="B"><a name="10012880000446"></a>The
Chairman:</b> But you did not answer, Mr. Troy, nor
other witnesses, Shona McIsaac&#146;s sensible question: what about
somebody who parks on land after dark, can see no sign, no indication
that it is illegal to park
there&#151;</div><a name="10012880000112"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012880000447"></a>Shona
McIsaac:</b> Such as a motorway service
station.</div><a name="10012880000113"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012880000448"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Is there no responsibility on those who either
own the land or will be clamping or ticketing on the land to put up
signs that are visible both day and night, to ensure that people are
aware of the problems they might encounter if they park
there?</div><a name="10012880000114"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Edmund
King:</b></i> That is a valid point, but in some of these
cases we have evidence that it is not in the interest of the landowner
to have clear signs. Many of them have deals with the clampers whereby
they are paid  &#163;50 a clamp. If there are clear signs,
motorists will not park there and the landowner will not get their
money. In many cases it is not in their interests. We also have
evidence of other cases where, if there are signs, the clamper will
park their vehicle in front of the signs to hide them, otherwise people
would not park there.</div>
<a name="10012880000115"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Shona
Johnstone:</b></i> That is the nub of the problem. On highway
land, for on-street parking, the signage is very clear. There is a
clear and independent appeals procedure. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column108" />Column number: 108</div>People know before they park&#151;they can see the signs. If the signs
are not there, any parking charge is invalid; if the signs are there it
is very clear. They know what the rights of appeal are and there is an
independent procedure. Where there are no signs, they do not know what
the position is. The public are very unclear in that situation. Is it
highway land? Is it not highway land? Is it private land? What is it?
If they do not know they get confused. Inadequate signage is one of the
biggest
problems.</div><a name="10012880000116"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">223</b><b class="B"><a name="10012880000449"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> I want to pose three questions. First, following on
what Brian Iddon said, can any of you identify any good reason why this
form of clamping should not be outlawed?</div>
<a name="10012880000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
assuming that we are going to go on with off-street clamping of the
kind we have been talking about, would it not be a good idea to make it
an offence for the occupier not to display in a visible way the name,
address and phone number of the clamper, so that if he does do it late
at night he is quite likely to be disturbed?</div>
<a name="10012880000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">Thirdly, the
point that you are all making is about the high level of charges. One
thing that occurs to me is that we are talking about the legal concept
of licence. If we are going ahead with wheel-clamping, there is nothing
to stop us providing a right for a person to go to the magistrates
court to require the repayment of any sum in excess of what the court
deems to be reasonable. That would be wonderful because there would not
be very much by way of legal charges if it was done in the magistrates
court. Could I have your views on those three
suggestions?</div><a name="10012880000119"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Edmund
King:</b></i> On the first point, I made the case that
clamping is
illogical.</div><a name="10012880000120"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">224</b><b class="B"><a name="10012880000450"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> Could we ask the other two witnesses and then move
on to the other two questions and see what the collective view
is?</div><a name="10012880000121"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Shona
Johnstone:</b></i> From a local government perspective, given
that this is about private land as opposed to the public highway, the
LGA does not have a view either way on greater regulation as opposed to
making clamping illegal. The vast majority of local authorities do not
use immobilisation or clamping in any form, except perhaps as the last
resort. Their view on parking enforcement is that they want to keep the
traffic moving, and to clamp simply defeats that
objective.</div><a name="10012880000122"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">225</b><b class="B"><a name="10012880000451"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Could you belatedly answer Shona
McIsaac&#146;s question about the level of fines that local
government impose and how they compare with the charges imposed by
clampers and
ticketers?</div><a name="10012880000123"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Shona
Johnstone:</b></i> It varies from authority to authority.
Speaking from recent personal experience, in Cambridge the charge is
&#163;50, discounted to &#163;25, so that gives you an idea.
Clearly, the position in large urban areas is rather different to rural
areas, so the level of fines will vary.</div>
<a name="10012880000124"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Patrick
Troy:</b></i> Superficially, it is very attractive to ban
clamping. Coming from a local authority background and hearing what
Shona had to say, I think that clamping is disappearing on the public
highway, but there are two reasons why I suspect clamping will
remain&#151;</div><a name="10012880000125"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012880000452"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> Unless outlawed.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column109" />Column number: 109</div><a name="10012880000126"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Patrick
Troy:</b></i> Unless outlawed&#151;on private land. One
reason for that is the driver liability issue to which I referred
earlier. If the only solution to control parking is issuing a ticket,
and there is no legislation to deal with who is liable for that ticket,
there will be no way of properly enforcing on private land. That is a
dilemma for landowners who want, quite rightly, to protect their land.
The best example of that is your own front drive. You would want
someone to do something about someone parking on your front drive, and
if there is a loophole in the law, which is there is at the moment in
respect of liability, then people will start to look at clamping as the
alternative.</div>
<a name="10012880000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">The other
reason is the problem of persistent offending, if ticketing is the
solution. If you ticket someone who is, for whatever reason, not
properly registered at DVLA, it is impossible to recover an outstanding
debt and they will of course continue to park unlawfully. Clamping is
the only solution there. Actually, that is currently in operational
guidance from the Department for Transport for local authorities, but
that is really the only circumstance where clamping should be
used.</div><a name="10012880000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is true that in Scotland clamping has been outlawed. You may ask
yourselves whether, if it is outlawed in Scotland, it should be
outlawed in England and Wales. I do not have any research to back this
up, but anecdotally what some landowners with private operators do
is&#151;because they do not want to ticket for the reasons I have
just explained&#151;remove the vehicle from the car park, store it
off-site and charge significantly more to release that vehicle back to
the individual. That is, perhaps, a much more disproportionate response
to a small parking contravention than clamping might be. So, it is not
necessarily the case that it has worked in Scotland, but,
unfortunately, there has been no research into that. It would be
interesting to do.</div>
<a name="10012880000129"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">226</b><b class="B"><a name="10012880000453"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> There were two other questions about display of
name, address and telephone number, and whether we should have some
redress in the magistrates court to recover charges deemed to be
unreasonable.</div>
<a name="10012880000130"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Edmund
King:</b></i> On the second point regarding the signs, I
think that that is a very helpful proposal, but I wonder whether the
onus would be on the landowner, or the licensed
clamper.</div><a name="10012880000131"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">227</b><b class="B"><a name="10012880000454"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> I thought it would be on the occupier, because the
occupier who does not ensure that the name and address is displayed
would be committing an offence under the existing offence provisions,
which are provided for in the Bill.</div>
<a name="10012880000132"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Edmund
King:</b></i> I think that is a helpful suggestion. In terms
of the courts you have to be careful, because the cases that we have
had involved a lot of pressure and stress on the individuals going
through the courts. Yes, we have won cases, but it has taken time. We
have also had people
stop&#151;</div><a name="10012880000133"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">228</b><b class="B"><a name="10012880000455"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> But you would, if you got results in the magistrates
court, begin to establish a tariff, which would constitute a precedent.
You can see the advantage of that. You, as a motorists&#146;
organisation, could fund a number of those cases and thus&#151;think
of the credit you will get&#151;you will be building up a
tariff.</div>
<a name="10012880000134"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Edmund
King:</b></i> I can see that point, because small claims
courts do not set a legal precedent and we have had a number of
successes there. The problem often is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column110" />Column number: 110</div>with ticketing, not clamping. We had a case recently where someone was
trying to appeal, but eventually gave up because she was worried about
bailiffs being called in and her and her husband&#146;s credit
rating. She gave up the case and paid under duress. Our view is that
individuals in this society should not have to go that far. There
should be an easier, independent tribunal, as there is with on-street
parking, so that individuals are not put under that level of
duress.</div><a name="10012880000135"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Shona
Johnstone:</b></i> With regard to Mr.
Hogg&#146;s second question on signage, at the moment is there is not
equity across the piece. There is one set of regulations and code of
conduct for local authorities, where signage is very clear, and another
for private land, such that it is often unclear whether or not it is
private land. From a local government perspective, we would argue for a
level playing field. In relation to the high level of charges, local
government would always argue that the charge should be proportionate
to the
offence.</div><a name="10012880000136"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">229</b><b class="B"><a name="10012880000456"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> That needs a tribunal to determine.</div>
<a name="10012880000137"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Shona
Johnstone:</b></i>
Yes.</div><a name="10012880000138"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Patrick
Troy:</b></i> I agree with that approach. Our code currently
requires the operator to put in place signs indicating his or her name
and address and contact details. We go further than that and say it
should not be a premium telephone line or a mobile number; it should be
a landline, so that the individual can make easy contact with the
clamper. It would make a lot more sense for the landowner to be
required to do that. Operators would not have to do it, so I am sure
they would support such a measure. That seems to be sensible.</div>
<a name="10012880000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">I agree about
the level of the charge; it has to be proportionate and reflect local
conditions, and it should reflect what is going on in the wider
community. It comes back to what the consumer regards as fair. If
consumers see a particular penalty charge in a local authority car
park, they will not understand why in the car park next door the charge
is significantly higher or&#151;less likely&#151;lower.</div>
<a name="10012880000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">There needs
to be some uniformity for the public to understand, but not to mimic
that situation. That comes back to Ms McIsaac&#146;s point, that you
cannot have a situation where private operators mimic local authority
legislation in issuing &#147;penalty charge&#148; notices, that
appear to the consumer to be from someone in public authority. There is
a balance to be struck between those two
things.</div><a name="10012880000141"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">230</b><b class="B"><a name="10012880000457"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I want to come back to the provisions in the
Bill that, pursuant to a firm being licensed, it may be prescribed that
it is part of a &#147;nominated body or scheme&#148;. I understand
from that, for example, that the BPA could be a nominated body or
scheme, with your code of practice being prescribed as per the terms of
the licence. What would be the situation if a complaint comes in,
either to the SIA or to you, that a firm has not complied with the
terms? Should you or the SIA determine what the sanction for that
breach should be? What notification requirements do you envisage, so
that if somebody notifies you of a complaint, you refer that on to the
SIA?</div><a name="10012880000142"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Patrick
Troy:</b></i> It should be a two-tier solution. Let us call
it an accredited trade association, which the BPA is at present. Others
may well arise, which we would welcome, as there needs to be some
competition in this 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column111" />Column number: 111</div>area. The association must have a complaints and sanctions process and
must deal with the operator from a credibility perspective, if nothing
else, and end the operator&#146;s membership, if it is not compliant
with the code. But there needs to be an appeals process, a second tier
of referral to the SIA, if the association is not carrying out that
function sufficiently. The SIA does have a little bit of a regulatory
role over the association in that situation, to ensure that it is
carrying out a robust complaints and sanctions process to make sure,
first, that the consumer is benefiting from that activity and,
secondly, if there are other associations, it is applying more or less
the same rules as the others to each situation. You cannot have a
situation in which one association is more lax than another in terms of
applying sanctions against  an
operator.</div>
<a name="10012880000143"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">231</b><b class="B"><a name="10012880000458"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> So you see the SIA effectively policing you,
as the association, as well as the potential licensee, to ensure that
you are doing your job properly, so, ultimately, the SIA could take
away your accreditation in those circumstances?</div>
<a name="10012880000144"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Patrick
Troy:</b></i> Absolutely, and that is exactly what happens
with the DVLA, which monitors our performance as its ATA. Ultimately,
if it is not happy about the work that we are doing on its behalf, it
can sever that link. I hope that it would not and would put in place
some improvement processes, but it is same
model.</div>
<a name="10012880000145"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">232</b><b class="B"><a name="10012880000459"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> Two points come from that. First, the point
that Mr. King raised about a company or organisation
re-registering as a separate body even though the membership, the
directors and those controlling that entity may be substantially the
same. Do you have a &#147;fit and proper person&#148; test within
your code, or do you see that as falling more heavily on the licensing
process
itself?</div><a name="10012880000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
does your code have any provisions that control the means by which one
of your members can solicit private land to control? I ask that because
I have heard of improper practice where pressure is put on landowners
through threat or menace&#151;&#147;You will allow us to control
your land for parking purposes, won&#146;t you?&#148; Is your code
wide enough to cover such situations? It would be interesting to hear
from the other panellists on whether they have experience of such
practice being used.</div>
<a name="10012880000147"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Patrick
Troy:</b></i> Yes, in answer to the first question, we do
have a &#147;fit and proper&#148; process, in the sense that we
have records of individuals who manage companies who are responsible
for carrying out, on a personal as well as on a company level, the
requirements of the code. What I mean by that is that if they decide to
leave the scheme or they are expelled from the scheme and reinvent
themselves in another company, we know the individuals associated with
the previous company and so can take action. That is not entirely
closing the loophole and I am very conscious of that, but at least we
have something in place that enables that to occur.</div>
<a name="10012880000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the second
point, I am not so familiar with circumstances where landowners have
had an arm twisted behind their back to allow operators to carry out
enforcement on their land. I am aware of operators approaching
landowners to say, &#147;Let us manage your land for you and
we&#146;ll give you &#163;50 for every clamp that we apply.&#148;
That is unacceptable and something we are trying to stamp out of the
industry at the moment. I 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column112" />Column number: 112</div>have to be honest, that is not in our code but we want to put it in the
next version of the code. As you self-regulate, you discover another
way round that problem and we need to take
action.</div>
<a name="10012880000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
there is a problem with what we call third-party enforcement, where a
company will act on behalf of one of our members. We say in our code
that that third party has to be fit for purpose. It must carry out
enforcement in compliance with our code. We have said to the member,
&#147;If they don&#146;t, you&#146;ll be responsible and we will
treat that as a breach of the code by you, not by that third
party.&#148; We are starting to see some of these issues and
loopholes emerge and we are starting to  close
them.</div><a name="10012880000150"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012880000460"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I should be interested in hearing from the

many loopholes, whether with the ATA and how it is policed or with the
SIA. I think it is fair to say that the SIA to date, since the Private
Security Industry Act 2001, has done the minimum and has not shown any
real enthusiasm or resource to get involved in appeals. It is only if
the member is licensed. Without a change to the structure of the SIA
and a boosting of its remit, I think it would be infeasible to see it
acting in that
way.</div><a name="10012880000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">On

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">236</b><a name="10012880000471"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Robert Flello</b> (Stoke-on-Trent, South) (Lab): My first
observation is that although I am sure that local authorities do a very
good job in the main, there are exceptions. Indeed, not many months ago
there was a huge outcry in Stoke-on-Trent when the local authority sign
in one of the city centre car parks led everybody to believe that there
was free parking after 6 pm, until they all came back to find tickets
on their windscreens. There is some work to be done to ensure that
local authority signage is up to an acceptable standard. I would be
interested in any comments you may wish to make about
that.</div><a name="10012880000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
main substantive question relates to the way we are looking at the
whole issue. Are schemes of registration, land registration and so on
not a far too complex way of resolving the problem? Ultimately, it is
about landowners looking for the cheapest way&#151;or a
revenue-making way&#151;of solving their parking problems. Should we
not put it back to the landowners? We should say, &#147;If there is a
private piece of land that you don&#146;t want people to park on,
fence it. If you are a local business and you only want people who use
your business to park on your land, put a barrier up so they will need
a ticket or a code to exit. If it is a commercial private car park,
take a barrier-type approach with a clear display of charges when you
approach the barrier.&#148; Are we not looking at things from the
wrong point of view? Would it not be better to put the onus on the
landowner to take whatever action is appropriate to resolve the
problem, even though it might cost them some money, rather than the
poor
motorist?</div><a name="10012880000175"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Edmund
King:</b></i> I concur with those conclusions. Having looked
at the problem for over 10 years, having seen legislation come in and
having seen numerous consultations on it, I can say that many of the
proposals would improve things in one aspect and then transfer the
problem elsewhere. We have heard that from clamping it 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column114" />Column number: 114</div>goes to towing or to ticketing. Unfortunately, no matter what
legislation we bring in, it still appears that there would be
loopholes. My view is that we should look to what happened in Scotland
and try to change the law in that
way.</div><a name="10012880000176"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Shona
Johnstone:</b></i> With regard to the second part, that would
certainly be one option. On your first issue, yes, I am sure we can all
find examples where local authorities have not always got it
right.</div><a name="10012880000177"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Patrick
Troy:</b></i> May I echo that point? The point I tried to get
across earlier was that no one is perfect in the parking management
world. I have been involved in it for the past 25 years. There will
always be circumstances where a silly decision is made. That is why the
independent appeals service is so important to try to close down those
issues. As I understood your question, it was why can&#146;t we just
do away with all this and put barrier systems in place? The problem
with that is that it is horses for courses. The best example was given
to me early on in my current post. We manage motorway service areas.
They are managed by private operators. You simply could not have a
barrier system. You have to allow the free flow of traffic into
motorway service areas. At the other extreme is the pub landlord with a
small car park with only five or six spaces but which is close to a big
retail outlet or a station. It is not practical for that landlord to
put in a barrier system. There has to be some other solution in certain
circumstances. I would accept that those circumstances are perhaps not
always right at the
moment.</div><a name="10012880000178"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">237</b><b class="B"><a name="10012880000472"></a>Mr.
Flello:</b> Perhaps there would be a greater burden of cost on
the pub landlord with only five or six parking spaces, but nevertheless
it would be doable. In the first example, given that most motorway
service stations have a long slip road that you can either turn off to
park or carry on down to fill up with fuel and then rejoin the
motorway, I am not sure that the proposal is that impracticable for a
motorway service area. I take the point that there are areas where you
could look at it, but surely it is much simpler to say to the owner of
the land, &#147;You resolve the problem, but you can&#146;t clamp,
you can&#146;t ticket. If you don&#146;t want any parking there,
fence it off. If you are not bothered about it, fine, let people park
there.&#148;</div><a name="10012880000179"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012880000473"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Is there any final comment that our witnesses
would like to make in approximately 20 seconds each, as we have less
than two minutes until half-past
2?</div><a name="10012880000180"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Edmund
King:</b></i> First, if this goes ahead we must have an
independent appeals process. Secondly, we must have a mandatory code
that has maximum fines and conditions. Thirdly, it should also apply to
ticketing and not just to clamping. Otherwise it will just transfer the
problem.</div><a name="10012880000181"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Shona
Johnstone:</b></i> The local government perspective is that
we would want to see a level playing field between the public and
private sectors. If there was to be a local authority system of
licensing and regulation, it would have to be properly
funded.</div><a name="10012880000182"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012880000474"></a>The

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012880000475"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Having come initially from local government
myself, I have much sympathy, if I am allowed to express that view from
the Chair.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column115" />Column number: 115</div><a name="10012880000185"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Patrick
Troy:</b></i> I have two simple points. Any legislation
should apply to the whole of the private parking sector, regardless of
how it is enforced. The other point, which it sounds as if we are very
much agreed on, is that having an independent appeals service is
fundamental to the fairness and public perception of the
service.</div><a name="10012880000186"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012880000476"></a>The
Chairman:</b> On behalf of the Committee I thank our three
witnesses for the very full, informative and most helpful evidence they

and those who represent local government and the motorist. Thank you
for coming to give evidence to us
today.</div><a name="10012880000383"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.31

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012880000477"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I welcome both Ministers. It is pleasure to have
you responding to questions from other members of the Committee. I do
not think we will be interrupted by Divisions in the House and we can
continue until 4 o&#146;clock. If we need to go on a
fraction longer, I am prepared to use my discretion, but I do not
believe that will be necessary. As we will be covering a wide range of
subjects with the Ministers, it would be good to deal with the subjects
in the order that they appear in the very helpful briefing paper that
has been prepared for our use. The first subject is stop-and-search
powers.</div>
<a name="10012880000188"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">238</b><b class="B"><a name="10012880000478"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I will keep my comments brief. I appreciate
that we have a lot of ground to get through. I obviously welcome the
desire to reduce the elements of bureaucracy associated with
stop-and-search and we will get into the debate about that in due
course. What was the thinking behind deleting the provisions relating
to the recording of a person&#146;s name? Obviously there may be a
risk that someone may be stopped and searched regularly, so how could
one assess whether someone was being picked on if information was not
recorded in that way? I would be interested to hear the thought
processes behind
that.</div><a name="10012880000189"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">The
Minister for Policing, Crime and Counter-Terrorism (Mr.
David Hanson):</b></i> May I say, Sir Nicholas, what a
pleasure it is to be before the Committee for the first time in what
will undoubtedly be a fruitful few weeks. Mr. Brokenshire
makes an important point. At the moment there is no requirement for an
individual to give their name to the police when stopped or searched.
If an individual was stopped in Parliament square today they would not
have to give their name to the police. We have decided to remove that
piece of information from the bureaucracy. The police can ask for the
name and can record it if they so wish. But that gives rise to the
important point that Mr. Brokenshire raised. An individual
could be in Ealing at 10 o&#146;clock, in Parliament square at 12 and
in Barking at 3. They could be stopped three times across London and
wish to make a complaint against the police. Because we have kept in
the legislation the need for the identified officer who is carrying out
the search to record the date, the time and the place, if a complaint
is made by an individual, we would be able to establish, through that
electronically garnered information, which officer undertook the
stop-and-search at which time and at which place. If something illegal
was found as a result of the stop-and-search, the officer would make
some sort of charge. There is a defence for those who wish to make
complaints. There is also a requirement for the officer to ask for that
information if he or she feels that it is relevant to the
investigation.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column116" />Column number: 116</div><a name="10012880000190"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">239</b><b class="B"><a name="10012880000479"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> In other words, you are saying that if a
complaint is made, there is a way to track the individual back to the
relevant police officer. You think that it would be done on that basis
rather than recording the information if it had been
volunteered.</div><a name="10012880000191"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Hanson:</b></i> Let me put it into a very simple context. If
David Hanson was stopped in Parliament square at 2.30 on a Thursday
afternoon and felt aggrieved and made a complaint to the Metropolitan
police, there are very few chances that there would be more than one
officer stopping and searching in Parliament square at 2.29 pm on a
Thursday afternoon. That could be traced through the electronic
collection of data. Certainly now in some cases, and, I hope, by the
time the legislation is enacted, we will be able to record
automatically officer identity, date, time and place when the
information is sent back to headquarters by electronic handsets or
through the Airwave system. I think the safeguard is there for the
complainant. If the police officer wishes to ask for their name, the
individual does not have to give it, so we have taken that step out.
Ultimately, if a serious offence is committed, that would move to
stage 2 of the stop-and-search
process.</div><a name="10012880000192"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">240</b><b class="B"><a name="10012880000480"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> The language in the Bill has sought to modify
the reference to a record being made. Is that intended to cover
electronic recording of information or other means of recording the
stop, rather than old-fashioned writing in a log
book?</div><a name="10012880000193"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Hanson:</b></i> Absolutely. Under the current legislation, we
require 12 items of information to be collected. The Bill proposes that
we reduce that to seven. Of those seven, four will soon be able to be
assessed by direct electronic means. I would love officers to be able
to do all that electronically and as speedily as possible, and we will
continue to work on it. That is the long-term objective. We can now
have identity, time, place and date all recorded electronically.
Ethnicity, object of search and grounds for search are being recorded
manually at the moment, but in due course I want them to be recorded
and directly transmitted without the need for
replication.</div><a name="10012880000194"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">241</b><b class="B"><a name="10012880000481"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> Can the Minister give an indication of any
guidance that the Home Office has given to the police in relation to
stops and searches as a policy issue? As he will be aware, there has
been a policy shift, if I may describe it that way, by the Metropolitan
police&#151;certainly in relation to the way in which they use the
power in section 44 of the Terrorism Act 2000. Has the Home Office
undertaken any assessment of that use, and has it indicated to other
police forces the appropriateness or otherwise of the utilisation of
stops and
searches?</div><a name="10012880000195"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Hanson:</b></i> There are very strict criteria for the use of
section 44 under the legislation. Senior officers&#151;assistant
chief constable or above&#151;have to sign off the section
44 application. Every application lands on my desk and within 24 hours
I have to agree it. I can, in theory, overturn it, so there is scrutiny
by me. We look at that very carefully and through officials we
regularly discuss with police forces their use of section 44, the
widespread nature of it and the number of stops. With every
section 44 application, I get information on how it has
previously been used and the geographical area of the application being
proposed. I can, in theory, not sign it and it would not
apply.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column117" />Column number: 117</div><a name="10012880000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">As you will
know, Mr. Brokenshire, the measure is also open to external
scrutiny by Lord Carlisle. He makes regular reports, which have
impacted upon the police&#146;s use of section 44. There is an
organic flow of information and discussion. Guidance is probably the
wrong word, but there is certainly heavy discussion about the usage. As
you will know, in London that usage has been restricted considerably
over the past 12 months because of the flow of information
from my office and from Lord Carlisle&#146;s
office.</div><a name="10012880000197"></a>

Brokenshire:</b> In other words, you would say that the
decision to reduce the number of stops and searches conducted under
section 44 has been a consequence of the dialogue between the various
bodies and the Metropolitan Police
Commissioner.</div><a name="10012880000198"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Hanson:</b></i> I always take the operational judgment of
police officers because they have to make operational decisions on the
use of stop and search. That is their judgment. We have said clearly to
them that that needs to be justified to Ministers, to external scrutiny
through Lord Carlile and to the general public, who must have and
retain confidence in the use of those powers. That has seen a shift
over
time.</div><a name="10012880000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">You
will also be aware, Sir Nicholas and Mr. Brokenshire, that
there is a legal challenge in Europe, against which we are seeking to
appeal. There is fluid discussion on the use of the power, but,
operationally, if an officer says to the Minister, &#147;This is the
area where I wish to have stop-and-search powers available,&#148; I
would have to give serious thought to overruling that judgment in my
ultimate sanction of
signature.</div><a name="10012880000200"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">243</b><b class="B"><a name="10012880000483"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> The Minister has rightly pointed out that
there is a judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in relation
to section 44. Can he give us an update on the Government&#146;s
position on that? I note that he says that the intention is to appeal.
What time scale is he working towards? What advice is he seeking? Some
argue that there are very limited grounds of appeal in such
circumstances. It obviously leaves the police and, in some ways, the
Home Office in a hiatus period in understanding the validity and
appropriateness of the section 44 power as currently
constituted.</div><a name="10012880000201"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Hanson:</b></i> I very much believe that section 44 as
currently constituted is a valuable power in helping to disrupt, deter,
and provide a framework to defend this country&#151;in particular
major areas such as the capital city&#151;against the threat of
terrorism. Section 44 is a very valid tool in that armoury, which is
why we are seeking to appeal. We are examining how we can appeal and,
if we can, we will appeal that judgment. If we lose the appeal, we will
see what we need to do to ensure we are able to protect the British
people from terrorist attack. The power is a deterrent. The fact that
there could be stops and searches occurring in parts of London today
under orders that I have endorsed indicates the deterrent value of that
activity. It is certainly a valuable tool. Amendments to the Bill that
would delete section 44 completely have already been tabled.
I will reject those amendments and argue strongly for the retention of
that power, because I believe it is an important tool.</div>
<a name="10012880000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are
looking at the grounds and time scale for appeal. If necessary, I will
report to Members during the course of the Committee about our
discussions on 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column118" />Column number: 118</div>those matters. We have not yet finalised the details but I intend, with
the Home Secretary&#146;s support, to ensure that we retain the

to appeal the European Court judgment, but at this stage there is no
absolute determination that the Home Office will be able to
appeal?</div>
<a name="10012880000204"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.

that we retain the right to have section 44-type stop-and-search powers
available to police, subject to parliamentary and independent scrutiny,
as one of the tools in the armoury to defend this country against the
terrorist threat. We wish to appeal the judgment and we are considering
how we can do that. If we can do so, we will appeal.</div>
<a name="10012880000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me add
one more point, Mr. Brokenshire. The judgment against us is
based on the historical use of section 44, and the case itself is from
2003. There have been significant changes since then, not least of
which is that the blanket use across every borough in the Metropolitan
police area has ended and been replaced by specific, targeted use of
the power in certain areas, which are not disclosable but which will be
obvious to Members of the Committee.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">245</b><b class="B"><a name="10012880000485"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> Do you accept, though, that the judgment is
based not on practice, but on the law as drafted? Although the practice
may have changed since 2003, the European Court of Human Rights
judgment speaks to the law as currently constituted, so to comply with
the judgment, if it is not appealed or that appeal is lost, changes to
section 44 would be required.</div>
<a name="10012880000207"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Hanson:</b></i> We would actively consider that option in the
event of the appeal not being heard or being rejected. I suspect that
that decision would probably be for the next Parliament, whatever
happens in that scenario. However, it would certainly be the present
Government&#146;s intention, under our stewardship, to maintain that
position.</div>
<a name="10012880000208"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">246</b><b class="B"><a name="10012880000486"></a>Tom
Brake:</b> To pursue that line of questioning, why are you not
using the Bill as an opportunity to respond to Lord Carlile&#146;s
concerns&#151;I am trying to remember the word he used in relation to
the application of section 44; it was either &#147;excessive&#148;
or &#147;disproportionate&#148; and Ministers are always keen to
quote Lord Carlile&#151;and as an opportunity to be perhaps much
clearer about the time frame and perhaps the geographic extent in which
section 44 can
apply?</div><a name="10012880000209"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Hanson:</b></i> Both those matters are operational decisions
for the police and are subject to their applications to me. Section 44
does not now say that there shall be a stop-and-search power in Greater
London. Section 44 gives the power for the police to request that power
in certain geographical areas. Whenever the police have a section 44
agreement, they submit a document to me that indicates the geographical
area and the  time scale in which they wish to operate that
section 44 power. Once they have agreed the document, I then have to
approve it. That then operates under the  jurisdiction of the
Minister, with the support from the operational
decision.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column119" />Column number: 119</div><a name="10012880000210"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">247</b><b class="B"><a name="10012880000487"></a>Tom
Brake:</b> But does that not mean that the power&#146;s
application will always be open to the charge of being applied
disproportionately, if there is no guidance to determine what would be
a reasonable geographic distance, for instance, over which it should
apply?</div><a name="10012880000211"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Hanson:</b></i> My judgment has to be founded on the
operational judgment of the police. The operational judgment of the
police is that they wish to apply to me for approval for section 44
usage in a certain geographical area, at a certain time, based on their
assessment of what they believe the threat to be to that area at that
particular time. They will then undertake random stops-and-searches of
individuals, vehicles, or whatever they feel to be appropriate, in that
geographical area, under my authorisation, and then subject to Lord
Carlile&#146;s retrospective examination.</div>
<a name="10012880000212"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">248</b><b class="B"><a name="10012880000488"></a>Tom
Brake:</b> I understand that the police will apply for a
section 44 agreement for operational reasons, but might not the
tendency always be to seek something that is slightly wider than
required, simply to provide a buffer, or, as the police perceive it,
for safety reasons? In practice, it might be operationally acceptable,
and from a civil liberties point of view more defensible, if it applied
to a smaller
area.</div><a name="10012880000213"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Hanson:</b></i> On that point again, that is part of my role
and that is part of Lord Carlile&#146;s role. I look at every section
44 agreement put before me. I challenge and discuss with my officials
the extent of the police request. I look at the figures for previous
police involvement in stops-and-searches in those areas. I look at all
the statistics. The police write a report for me, on which I then make
a judgment. I could in theory&#151;I have not yet, but I
could&#151;refuse to accept that section 44 agreement. It is based on
the operational judgment of police and there is ongoing
discussion&#151;as there has been following Lord Carlile&#146;s
reports, and ministerial and official discussions with various forces
and the Association of Chief Police Officers&#151;on the use of the
geographical areas. That is why, as you will know, Mr.
Brake, and as I mentioned to Mr. Brokenshire, the areas
concerned in London have been shrunken considerably in the past
12 months, as have those in other police force
areas.</div>
<a name="10012880000214"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">249</b><b class="B"><a name="10012880000489"></a>Tom
Brake:</b> I shall move on to another matter: the removal of
the name and address requirement. Minister, you made an estimate, or
perhaps a guesstimate, about a reduction of 20,000 police hours, is
that right?</div>
<a name="10012880000215"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Hanson:</b></i> We estimated that the stop-and-search changes
will save around 200,000 hours per year. That is based on the
statistics for stop-and-search for 2007-08, which is our last full
year, and on our assessment of how long it will take if the five items
are not recorded on every stop-and-search by an individual officer. We
made that assessment&#151;I did not do so personally, but officials
did&#151;on the basis of the number of stops-and-searches in that
year, less the time that it takes to do
them.</div>
<a name="10012880000216"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">250</b><b class="B"><a name="10012880000490"></a>Tom
Brake:</b> I understand that. If the change is made, what is
the estimate of the number of times that police officers will go for
the shortened version? You heard Jan Berry state that, particularly in
relation to stop-and-account, a new, simplified process had been
offered to the police, but senior officers seemed still to be applying
the full-blown approach. I am seeking guarantees that the estimate of
200,000 hours accounts 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column120" />Column number: 120</div>for the fact that many officers will continue to collect the same
information, so there will be no or a smaller time
saving.</div>
<a name="10012880000217"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Hanson:</b></i> One of the difficulties of being Police
Minister in the present situation is that we have 43
forces&#151;Mr. Hogg knows about this from his days in the
post&#151;and those 43 forces will operate 43 regimes. Part of our
job is to improve good practice. We are driving through the
stop-and-account form very hard to ensure that forces comply with our
wish to stop the use of that form. Most forces are doing that, and if
they are not, they will stop using them
shortly.</div><a name="10012880000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our
estimate is that the information is not required. Forces have been
consulted on it and we have discussed it with ACPO. That is the source
of the time saving that we anticipate. It may be less or it may be
more, but that is our judgment now. If we agree as a
Committee that those five items are not necessary, and Parliament
endorses it, it will save time for police officers, which in my view
will be a good thing because we do not use the information that we have
got. If we do not use it, why do we collect
it?</div>
<a name="10012880000219"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">251</b><b class="B"><a name="10012880000491"></a>Mr.
Flello:</b> I want to pick up on the point about recording the
name and address. Let us suppose that somebody is stopped and searched
in Parliament square; their name is not recorded and what they have on
them seems to be innocent enough, but 10 minutes later there is a major
incident, and that little bit of evidence that may have helped in a
subsequent investigation is not there. What risk analysis or assessment
has been done to determine that the benefit of the reduction of 200,000
hours is huge and the risk is so small as to be negligible?</div>
<a name="10012880000220"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Hanson:</b></i> I can give you, I hope, the assurance that
these ideas are not simply a Minister or the Home Office saying that we
wish it. The ideas have come from discussions with ACPO and the Police
Federation, and from recommendations through consultation. They are
seen as proportionate by the police family as a way to reduce
bureaucracy, not put the public at risk, save police time, and let
those 200,000 hours be used differently&#151;on something that is a
better use of time for the public at large. I never say that we will
eliminate all risk&#151;that is not
possible.</div><a name="10012880000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
principle is that, if the stop-and-search shows that something is
wrong, such as the numberplate on the vehicle or the characteristics of
the person, that can lead to action by the police. If the
stop-and-search is simple, the police officer will record the key items
that we have now: ethnicity, so we do not have disproportionate
activity towards people from minority communities; the object of the
search, or what we are looking for and why; the grounds for the search,
or on what grounds has the individual or vehicle been stopped; the
identity of the officer; the date; the time; and the place. That
information gives us reasonable grounds for knowing why, where and
when. If the situation that you described happened, there could be
problems, but that would be in a very small number of cases. There is a
balance. We do not use most of the information that we get, which I
will discard if the Bill becomes law. That is a waste of police time.
It is costing time. The police have asked us to try to remove those
burdens, so the police are making judgments that I am trying to endorse
and
support.</div><a name="10012880000222"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">252</b><b class="B"><a name="10012880000492"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> Just three matters if I might, Mr.
Hanson. As regards a section 44 application, which 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column121" />Column number: 121</div>comes to you, I take it, in the form of a submission, how much
information do you get on the reasons for operating stop-and-search
within a geographical
area?</div><a name="10012880000223"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Hanson:</b></i> I get a large number of reasons, and I hope
that Mr. Hogg will understand if I cannot necessarily also
disclose to the Committee some of that information, but I get an
operational view from the police on why they believe an area needs to
be examined. That sometimes involves individuals. It sometimes involves
physical buildings.</div>
<a name="10012880000224"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">253</b><b class="B"><a name="10012880000493"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> Is that queried by your officials before it is
placed before
you?</div><a name="10012880000225"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Hanson:</b></i> It is. There are officials who look at the
information. I make judgments upon it. I have to sign the document and
I take very seriously my responsibilities in signing a document that
endorses an operational decision by a police
officer.</div>
<a name="10012880000226"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">254</b><b class="B"><a name="10012880000494"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> Secondly and differently, I rather share Robert
Flello&#146;s view about the recording of name and address. It seems
quite likely that, on occasion, there will be complaints about this. It
is a good thing to know the identity, in so far as you can ascertain
it, of the person searched. Would you like to comment?</div>
<a name="10012880000227"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Hanson:</b></i> In relation to complaints, I hope that I have
been able to reassure the Committee that if Mr. X were
stopped in Parliament square at 2.45 pm on Thursday 28 January by a
police officer who was named, at a time that was identified and in a
place that was identified, and if he subsequently went to the
commissioner and made a complaint about that, we would identify the
police officer accordingly.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012880000495"></a>The
Chairman:</b> We paused then because I was very conscious of
the duties of our <i class="I">Hansard </i>writer. I suspected it would have been
difficult to hear what was being said over the clamour of that bell.
Please continue
Minister.</div><a name="10012880000229"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.

it difficult to do two things at once as well.</div>
<a name="10012880000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">The only
additional point that I would throw into the pot is that the individual
who would be stopped also gets a physical record of the stop-and-search
in their hand, so they can use that as evidence if they wish to make a
complaint.</div><a name="10012880000231"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">255</b><b class="B"><a name="10012880000496"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> The other question is the one that I put to the
Police Federation. With regard to the ethnic origins, I think it is a
good idea for the constable to record what he deems to be the ethnic
origins of the person because that is important for the
record, but I would have thought that asking somebody what their ethnic
origins were is likely in some cases to be confrontational. That is my
view and I should like to hear
yours.</div><a name="10012880000232"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Hanson:</b></i> Interestingly, the genesis of that provision
is recommendation 61 of the Macpherson report following the death of
Stephen Lawrence, where the recording  of a person&#146;s
self-defined ethnicity, as opposed to the assessment of the police
officer, was deemed to be important. The police officer might determine
someone to be a particular ethnicity and the person might deem
themselves to be something else, so that self-definition essentially
followed that
recommendation.</div><a name="10012880000233"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">256</b><b class="B"><a name="10012880000497"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> On the other hand, having walked the streets as a
special constable some 30 years ago, I can envisage circumstances in
which posing that question may cause trouble. I would rather make my
own assessment and record that in the note or on the
record.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column122" />Column number: 122</div><a name="10012880000234"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Hanson:</b></i> It is an interesting question and 
perhaps one that we can debate in Committee. The Lawrence report looked
very carefully at positive relationships between predominantly black
and minority ethnic communities and the police, and one of its
recommendations was this particular facet. I would be loth to change
it, given the consideration that went into that report. I recommend it
to the Committee, but I am happy to explore the issues in
detail.</div><a name="10012880000235"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012880000498"></a>The
Chairman:</b> It is now 3 o&#146;clock. Can we move speedily
to the second section, which is on gang injunctions? I think we may
need a little longer on the DNA
database.</div><a name="10012880000236"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">257</b><b class="B"><a name="10012880000499"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> The gang injunction provisions mirror those
that were debated in the Policing and Crime Act 2009. The
Under-Secretary of State may remember some of the debates and
discussions that we had in relation to those orders, and how they
sought to fill a hole resulting from a court judgment on the use of
section 222 injunctions under the Local Government Act 1972 in
Birmingham. At that time, we debated the fact that those previous
orders were not applicable to under-18s. The Government indicated that
they would come back to us and have now done so. However, the Minister
will be aware that we also debated what happens when the orders are
breached, and the fact that, as a civil order, breach of an injunction
would usually go before the normal courts rather than the youth court.
That was one of the reasons why the Government stated that they were
unable to introduce provisions at that time. Will the Ministers explain
the Government&#146;s approach to that? Nothing in the Bill as
drafted states that a breach of the orders would result in a young
person going before the youth court, which seemed to be one of the
primary factors in the delay in the first place. It would be helpful to
understand the thinking  on that.</div>
<a name="10012880000237"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Hanson:</b></i> We have taken a decision to make some changes
to ensure that a breach of the orders will result in challenging and
automatic penalties. I will put the purpose behind the under-18s gang
injunctions in context. We seek a limited use of the injunctions, and
we want to help&#151;often before any criminal conviction has
occurred for an under-18&#151;and engage in positive interventions,
positive diversionary activity and positive support to the individual.
However, we have included in the legislation an ultimate deterrent on
breach leading to detention. If people undertake persistent activity in
gangs, persistently break their order, or undertake an activity that is
so severe that the order is breached, we need to have penalties that
ultimately lead to detention.</div>
<a name="10012880000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having
considered the matter since Mr. Campbell dealt with measures
on over-18s in gangs in the previous legislation, we have made some
changes and have introduced the proposal in the Bill to try to meet
that need. We do not want to criminalise young people; we want through
early intervention to prevent their
criminalisation.</div><a name="10012880000239"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">258</b><b class="B"><a name="10012880000500"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> To be clear, are you saying that a breach of
the order would result in the young person going to an adult prison or
to a youth offender
institution?</div><a name="10012880000240"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Hanson:</b></i> If a breach of the order occurred&#151;I
would hope that this would be the very, very, very, very, very last
resort&#151;it would result in detention at an appropriate facility.
The order is meant to be a positive 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column123" />Column number: 123</div>for the young person, so it would mean that they were doing a
diversionary activity or one of the other things that I have mentioned.
If they breach, we have to have the sanction of detention. We have had
this discussion, and have agreed a position, across Government on the
last resort in the event of a breach. If we do not, the individuals we
are dealing with, as you will know, Mr. Brokenshire, are
going to be at the most challenging end of the potential criminal
spectrum. That option has to be one that could ultimately be a
sanction.</div><a name="10012880000241"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">259</b><b class="B"><a name="10012880000501"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> The Minister will be well aware from reading
all the briefing notes for this sitting of the statement made in
relation to the previous Act that bringing in young people would
require this major change in the relationship between the civil courts
and minors. Yet there does not seem to be a significant change in the
Bill as compared with the wording in the Act. I am trying to understand
what, if anything, has changed. Was that a wrong characterisation at
the time of the original Act or has something else happened that is not
obvious?</div><a name="10012880000242"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Hanson:</b></i> It is certainly an issue that we have had to
look at. The environment in which these injunctions will be used has
not changed in the intervening months. We have acknowledged that the
situation remains the same. In the new schedule 5A we are giving courts
the power to impose two types of order not previously available to the
civil courts. They relate to issues I have referred to in my previous
comments and they strengthen the deterrent power of breaching the
order.</div>
<a name="10012880000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope the
Committee will understand that it is not the Government&#146;s
intention to use those detention powers or those powers on breach of
order. They are there as a power. I want to see the effective use of
the gang injunction so that the individual, whether convicted or not,
undertakes diversionary activity to take them away from gang activity
and to change their lives before they reach 18. Sadly, in some areas
now, people between 14 and 18 are becoming involved in gang
activity.</div><a name="10012880000244"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">260</b><b class="B"><a name="10012880000502"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> Does the Minister accept that there is a
clear link between these types of order and antisocial behaviour
orders? Does this imply some weakness in antisocial behaviour orders?
What is the difference between the two as he sees
it?</div><a name="10012880000245"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Hanson:</b></i><b class="B"> </b>There are significant differences
between antisocial behaviour orders and the proposed gang injunction.
This is a specific order. It is designed for individuals who are
actively involved in gangs, who are very often on the edge of
criminality, who may be drawn into further acts of violence or gang
activity and who may be identified by the police, by youth workers, by
youth offending teams, by other agencies and by their families. The
application of this injunction is a severe measure which is different
from antisocial behaviour orders in a range of ways, which I could go
through over many hours. It is designed in specific instances to look
at that activity as a whole. As I have said, if the power is agreed by
Parliament we will pilot this, probably in a major UK city for a
six-month period starting as soon as we can once the Bill is enacted,
to look at those issues and to compare and contrast how it works in
practice.</div><a name="10012880000246"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">261</b><b class="B"><a name="10012880000503"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> How many adult gang injunctions have been
given since the previous Act become law?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column124" />Column number: 124</div><a name="10012880000247"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Hanson:</b></i><b class="B"> </b>None, as yet. We had that discussion
at the sitting the other day. The legislation received Royal Assent
only a few months ago. We are working through that at the moment. The
power is available. That is not a failure of the power. The power is
there for very specific cases where individuals are involved in gang
activity and where this order for adults or, if agreed by the Committee
and the House, for younger people, can make a difference in their lives
to drive them away from that
activity.</div>
<a name="10012880000248"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">262</b><b class="B"><a name="10012880000504"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> My reason for restating that point was that
the Minister has said that he wishes to pilot the youth injunctions for
six months. Has there been any piloting of the adult injunction, as
that might have been helpful to inform the approach and policy in
relation to these new
injunctions?</div><a name="10012880000249"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Hanson:</b></i><b class="B"> </b>I am looking at my colleague because
the adult injunctions were taken through when I was in the Ministry of
Justice as opposed to the Home Office. My understanding is that there
was no piloting of the adult injunctions. I have chosen to pilot the
youth injunctions for younger gang members for the simple reason that
it is a complex area. We are dealing with very vulnerable people. We
want to try something that works. We need legislative cover for that.
This is what this is about. The pilot will look at the various
challenges. If it is successful, works, is useful, makes a difference,
helps agencies and changes lives, we will look at extending
it.</div>
<a name="10012880000250"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">263</b><b class="B"><a name="10012880000505"></a>Mr.
Flello:</b> The evidence we heard on Tuesday suggested, as you
have Minister, that this is a power of last resort. In the guidance
issued on this power, will you make it clear that, if it is to be used,
there must be a documented progression of previous
activities&#151;everything from the acceptable behaviour
contracts&#151;and that all these measures have been looked at, if
not used, and that there is a proper documented pattern to it? It
should not be used by a council that wants just to dip in and out of
the tool box, rather than properly using all the tools that are in
there.</div><a name="10012880000251"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Hanson:</b></i> I cannot give a totally satisfactory answer.
The first time anybody comes into the sphere of this type of
legislation could well be under the gang injunction. It could be that
somebody has not come before the courts, has not been involved in an
ASBO or parenting contract, but has got involved in a gang and is
vulnerable to being sucked into gang activity. It may be the first
intervention that individual could face.</div>
<a name="10012880000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill will
define clearly both what a gang is, under the Policing and Crime Act
2009, and the options around the diversionary activity and the
disposals that could be put in relation to the injunction. I cannot
guarantee that it will not be a progression. I can say it will be used
only where there are specific circumstances around the involvement of a
gang.</div><a name="10012880000253"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">264</b><b class="B"><a name="10012880000506"></a>Mr.
Flello:</b> In that case, how vigorously, in guidance or
whatever form, will the requirement be on local authority partners to
ensure that matters such as diversionary activities are properly in
place? A criticism I have of section 30 orders is that the police do
their part enforcing section 30, but when a local authority comes to do
its bit, sadly, in certain cases it is very poor and sometimes
completely lacking. If this intervention is designed to get a young
person away from a gang environment, it must ensure that all those
other facilities and support mechanisms are put in place.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column125" />Column number: 125</div><a name="10012880000254"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Hanson:</b></i> This will be undertaken in partnership with a
range of agencies: local authorities, youth offending teams, support
from a range of organisations. Through the order we are trying to put a
legally binding commitment on an individual to undertake activity that
will help in diverting them from the activity that we are concerned
about. The need for that support across the board is vital and that
partnership is there. As I mentioned earlier, we will be piloting this
in a major UK city, if legislation is approved. We will learn lessons
in the first six months of that pilot. If it works and is effective, we
will take it forward with partner
agencies.</div><a name="10012880000255"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">265</b><b class="B"><a name="10012880000507"></a>Mr.
Flello:</b> To conclude on that point, my concern would be
that the major city that you might have in mind may have an extremely
good track record of involving the local authority. That may not be the
case in future roll-outs of the pilot if it is successful.</div>
<a name="10012880000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given that 14
is older than the age of criminal responsibility, do you envisage
having to come back to the House, if the pilot is successful, to reduce
the age? Might it not be better to address it here and now in the Bill,
and reduce the age to that of criminal
responsibility?</div><a name="10012880000257"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Hanson:</b></i> It is not the Government&#146;s intention
at the moment to have an age lower than 14. We have made an assessment,
rightly or wrongly, that the type of gang activity that we have will be
commencing at the earliest around the 14-to-17 age range. I know we
heard evidence earlier in the week from one witness who indicated that
people were involved in gangs when they were perhaps as young as 10 or
11. I will happily keep this under review. We have put this in place
because we think it is proportionate, helpful and will hit the age when
people are predominantly involved in
gangs.</div><a name="10012880000258"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">266</b><b class="B"><a name="10012880000508"></a>Tom
Brake:</b> Some months ago the Home Affairs Committee
conducted an inquiry into knife crime. As part of the inquiry, we
looked at the issue of gangs. It was very clear that the membership of
some gangs is fluid&#151;who is in, who is out; there are a lot of
people on the periphery and so on. How confident are Ministers that it
will be possible to identify people who are clearly genuine gang
members, rather than people who are on the periphery of gang
activity?</div><a name="10012880000259"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Hanson:</b></i> We will, first, focus particularly on the
Policing and Crime Act 2009, which determines what is a gang. There is
a clear definition in that Act. We will work with agencies that look at
vulnerable individuals. Those vulnerable individuals will be people who
are on the edge of the gang. Gangs are defined under the Act as having
at least three people, a name, an emblem, a colour, other
characteristics, or as being associated with a particular geographical
area. I cannot say that young person &#147;X&#148; or young person
&#147;Y&#148; will necessarily be a member of a gang, but the
criteria are there. The people who know the area will know who those
people are, and whether it is the head teacher, youth worker, police
officer or a parent, that criterion can be defined by an individual who
is involved in that. The determination will be undertaken by those
agencies on whether an application should be made for the
order.</div>
<a name="10012880000260"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">267</b><b class="B"><a name="10012880000509"></a>Tom
Brake:</b> In cases where a detention order might be applied,
there is clearly a risk that if you take a gang member out of a gang,
they might end up in an environment where gangs are also rife. How will
that issue be addressed?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column126" />Column number: 126</div><a name="10012880000261"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Hanson:</b></i> I cannot emphasise this enough to the
Committee. Detention, in the event of a breach of the order, is the
absolute last resort. If somebody is detained and sent to a youth
offender institution because they breached the order, the order, in my
view, has failed. It is the absolute last resort. The order is there as
a deterrent, but it is not the purpose. We are not seeking to detain
people because they are gang members without criminal convictions; we
are seeking to divert people from gang
activity.</div>
<a name="10012880000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">In my former
role as Prisons and Youth Justice Minister, I was responsible for all
young persons&#146; facilities. There is a gang culture in some of
those facilities. Gangs form from people who were not in gangs outside,
because that is a natural thing that happens in those types of
establishments, and we have to be aware of that. There are strategies
to support prison staff in helping to break that. However, if someone
goes to prison or a youth offender institution for breaching the order,
the order will have failed. Our job is to make sure that we use the
order as an effective
diversion.</div><a name="10012880000263"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012880000510"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I have two more questions under this heading.
May I suggest that we try to speed up just a little, as we have to
finish close to 4 o&#146;clock and we have the DNA database, domestic
violence protection orders, and the return to wheel clamping as
subjects on today&#146;s agenda?</div>
<a name="10012880000264"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Hanson:</b></i> If it is helpful, Sir Nicholas, I will be
taking questions on DNA with Alan Campbell. I will deal with the
domestic violence orders and Mr. Campbell will deal with
wheel clamping. We can take those subjects in whichever order you wish
to take them. If you would like a break from my voice, you could
discuss wheel clamping with Mr.
Campbell.</div><a name="10012880000265"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012880000511"></a>The
Chairman:</b> You are lulling me into a certain sense, I have
to confess. I call Douglas
Hogg.</div><a name="10012880000266"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">268</b><b class="B"><a name="10012880000512"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> It is a brief point. It relates to how the breaching
of the injunction will rank in a person&#146;s criminal record. Will
they be deemed to be convictions? Will they be shown on the
antecedents, so that when somebody subsequently stands trial, if they
do, they will form part of the
antecedents?</div><a name="10012880000267"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Hanson:</b></i> I have indicated that an individual could get
a gang injunction without having undertaken a criminal activity. In
that case, the injunction would be recorded and would not be deemed to
be a criminal conviction in that sense. The injunction is there to
provide an alternative diversionary activity. The breach of an
injunction would be a serious offence, is subject to serious penalties
and would be recorded. But the diversionary activity is meant to be
something that, even if an individual has not committed a crime, could
be used.</div>
<a name="10012880000268"></a><div class="hs_Para"></div><a name="10012880000269"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">269</b><b class="B"><a name="10012880000513"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> I suppose then, as often happens in criminal cases,
if the defence counsel asks, &#147;Have you had any previous problems
with the police?&#148; the individual will have to answer,
&#147;Yes, I was the subject of an injunction&#148;, albeit no
criminal proceedings were brought.</div>
<a name="10012880000270"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Hanson:</b></i> If it will help the Committee, I will happily
check with my officials after this session.  When we reach the
line-by-line scrutiny of the Bill, we can discuss those matters and I
will give clarification then, rather than say something that is not
strictly accurate now.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column127" />Column number: 127</div><a name="10012880000271"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012880000514"></a>Mr.

me.</div>
<a name="10012880000272"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012880000515"></a>The

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">270</b><b class="B"><a name="10012880000516"></a>Andrew
Rosindell:</b> I have a very brief question&#151;just a
point for clarification. On Second Reading, the Home Secretary referred
to dangerous dogs as potentially being part of this legislation. What
proposals may be included in the legislation to deal with that area of
concern? Alan Johnson specifically mentioned it when he spoke on Second
Reading.</div>
<a name="10012880000274"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Hanson:</b></i> There are ongoing discussions with the
Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs to look in general
terms at whether further legislation is required. The Home Secretary
said that at Home Office questions, and we are looking at the issue of
dogs in the round. In relation to the legislation before the Committee,
the word &#147;weapon&#148; could be defined under legislation as
being a dog. That is the clarification the Home Secretary made on
Second Reading, but we are looking in the round at whether we need
further measures on dogs, in which I know you take a great interest,
although not necessarily for this Bill, given where we are in the
parliamentary cycle.</div>
<a name="10012880000275"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">271</b><b class="B"><a name="10012880000517"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> Obviously, the Minister will acknowledge the
volume increase in the number of profiles on the DNA database. Why does
he think that the proportion of DNA detections has gone down given the
increase in numbers?</div>
<a name="10012880000276"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Hanson:</b></i> Let me first look at the figures. Since April
2001, 152,700 convictions were helped by the DNA database, of which
nearly 2,000 were for serious crimes, including murder, manslaughter
and rape, and another 6,500 were for other sexual and violent offences.
Crime is falling. Although it did not get much publicity, last week I
recorded an 8 per cent. reduction in recorded crime over the previous
year overall. The number of individuals on the database is increasing.
I think that there are proportionate uses of it. I am content that the
database still fulfils a valuable role in helping us to detect crime,
even if sometimes crimes are detected without
DNA.</div>
<a name="10012880000277"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">272</b><b class="B"><a name="10012880000518"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I press the Minister on this issue because
although I hear what he says about the aggregate numbers, which we can
debate in a different forum, the proportion of crimes solved by DNA
detections has pretty much stayed the same or has slightly gone down,
when the expectation might have been that the more profiles you put on
the database, the greater the likelihood that through technology and
matching, the number of DNA detections would go up. Is that
in line with what the Home Office was
expecting?</div><a name="10012880000278"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Hanson:</b></i> The numbers fluctuate. My colleague, the
Under-Secretary has just indicated that the numbers are likely to rise.
It is a debateable point, but from my perspective, if the DNA database
solved just one crime, I would be content with its operation. I think
that it is a valuable tool. If I look at the types of activity and the
cases I could quote&#151;as I will during other Committee
sittings&#151;that we have brought to justice, I can see that it has
a very valuable purpose. The decisions we have taken on the Bill are
about making judgments about how we make it proportionate, transparent
and give  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column128" />Column number: 128</div>people an understanding of their rights, and what we understand by that.
Following the consultation, we made changes to our original
proposals.</div>
<a name="10012880000279"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">273</b><b class="B"><a name="10012880000519"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> To make the point, I am not denying the
importance of having a DNA database, but as the Minister will
understand, it is a question of proportionality in the retention of
records on it, which is the key aspect of this debate. The point, which
I think the Minister has confirmed, is that the detection rate has gone
down, albeit slightly, but it has not gone up or reflected in any way
the increase in the number of profiles on the
database.</div><a name="10012880000280"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
separate point is the evidence base that the Government have sought to
use to justify the six-year period. As the Minister will know, the
research&#151;previously described as evidence&#151;conducted on
behalf of the Jill Dando Institute was not quite what the Government
thought it was when they published it and sought to justify their
12-year proposals. Can the Minister give any background information on
the status of the Government&#146;s current document, &#147;DNA
retention policy: Re-arrest hazard rate analysis&#148;? Who produced
the
document?</div><a name="10012880000281"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Hanson:</b></i> It is a Home Office document and we
commissioned it. I will put it in context. We produced a document in
May last year that indicated that we were consulting on what we felt
was proportionate activity at the time. We looked at the 12-year figure
and we had a consultation. We have had the judgments in between and
have determined that we want to be proportionate and fair while still
using DNA, including that of innocent people, to help us ensure that we
get convictions, fight crime, bring people to justice and give justice
to
victims.</div><a name="10012880000282"></a><div class="hs_Para">Following
the consultation, we have settled on a period of six years for DNA
profiling retention. I think that is fair and proportionate. It is in
line with what we believe the out of boundary judgments will be, and it
is in line with our evidence base, which Mr. Campbell
referred to, in relation to re-arrest rates. Looking at the Scottish
model, I think that convictions can be made using the six-year period
that will be valued by the people who seek them, such as relatives of
victims. I think it is proportionate. Our debate in Committee will
centre on the difference between three years and six years, violence
and sexual activity in the three-year period, and other activities.
There are legitimate debates in relation to that, but we have tried to
get it as right as we can by pushing it as far as we can, based on
evidence and
judgment.</div><a name="10012880000283"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">274</b><b class="B"><a name="10012880000520"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> Obviously, there was some concern about the
previous evidence, which is why I seek clarification. The re-arrest
hazard rate analysis document is an internally produced Home Office
document and it has not been peer
reviewed.</div><a name="10012880000284"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department
(Mr. Alan Campbell):</b></i> Yes it
has.</div><a name="10012880000285"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">275</b><b class="B"><a name="10012880000521"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> Okay. Perhaps we could get some clarification
about who prepared the document and who reviewed it. That sort of
information would be very helpful to understand the basis of the
document and how it might be viewed. Mr. Campbell might like
to comment on
that.</div><a name="10012880000286"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Campbell:</b></i> It might be better if we write to you with
the detail. The document was produced internally, but it has been
independently peer reviewed by two 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column129" />Column number: 129</div>leading academics in the field. Clearly, there are some issues, but
nothing that detracts from the broad lessons of the original
research.</div><a name="10012880000287"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012880000522"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> That would be helpful in understanding how
the document was prepared, the decisions that were taken, who prepared
it and who conducted the peer review. As the Minister will appreciate,
there were previously some
sensitivities.</div><a name="10012880000288"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Campbell:</b></i> I undertake to get as much information to
the Committee as possible, but it has been very much work in
progress.</div><a name="10012880000289"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">276</b><b class="B"><a name="10012880000523"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> That is very helpful. On the evidence base
and analysis, what consideration has the Minister, or his officials,
given to the analysis conducted by Professor Jim Fraser of Strathclyde
university&#146;s centre for forensic
science?</div><a name="10012880000290"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Hanson:</b></i> We have certainly looked at that material.
Mr. Campbell and I are jointly dealing with the issues on a
day-to-day basis. We have looked at it and have taken some analysis of
it. I still stick to the fact that, ultimately, it boils down to our
judgment based on our research and our understanding. That is where the
Bill is coming from. It is a judgment argument, and there will be some
debate about that, but we are using our peer group-reviewed evidence to
make those judgments.</div>
<a name="10012880000291"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Campbell:</b></i> Although the Fraser review was useful in
terms of looking at the Scottish model, nothing much appeared to come
from it that would give a clear steer on retention periods. The
evidence that we produced, about which I have given you a commitment,
is based on more recent evidence, which was not available when the
Scots decided to go in their own direction. It is interesting to note
that when we mentioned the Scottish model, one response was to rush to
defend its evidential base, but the reality is that it was not anything
like the evidential base we have obtained since.</div>
<a name="10012880000292"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Hanson:</b></i> To back up what Mr. Campbell said,
the evidence on the convictions that have occurred, based on the
potential of our model of between three years and six years, as I
reported to the Committee in an earlier intervention, is that we have
had about 23 convictions that would not have happened had the Scottish
model been in operation. Again, a judgment has to be made, and my
judgment is on the side of victims and ensuring convictions, not on the
side of avoiding them.</div>
<a name="10012880000293"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">277</b><b class="B"><a name="10012880000524"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> Will the Minister confirm that the hazard
rate analysis is heavily caveated? Perhaps that is why he talks about
judgment rather than hard evidence. Evidence is difficult to find, even
in relation to the report that was produced for the Home
Office.</div>
<a name="10012880000294"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Hanson:</b></i> The hazard rate analysis indicates strongly
that there is a tendency to reoffend during the period from the
potential offence or taking of DNA through to the end&#151;in this
case, an eight-year period. After six years, the ability to offend or
reoffend is less likely. That is a judgment.</div>
<a name="10012880000295"></a><div class="hs_Para">The six years
is, we think, proportionate. It is less than the 12 years we proposed
in our initial consultation. We can get that through, in our
discussions with the Council of Ministers. It means, yes, that there
may be people who will have had their DNA taken in year 1 who would
never have reoffended throughout the whole six years, and there will be
people who reoffend at 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column130" />Column number: 130</div>different levels throughout that time. It is proportionate, and it is
based on that evidence. Ultimately, it is based on our
judgment.</div>
<a name="10012880000296"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012880000525"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I am sure the Minister will confirm that even
the report indicated that there was a range&#151;that it could be
less than six years. Is the Minister saying that it is a question of
judgment?</div><a name="10012880000297"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Campbell:</b></i> Yes, it could be less than six years. Even
if most people go on to offend within the next  two to three
years, it still leaves a significant number who could go on to offend
later on. We drew a line at  six years, because a line has to
be drawn somewhere. It is not the case that you can draw from the early
arrest evidence an idea of the kind of crime that people might go on to
commit. There is no clear link. One therefore has to make a judgment at
some point.</div>
<a name="10012880000298"></a><div class="hs_Para">Referring to
the available evidence upon which the research was conducted, there was
some discussion about why we used arrest to arrest. The reality is that
we are talking about a limited time scale. Whoever does the research,
we are talking about a limited amount of evidence because the database
has been around for a limited time. Using arrest to arrest gives a
bigger number of people, as opposed to bringing in convictions. You
will be aware that if you are involved in the legal process it can take
quite a long time for it to come to fruition. We believe that it would
have skewed the evidence, which arrest to arrest does not. Whichever
way we look at it, there are limitations on any piece of
evidence.</div>
<a name="10012880000299"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012880000526"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I am sure the Minister will accept that
simply because someone has been arrested a second time, it does not
mean that they will have been convicted as a consequence of that
arrest. That is one of the imperfect elements of the
analysis.</div>
<a name="10012880000300"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Campbell:</b></i> Yes, and I am sure that it is imperfect to
people looking in from the outside, as I said in my first point of
clarification. Unfortunately, if one finds oneself as part of that
group&#151;if you have been arrested and you do not go on to
offend&#151;you are still part of that group, and the available
research says you will be more likely to go on to offend than the rest
of the population. We believe that is significant, which makes it worth
innocents being on the DNA database.</div>
<a name="10012880000301"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">278</b><b class="B"><a name="10012880000527"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> Mr. Hanson said that in the
Committee sittings, he would bring forward various examples of cases
that he suggested would not have been solved if the Scottish model had
been adopted. Could he produce details? Obviously it is a question of
assessing some of the facts and circumstances and the role that DNA
might have played. Sometimes it is not necessarily as clear-cut as
might be
presented.</div><a name="10012880000302"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Hanson:</b></i> I would be very happy to give those examples
to the Committee, but it might be better if I wrote to hon. Members
detailing, as part of an annexe, four or five good examples when DNA
has been essential in securing a conviction, and when under our
proposed model would be the right thing to do. That would be useful for
discussion. Then hon. Members can refer to those examples in Committee
and, if they wish, interrogate us on
them.</div><a name="10012880000303"></a>

Simon Burns</b> (West Chelmsford) (Con): Yes, I am on a point
of clarification. The offer sounds extremely helpful and it would be
extremely useful to the Committee, but only if we get the letter before
we deal with DNA in the Bill. Given the time that Ministers tend to
take to respond to MPs&#146; letters, we do not really want it for
the Report
stage.</div><a name="10012880000307"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012880000532"></a>The

Minister, but I think you have gathered the point that Simon Burns made
and I am confident that the letter will reach us in time. I look to you
for a
nod.</div><a name="10012880000308"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.

House of Commons board by close of play on Monday
evening.</div><a name="10012880000309"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">279</b><b class="B"><a name="10012880000534"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> This is my final question. The Minister will
probably recall that on Second Reading a point was raised about an
assertion by the Prime Minister that 114 murders were solved as a
result of previously innocent people&#146;s DNA being checked. Is
that figure still correct? Does the Minister stand by it and can he
provide some further
details?</div><a name="10012880000311"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Hanson:</b></i> The answer is yes and if the Committee so
wished, I could do
so.</div><a name="10012880000312"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012880000535"></a>The

satisfy the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">280</b><b class="B"><a name="10012880000536"></a>Tom
Brake:</b> Dr. Wallace from GeneWatch raised the issue of
false matches. As she did so, I think I could see Ministers
pooh-poohing her comments under their breath. Could the Minister
respond to her argument, which seemed to be sound? Often DNA is
degraded, so it does not have the 10 points that are taken as markers.
When the DNA database is extended to include that of other European
countries from 2012 onwards, there is potential for a larger number of
mismatches to occur, notwithstanding the one in a billion rule that
applies currently to DNA that is intact or complete. Is there, as Dr.
Wallace suggested, a risk of significant numbers of
mismatches?</div><a name="10012880000314"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Campbell:</b></i> I think we started from the perspective of
what is sometimes called the birthday paradox, which is the likelihood
of members of the Committee sharing a birthday. The numbers involved,
however, should not be compared. As Gary Pugh made very clear, you are
talking about a significant number of numbers for each individual
profile on the database. The likelihood of people getting a wrong match
now&#151;I do not think it would change significantly even if the
database continued to grow at its current pace&#151;is not
mathematically
significant.</div><a name="10012880000315"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">281</b><b class="B"><a name="10012880000537"></a>Tom
Brake:</b> That clearly is the Government&#146;s view, but
can I ask Ministers to watch that area carefully? I think Dr. Wallace
referred to the Germans having slightly different or lower standards
and therefore increasing the potential for
mismatches.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column132" />Column number: 132</div><a name="10012880000316"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Campbell:</b></i> Let us make this clear. Without question,
we lead the field on DNA, which is why we are coming to some of these
issues before other countries do. We are certainly conscious of the
need to make sure that the governance is right and that the standards
are as high as we can make them.</div>
<a name="10012880000317"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should add
a caveat that DNA is only one important tool in the detection of crime.
I do not believe that a court would accept a DNA match as the only
piece of evidence on which to convict someone. However, it is often the
hook on which the rest of the investigations begins and then
hangs.</div><a name="10012880000318"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">282</b><b class="B"><a name="10012880000538"></a>Tom
Brake:</b> I am not certain, but I think that Mr.
Hanson was going to pick up the question whether deletion of DNA
automatically triggers deletion from the police national computer, or
whether, as he argued, there is no link between the two and that
therefore there will not be an automatic deletion. Dr. Wallace&#146;s
position was that DNA deletion might still leave the PNC
entry.</div><a name="10012880000319"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Hanson:</b></i> If Mr. Brake will allow me, Sir
Nicholas, I said that I would refer back to that by the time we reached
Committee scrutiny stage. I will ensure that we have clarification of
that point when we reach that
stage.</div><a name="10012880000320"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
can say generally that we are currently working up an IT solution for
action at the end of the proposed six-year period that we believe will
be in place shortly, in the event of legislative approval, that will
ensure that DNA will be deleted automatically at the end of that
period.</div><a name="10012880000321"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">283</b><b class="B"><a name="10012880000539"></a>Tom

question related to the
PNC.</div><a name="10012880000322"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Hanson:</b></i> I will clarify those points by the time we
reach Committee scrutiny

shortly. They always are&#151;and they are always on time and on
budget.</div><a name="10012880000324"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
final issue, which was raised by Isabella Sankey, is national
security exceptions in relation to DNA. I wonder whether the Minister
can tell us in what cases national security exemptions or exceptions
might apply and how widely they could
apply.</div><a name="10012880000325"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Hanson:</b></i> Again, we have determined in the legislation
that if an individual has been convicted of a terrorist offence the
conviction lasts for life. If an individual has been suspected of a
terrorist offence, they are subject to the six-year rule under the
proposed legislation, as now, but a police officer may wish to apply to
extend that six-year period for a further year, subject to judicial
oversight. That is clearly established as part of our proposals, and I
hope that the Committee will support those in due course for national
security
reasons.</div><a name="10012880000326"></a>

Hanson:</b></i> The police will make operational judgments
that have to be discussed and confirmed in court, ultimately, with
judicial oversight. They will make those operational judgments based on
their knowledge of individuals. Police officers have mentioned this.
Sir Hugh Orde said that there were individuals without convictions in
Northern Ireland who were well known to the police to be involved in
potential terrorist activity. The same could be true of Islamist
extremist-inspired terrorism, through to other individuals involved in
animal rights extremist terrorism and right-wing extremist-inspired
terrorism. It would be an operational decision based on whether the
individual is known to the police. The police would make a case to
extend that retention period, under strict regulation, beyond the
six-year period for those
reasons.</div><a name="10012880000329"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">286</b><b class="B"><a name="10012880000542"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> I have just two questions for you, Mr.
Hanson. First, just refresh my memory about the Enniskillen case. My
recollection of the Northern Ireland Enniskillen case was that there
was a positive mismatch and that somebody who clearly was not guilty
had DNA that matched the DNA on the
explosives.</div><a name="10012880000330"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
now that low-copy DNA is increasingly available and used, is there a
case for saying that DNA evidence by itself should not be sufficient to
justify a conviction, but that there should always be corroborative
evidence?</div><a name="10012880000331"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Hanson:</b></i> I was involved in the Enniskillen case as the Northern
Ireland Minister who was dealing with those issues at that time. There
were some difficulties with the DNA and the DNA evidence. A range of
factors led to those difficulties. Some of it was down to the way in
which the DNA had been stored. It was not, therefore, a simple,
straightforward mismatch; there were some problems with the suitability
of the evidence. It is best that I reflect on those points. Rather than
talk from memory about the details of events that are now three or four
years old, I think that we should look at them and, if need be, refer
to them in our later discussions in Committee.</div>
<a name="10012880000332"></a><div class="hs_Para">For me,
evidence is about what a jury ultimately believes leads them to being
beyond reasonable doubt. That could be solely DNA evidence, if that DNA
evidence was proved to be sufficient for a jury to come to a
conclusion. It could be further evidence, as Mr. Hogg
outlined. Ultimately, it is for the prosecution to bring a case and it
is for a jury to listen to that case, including the defence of that
case, and to come to a judgment. I believe that DNA can very often be
supportive material for circumstantial evidence, because, as I think
Sir Hugh Orde said, whatever else DNA does, it can place
somebody at a certain place at a certain time. Equally, in some cases
that I will write to the Committee about DNA has been the defining
evidence that has established that there is no other way that an
individual could have been involved other than by being at the scene of
the crime and ultimately undertaking the offence for which they are
convicted.</div>
<a name="10012880000333"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012880000543"></a>The
Chairman:</b> We now move to the next sector for discussion,
perhaps quite briefly, which is domestic violence protection
orders.</div>
<a name="10012880000334"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012880000544"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> Sir Nicholas, given the limited time that we
have available to us, I wonder whether we might seek to get questions
in now on the remaining parts of the Bill, because I fear that
otherwise we will run out of time to ask
them.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column134" />Column number: 134</div><a name="10012880000335"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012880000545"></a>The
Chairman:</b> We may well do. Is it the view of the Committee
that there are no major questions to put to the Ministers on domestic
violence protection orders?</div>
<a name="10012880000336"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">287</b><b class="B"><a name="10012880000546"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I have one question on those orders, Sir
Nicholas. I am just seeking a point of clarification.</div>
<a name="10012880000337"></a><div class="hs_Para">Mr.
Hanson will remember that on Second Reading there was a question about
the sanctions that might apply for breach of a domestic violence
protection order. He said at the time that he would quote the section
and provide the details of the relevant provision. A number of people
are still concerned about that matter and it might be helpful to put
those details on the record, just to clarify that matter.</div>
<a name="10012880000338"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Hanson:</b></i> The sanction for breaching a domestic
violence protection order is currently set at a fine of up to
&#163;5,000 and a term of imprisonment of up to two
months.</div>
<a name="10012880000339"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">288</b><b class="B"><a name="10012880000547"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> Where is that stated in the
Bill?</div><a name="10012880000340"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Hanson:</b></i> If I recall correctly, on Second Reading I
referred back to a previous piece of legislation, which indicated the
penalty for a breach of an order. That is recorded in <i class="I">Hansard</i> in
the report of the Second Reading debate. I do not have the reference to
that previous piece of legislation in my head at the moment, but if
members of the Committee wish to refresh their memory of that Second
Reading debate there will be a reference in my winding-up speech to
that previous piece of legislation, under which breach of an order
incurs a penalty of two months&#146; imprisonment or a fine of
&#163;5,000.</div>
<a name="10012880000341"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012880000548"></a>The
Chairman:</b><b class="B"> </b>Is that answer
satisfactory?</div>
<a name="10012880000342"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012880000549"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> Yes. Thank you.</div>
<a name="10012880000343"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012880000550"></a>The
Chairman:</b> We move on to the last section that I have
highlighted, which we dealt with in our discussions with our first
panel of witnesses this afternoon. That section deals with
wheel-clamping, which is, of course, a highly contentious and somewhat
sensitive issue.</div>
<a name="10012880000344"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">289</b><b class="B"><a name="10012880000551"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> What came out of our evidence session on
wheel-clamping earlier this afternoon was the need for clarity on the
interrelationship between the Security Industry Authority, local
authorities&#146; responsibilities and the relevant codes of practice
and those bodies that might be responsible for those codes of
practice.</div>
<a name="10012880000345"></a><div class="hs_Para">I know that
the Minister will probably have taken in a number of points from that
last evidence session that he will want to follow up on, but it would
be helpful at this stage to hear his thoughts on how that
interrelationship should work.</div>
<a name="10012880000346"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Campbell:</b></i> We want a system that is effective but we
also want to keep it simple. This is a terrible area of cowboy
activity&#151;activity that we want to stamp out. We asked the SIA if
it would consider the possibility of licensing companies, because it
already licenses individuals. As part of getting a licence from the
SIA, there will be a code of conduct, which will cover many of the
areas of common concern and will be the subject of further 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column135" />Column number: 135</div>consultation. We hope to introduce the code through statutory
instrument, rather than in the Bill, because over a period of time some
of those conditions might change, not unlike the mandatory code for
alcohol that is currently being introduced.</div>
<a name="10012880000347"></a><div class="hs_Para">We looked at
a number of models, including local authorities and having other
associations involved, but we want to keep it simple. We do not believe
that there would be great benefit in introducing a role for a trade
association simply because we do not want to make it over-bureaucratic.
We are not convinced of the efficacy of some of the existing trade
associations. The code of practice would therefore be enforced by the
SIA in one way. It would also depend upon&#151;as I suspect we will
get to later&#151;whether there is another way of redressing
grievance through an appeals
procedure.</div><a name="10012880000348"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">290</b><b class="B"><a name="10012880000552"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> On reading the Bill regarding licensing, I
note
that</div><a name="10012880000380"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
conditions that may be prescribed...include conditions requiring
the person to whom the licence is granted to be a member of a nominated
body or
scheme.&#148;</div><a name="10012880000349"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
think the Minister is saying that would be a separate SIA-nominated
scheme, rather than a regulatory arrangement through a trade body. Is
that
correct?</div><a name="10012880000350"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">291</b><b class="B"><a name="10012880000553"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> To be clear, that scheme will include
provisions relating to signage, levels of fine, a number of the issues
highlighted in the original Home Office consultation
document.</div><a name="10012880000352"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Campbell:</b></i> Yes. We would expect it to include
charging. Of course, we are not just talking about clamping; there are
associated issues. Time is an important factor&#151;for example, it
is entirely unacceptable for clampers to wait around the corner until
you leave the vehicle, and then clamp your car and tow it away within
10 minutes.</div>
<a name="10012880000353"></a><div class="hs_Para">From the very
useful discussion we had today, it has been confirmed that signage is
absolutely crucial. Signage is not just about what you cannot do but
how to get the information that you need should you have a grievance.
There will be a process for redress and appeal. Method of payment was
mentioned. Too often that is required in cash, and amounts to little
more than extortion. There also needs to be a complaints procedure and
other elements. Those are the areas&#151;and I am sure there
others&#151;that the code of conduct will
address.</div><a name="10012880000354"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">292</b><b class="B"><a name="10012880000554"></a>Andrew
Rosindell:</b> The earlier evidence was very helpful. There
were three specific points on which the witnesses found consensus:
first, that land should be registered; secondly, that there should be a
code of conduct and that it should be the same as the one local
authorities have to abide by; and thirdly, that there was a need for
signage. Can all three areas be
incorporated?</div><a name="10012880000355"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Campbell:</b></i> Signage certainly can. As for the code of
conduct, we would want to consult on that. I am pretty confident that,
when we get a code of conduct, it will have the best parts of what
pertains to local authorities, but we may be able to get a better
system that incorporates much of what happens with local authorities. I
listened carefully to the discussion with Professor King the other side
of the matter, which is what you do with land. We were not convinced
that that was necessary because we want to focus on the companies. If
we are going to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column136" />Column number: 136</div>tolerate companies, they have to abide by a strict code of conduct in
the rules, otherwise they will lose their licences and they will be out
of
business.</div><a name="10012880000356"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">293</b><b class="B"><a name="10012880000555"></a>Andrew
Rosindell:</b> But will the code of conduct be in the
Bill?</div><a name="10012880000357"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Campbell:</b></i> To have a code of conduct will be in the
Bill but the details of the code of conduct will come in through
statutory instrument. To bring in land complicates matters
unnecessarily. That was the point that the councillor picked up. As
soon as you introduce local authorities&#151;although you can learn
their best practice&#151;and introduce a register of land or ask them
to police it, there is a cost. We do not want that cost to be borne by
the taxpayer, local or national. We want the cost of the scheme of
regulation to be borne mainly by the companies. They are the causing
the problem in the first
place.</div><a name="10012880000358"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">294</b><b class="B"><a name="10012880000556"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> I stepped out of the room briefly, so you may have
answered this question. Having listened to the debate this afternoon, I
asked myself why we do not simply outlaw this form of wheel-clamping. I
got the impression from those on the panel that they would be content
with that and I cannot identify yet any principled reason why we should
not.</div><a name="10012880000359"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Campbell:</b></i> There is a principled reason and a
practical reason. The principled reason is that private landowners have
a right to protect their land from people who would park on it. This
debate focuses on the practices of the companies, but of course the
situation would be helped if people did not park where they should not
park. There is an argument for using methods other than
wheel-clamping&#151;you could have a ticketing solution, for
example&#151;but the reality is that sometimes a mechanism is needed
to remove cars or deter people from parking on private land.</div>
<a name="10012880000360"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are not
talking just about a piece of wasteland that may be seen as a cash cow
for clampers. We are talking about residential homes, hospitals and all
sorts of buildings and premises that need to have a mechanism in place
to regulate parking. If you did not have clamping, another
suggestion&#151;perhaps we shall get to it on another day and another
Bill&#151;involves ticketing, but ticketing brings with it all these
issues, too. What we are seeking to do in the Bill, if we are going to
have clamping, is to have a much better regulated system, because the
other side of course is that there are some clamping companies that do
act responsibly and do a useful
job.</div><a name="10012880000361"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">295</b><b class="B"><a name="10012880000557"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> I take the point that people are entitled to protect
their private land. I feel strongly about that, as it happens, but
clamping causes or can cause very severe disadvantages to the person
clamped, and in the spectrum of disadvantage, ticketing is a much lower
level disadvantage than clamping. If you were clamped in the middle of
the night, you would be very angry indeed. One does have to look at it
in the balance, and it seems to me probable that clamping on private
land is the wrong side of the line, although I take the point that
people are entitled to protect their own
land.</div><a name="10012880000362"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Campbell:</b></i> I think that ticketing brings with it a
whole range of problems, and we have talked to the Department for
Transport about what might happen there. It is not a panacea. However,
I also think that people would perhaps see clamping slightly
differently 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column137" />Column number: 137</div>if we were able to rid the industry of those who use entirely
unacceptable methods. To some extent, the proof of the pudding is in
the eating. We shall have to see what the effect is of the code of
conduct that we propose, which is why we very much want to involve the
industry, local authorities and the public in the consultation on what
is wanted in the code of conduct, but it will have to be a tough code
of
conduct.</div><a name="10012880000363"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012880000558"></a>The
Chairman:</b> We have finished the items on our list, but I
suspect that Mr. James Brokenshire wishes to raise another
matter.</div><a name="10012880000364"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">296</b><b class="B"><a name="10012880000559"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I have a couple of quick points. The first is
on the question of universal jurisdiction. There has been some
suggestion that the Government will seek to deal with universal
jurisdiction in this Bill. The Tzipi Livni case is obviously one that
people have been looking at. I do not know whether the Minister can
give any update on whether that is the case, because it obviously will
have a bearing on the consideration in Committee.</div>
<a name="10012880000365"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, we
are awaiting details of the compensation scheme for victims of
terrorism overseas. Again, it is important to put on record where the
Government have got to with that, to allow us proper
consideration.</div><a name="10012880000366"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Hanson:</b></i> I shall very shortly table provisions and
shall write to all members of the Committee, including you, Sir
Nicholas, and Mr. Cook, with details of the provisions that
we are tabling on compensation for victims of terrorism overseas. As
the Home Secretary said on Second Reading, that provision will apply
from 18 January 2010 if approved by Parliament and will be based on the
Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority scheme, which operates in UK
circumstances. We are also considering, separately to that, what
compensation 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column138" />Column number: 138</div>support we can give for individuals who have been victims of terrorism
from 2002 to date. That is under separate
consideration.</div><a name="10012880000367"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
relation to universal jurisdiction, the Government do not propose at
this time to table amendments, but that remains under consideration. In
the event of that situation changing, I will certainly write to hon.
Members, informing them
immediately.</div><a name="10012880000368"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Campbell:</b></i> One final point. In Mr.
Hanson&#146;s letter that deals with other matters, there will also
be details of another amendment that we will table on wheel-clamping,
which will put in the Bill the fact that we will have an independent
appeals
system.</div><a name="10012880000369"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">297</b><b class="B"><a name="10012880000560"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> On
wheel-clamping?</div><a name="10012880000370"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Campbell:</b></i>
Yes.</div><a name="10012880000371"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012880000561"></a>The
Chairman:</b> This is an extremely appropriate time to end,
with that last comment from the Under-Secretary. The Committee will sit
again, under the chairmanship of Frank Cook, next Tuesday at 10.30 in
the morning. The sitting will be in Committee Room 12.</div>
<a name="10012880000372"></a><div class="hs_Para">I thank all
hon. Members for their staying power and the way in which they have
involved themselves in the questioning, which has been most helpful to
the Committee. I thank, on behalf of the rest of the Committee, the
Ministers for the frank and helpful way in which they have dealt with
all the questions put to
them.</div><a name="10012880000373"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Ordered,
</i>That further consideration be now
adjourned. &#151;<i class="I">(</i><i class="I">Mr.

till Tuesday 2 February at half-past Ten
