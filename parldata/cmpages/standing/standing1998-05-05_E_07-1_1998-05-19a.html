<B>The Chairman:</B> Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. For those who have not already anticipated the understanding and generosity of the Chair, hon. Members may remove their jackets if they want to do so. It may also be for the convenience of the Committee if I say that I was fortunate enough to be present for this morning's deliberations, so hon. Members will not need to do me the courtesy of repeating arguments that have already been heard.

Amendment proposed [this day]: No. 8, in page 21, line 39, at end insert--

<P>
Question again proposed, That the amendment be made.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind the Committee that with this it will be convenient to discuss amendment No. 9, in page 21, line 39, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(da) may make provision for members of a group of companies to elect to base their corporation tax payments on the previous year's taxable profits;'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Paymaster General </B>(Mr. Geoffrey Robinson): I shall not do you that discourtesy, Mr. Gale. Indeed, I shall proceed from the point where I left off. We shall resist amendments Nos. 8 and 9 for the compelling reasons that I have already explained to the Committee. I do not want to detain the Committee further on them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael Fallon </B>(Sevenoaks): The extent to which the reasons are compelling is subjective. The Paymaster General describes his own reasoning as compelling. He was in a remarkably genial mood before we broke for lunch, perhaps in anticipation of the lunch that he was about to have. He was helpful on amendment No. 8; he has gone some way to reassure the Committee that he will explore whether the rules could help companies that have imbalanced profits because of the seasonal nature of their trading.
<P>
I fear that we still differ over amendment No. 9, about which the Paymaster General did not do so much to reassure the Committee. He spoke rather airily about various companies with which he had been involved having different cash flows. I am not fully aware of all the companies with which the Paymaster General has been involved; some of them are well known, others are not known. The only company of which I have been a director had remarkably good cash flow. Although monthly forecasts can change against the budget, cash flow depends on the complexity of the company, the extent to which it trades overseas and sterling movements. It might have been helpful if the Paymaster General had given us some comfort on that.
<P>
The Paymaster General neglected to answer why he could not consider an element of choice. If some companies can show year after year that it is difficult to forecast profits on a current-year basis, why can such companies not have the choice to revert to a prior-year basis? Is it dogma? Is there a practical reason why companies could not elect on the basis of their trading experience, with the agreement of the Revenue, to revert to a prior-year system? Another amendment could be tabled on Report.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick St. Aubyn </B>(Guildford): I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Sevenoaks (Mr. Fallon) that we have heard far less from the Paymaster General about amendment No. 9, which speaks for itself. I suppose that we might draw comfort from one aspect: the Government's decisions and statements are driven mainly by what the Revenue tells them. Generally, the Inland Revenue is in favour of clauses and amendments that will yield more money, and against those that will yield less. We must, therefore, assume that it believes that amendment No. 9 would somehow cost revenue because of when it is collected. From that, we surmise that it expects the economy to grow and believes that, on balance, the profitability of the largest companies will increase year on year, so that if such companies were allowed to assess their profits on the basis of a previous year's profits, it would assess them on a lower figure than if it had to assess them on this year's profits. It is merely the Revenue's avaricious instincts that drive the Paymaster General's hostility to the amendment, which shows the Government's short-sightedness. They say that they are against driving the economy into boom and bust, but in order to sustain--

Sitting suspended for a Division in the House.
<P>
<H5>4.49 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
On resuming--
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I was about to come to the heart of my argument about the Inland Revenue's attitude that lies behind the response of the Paymaster General to amendment No. 9, which is that it is a way of getting more money in faster. Profits are expected to rise on the whole, as a result of which the accretion of taxes will be higher if companies have to pay tax on the basis of their current year's profits.
<P>
In the glorious period of 18 years of Conservative rule, we demonstrated that cutting the amount of money that is taken from companies enables them to invest it in their future and generate more profit. During that time, the profitability of British companies shot up. We transformed the situation in which British companies were deeply unprofitable and when many did not make economic sense to a situation in which we have one of the most successful large company sectors in the world. Some of the largest companies in Europe are British. The most successful companies will be hit because those that are growing the fastest will have to pay more the fastest.
<P>
What about companies in high-risk areas? The Government often tell us how much they want to help the risk takers who are providing many new jobs in our economy. Yet, under the provision, a company that is growing fast, as a result of which its profits are growing fast, will find that, because of the need to pay a much higher tax rate on this year's profits than it would have on last year's profits, funding for investment business is constrained.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies (Croydon, Central)</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I give way to the highly knowledgeable hon. Member for Croydon, Central (Mr. Davies) who, as we have heard, knows so much about large companies.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> Members of the Committee know of my background in Unilever and Colgate rather than in bean counting. Given the hon. Gentleman's analysis, is he happy to discriminate against those companies that are going through difficult times and of which profitability is decreasing? Does he want them to be taxed on the basis of the previous year's profitability or, on reflection, do you agree with the Government that it is much fairer to--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I do not agree with anything.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> The hon. Member for Croydon, Central (Mr. Davies), whose grasp of the matter is somewhat stretched, does not realise that the amendment would make provision for a group of companies to elect to base their payments on the previous year's tax performance. We are not obliging companies to choose the previous year's profits. The hon. Gentleman is displaying a lack of understanding of the commercial world.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I shall give way when I have answered his earlier point--to the extent that any of us can understand it. As large companies are growing so fast, they need money in their business. If they are to be pulled back by the much higher tax charges on a current-year basis, their growth will be constrained. It will have an impact on their share price at the time when they may need to raise more capital to develop new ideas and technology. If the Government do not accept the amendment, the fastest growing companies will be the hardest hit.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> In that case, the Opposition amendment is designed to discriminate in favour of very large companies that are growing fast. It would ensure that they paid less tax on the cash flow benefit while smaller companies that were declining lost. Is that the basic thrust of the amendment?
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I marvel at the ability of members of the Labour party to perform a 180 degree turn. The hon. Gentleman accused us of discriminating against certain types of companies, but we are now told that we are discriminating in favour of them. We support flexibility. It is the lack of flexibility in the Government's proposals that discriminates against the entire corporate sector. In the current year, a fast-growing, large company should enjoy at least some benefit from having its profits assessed on the basis of the previous year to determine what it must pay this year, just as a small company that is below the threshold for the new payment regime will pay tax only on last year's profits in the current year. If the Government want to help the small companies sector by relieving it of these provisions, they must also want to help the large, fast-growing companies sector. If a fast-growing small company creates jobs, a fast-growing large company creates, broadly speaking, many more jobs.
<P>
I suspect that the background to clause 36 and to the new system of payment is that originally the Government were targeting the small companies sector, and that when problems came to light in imposing the new system on the small companies sector, they said, ``Well, at least we can carry on with it for the large company sector''. As a result, however, they are left with a system that, as someone said to me last night, is not a step forward but a step back to the classic system of double taxation. One of the problems of that system was its lack of flexibility, and one of the problems of clause 36 is its lack of flexibility. The Paymaster General should show a modicum of common sense and accept an amendment that makes the system a little more bearable.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson:</B> I think that we are agreed on amendment No. 8--the hon. Member for Sevenoaks implied that he was satisfied with my comments on the amendment.
<P>
I am in favour of flexibility, but amendment No. 9 would impose major changes on the corporation tax system. We have got rid of tax credits and of ACT and are moving to in-year instalments--a modern system of corporation tax payment--but to have two systems running in parallel would be an impossible imposition. The hon. Member for Sevenoaks will recall not only the practical difficulties of trying to police the &#163;50,000 limit for individual savings accounts but the massive system changes involved in moving from personal equity plans and tax-exempt special savings accounts to the new ISA--over and above the software changes that the millennium bug is imposing.
<P>
Countries that allow a prior-year system, such as France, require tax returns and top-up payments to be made much quicker than we do. Having discussed the issue with affected companies, we felt that some would prefer one system and others would prefer another, but that because of the sheer complexity we could not allow two systems to run in parallel.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> Surely it is easier to police, to use the Paymaster General's words, a company that elects to pay tax on the basis of last year's audited accounts rather than on the basis on the current year's estimated accounts.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I was drawing a comparison with the ISA and emphasising the difficulties of running two systems in parallel. Auditors are responsible for policing and the agreed profits are what they report as being a true and fair state of a company's accounts.
<P>
The hon. Member for Guildford (Mr. St. Aubyn) says that we have targeted small companies from the outset, but he seems to forget that they were always left out of in-year instalments. Once we had consulted industry to ascertain what its problems might be, we decided to leave medium-sized companies out of the in-year instalments system.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory (Wells)</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I will give way in a moment, but it is interesting that as I am about to mention the EU the right hon. Gentleman jumps to his feet.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> Many companies with small profits will be caught by this provision because they will be associated companies of larger companies. It is not correct to say, therefore, that all companies with small profits are excluded, so the clause will cause considerable administrative difficulty to companies with small accountancy departments, which will have to grapple with profit forecasts and payments on account.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I readily accept the right hon. Gentleman's point, but not the conclusion that he derives from it. Any small company that is part of a large group that will be affected by the move to in-year instalments will be subject to the same financial reports and accountability regime as any big member of the group, involving matters such as forecasting--not just cash flow, as the hon. Member for Sevenoaks said--but profits on which they will be taxed, cash flow and balance sheets. There will be monthly reports on the terms of variance against the profit. It will work through the year and any amendments after the year end will be confirmed or otherwise by the relevant accounting body and adjusted.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
It is a simple system, reflecting the reality of how companies do their financial forecasting and their financial reporting, so that no burden is imposed on even the smaller of their subsidiary companies. I trust that we have done enough to avoid votes on these issues, but if the Opposition wish to press their amendments we shall be forced to resist them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> The Paymaster General has tried, but he has not satisfied us. The reason that he did not give, which I suspect he could have done, is the issue of cost. My hon. Friend the Member for Guildford was more convincing. The Reveneue will gain from the system that the Government are proposing. If the Paymaster General fears that if we switch to a prior rather than a current year assessment, the Revenue will somehow lose out, it is still open to him to adjust the rate later. There is no danger of a loss in revenue in allowing companies to elect. The reason that the Paymaster General gave was rather revealing when he said that they would all have too much to do. There are many other compliance costs, most of which we are now discovering arise not from millennium but Government compliance of all the new burdens, some of which we shall explore later.
<P>
In his throw-away final remark, the Paymaster General has given a real hostage to fortune when he said--and I wrote down his words exactly--that the system ``will not impose a burden.'' We are very sure that it will impose a burden. Therefore I am minded to press amendment No. 9.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I wish to add to my hon. Friend's last point. I have a letter from the British Venture Capital Association, which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``This will constrain vital areas such as capital investment, research and development, all of which the Chancellor wishes to promote.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is the contradiction at the heart of the Government's policy and why they should be the first to sign up to amendment No. 9.

<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

</FONT>Question accordingly negatived.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The matters arising from clause 36 have been thoroughly debated already. I am prepared to allow a stand part debate, if that is what hon. Members want, on the understanding that matters that have already been debated are not raised again.
<P>

<H4><center>Clause 38</center></H4>
<H4><center>Taxation of rents and other receipts from land</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Philip Hammond </B>(Runnymede and Weybridge): On a point of order, Mr. Gale. Clause 38 gives effect to the provisions in schedule 5, but there is an error, as the Committee knows, in that part of paragraph 48 appears in the text after paragraph 55. I am aware of the provisions relating to simple printing errors, but it is not clear to me whether the latter part of paragraph 48 should be included in the right place or should not be there at all. I had expected the Government to table amendments to renumber the paragraphs and to set the matter straight.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The hon. Gentleman is correct, but that is a matter for the Government, not for the Chair. If the Minister wishes to respond, he may do so. The question under consideration is whether the clause as printed should stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Further to that point of order, Mr. Gale. Is it in order for the Committee to consider a schedule which is manifestly wrong in that the order of the paragraphs is not consecutive--paragraph 55 is followed by paragraphs 48 and 56?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> It is open to any hon. Member to vote against the clause or the schedule under consideration. The order of the Bill is a matter for the Government, not for the Chair. If the Minister wishes to respond, he may do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I do wish to speak to the clause. I sense that some assistance is about to be granted to the Government. We should have an explanation because one of our duties in the Committee is to try to make legislation intelligible to outside interests. I remember that during the previous Parliament we launched an initiative to have statutes written in plain English. We have not heard much of that from the present Government and the initiative may have died a death.
<P>
An error in numbering, which might mislead the layman or the practitioner when seeking answers on taxation issues, is a matter of concern. We may be forced to vote against the clause because it simply does not make sense as it stands. That is a considerable problem, and the fact that it was my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond) rather than the Government who picked it up reveals a dereliction of the Government's duty. The Government have 1,000 civil servants working for them, whereas I have only my hon. Friends and a few outside practitioners who are kind enough to send me their observations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Does my right hon. Friend agree that in the circumstances, it ill-behoves the Paymaster General to criticise the drafting of Opposition amendments, as he has done frequently?
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> My hon. Friend is right. When our amendments put the Government in difficulty, the Paymaster General often points out that our amendments are technically defective. The Opposition understand that fact--we frequently table probing amendments, which are not intended to be incorporated into the Bill. They give the Government the chance to tidy up legislation and to produce consequential amendments.
<P>
Rather than nitpicking, the Government should ensure that the Bill is not as grossly defective as the clause is. We require an explanation, and the in-flight refuelling that appears to be going on may have helped the Paymaster General to cast light on my hon. Friend's argument.

<P>

<B>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson:</B> The Committee should congratulate the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge on his sharp-sightedness. We all have our moments of glory as Back Benchers, and this is certainly one such moment for him. I remember a similar moment when it was discovered that one of our shipbuilding nationalisation Bills was hybrid, which was a tremendous coup for Back-Bench Members. The hon. Gentleman's discovery is not quite in that league, but I congratulate him anyway.
<P>
I assure the Committee that the printing error has been picked up and that it will be corrected in the reprint of the Bill. The authorities of the House said that it could be amended as a printing error, which suggests that it is in order for the Committee to debate the clause and the associated schedule.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory) was a little ungracious. I have from time to time noted that an amendment was defective, including some of the technically complex but well thought out amendments that were moved by the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb). I have always said that we should nevertheless take such amendments on their merits and see where our debate takes us. We have had full debates, notwithstanding the fact that, from time to time, there may have been technicial deficiencies in an amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I thank the Paymaster General. If the problem is a simple printing error, it will be corrected when the Bill is reprinted. Is the second paragraph 48--that which comes after paragraph 55--meant to be part of the Bill, and will it be renumbered as such, or is it superfluous and should it be deleted?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I understand the hon. Gentleman's point. The misprint will be corrected. We have agreed with the authorities of the House that the second paragraph 48 will be deleted in the reprint.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 38 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Schedule 5</center></H4>
<H4><center>Rent and other receipts from land</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick Gibb </B>(Bognor Regis and Littlehampton): I beg to move amendment No. 39, in page 170, leave out lines 28 to 31.
<P>
This is a welcome schedule because it sweeps away some archaic schedule A rules, including the fact that rents are taxable on a due and payable basis rather than on an accrual basis and, with regard to the streaming of losses, the fact that landlord repairing losses are different from tenant repairing losses. In 1995, the schedule A rules from non-corporations were replaced with a more businesslike approach, and the same will happen in this instance. The rules that apply to businesses will also apply to schedule A businesses, which makes a great deal of sense.
<P>
This technical amendment would ensure that the Government's objective of creating an accruals concept that applies to schedule A will apply properly to the associated income. When the code was revised in 1995 for non-corporations, there was a debate about whether money siphoned into a sinking fund for future repairs to premises or property should give rise to a deduction for tax purposes. When money is put into a sinking fund, no expenditure takes place. The expenditure will occur in two, three, four or five years time when the property falls into a sufficient state of disrepair that the money needs to be expended.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Until the new code was introduced in 1995, the Revenue's view was based on the previous 1963 code. It believed that no deduction was available for a sinking fund until the money had been expended. That decision caused some hardship. When the 1995 code was passed, the debate ensued as to whether the Revenue would allow a deduction for a sinking fund on the basis of the long-standing case of Owen v. Southern Railway of Peru, which decided that if the provision could be calculated with accuracy, it should be possible to get a deduction for the expenditure. That debate was unresolved until this Finance Bill was introduced. My view, which is shared by people outside the House, is that it has now been resolved in the wrong direction.
<P>
New section 21A(3), which is in schedule 5 on page 170, refers to section 74(1)(d) of the Taxes Act 1988. Section 74 is the main provision which determines whether expenditure is deductible. Paragraph (d) specifically excludes
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``any sum expended for repairs of premises occupied . . . for the purposes of the trade, profession or vocation, beyond the sum actually expended for those purposes''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Therefore, any expenditure where sums were put into a sinking fund were not deductible.
<P>
It is slightly odd that new section 21A(3) incorporates that section into the new schedule A rules because the new rules purport to establish an accruals, business basis for the calculation of schedule A income. Schedule A income is supposed to be calculated according to the general rules that apply to the calculation of a trade's profits. It is wrong for those provisions to exclude expenditure siphoned into a sinking fund. I believe that the drafting of the Bill pertetuates an injustice.
<P>
The Government have an opportunity to put the rules onto a stable basis. They can resolve the debate, which took place after 1995, in the interests of business so that any money that is put aside for future repairs to a building can be deductible for tax purposes. The amendment would do that. It may be defective--one tables an amendment based on outside advice and hopes that it is technically sufficient--but even if it is not, I trust that the Government will accept my point. It is important for companies to obtain a deduction for sinking fund expenditure before the money is spent. I hope that the Government accept the intent of the amendment, even if they cannot accept the actual amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson:</B> On the basic principle of the new schedule A charges, the Committee will welcome what the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton said about them. They do, indeed, simplify the situation and create advantages for schedule A persons. We have made the language more user-friendly and comprehensible.
<P>
I understand that the amendment's purpose is to deal with the sinking fund. I think that that is in order and I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on it. We do not, however, want to include the sinking fund because it would put the landlord in a more privileged position than the trader. I see no reason, considering the latitude of the arrangement--the ability to offset and other provisions--why a landlord renting a property and land should be able to set up a fund against future repairs. That is the essence of it--
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson:</B> I will just finish this sentence and then give way. I cannot see the merits of making such a provision for the landlord and not for the trader, unless the hon. Gentleman thinks that a trader should have similar advantages.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Does the Paymaster General agree that leases allowing the landlord to set up a sinking fund to which the tenant would be required to make contributions, but for which the tenant would be unable to obtain deductions in computing his tax liabilities, would be onerous for the tenant or trader?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> We are not going down the route of sinking funds, so that question does not arise. If we were doing so, those would be valid considerations.
<P>
Sadly, we cannot accept the amendment. I understand its aim, but there is no reason why we should extend the provision as the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton wishes. Where repairs are incurred to the land and building, they are written off in the year and allowable for tax computational purposes, which is perfectly in order.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I feel that that is unjust because money is set aside and expense incurred, which--even though the money is not spent on the items of repair--creates hardship. It is unfair that no account is taken of such expenditure--the money set aside may even be deposited in a separate bank account--when calculating the profit on which taxes are paid. Landlords are therefore effectively paying tax on profits that do not exist. In light of the fact that this is a technical amendment, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 42, in page 177, line 38, after `profit' insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`or reducing or mitigating a loss'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendment:
<P>
No. 43, in page 177, line 40, after `profit', insert `or mitigating a loss'.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> We stand in awe at the Paymaster General's technical expertise--it may be that of his civil servants, but we know that he also has a sophisticated grasp of tax matters--but on this aspect he is probably as much of a layman as Opposition Members.
<P>
Page 177 of schedule 5 deals with losses, and it is welcome that the previous Government's initiative of modernising the taxation of property income--which has worked in respect of individuals--is now being applied to the company sector. Before I go any further, I should perhaps mention my connection with a company that will be affected by these changes. [Hon. Members: ``Ah.''] That company is proud of a long tradition of providing low-cost homes to those who cannot afford to buy them. Apparently that is something that the Labour party is against. I know that that is not the issue at this juncture.
<P>
Under the new regime, whereby losses on property trading and investment can be offset against the other profits of a business, there is a condition. That condition is that schedule A business must be conducted on a commercial basis. A commercial basis is defined towards the end of page 177, at the beginning of line 37, as, in effect, one on which there is a reasonable expectation of making a profit. Furthermore, it is stated that if the company behaves in a way that cannot reasonably be expected to create a profit, it will lose the benefits of the schedule. That is my layman's understanding.
<P>
My concern is therefore that a property investment company might not own the freehold of a building but a leasehold interest with a superior landlord, to which a fixed rent must be paid. Such a company may find that the current market rent obtainable for the building is--due to a change in market conditions--less than the rent that it must pay to its landlord. In such a situation it would be common sense and commercially sound for the company to find a tenant, even if it knows that the rent payable will generate a loss, rather than to maintain vacant possession of the building. However, the company would be fearful that it would be technically in breach of the requirements of the schedule if it entered into a contract through which it knows it will make a loss. That is the issue with which the amendment seeks to deal.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I support my hon. Friend's comments. I do not claim to be an expert in such matters, but the implications extend beyond property companies that trade at a loss.
<P>
Take the example of a company that acquires a long or medium-length leasehold interest in a property that it subsequently finds surplus to its requirements, and which then sub-lets that property at the current commercially available rent. During the early 1990s many large companies found themselves in such a position. They had to sub-let properties at substantially lower rents than they themselves were paying. Such an activity will be taxed separately as a schedule A business activity.
<P>
The requirement that a business should carry on on a commercial basis is right. However, the definition of a commercial business--that it must operate with a view to making a profit is clearly faulty. My hon. Friend the Member for Guildford rightly drew attention to the logical possibility that someone might carry on a business on a commercial basis in order to mitigate a loss that could not otherwise be avoided.
<P>
I shall quote an example from real life. A very large and well-known plc took out a 25-year lease on a suite of offices not very far from the House of Commons, for which it paid a rent of over &#163;100,000 per annum. In 1993 it found that those offices were surplus to its requirements. It sub-let them for 10 years at a rent of less than &#163;30,000 per annum, which was the then current market rate. As I understand it, the company will have to account for the income derived from that letting as a schedule A business. According to the definition contained in the schedule, it would fail the test of commerciality.
<P>
I shall quote another example for the Paymaster General's benefit. Many small businesses hold business property on leases that are over-rented. For instance, a local newsagent decides to retire but cannot dispose of his business because the premises of which he is the tenant are over-rented. He may choose nevertheless to retire and to sub-let those premises at the best available commercial rent. Once again, he would fail the test of commerciality as described in the schedule.
<P>
I therefore urge the Committee to consider the amendment in the spirit in which it is intended. It seeks not to undermine the commeciality test but to clarify and adapt it for the real world.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson:</B> There is not a great deal that divides us on the matter. I suspect that the amendment is in fact a probing amendment, which seeks assurance that there will be no significant change to the application of the commerciality test. If so, I can give that assurance.
<P>
The Revenue has always interpreted commerciality tests in accordance with the statement of intent, which is perhaps what the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge was getting at. That means that a company will not be considered to be operating uncommercially because, for example, it is temporarily experiencing adverse circumstances or struggling to establish itself or to develop a new activity.
<P>
That is not the example to which the hon. Member referred, which concerned the sub-letting of a 10-year lease at less than half the original rent. Anyone would want to examine that carefully to ensure that there was no implied or unintended benefit to a third party. The company concerned was caught out in that irresponsible property boom sponsored by Lord Lawson, but the Government will not allow a similar situation to arise because there will not be a similar property boom. A 10-year view of a Labour Government maintaining the low inflation and stability to which our economic policy is directed is a wise judgment.
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> The Paymaster General has made his point cleverly. He may be aware that when sub-letting property at a substantial loss, many companies take account of the fact that they must continue to pay business rates, albeit at a reduced level. That is a substantial cost that can be shed by sub-letting at a rent even below the market rent.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I take that point and I know the difficulties faced by many companies in that situation. I can assure the hon. Members for Guildford and for Runnymede and Weybridge that it is not our intention to change the commerciality test. The proof of that will be the way in which the schedule A arrangements are interpreted by the Revenue. Opposition Members should read that part of the schedule that we are discussing. There may be a temporary situation in which a company wants a property to be occupied for security or insurance purposes, in which case a strictly pragmatic and sensible approach will be adopted, as it has been in the past, by the Inland Revenue.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I am a bit confused by the Paymaster General's logic. Is he going to accept the amendment because we agree on what we are trying to achieve? He seems to have acknowledged that the amendment makes the intentions of the legislation clearer and that we should legislate with clear words and state what we really mean. He also seems to have acknowledged that there is ambiguity in the current legislation, so is he saying that he will accept the amendments?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I am telling the hon. Gentleman that there is no need for the amendments. The legislation is clear and those parts of the schedule to which he is directing his attention are clear. The position remains as before and the same approach will be adopted as for the commerciality test in relation to corporation tax on losses arising from a trade. With my assurance that that is exactly how the provision is drafted and how it will be interpreted, there is simply no need for the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> There is an ambiguity in what the Paymaster General says. He distinguished the short-term problem of a company from one which may last 10 years. A company may have gone to another part of the country when it was doing extremely well, but later decides to withdraw. In the meantime, the premises that it let may have missed the market or there may have been a fundamental change in the property market in that part of the country and it may be many years before the company can recover from another tenant the sort of rent that, with good intent, it had underwritten five or 10 years, or even longer, before. Is the Paymaster General limiting his personal concession rather than acknowledging the broad point?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> There is no personal concession. It is how the legislation has been interpreted and administered by the Inland Revenue for many years. That will not change. The hon. Gentleman made exactly the same point as his hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge. A landlord may be caught out and suddenly have to let a property at much less than the market rate. I cannot comment on individual cases, but such landlords will be extremely well apprised of the application of the relevant part of the legislation and they will know where they stand with the Inland Revenue, which in future will be exactly where they stood in the past. That is why the amendment is unnecessary.
<P>
The legislation is trying to avoid the sort of situation to which the amendments, if they were accepted, might give rise. I shall give an example, which may be far fetched, but not everyone behaves as impeccably as Opposition Members. A property might be let to a relative of a director at below the market rent and that could escape the commerciality test if the company was being run as efficiently as possible. That is the import of the amendments and would be precisely their effect. Existing legislation is replicated in the Bill and is adequate. The hon. Gentleman has my assurance, on behalf of those concerned with the application of the legislation, that there is no change.
<P>
<H5>5.35 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Sitting suspended for a Division in the House.
<P>
<H5>5.50 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
On resuming--
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> It may be convenient for the Committee--with your permission Mr. Gale--if I now correct the printing error that the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge drew to our attention. The second of the two paragraphs numbered 48 is wrongly numbered. The paragraph 48 that comes after paragraph 55 will be renumbered 56, and all subsequent paragraphs will be renumbered accordingly. I understand that that is now being done. The reprint will be available as soon as possible. The hon. Gentleman will see that the two paragraphs numbered 48 are different; the second one will be renumbered 56.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We are going back over previous business. To keep the Committee firmly in order and to allow other hon. Members to speak, I shall treat this as a point of order.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> Further to that point of order, Mr. Gale. I am glad that you have ruled that it is a point of order, because something quite serious is happening. Just before the sitting was suspended, we were told that paragraph 48 had got into the Bill inadvertently. We were told that a Government amendment was not needed to remove it, but that it had been cleared up under a printer's error convention. We are now told that it is part of the Bill. The Paymaster General should make up his mind. Is he now saying that those two lines will be part of the Bill and that only the numbering is wrong?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> That is absolutely right. That is exactly the position. I hope that I made that clear.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> Further to that point of order, Mr. Gale. I am unused to this level of Government incompetence in legislative matters. Does it mean that the Division on the clause, which was taken on a false premise is therefore invalid? We voted for the clause on the basis that those two lines were to be expurgated. We are now told that they will not be. What is the legal implication? It sounds serious.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> My understanding is that the Paymaster General is simply alluding to the numbering of the paragraphs. If, having given an undertaking--it will be a matter of record that part of the clause was superfluous and would not be in the Bill when it was reprinted--the Paymaster General now says that that is not the case, there will be a difficulty. Perhaps the Paymaster General could clarify matters.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> The situation is clear. I am happy to clarify it. It is simply that there is a misprint in the numbering of the paragraphs. Paragraph 55 is followed in the text before the Committee by paragraph 48, which should be renumbered 56. Paragraph 56 should therefore be paragraph 57 and subsequent paragraphs will be renumbered accordingly through the schedule. I do not think that that should cause much difficulty. The mistake is being corrected.
<P>
The earlier vote was on clause 38--we have not yet voted on schedule 5, so the problem alluded to by the hon. Member for Guildford does not arise. I shall seek other guidance, but the clarification that I have given is quite clear. We shall vote on the text with that misprint corrected. It will be available to the Committee, so I see no problem in proceeding.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I think that, for the moment, we have taken the matter as far as we can. The Paymaster General has put the Government's position clearly on record. It will be for the Opposition to study that record. Perhaps I should make it clear now that if it becomes apparent to the Opposition that they have voted on a misunderstanding, and although I have no power to direct Madam Speaker in her selection of amendments, I hope that she would accept that an Opposition amendment tabled on Report would be suitable for consideration. We shall now return to the business in hand.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> On a slightly separate--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I have ruled on that matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> After the episode of blinding incompetence by the Government, I wonder how they had the nerve to criticise our efforts to propose amendments. We gladly burn the midnight oil and we use our best efforts to table well-considered amendments--but when the Government, with all the resources and expertise behind them, cannot get right the matter whether two lines should be kept in or taken out, we are bound to ask whether they know what they are doing.
<P>
Such a matter is germane to the amendment. Knowing the human frailties of Labour Members and those who advise them, we can say with confidence that the Bill has been drafted sloppily. The Government have come up with the barest of excuses and dredged up the old chestnut of the executive renting his home at a loss to the company. That can be dealt with by the taxation of personal benefits. It can be dealt with as an exclusion, if that is the Government's real worry. However, we have not received a clear acknowledgment that we made a valid point.
<P>
The Paymaster General wanted to refer to the boom-and-bust scenario. Most of the problems arise from the type of upwards-only rent review--institutional lease--that was popular and widely accepted in the 1970s when there was exceptionally high inflation under the previous Labour Government. At that time, it was almost unimaginable that rents might fall. The level of inflation was so high that any change in the relative value of properties would be mitigated by the Labour-style inflation rate. We fought for 18 years to change that inflation culture. It is because we succeeded in killing it that we have the inherited situation whereby companies that committed themselves to high rents and upward-only rent reviews are now caught short in the current environment.
<P>
Let us reflect on the fact that in a modern, flexible, fast-changing economy, certain property sectors that may have comprised commercial premises may now be made up of residential premises. A whole swathe of commercial premises in central London are converting back to residential premises. A company in such an area that had a commercial lease might find a significant drop in demand for office premises and have great difficulty in sub-letting its commercial lease. It might not be able to negotiate with its landlord any means out of that least or a conversion to residential use that might be more profitable in the current environment. Yet again, the Paymaster General has failed to grasp the wider economic scene.
<P>
We shall read the runes of what the hon. Gentleman said, providing that he does not pop up in five minutes' time to contradict himself again. We had better call a halt to the debate while we are ahead. We received a clear statement from him that he agreed with us that the situation is as before. On those grounds, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 44, in page 178, leave out lines 40 to 44.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 45, in page 180, leave out lines 17 to 32.
<P>
No. 32, in page 180, line 32, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `29A In section 413 Taxes Acct 1988 (Interpretation of Chapter IV) after the words ``trade or trades'' in section 413(3)(c) insert, ``or a Schedule A business''.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> It is fair to say that these are probing amendments, prompted by those who have written to us about their worries that the clause will have an unfair effect on them. How does the Paymaster General or the Financial Secretary envisage the provision applying to companies? How can the surrender of excesses be treated and how flexibly will the clause be interpreted?
<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I rise to speak to amendment No. 32, to schedule 5. As I mentioned when we discussed amendment No. 39, we welcome the provisions in schedule 5. They bring in a new regime for schedule A companies that is more in line with business practice, moving the taxation of schedule A income to an accruals basis. The creation of the concept of a schedule A business is useful. It makes a distinction between an actively managed investment, for example, a property development, and a passively held investment, on which no active management takes place and the income from which is pure profit. That important distinction should be made. A schedule A business should be taxed as a business.
<P>
A problem existed before schedule 5 was proposed, but I and many others had hoped that it would be dealt with when schedule 5 was introduced. That problem involves consortium companies. A consortium company that is an investment company cannot use its losses for consortium relief. An investment company that is owned by more than whatever is the definition of a consortium--five or more owners with less than 50 per cent. ownership, each holding more than 5 per cent. of the shares--cannot use its losses for consortium relief. The losses of a consortium company that qualifies as an investment company cannot be used by the corporate owners of that consortium company. That gives rise to enormous commercial problems, especially for joint ventures. Someone who took advice on establishing a joint venture in a property company would not establish a company through which to conduct that joint venture, because if he were to do so, and the business made a loss, those losses would not be available to the consortium member companies. In most circumstances, therefore, joint venture property development takes place through side-by-side leases or through a partnership, although from a commercial perspective, they are not the ideal vehicles through which to conduct a joint venture property deal, because they lose the benefit of limited liability.
<P>
Amendment No. 32 is designed to deal with that problem, at an opportune time. It is meant to help the Government and business. If it is technically efficient, I hope that the government will accept it. If it is not, I hope that they will introduce their own amendment on Report.
<P>
The amendment would not add a new paragraph, 29A, to schedule 5. I assume that the order of earlier paragraphs in the schedule will not change as a result of the Government's incompetence. It is designed to amend section 413(3) of the Taxes Act 1988, which, for the benefit of Labour Members, is on page 1812 of ``Butterworths''. The amendment would amend the definition of a trading company to include a schedule A company.
<P>
The purpose of the amendment is to enable a consortium company that qualifies as a trading company, as opposed to an investment company, to use its losses against its profits. A consortium company that is an investment company cannot. Although schedule 5 introduces the concept of a schedule A business that is meant to appear to be comparable to a Schedule D, case I, normal trading basis, it ceases to be a trading basis if the company qualifies as an investment company. The Bill therefore contains an anomaly. It is wrong that a consortium company defined as an investment company for tax purposes, even though it is carrying on a schedule A business, cannot use its losses for consortium relief when it would have been able to, had that consortium company been defined as a trading company. Schedule 5 is meant to introduce the concept that a schedule A business is like a trading compnay. It is odd that an amendment has not been tabled that would enable the losses of a consortium company that is an investment company, but is carrying on a schedule A business, to be available for consortium relief.
<P>
It is an important point. Companies such as Tesco and Greater Universal Stores, which have large property portfolios, are engaging in joint venture deals with companies that specialise in property, such as British Land. They would want to put the properties into a company and not to have to carry out such deals through a partnership or side-by-side leases. The Bill will hinder the efficient management of property.
<P>
It does not make sense for trading companies with no expertise in managing or developing property to be doing that work themselves. As always, the private sector is ahead of the Government in private finance initiative deals. It is calling in experts to run portfolios and that is being carried out successfully. The problem could be solved by the Government at this opportune moment under schedule 5. Joint venture deals cannot be undertaken through a joint venture company because the losses cannot be used. That is commercially unacceptable.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. John Burnett </B>(Torridge and West Devon): I do not have my yellow book with me, but will the hon. Gentleman elaborate on one point? Is the purpose of the amendment to allow a property investment consortium company to surrender its losses to its consortium owners?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Yes, provided that the company is undertaking a schedule A business. That is distinct from a company that merely holds property for long-term investment, but does not actively manage it. I shall explain the oddity in the Bill. Let us suppose that a property developer wanted to engage in a quick deal and make a fast buck. If he developed the property quickly and sold it, any losses would be available for consortium relief because property developing in such circumstances is a schedule D, case 1 activity. It is a trading activity, so the loss would be available for consortium relief under the Bill.
<P>
If a company held a property for a long-term investment and actively managed it for that time, it would be an investment company. If it were an investment company and a consortium company, any losses that it generated would not be available for consortium relief. I hope that the Government will take the opportunity to remove such an anomaly either by accepting amendment No. 32 or by giving an assurance that they will come forward on Report with their own remedy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson:</B> I shall deal first with amendments Nos. 44 and 45, after which I shall deal with amendment No. 32 in the name of the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton. Amendment No. 44 would delete the ordering rules in the rewritten provision on the set off of group relief. Similarly, amendment No. 45 would delete proposed new section 403ZE. I have to go into some detail and I hope that it will not give rise to unrelated remarks from Opposition Members. It would be helpful if I explained that the new provisions that replace the old section 403 on group relief are included in schedule 5.
<P>
When considering the changes needed to provide for schedule A losses to be surrendered for group relief, the opportunity was taken to rewrite the general rules on surrender in clearer, simple language. That may be one of the points that the hon. Gentleman wished to establish; I can confirm that that is the case. I can go into the reasons if the hon. Gentleman wishes, but I do not think that they are relevant to this afternoon's debate on the probing amendments. However, the effect of the rules has not changed. The purpose of amendment No. 44 is to delete the ordering rule, which provides that amounts surrendered are to be made up
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``first of charges on income, then Schedule A losses, and finally management expenses.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There was an ordering rule before, but it applied only to charges and management expenses. Schedule A losses are an additional item. That could not be understood so easily in the old version, but it is clear in the rewrite, in what we might call newspeak. When the legislation was rewritten, this rule was expressed more clearly. That is a good thing, as it makes it easier for companies to carry out their tax computations. The ordering rule will not operate to anyone's disadvantage. If relief cannot be given for these amounts in the year in which they are incurred, they will be carried forward. When they are carried forward, they will all get the same treatment; they can be offset against the company's own profit, but they cannot be surrendered to group relief.
<P>
Deleting the rule would mean that companies would not know in which order to surrender, and that would cause uncertainty, which I am sure is the last thing that the hon. Member for Guildford would want. I hope that makes clear what was done and why.
<P>
Amendment No. 45 would delete new section 403ZE, which defines gross profit for the purposes of rewritten section 403. Management expenses, charges and schedule A losses can be surrendered only as group relief to the extent that, in aggregate, they exceed profits for the year. These rules existed before but they have been put in simpler, clearer language, as I have already said, and they take account of the fact that schedule A losses can now be surrendered. Otherwise, they have not been changed. If the amendments are accepted, the legislation will still provide that charges, management expenses and the new schedule A losses can be surrendered only to the extent that they exceed the company's gross profits for the year. However, there would be no definition of gross profits and no rules for working out how much relief was properly available.
<P>
The hon. Member for Guildford will realise that his amendment would not have the intended effect. If he wishes, he can return to that once I have responded to amendment No. 32 moved by the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton.
<P>
I cannot accept what the hon. Gentleman said about something that is actively managed by a consortium for the long term. If one thinks it through logically, a long-term investment in a property, even if it is on a consortium basis, is not active management. We would usually think of a consortium as coming together for something like the channel tunnel. That is a specified project for a specified period of time, neither of which were adhered to, and it was clear that if losses were incurred--they were massive in that case--companies entering that project on a consortium basis would clearly be justified in seeking group relief for the proportion of losses that represented their share in the consortium.
<P>
I do not understand how one can logically transpose that sort of situation to the situation of a relatively passive investment under schedule A. We are discussing schedule A businesses, and there is a clear difference between the two sorts of activities. It would be for the consortium, if it wished, to make a case to the Inland Revenue and to discuss whether it should be taxed under schedule D or schedule A. I am not--and neither is the Bill--attempting to say what should be included in schedule D and schedule A. The schedule makes consortium activities available under schedule D and restricts it to businesses operating under schedule A.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> For the first time, this schedule enables schedule A losses to be group relieved. The Paymaster General gave the example of a company that was engaged, in his words, in relatively passive property development activity. If that generated losses, thoses losses would be available for group relief under the provisions of schedule 5. A consortium--that is, where the group structure does not exist and where the ownership is less than 50 per cent.--is an unusual circumstance. I do not see why the losses of a company that is wholly part of a group should be group relieved, when the losses of a company that is only 49 per cent. held by groups should not be group relieved. I hope that the Paymaster General will explain the situation.
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> It is clear that the same considerations do not apply to investment activity, which is why they are treated as schedule D. That is one reason why we allowed group relief to occur in certain circumstances, although we were not trying to extend the arrangements unnecessarily.
<P>
Our proposals are an appropriate, beneficial and welcome change to the treatment of schedule A. However, to argue that we should go further and ensure that consortium arrangements should apply to schedule D businesses is stretching it too far. I do not see the case for going that far. Property provides security to an activity. If one is digging a hole in the ground for the channel tunnel, one does not have much security. Property is an example of the long-term investment to which the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton referred. Property provides security and it does not expose an operation to the risks that are inherent in schedule D activities, where relief on a consortium basis is appropriate.
<P>
It is not inappropriate to extend the consortium arrangements under schedule D to a business that engages in property investment activities. If the hon. Gentleman were to press the amendment to a vote, we should resist it.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> Members of the Government have the benefit of in-flight refuelling facilities--we saw that in evidence this afternoon--but Opposition Members have to land and take off again. I am grateful to the Paymaster General for focusing my mind on the amendments. I realise that I should clarify the thinking that lies behind them more fully that I did earlier.
<P>
New section 403(3), which amendment No. 44 would alter, deals with group relief for schedule A losses that are in excess of profits for a period. We welcome the fact that group relief will be available. The point of this probing amendment is that it would be more consistent to treat schedule A losses in the same way as trading losses. The full amount should be available for group relief without the need to offset those losses against the company's other profits. That is my aim in the amendment, and it may be what my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton was getting at, in a different way, in amendment No. 32.
<P>
Amendment No. 45, which would make alterations on page 180 of the Bill, is necessary because new section 403ZE defines the surrendering company's gross profits for the accounting period to be its profits
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``without any deduction in respect of such losses''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That perpetuates the existing anomaly than can arise if a company has a capital gain in the year that is offset by losses that are brought forward. In such circumstances, the capital gain must be set against the schedule A loss for group relief purposes, even though, for other tax purposes, it will in any event be eliminated by the brought forward losses. That unreasonably restricts the amounts that are eligible for group relief under the new section.
<P>
The Paymaster General said that he was elucidating a plainer language, which we all want to hear, but he has not so far dealt with those anomalies. That is much to be regretted, but I hope that he will discuss them.

<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The Paymaster General's response was very disappointing. It is clear that he does not have a grasp of the problems that are faced by the commercial world. If he spent more time looking in his red box and reading the newspapers he would avoid the problems that his Government face elsewhere. For example, the private finance initiative, which the Government are keen on, will suffer if they do not accept the amendment. PFIs involve joint ventures with Government in managing properties. Commercial entities that are engaged in such activities would prefer to operate through a consortium company. That will be difficult for them if they cannot use a limited liability company.
<P>
The proposal makes using a limited liability company for any joint property venture with the Government or the private sector impossible because the commercial entities will lose the ability to use their losses. Only partnership arrangements or side-by-side leases allow them to use any losses that are generated. It seems absurd that limited liability will not be available for companies engaged in joint ventures simply because the Government and the Paymaster General have not accepted the important representations made by the business sector which has tried to sort out what is a long-standing problem. It is regrettable that they have not taken the opportunity to sort out the problem. I hope that the Paymaster General will think again about accepting the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> Taking up the hon. Gentleman's point on PFI, I am sure that he regrets mentioning it. Contrary to what he said, it is clear that our changes to it have greatly encouraged its development. I do not believe that we will stand in the way of successful PFI and private-public partnership projects. What was wrong with the PFI was the previous Government's absurd universal testing rule which allowed the capital expenditure rules to gunge up the system. There were no priorities. The first thing we did was to get rid of the universal testing rule and establish priorities. The hospital programme and other programmes have taken off to Britain's immense advantage. We have done what the Opposition, when in government, should have done years ago.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Surely the point that my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton is making is that anything that increases the risk, to whatever marginal extent, increases the difficulties for companies participating in PFI contracts, which must increase their cost to the Government.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> Costs are coming down all the time under this Government. The most recent prison tenders are 20 per cent. cheaper. We shall drive down those costs as we do the sensible thing. We will standardise contracts and not waste people's time on contracts and projects that will never happen because of an absurd universal testing rule. That is how to lower costs.
<P>
The amendment is about consortiums that fall under schedule A. Some hon. Members wanted further extensions of relief, but we do not intend to give those. We are giving one allowance which has to be claimed in the entity in which it arises. That is an important restriction on the new extension. The pleas for further extensions are not justified or necessary. We have clarified many matters and established a more flexible and advantageous regime for those operating under schedule D. We have taken a big step forward.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> Could the Paymaster General clarify one small point? It is a simple question. If a subsidiary company within a group makes schedule A business losses, can those losses be utilised by other group companies?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> They can be used in the entity and the year in which they arise. If any profits remain, losses can be carried forward but they must be utilised in the entity itself. I am sure that I have dealt adequately with the points raised by the hon. Member for Guildford, and I am sorry that I cannot concede the point pressed by the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> Naturally, I am disappointed by the Paymaster General's response. We have been told that we are aiming for a simpler system and we heard praise for the easily understood wording. What we are getting is easily understood words but less easily understood taxation. We ought to be aiming for a neutrality of treatment for companies that focus on schedule A business and those for which schedule A activities are part of general business. It is anomalous that a company that, probably for historical reasons, has hived off or separated its schedule A activities cannot obtain the same tax treatment through group relief as one that does everything under one corporate umbrella. Why should the same logic not also be applied to companies that are part of a group? The Paymaster General has not answered that question.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I want just one clarification from the Paymaster General. In answer to the question from the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon (Mr. Burnett), my understanding is that under schedule 5 it is possible for schedule A losses to be subject to group relief.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson:</B> Yes, it is possible under the conditions that I described to the hon. Gentlman.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> So more could be done, then. Losses could be taken against the current-year profit or be carried forward within the same entity. In fact, they could be subject to group relief. The Paymaster General's lack of understanding of that point makes me worried that he has not understood the purpose of the amendment, which is to address the anomaly whereby such losses are subject to group relief within a group of companies, but not when one company happens to be a consortium rather than a full member of a group. That seems anomalous, and I hope that, when he leaves the Committee today, the Paymaster General will read the red box, finish his homework and, on Report, table an amendment that accepts the principle that we debated today. That principle has important commercial ramifications for joint venture property development activities in the private sector involving large companies with large property portfolios.
<P>
The Paymaster General mentioned PFI--we all know that the Government are using it as a means of hoodwinking--which enables the Government to take the liabilities off the balance sheet without taking the risks off the balance sheet. I hope that the accountancy profession will stand firm in its view on that, and that the Government will not bully it into changing its view. That was clearly out of order, Mr. Gale, and I shall resume my seat. I hope that the Paymaster General will have considered this matter properly in time for the Report stage.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson:</B> I beg to move Government amendment No. 132, in page 182, line 12, after `768D'';', insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(b) in subsection (3) for ``or 768A'' substitute ``, 768A or 768D'';'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment is a purely technical one--I hope that it will not detain the Committee long--to repair a small oversight in certain anti-avoidance provisions, which already apply to the computation of profits in investment companies and their setting off of management expenses. It closes a small loophole in situations where there is a change of ownership. If Opposition Members want further elaboration on the amendment I would be willing to give it, but I would preface that by stressing that it is technical and I fear that it would not be too readily understood--[Interruption.] I look forward to a clear exposition from the hon. Member for Sevenoaks of exactly what troubles him about the amendment and of why the Committee's business cannot be dispatched with expediency so that we can move ahead.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> There is no limit to the arrogance and bluster of the Paymaster General. He now tells us that an amendment is so technical that, as the Minister in charge of the Bill, he cannot explain it to the Committee. He did not even have the good grace to apologise for the amendment, which corrects a mistake. We are beginning to lose confidence in schedule 5. He said that paragraph 32 is wrong and must be corrected. Three quarters of an hour ago, paragraph 48 was to be deleted, but now we are told that it will remain in the Bill and be renumbered. We do not know what is happening with schedule 5. I suspect that this is the first of a series of Government amendments to correct the mistakes that they have made in the drafting of the Bill, and this is only our sixth sitting. If this is the rewrite project, we need a rethink, too.
<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> There are just two words missing from the Paymaster General's statement--mea culpa. As the mouthpiece for the Inland Revenue, I am sure that the Government are saying that inwardly, but the Paymaster General should say that outwardly. After his series of disasters this afternoon and if he has any sense at all, he will know that he has made a fool of himself in front of all of us and his admonitions on our drafting techniques will in future be taken less to heart than before.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson:</B> In the face of that stinging criticism, I shall have to inflict on the Committee a sample of the matter that we are discussing and I willingly accede to the entreaties from the hon. Member for Sevenoaks.
<P>
The amendment is an anti-avoidance measure which ensures that all share capital and voting powers are taken into account when there is a change of ownership. Schedule 5(31) inserts a new section 768D in the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 to prevent schedule A losses arising before a change of ownership of a company from being offset against profits arising after that change in certain defined circumstances.
<P>
Schedule 5(32) amends section 769 of the Taxes Act 1988 with the intention of ensuring that the rules therein for ascertaining whether there has been a change in ownership of a company, which currently apply to the loss-buying or management expenses-buying legislation at section 768, 768A, 768B and 768C, apply equally to the new section 768D.
<P>
Although paragraph 32 attaches section 768D to section 769(1), (2)(d), (4) and (5), it does not attach section 768D to section 769(3) or (3A). Those two subsections together extend the rules on change of ownership, which otherwise focus on ordinary share capital, to allow all share capital and voting or other special powers held by any person under the articles of association or other document regulating the company to be taken into account. I am afraid that that was overlooked as a natural consequential amendment to give effect to section 768D, upon which most of the attention was directed. I urge the Committee to accept the amendment to complete the picture and to prevent loss-buying in all circumstances, as intended.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 40, in page 184, line 22, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(5) After subsection (6) insert--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
	``(7) In any computations (the ``relevent computation'') for the purposes of section 76(2) of this Act or section 89(7) of the Finance Act 1989, any allowances under the 1990 Act which would be deductible in the computation of profits of a Schedule A business or overseas property business of the company shall, so far as referable to life assurance business, be deductible in the relevant computation, and subsection (4) above shall apply as if such allowances were allowances in respect of investment assets.''.'.
<P>
The amendment relates to the taxation of life assurance companies. As most people know, the taxation of such companies is complex and they are normally taxed on the basis of investment income minus expenses. But they may be taxed on a notional schedule D case I basis when the profit is calculated on the same basis as that used for calculating the profits of a normal schedule D, case I profit of a company. The notional schedule D case I basis is used for two purposes. First, it gives a minimum level of profit on which a life assurance company must be taxed. Secondly, it is used to decide how much profit should be taxed as corporate rates rather than policy-holder rates--that is, how much should be taxed at 30 per cent. or 31 per cent. and how much at 23 per cent. or 20 per cent.
<P>
Previously, it was possible to claim capital allowances on investment properties when calculating the notional schedule D, case I--[Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. A quid pro quo for having the windows open and, therefore, noise coming in from outside, is that hon. Members who wish to conduct private conservations do so in the Corridor, otherwise, it is very difficult for the Hansard writers to hear what is being said.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I am grateful, Mr. Gale. I am surprised that Government Members are not deeply interested in this issue. If they were scrutinising the Bill as closely as Opposition Members, they would be all ears and listening eagerly.
<P>
Before the Finance Bill was proposed, companies were able to claim capital allowances in calculating their notional schedule D Case I profit. Indeed, the Finance Act 1995 deliberately provided that. It is absolutely clear from that Act that companies can claim capital allowances in calculating their notional Schedule D, Case I profits. The Finance Bill changes all that. It says that investment properties are not investment assets for this purpose. It seems to deny deduction for capital allowances in the notional Schedule D, Case I computation. That seems to be an oversight, as the change was not announced in the press release, notes on clauses or the Chancellor's statement on the Budget. It is not surprising that it was not announced in the Chancellor's statement because he announced so little that related to tax changes.
<P>
The oversight has arisen because paragraph 40(2)(a) of schedule 5, on page 184, defines an investment asset as one that is
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``held by a company for the purposes of its life assurance business otherwise than for the management of that business, and''--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and paragraph 40(2)(b) continues
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``is not let in the course of a schedule A business or overseas property business.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is paragraph 40(2)(b) that causes the problem. It is included in the Finance Bill to prevent the changes to the schedule A taxation regime giving rise to a double deduction because, as a result of the changes, capital allowances are already deducted in calculating schedule A profit, whereas, for Schedule D, Case I purposes, they are deducted after calculating profit. So paragraph 40(2)(b) is necessary to avoid double deduction, but because it exists, it means that no capital allowances can be deducted when calculating the notional Schedule D, Case I profit. That seems to be an oversight, which the amendment would remedy, not by deleting sub-paragraph (2)(b), which is necessary, but by amending section 76(2) of the 1988 Act and section 89(7) of the Finance Act 1989, specifically to include investment properties as investment assets for the notional Schedule D, Case I test.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson:</B> I think that the whole Committee would wish to compliment the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton on yet another display of his formidable technical expertise on a whole range of matters, which reflects the many years that he spent in practice.
<P>
Most life assurance companies are not assessed for tax on their trading profits but on their investment income and gains less management expenses--the so-called I minus E formula. The reason for that is lost in the mists of history, and it would not be profitable to go into that. It is something of an anachronism and arcane practice, which perhaps we shall address one day.
<P>
It is usually still necessary to compute a proprietary company's trading for some subsidiary purposes connected with the computation on the I minus E basis. There is, for example, a rule that the deduction for expenses must be limited if the I minus E profit would otherwise be less then the trading profit. That subsidiary computation is known as the notional case I computation. The purpose of the amendment appears to be to ensure that the capital allowances on investment assets that the company deducts in its schedule A computation are also deducted in computing the notional case I profits. I would be grateful if the hon. Gentleman would confirm that that is the purpose of the amendment, but I assure him that his concern that the Bill will change the law in this area to the detriment of life assurance companies is unfounded. However, given the arcane nature of life assurance taxation, I can understand that concern. Where property is held to back a company's life assurance business, the rules that apply to a computation of trading profit for a life insurer take precedence over the schedule A rules that we are debating.
<P>
If the hon. Gentleman reflects on what I have said, nothing could be more clear. I also point out, without going into the technicalities, that it would not work. The more fundamental point is that the amendment is narrower in scope that the Revenue's current practice, which continues unchanged. The amendment would apply only to schedule A capital allowances, whereas current practice extends to all capital allowances on investment assets. I reassure the hon. Gentleman that the amendment would create confusion and uncertainty in an area where present practice works to the benefit of life insurance companies. The hon. Gentleman will probably, on reflection, seek leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I am grateful to the Paymaster General for that assurance. That will be useful for the life insurance industry. On the basis of Pepper v. Hart, his words are as good as an amendment. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That this schedule be the Fifth schedule to the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Schedule 5 deals with what the experts tell me is one of the most complex areas of tax law--the taxation of rents and profits from property.
<P>
The previous hour and a half was not a glorious outing for the Government. Time after time, those of my hon. Friends who are better qualified in such matters than I am have drawn the Committee's attention to ambiguities in the schedule. Time after time, the Paymaster General has either displayed a lack of grasp of the matter in question or has resorted to quoting chapter and verse from the briefing notes, showing no sign that he has analysed or understood what he is reading. We might have avoided much of our discussion if the briefing notes had been circulated.
<P>
The fiasco over paragraph 48 shows that not enough attention has been paid to the details in this complex and long schedule. That has shown up elsewhere in our debate on an earlier amendment to paragraph 4. The Paymaster General has created as much confusion as has clarified.
<P>
It is still not clear why a person renting a property out by way of business, who is required by the lease on that property to make payments into a sinking fund operated by his landlord, should not be allowed to deduct those payments in computing the profits of his letting business. In practical terms, he has lost control of that money; he no longer has it in his possession. To all intents and purposes, it is an expenditure that he has incurred.
<P>
The Paymaster General conducted a lengthy debate with the Opposition about the appropriateness of the commerciality test that is applied under paragraph 28. He made great play of the fact that a temporary loss would arise, and that a company could properly seek to mitigate such a loss. However, it is still not clear whether the Paymaster General has given adequate consideration to a lease being granted when it is apparent that a loss will be incurred throughout the life of that lease, which may be a long period. What will happen if a loss is envisaged from the outset? The leasing of a building or property may be the only schedule A business carried out by a person or company; it is still not clear whether the Paymaster General's assurance will hold good in such circumstances, yet we understand that the commerciality test will have been satisfied provided that the company or person in question was seeking to mitigate a loss.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton raised important points on amendment No. 40. I do not claim the level of expertise of my hon. Friend, but I understand that what the Paymaster General was able to tell my hon. Friend by reading his brief satisfied him. Indeed, my hon. Friend said that the clarification that had been given as a statement made by a Minister would be of great value to the industry. If practitioners as skilled as my hon. Friend are forced to come to this Committee to seek ministerial clarification of matters in the schedule, perhaps the schedule is drafted in a way that is not as clear, concise or plain as we should have liked.
<P>
<H5>6.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The conclusion of Opposition Members, taking into account the Paymaster General's responses, is an overall feeling of muddle, confusion and lack of clarity, including the shambles over paragraph 48. The Paymaster General had clearly not been informed by his officials of the muddle in the schedule, which they might have expected him to refer to in the debate. Insufficient time and attention has been devoted to the preparation and presentation of schedule 5. We have debated only a few paragraphs of the schedule and have found deficiencies in their presentation and explanation. I shudder to think what would happen if we were to debate every paragraph to draw the Paymaster General out of the obfuscation that is apparent in the schedule.
<P>
My hon. Friends and I are deeply concerned that this is a shoddily drafted schedule. The Government's outing this afternoon has not been a successful one and the Paymaster General has ended up with egg on his face.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I am grateful to the Paymaster General for his reponse to my question regarding schedule A business losses within a group. I hope that he might reconsider allowing similar losses to consortiums as amendment No. 32 would provide.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> It is worth considering that the schedule is 23 pages long. We have seen a number of mistakes by the Government in those pages, and given their resources compared with ours, it does not give us much confidence in the other 400 odd pages, plus goodness knows how many pages of regulations.
<P>
It is fair to say that the good intention behind schedule 5 is to be welcomed. The Government have attacked the property sector since coming to power. They have increased stamp duty twice in two years, which has sent a signal to those investing in property that the Government are against them. We should like to have believed, that schedule 5 signalled a more rational and coherent approach to property investors and investment than has hitherto been suggested. Instead, we saw incompetence, confusion and a could-not-care-less attitude on a measure that is designed to help property investment.
<P>
I am concerned at how negative the Paymaster General has been at every turn. We said that it was good that schedule A losses may up to a point enjoy group relief, but when we suggest extending that logically to its conclusion, we are told that we shall not get that. When we ask for clarification on mitigating losses, we are told that we shall not get that either.
<P>
I am as concerned as my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge that not only are Labour Members tripping themselves up in the minutiae of the schedule, but they do not understand the big picture. We have not yet debated clause 42 on page 185.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We are concentrating on schedule 5, not clause 42.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I apologise, Mr. Gale. I meant paragraph 42 of schedule 5. It deals with the letting of furnished holiday accommodation and includes a stipulation that if any of the accommodation was first let by the person as furnished accommodation for more than three years before the beginning of the year of assessment, it may not be treated as furnished holiday accommodation. Will the Paymaster General explain that stipulation? It might unfairly discourage companies and discriminate against those that offer furnished accommodation.
<P>
Having lived in the west country for several years, where there is a tremendous demand for holiday accommodation, I have some knowledge of such matters. Such a provision will have a knock-on effect on the local housing market. Properties that might be available throughout the year as furnished accommodation could be withdrawn during the summer, which will create local housing difficulties. The idea that companies, which had a choice between holiday accommodation and furnished accommodation, should be penalised by the clause for electing in the first instance to try their hand at furnished accommodation is without common sense. It is against the interests of providing homes for local people and against the equitable treatment of property investment. The Government have just thrown it in and there may be an anomaly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown </B>(Cotswold): Does my hon. Friend agree that such a measure will create a perverse situation of furnished property against unfurnished property. The original intention of granting greater tax relief for furnished property was that it had a knock-on effect on the economy in terms of the furniture that has to be purchased, the cleaners, letting fees and so on.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> My hon. Friend makes a good point. Why are we discussing furnished accommodation as opposed to unfurnished accommodation? That is another anomaly. Those who have let furnished accommodation might be left in limbo if they switch to holiday lettings. They would not be treated as having furnished, holiday accommodation under the clause, but they would no longer have furnished accommodation. Will the Paymaster General clarify under which section of the Taxes Act an investment company would be taxed if it let its asset as furnished accommodation and then switched to holiday letting? The requirement is perverse.
<P>
<B>Mr. James Plaskitt </B>(Warwick and Leamington): Does the hon. Gentleman have an interest on which his knowledge is based?
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I am not aware of an immediate interest, but I might have one in the future. Such a point has no bearing on the matter, but it is encouraging that we have heard something from the hon. Gentleman. We were beginning to doubt whether he had the power of speech. The catechism from the Labour policy unit that was shared with us this morning has all the hallmarks of a cult. Indeed, the Opposition see it as a cult of silence. I am glad that it has been broken. May it be broken many times in the future, but first and foremost by the Paymaster General on the points that we have raised.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> This is a schedule of some complexity and technicality, and the Committee is indebted to the exposition given by my hon. Friends and by the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon. The schedule is badly written; it is riddled with errors and two of its 75 paragraphs are wrong; it is poorly understood by Ministers; and the Government have already had to amend it. The Committee is in no doubt that it could have been better prepared.
<P>
I turn to the sorry matter of paragraph 48--the second paragraph 48. We are still in some doubt. We were told first that it was a printing error and that those two lines could happily be deleted. Half an hour later, we were told that those two lines should be put back. I am still not sure what is correct; I hope that the Paymaster General will correct that shambles.
<P>
It is not as though the Paymaster General was not given notice of the problem. My hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge was not the only person to spot the mistake. The Law Society mentioned that defect to the Government in its April memorandum, to the Government, and I do not understand why the Paymaster General and his officials have not done their homework since then. Perhaps he will apologise for that shambles.
<P>
The Paymaster General was winging it again. We saw again his cavalier attitude to legislation. It was as if he had said, ``We can include those two lines; we need not include them'', and ``This is complicated, I need not explain it; all right, then, I shall explain it''. In fact, it is sloppy drafting, slopping thinking and sloppy advocacy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I have already complimented the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge on his spotting of the misprint. I have made it clear that we shall correct that mistake. It does not bear going over again. I do not want it to turn into a rush of blood to the head. It is a minor thing; it is simply a renumbering of paragraphs. The substance of schedule 5 is quite clear and we are already addressing some of the points that arose from our debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I shall given way in a moment. I am coming to the hon. Gentleman's point about the sinking fund, which was raised on amendment No. 39. The simple fact is that, for schedule A businesses, we do not feel that sinking funds or making advance provision for repairs is a necessary or appropriate charge against the profits in that year. The charges for repairs can be taken in the years in which they occur. A proper charge can be made against profits in that year, but not against a sinking fund.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> In view of the topicality of the information being given to Ministers by civil servants, does not the Paymaster General agree that Opposition Members were right to expect Ministers to be briefed on such a blatant error and be ready to answer questions on it?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> The hon. Gentleman labours the point. Any inconvenience is to be regretted, but it is not a matter of great substance. The more the hon. Gentleman seeks to labour it, the less important it becomes. It is a numbering correction; it alters nothing substantial in schedule 5.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman spoke about the commerciality test. I assured him on that point, but I repeat that if the company is doing the best that it can, it will not ordinarily fail the commerciality test. For a company to fail the commerciality test, it would have to be structured in such a way and carry on its business in such a way as to create an expectation that it would permanently make a loss.
<P>
I have explained several times that there is no substance to the hon. Gentleman's comments on the commerciality test, although I appreciate that he is trying to make them in a serious way. The wording is the same, and the rules that apply to it will be the same as previously. That assurance is clearly reflected in the Bill. The hon. Gentleman need no longer concern himself with it.

<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> The Paymaster General appeared to set my mind at rest, then snatched the prize away. He said that the test would be whether a company or a person had entered into a business with no foreseeable prospect of making profits. I put it to the Paymaster General that it is quite possible that someone with an ordinary schedule D business who lets a single property may enter into that schedule A business venture with no prospect of ever making a profit, yet it would be a genuine commercial transaction because the business man was trying to mitigate a loss that he would otherwise incur.
