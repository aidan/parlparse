<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080701129000361"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> Here we are dealing with an old bugbear
regarding schooling and the relationship of children in care to their
teachers. Many of us have said for some time that there are two main
groups of children for whom special provisions need to be made, aside
from those who have learning disabilities and obvious requirements like
that, and they are children in the care system and young carers. The
hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole and I have slaved our way
down to the Southampton to the annual young carers festival for some
time.</div>
<a name="080701129000035"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080701129000362"></a>Kevin
Brennan:</b> While the hon. Gentleman is on that point he
might like to know that last Saturday I went as
well.</div>
<a name="080701129000036"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080701129000363"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> We were delighted to hear that because, as we
have pointed out, we had not had a Labour Minister or MP down there for
some time&#151;I am not trying to be critical&#151;although we used
to when the hon. Member and the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North
Poole I started doing the MPs&#146; question time at the
children&#146;s request. It was great to hear. I am sure that the
Under-Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families, the hon.
Member for Cardiff, West was appreciated and that he enjoyed it as well
because it is always extraordinary. That is entirely out of order,
Mr. Williams, because it is not the question in
hand.</div><a name="080701129000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are two groups of pupils for whom special attention and recognition by
a key member of staff is essential. The group germane to the Bill are
looked-after children. Clause 20 includes designating a member of staff
to be the key link for looked-after children. My problem is that
subsection (1) refers only
to</div><a name="080701129000306"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a
member of the staff at the
school&#148;</div><a name="080701129000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">being
the designated person. The intention and direction of the clause is
right but it is not good enough because the designated person could be
a school caretaker, a games assistant or somebody like
that&#151;perfectly worthy individuals though they may be. To take
the problems seriously, we think that a properly qualified member of
the teaching staff must become the designated person. It needs to be
somebody who understands the educational requirements of that child,
who can communicate with other teachers, the head teacher and governors
on an equal basis and who has
authority.</div><a name="080701129000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">Children
in the care system obviously have particular educational needs. As we
have heard from the statistics that have been bandied about, they are
much more likely to do badly at school, not least because of the lack
of continuity in their education. There are also problems with the
image of looked-after children&#146;s poor achievement and outcomes,
so some schools would prefer not to have them because it may bring down
their averages. Those are considerations that looked-after children
have to face. It is therefore absolutely right that special provisions
be made by a school to ensure that the special needs of looked-after
children are recognised and taken on board at the highest level within
those
schools.</div><a name="080701129000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
may mean that the school must chase the responsible social worker, if
that responsible social worker is not performing the role of a
&#147;pushy parent&#148; that I would like to see them play. A
child who happens to be in the care system is entitled to no lesser
degree of attention from the responsible person or body, which could be
a social worker, as he or she would get from a responsible 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column151" />Column number: 151</div>parent. That could mean turning up to parents
evenings demanding to know why the child is lagging behind, for
example, or expressing concerns about bullying or liaising with the
school on a whole host of matters. Clearly, because of the pressures on
social workers, which we have previously discussed, a social worker may
not be in a position to play as active a role in overseeing a
child&#146;s education as one might like.</div>
<a name="080701129000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have
mentioned innovative authorities such as Barnet that have introduced a
buddy system, whereby an officer of the authority will buddy up with a
looked-after child. One of their roles will be to look at their school
report and to monitor their educational progress and, if necessary,
ring up the school and say &#147;What is going wrong here?&#148; It
would be helpful if there is a designated teacher who will be their
first point of call, be that for a social worker or an extended family
member whom one wants to encourage to have an interest in the
child&#146;s progress.</div>
<a name="080701129000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">Therefore,
the clause is to be welcomed, but it needs to be beefed up, hence
amendment No. 17 states that a member of the teaching staff must be the
designated person. However, the amendment goes further: the second part
of it would provide for a responsible governor. The measure applies to
young carers and many of us have argued for it before. Recognising the
teacher so that they feel that they have the clout to argue the case
for looked-after children would be greatly improved and enhanced by
introducing a separate, responsible governor, someone other than the
teacher&#151;as it stands the designated person could be the teaching
representative on the governing body&#151;to oversee the provisions
for looked-after children. They would be the line manager, as it were,
for the designated teacher. That would send out a clear signal to
schools that the special requirements of looked-after children, which
result from the fact that educational outcomes for looked-after
children have been a scandal for too many years, are a priority and
that schools need to have a structure in place that can cope with that
and make it a reality. Amendment No. 17 would ensure that a properly
qualified teacher, in partnership with a governor, are directly
responsible for overseeing the fortunes of children in the care system
who attend their schools.</div>
<a name="080701129000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 18 specifies that there should also be a responsibility for both
those individuals to report</div>
<a name="080701129000307"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
educational progress to the foster carer or other appropriate
carer&#148;.</div><a name="080701129000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another
flaw in the system is that, too often, it is difficult to get
information out of the school on how a child is actually doing,
particularly foster carers. If a foster carer is doing his or her job
properly, as the vast majority of them fortunately do, and if we expect
a foster carer to be as close to a natural parent as possible and to
play the role of a birth parent, which could include being a
&#147;pushy parent&#148; when it comes to asking questions about
whether a child is doing well at school, we should ensure that they
automatically have an entitlement to know about the performance of the
child at school, receive reports and hold a conversation with the
relevant teachers or whoever on an established basis, so that they are
fully informed about the child&#146;s school progress. They will then
be able to ask all the right questions. At the moment that does not
happen in many
cases.</div><a name="080701129000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
Nos. 17 and 18 would require that there be designated teachers who know
about the requirements of looked-after children, a governor to oversee
that and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column152" />Column number: 152</div>that foster carers should have access to educational information about
the child. They would then be able to ensure that they were doing well
and ask the right questions if they were not. Such requirements would
add some real beef to the well intentioned clause. They would make its
provisions a reality rather than the wish list that they might become.
I have some sympathy for the amendments that are being advocated by the
Liberal Democrats in a similar vein. On that basis, I commend
amendments Nos. 17 and 18 to the
Committee.</div><a name="080701129000046"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="080701129000364"></a><b class="B">Angela
Watkinson</b> (Upminster) (Con): I wish to speak briefly in
support of amendments Nos. 17 and 18. The two secondary schools for
which I am governor have extremely good pastoral care departments. I
have asked a number of head teachers in my constituency how many
looked-after children they have on their rolls. Most of them said none,
but they did not say they did not know. I am assuming that there is a
very good process between social services and education departments so
that schools are always aware if they have looked-after children on
their
rolls.</div><a name="080701129000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is important that somebody is available for a looked-after child. When
they arrive in school, they are more likely to be having a crisis day
than the average pupil. There are more opportunities for stress and
more things that will concern them. If only one teacher is designated
to be a friend, adviser and mentor to a looked-after child, it is not
possible for them to be available at every moment. It is not possible
for them to be available when the child arrives in school every
morning. If two teachers are designated, it is more likely that
somebody will be available to take control of a crisis. If a governor
is also designated, although they are in school only from time to time,
there is an extra option for that
child.</div><a name="080701129000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is important that children have an adult to whom they can relate.
Personality and character come into that. If they relate to one of the
three designated people and feel more comfortable opening up and
disclosing personal problems to them, they are likely to disclose more
than if only one of the other designated people was available. It is
therefore a very good idea that there be two or even three people
available to a looked-after child if they are having a bad day or if
there is an ongoing problem that the school needs to be aware
of.</div><a name="080701129000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 18 includes reporting educational progress. With most children,
parents will come to the school on parents&#146; evening, which is an
annual occasion. If they have problems in between those events, they
will get in contact with the class teacher or the head teacher. With
looked-after children, there is more potential for social problems that
could affect their educational progress so more frequent access to the
school is a huge advantage. More frequent access to school, more
discussion and more reporting on their educational progress could head
off other social problems that are brewing up in the background that
adults are not aware
of.</div><a name="080701129000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
understanding is that the number of such pupils in any one school will
be very small so this will not be an onerous task in addition to the
great number of functions that teachers have to perform. Most of my
schools had good pastoral care departments and would be only too
pleased to take on this role. It will be hugely advantageous to the
looked-after children in our schools. It will not only maximise their
aspiration and their ambition to succeed, and give them the best
possible future and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column153" />Column number: 153</div>opportunities for training, further education and a
productive career, it will safeguard their emotional
well-being.</div>
<a name="080701129000051"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="080701129000365"></a><b class="B">Mark
Williams</b> (Ceredigion) (LD): I very much want to endorse
what the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham said and the
practical case studies highlighted by the hon. Member for Upminster.
The first point I want to make concerns clarity. I welcome the thrust
of the clause, but, as has already been said, does it go far enough? On
Second Reading, the Minister for Children, Young People and Families,
the right hon. Member for Stretford and Urmston
said:</div><a name="080701129000308"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Clause
20 will make sure that there is a designated teacher in every school to
give children in care the encouragement and personal support they need
to realise their talents.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report</i>, 16
June 2008; Vol. 477, c.
727.]</div><a name="080701129000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">Yet,
here we are talking about a designated member of staff. That could be
the caretaker, a games assistant and a range of individuals who work
within the school community. Amendment Nos. 17 and 28 specify that it
must be a member of the teaching staff or a qualified teacher. That is
essential because it gives status to looked-after children. It is also
about the practicalities of delivering those expectations of
educational achievement and the needs of pastoral care, the
child&#146;s well-being, which amendment No. 29 seeks to
pursue.</div>
<a name="080701129000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 29 seeks to build into the Bill the obvious point about holistic
care and support for looked-after children. The Barnardo&#146;s 2006
report, &#147;Failed By The System&#148;, revealed that 79 per
cent. of young people who have been in care have no GCSEs or other
educational qualifications when they leave school. But academic
achievement and pastoral needs within the school community go hand in
hand. One cannot separate the two.</div>
<a name="080701129000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">Half of the
young people in the Barnardo&#146;s survey revealed that they had
been bullied. Half the group had attended six or more schools; 11 per
cent had attended more than 10 schools; 39 per cent. said that no one
had attended a school parents&#146; evening; 48 per cent. said that
nobody attended their sports days or school events. Educational
achievement and self esteem go hand in hand. With the visitor
provisions we talked about this morning, with a designated teacher
clearly undertaking that pastoral role and with a link to foster
carers, social workers or whoever, we can meet some of those
challenges. If we get to the root of the self esteem issue
educationally, we can move on and tackle many of the educational
challenges.</div><a name="080701129000055"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="080701129000366"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Edward Timpson</b> (Crewe and Nantwich) (Con): I agree with
everything that has just been said. It is important to emphasise that
the partial aspect of the care plays a significant role in the general
well-being of looked-after children within educational establishments.
Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the designated teacher also has the
responsibility to ensure that the mental and behavioural well-being of
the child in the school is part of their training? A growing number of
looked-after children unfortunately suffer from an attachment disorder.
Teachers should be aware of that and be trained to ensure that when
they are dealing with each individual child they can assess those needs
and feed that into their pastoral care. That will then improve their
educational outcomes.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080701129000367"></a>Mark
Williams:</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman. I very much agree.
As someone who endured a one-year course for a postgraduate certificate
in education, I can testify to the limitations of teacher training in
all areas of special needs and some of the behavioural problems that he
has
identified.</div><a name="080701129000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hesitate to use the phrase &#147;narrow educational
achievement&#148;, but I do not want the well-being of the child to
be lost in a welter of percentages and academic targets. They go
together. It should also be said that the needs of looked-after
children are not always special educational needs. Yes, 28 per cent. of
looked-after children have SEN statements, compared to 3 per cent. of
the population, but we should not automatically assume, as the hon.
Member for Buckingham (John Bercow) said on Second Reading, that the
SENCO should necessarily assume the role of a co-ordinator for
looked-after
children.</div><a name="080701129000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
pay tribute to the fact that the Bill wisely mentions, under clause
20(3), that the governing body will ensure that the designated
person&#151;a teacher, I hope&#151;has qualifications and
experience, a point made by the hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich. If
that role is to be effective, it requires a full awareness of the
child&#146;s background and circumstances as well as the operation of
the care system. As a novice to these Committee proceedings, I find
that the matter involves a welter of information of which I suspect
many teachers are unaware, but which they need to be aware of when
working with such children.</div>
<a name="080701129000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 30, in line with the provisions on SENCOs and special needs
governors, would give looked-after children the same status by making a
governor responsible for them. It is a chain of responsibilities: the
teacher is responsible and accountable to the governor, and the
governor is also equipped with appropriate training and advice.
Although our names are not on amendment No. 18, I support its spirit.
It is an acknowledgement that educational achievement cannot be viewed
just within the confines of the classroom; it must be extended to the
home environment and the person charged with care.</div>
<a name="080701129000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for East Worthing and Shoreham raised the spectre of schools
summoning social workers to hear about the educational progress or
problems of particular children. It is important. Many of us have sat
through countless special educational needs consultations with parents
who refused to turn up, wishing that we had the capacity to bring them
in. The amendment is laudable. It would build dialogue between carers
and the children in
school.</div><a name="080701129000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">Above
all else, the amendments are not about giving another member of staff
or a governor a meaningless title. They are about acknowledging the
needs of 60,000 children and young people and giving the school
community the structure to support them educationally
and&#151;critically&#151;pastorally, so that their educational and
social entitlements can be met.</div>
<a name="080701129000062"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="080701129000368"></a><b class="B">Annette
Brooke</b> (Mid-Dorset and North Poole) (LD): I shall be
brief, as my hon. Friend and other hon. Members have made clear points.
I refer to the situation discovered by the Education Select Committee.
In some schools, SENCOs were teaching assistants. The Education and
Inspections Act 2006 or resulting regulations stated 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column155" />Column number: 155</div>that SENCOs should be qualified teachers;
personally, I feel that they should also be members of the senior
management
team.</div><a name="080701129000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is important that we understand why the Bill does not say &#147;a
member of the teaching staff&#148;. I suspect that there is a reason
for that, but it is important to understand why. I want particularly to
specify that it should be a fully qualified teacher. As my hon. Friend
explained, it is such an important job. It involves a mix of guiding
through academic routes and trying to improve academic
performance, but it also involves looking after the welfare of the
child and addressing the various other needs that must be addressed
before academic achievement can be
attained.</div><a name="080701129000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall refer briefly to some good practice in Dorset. I attended a
Dorset awards day for foster carers and children a couple of weeks ago
at which I was involved in presenting certificates. It demonstrated a
close working between the teachers in school, the local authority and
foster carers. The latter were there with the children, and the
certificates that I handed out were varied. One was for 100
per cent. attendance at the learning support centre. Another was for
100 per cent. attendance over the previous term. Some were for academic
achievements in their GCSEs; others were for behaving well at home and
helping around the house. It was a complete mix, but awarding and
celebrating progress in the lives of those foster children
brought all the services together quite beautifully and skilfully. A
good day was had by all, as the rest of the day was a fun day with lots
of entertainment. I mention that practice because it is worthy of being
adapted by other local authorities.</div>
<a name="080701129000065"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080701129000369"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b><b class="B"> </b>We are heaping praise on Dorset. I seem
to recall that Dorset piloted the giving of bursaries to children in
the care system for particular education-related studies&#151;for
instance, more music lessons. That gave the authority control over its
budget that it would not normally have had to allow pupils to pursue a
subject in which they showed artistic, musical or educational promise.
That was another example of good practice by
Dorset.</div>
<a name="080701129000066"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080701129000370"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> I was very pleased that Dorset was selected for
the 18-to-21 pilots. It is obviously is good practice, and we should
share it whenever we can. I support all the
amendments.</div><a name="080701129000067"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080701129000371"></a>Kevin
Brennan:</b> I agree with the hon. Lady on the importance of
having fun days, with lots of entertainment &#151;which is obviously
what we are having today.</div>
<a name="080701129000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
intention behind this small flourish of amendments to clause 20 is to
ensure that the role of the designated person specified for children in
a maintained school has the maximum impact. I sympathise with that
intention. We should consider our history in trying to improve
educational outcomes for looked-after children when discussing the
amendments.</div>
<a name="080701129000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
goes back to the Quality Protects initiative of 1998, which started our
focus on improving the educational outcomes for looked-after children
both locally and nationally. We know much more about the subject than
we did before introducing the national data collection in 2000. Before
that, no one even checked to see how they were doing in
school.</div>
<a name="080701129000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall be
confessional for a moment. I have said publicly that during my
career&#151;I was in the teaching 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column156" />Column number: 156</div>profession until 1994&#151;my awareness of those children that might
have had looked-after status in the classroom and the school was
minimal. There was none of the focus that has rightly been introduced
over the past few years, which has led to an improvement in outcomes.
However, I think that we would all agree that that still is not good
enough.</div>
<a name="080701129000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">At first, we
found that only 7 per cent. of looked-after children achieved five good
GCSEs; by 2006, that figure had increased to 13 per cent. However, we
should not exaggerate. The hon. Member for Ceredigion suggested that 79
per cent. of looked-after children had no GCSEs, but that is not quite
true. In 2000, 49 per cent. had one GCSE, and the figure rose to 64 per
cent. by 2007. Again, it is not good enough, but we should not
exaggerate the problem.</div>
<a name="080701129000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the
Children Act 2004, we introduced a duty for local authorities to
promote the educational achievement of looked-after children. Building
on that duty, as part of the &#147;Care Matters&#148; agenda, we
are introducing an annual personal education allowance of &#163;500
for all looked-after children who are at risk of not reaching the
nationally expected standards of attainment. It is intended to meet the
costs of the sort of activities or resources needed to support
looked-after children&#146;s learning and development, in the same
way that a good parent would seek to enrich their child&#146;s
education by making extra things
available.</div><a name="080701129000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
it stands, subsection (1) requires the governing body of a maintained
school to designate a member of staff as having a particular role
in</div>
<a name="080701129000309"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;promoting the
educational achievement of registered pupils ...who...are
looked after by a local
authority&#148;.</div><a name="080701129000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
take the point made by the hon. Member for Upminster about having a
significant adult in school whom a young person can turn to, but that
will not necessarily be the designated teacher for looked-after
children. It might be a trusted subject teacher or form teacher.
Specifically, the designated teacher&#146;s job is to promote the
educational achievement of registered pupils who are looked after by
the local
authority.</div><a name="080701129000327"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.30
pm</div><a name="080701129000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
the hon. Lady said, most schools have a small number of looked-after
children on their roll, but we know that when there is someone in the
school whose job it is to champion the educational needs of
looked-after children, that can have a real impact on individual
outcomes. Most schools already have a designated teacher for
looked-after children, in line with the current good practice guidance,
but although we have come quite a long way in raising awareness in
schools of the needs of looked-after children, not all schools make
specific provision for their
needs.</div><a name="080701129000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Ceredigion was right to point out that we should not
assume that all looked-after children have special educational needs. I
met a young man in Birmingham who told me that he never told anyone
that he was in care until quite some time into the acquaintance because
he felt that he would be judged immediately in exactly that fashion
when in fact he fully intended&#151;and I completely believed
him&#151;to qualify as a doctor in the next few years and was
obviously a very bright and academically able young man. As the hon.
Gentleman said, we should not make such assumptions.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column157" />Column number: 157</div><a name="080701129000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
because schools do not always make specific provision, it came out
quite clearly in the &#147;Care Matters&#148; consultation that we
need to take action to put the requirement on a statutory footing and
to make it a requirement for all governing bodies of all maintained
schools to appoint a designated teacher to ensure that the role is
given the status and recognition that it deserves. I say
&#147;teacher&#148; because the intention is&#151;I have said
this publicly previously&#151;that it should be a teacher. I shall
say more about that in a moment. This is a very effective way
significantly to improve educational outcomes for looked-after
children. We will use the regulation-making power in subsection (3) to
require the governing body to ensure that the designated person has the
necessary qualifications and experience&#151;in particular, qualified
teacher status. There may be examples, which I shall come to, in which
that does not necessarily need to be the case, but it will be the
norm.</div><a name="080701129000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
addition, we will issue statutory guidance to governing bodies, setting
out in some detail the role and responsibilities of the designated
teacher. I am referring to the role of the designated teacher in
assessing the child&#146;s educational needs and in making
arrangements for co-operating with the local authority, especially in
relation to the development of the child&#146;s personal education
plan. Guidance will also stress the sorts of administrative task that
could be undertaken by non-teaching staff acting in support, as well as
the importance of ensuring that the school&#146;s policy on pastoral
care is effective for looked-after
children.</div><a name="080701129000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under
amendments Nos. 18 and 30, a designated governor would be appointed to
promote the educational achievement of looked-after children. That
would be in addition to the designated teacher. The amendments would
also ensure that the governor had the necessary information to
discharge that role effectively. I agree with the hon. Members for East
Worthing and Shoreham and for Upminster about the significant role that
school governors can and should play. It is right that they pay proper
attention to promoting the educational achievement of looked-after
children on their roll, and certainly governors and staff need to
understand that school can often be a particular haven of consistency
and continuity in the lives of looked-after children. That has
implications for the way in which schools work to support their
educational
achievement.</div><a name="080701129000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
clause 20, supported by the appropriate statutory guidance, will ensure
that that happens and, indeed, will make it clear that the governing
body should expect to receive a regular report on the work of the
designated teacher and on outcomes for looked-after children who are
pupils at the school. Governing bodies have a legal duty to promote
high standards of educational achievement and well-being for all pupils
at the school, including looked-after children. The governing
body&#146;s role is and should be essentially a strategic one. Of
course, there is nothing to prevent a governing body from identifying a
link governor to lead on issues relating to looked-after children, but
the governing body overall remains responsible for any decisions taken.
We will make that absolutely clear when we issue governing bodies with
statutory guidance on the role and responsibilities of the designated
teacher.</div>
<a name="080701129000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
encouraging that awareness among school governors of the needs of
looked-after children has increased significantly in recent years. We
are committed to ensuring that school governors are provided with
training to help 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column158" />Column number: 158</div>them understand the needs of looked-after child and
effectively hold schools to account. We expect to use the statutory
guidance on the role and responsibilities of the designated teacher to
set out clearly what governors need to put in place.</div>
<a name="080701129000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">The guidance
will build on that produced in 2005 by the former Department for
Education and Skills, in partnership with the Who Cares? Trust and the
Advisory Centre for Education. The 2005 guidance, which was called
&#147;Supporting Looked After Learners&#151;A Practical Guide for
School Governors&#148;, was designed to help individual governors
gain an understanding of the experiences of looked-after children in
schools and of the challenges that they need to overcome if they are to
succeed.</div>
<a name="080701129000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 18 seeks to ensure that foster carers and others who care for
looked-after children are informed of their educational progress. It
goes without saying that it is vital that those who are responsible for
a looked-after child&#151;whether as a foster carer or in a
residential setting&#151;receive regular and comprehensive
information about the child&#146;s educational progress. Indeed, we
would expect all those who are responsible for the care of a
looked-after child to help them meet their full potential. For a number
of reasons, however, amendment No. 18 is not necessary to achieve that
aim.</div>
<a name="080701129000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under the
Education (Pupil Information) (England) Regulations 2005, schools are
already required to provide an annual report to the parent of every
child who is a registered pupil at the school, and that includes
looked-after children. For the purposes of education law, a parent
includes anyone who has parental responsibility or who has care of the
child. That includes foster carers and a child&#146;s key residential
worker in a children&#146;s home. Schedule 1 of the regulations
clearly lists what information the report should contain, including
brief particulars of achievements in all subjects and activities that
form part of the school curriculum, plus comments on the child&#146;s
general progress and details of the arrangements for discussing their
reports with their teacher.</div>
<a name="080701129000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
intention behind the duty that clause 20 places on the governing body
is very precise. The governing body must appoint a designated person
whose specific role it will be to promote the educational achievement
of registered pupils at the school who are looked after by a local
authority. A key aspect of that role will be to ensure that the school
works closely with the child&#146;s carers and the local authority,
which will also have a particular duty to promote the child&#146;s
educational achievement, as I said.</div>
<a name="080701129000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I
indicated, we will issue statutory guidance to governing bodies setting
out in detail what we expect the designated teacher to do to promote
the educational achievement of looked-after children at their school.
Among other things, the guidance will cover helping the child&#146;s
carers to get involved in supporting the child&#146;s education,
regularly assessing the child&#146;s progress, identifying any
additional needs and participating in the development of the
child&#146;s personal education plan and in the regular six-monthly
reviews of that plan.</div>
<a name="080701129000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">The personal
education plan forms part of the child&#146;s care plan, and we have
made it clear in statutory guidance that social workers should fully
involve the child&#146;s carers and, where appropriate, their parents
in drawing up the child&#146;s personal education plan. Social
workers should also work in partnership with the designated teacher to
ensure that the plan sets clear objectives and targets and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column159" />Column number: 159</div>clearly identifies the additional support that the
child will need to achieve those targets. The regulations that apply to
the regular reviews of the child&#146;s case require the
child&#146;s educational needs, progress and development to be
considered at the six-monthly review. Through statutory guidance, we
make it clear that the child&#146;s carers should be involved in that
review in addition to the child&#146;s parents.</div>
<a name="080701129000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 28 makes provision for the designated person to be a qualified
teacher. We would not disagree with that; indeed we made that intention
clear in the &#147;Care Matters&#148; White Paper and in debate on
similar amendments in the other place. Although I understand the
reasons for wanting to ensure that the role of the designated person is
performed by a teacher, the best way of dealing with the issue is to
set out in regulations precisely who is qualified for the job. In most
cases, we would expect the role to be filled by a teacher with
qualified teacher status, but there might be some exceptions to that.
Some teachers can practise without qualified teacher status, such as
overseas-trained teachers, as members of the Committee will know. Of
course, there are also those who started their careers before the
current training requirements came into force.</div>
<a name="080701129000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">The key
point is that it is better to specify that in regulation, rather than
doing so rigidly through primary legislation, because that will allow
for changes to be made more easily in line with changes in teacher
training without the need for further primary legislation. To have the
necessary flexibility, it is much better that that is done through
regulation. The power to prescribe qualifications through legislation
will enable us to update the qualifications of the designated person,
if there is any change in the framework of teacher qualifications,
without the delay of amending primary
legislation.</div><a name="080701129000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 29 would make the designated person responsible for promoting the
well-being of looked-after children and championing their educational
achievement. On Second Reading, the hon. Members for Mid-Dorset and
North Poole and for Ceredigion spoke about the need to ensure that the
designated teacher takes sufficient account of pastoral needs as well
as academic achievement. Again, we do not disagree that an holistic
approach is required. The designated teacher should discharge his or
her responsibilities for looked-after children registered in the school
in that holistic way, but the amendment is not needed for that to be
achieved. The Education and Inspections Act 2006 already places the
governing body of a maintained school under a duty to promote the
well-being of all pupils in a school, including looked-after children,
and that is in addition to their duty under the Education Act 2002 to
ensure that they promote the welfare of all the children on their roll.
Since 2005, Ofsted has been under a duty to report on the contribution
that schools make to their pupils&#146; well-being. The well-being
duty on schools ensures that they focus specifically on the five
&#147;Every Child Matters&#148; outcomes, as defined in section 10
of the Children Act 2004&#151;I will not go into the detail because I
know that members of the Committee are familiar with them.</div>
<a name="080701129000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
designated teacher will therefore have an important role in championing
the well-being of looked-after children and raising awareness of their
particular needs. We want the primary focus of that role to be on
raising expectations about teaching and learning
for looked-after children and supporting them to achieve their full
potential. Given the significant attainment gap between looked-after 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column160" />Column number: 160</div>children and children generally, which we all
know about, we need make no apology for having that at the
forefront I hope that
I have offered reassurance on how seriously we take the role of
designated teachers and of school governors in ensuring that
looked-after children have the support that they need to reach their
potential. I hope that hon. Members will, on that basis, feel that they
can withdraw their
amendments.</div><a name="080701129000093"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080701129000372"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> I am a bit disappointed, which I have not been
much in the Committee so far. The Minister seems to be moving into a
position in which it would be easy for him to accept at least one of
the amendments in this small flourish of amendments, as he described it
earlier. He made all the right noises and pointed to the problems with
the educational achievement gap, which we all know about and which has
been widening. He pointed out that the 7 per cent. achievement on the
O-level criteria has improved to around 12 or 13 per cent.
The achievement by children who are not in care has improved rather
more, so that last year the gap worsened. Children in care are being
left behind, and more so than their cohort as a whole. That is also an
important consideration for children in care, because some 80 per cent.
of the 61,000 children in the care system in England and Wales are of
school
age.</div><a name="080701129000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
goes to the heart of what is essential for improving conditions for
looked-after children in the education system. It was not therefore a
surprise to me that the Minister agreed with everything that we said.
He also said that the Government will set out in guidance the role of
the designated teacher&#151;I think that he said
&#147;teacher&#148; and not &#147;member of staff&#148;. He
agreed with the significant role of governors in promoting educational
achievement, and said that that there would be regular reports to
governors. Everything he said seemed to agree with what we had said,
but then he ruined it by saying that the amendments were not necessary
because the issues could be set down in guidance. Clearly, the Minister
has got confused as to what is a designated member of staff and what is
a designated teacher; he slipped seamlessly from one term to the other,
without realising that the Bill does not say &#147;designated
teacher&#148;. I could not find in any of his comments any downside
to putting &#147;designated teacher&#148; rather than
&#147;designated member of staff&#148; in the Bill. He gave lots of
good reasons why the amendments were well intentioned and appropriate,
and no good reasons why the Committee should not adopt them, at least
those relating to a designated teacher and a designated
governor.</div><a name="080701129000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Ceredigion made some good points in support of his
amendment, which is based on the same principle as the amendments in my
name and those of my hon. Friends. He showed from his experience how
much more attention needs to be given to the issue by teaching staff.
As he said, it is not a question of meaningless
titles, but of proper titles being given to the right people along with
the right tools to do the job, backed up in statute. That is what the
amendment is about. He quoted my hon. Friend the
Member for 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column161" />Column number: 161</div>Buckingham, who said that this should not be another
job that gets piled automatically on the SENCO&#151;the general
repository of all things slightly odd. The job needs to be done by
somebody who is focused on looked-after children and who has the
appropriate training, overseen by the governors. There will also be a
governor with the responsibility of ensuring that that training has
taken place, and that reports on the progress of looked-after children
and the school&#146;s policy towards such children are discussed at
governors&#146; meetings, that they are not just another little box
that you have to get around to ticking. The hon. Gentleman rightly says
that the governing body is responsible for overseeing that, but it
would be so much better if there was a designated governor who was
responsible for ensuring that the governing body was doing everything
that it should be&#151;not just the minimum&#151;to ensure that the
policy was implemented. It is not the designated teacher who will be
responsible for that, but the head and the senior staff severally, on
the same basis that it will be the governing body jointly and
severally. Again, I could not see a downside to a designated governor
in what the Minister
said.</div><a name="080701129000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
take the Minister&#146;s point that the information that I called for
should, under the Education (Pupil Information) (England) Regulations
2005, be made available to every person with parental responsibility
for a child. He gave a satisfactory answer on that matter, and also
regarding amendment No. 30 on promoting well-being, in that that is
catered for elsewhere. The Minister did not make a case for why having
a designated teacher and a designated governor would in any way damage
the Bill or hamper&#151;beyond what is intended by forthcoming
regulations&#151;the role of the school in doing what we want it to
do. On that basis and to ensure that the Committee is awake, I will
push the amendment to a vote. I ask the Committee to support the lead
amendment, which is about having a designated teacher and a designated
governor.</div><a name="080701129000097"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

amendment No. 32, in

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080701129000389"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> I had better say at the outset that this is a
probing amendment because I rather suspect that I have applied my
thoughts to the wrong clause. However, I hope that the Minister will
accept the argument that I put forward even if the amendment is tabled
in a highly technically inefficient
way.</div><a name="080701129000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment is about parity of treatment for care leavers in their future
education. I welcome the support that is offered in the clause to
previously looked-after people who decide to go to university.
Ministers have pointed out that only 6 per cent. of looked-after
children go on to university. There is a massive discrepancy between
that figure and that for the rest of the population. I therefore
appreciate the bursary. However, it is also important to appreciate
that 30 per cent. of care leavers aged 19 are not in education,
employment or training. While the gap is not quite as large as with the
university figure, it is still highly significant that a third of care
leavers are not in education, employment or training. When the
Children, Schools and Families Committee looked at this issue, it
recommended that a broader bursary system be introduced for
looked-after children in post-16 education and
training.</div><a name="080701129000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
recognise that the Government are putting forward support in clause 22
in the way of a personal adviser in certain circumstances. The
Government have responded in other arenas by saying that they have
measures to support young people who are not in education, employment
or training, such as by not charging fees for courses. If we want to
ensure that we put as much emphasis on carrying on in training as on
going to university, we must give a little more financial assistance to
care leavers. I have deliberately included apprenticeships in the
amendment because that could be an area where just that little bit of
extra support is
needed.</div><a name="080701129000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that the Minister will respond to the general principle rather
than the adequacy of the amendment and say why there should not be more
assistance for the important proportion of care leavers who are not in
education, employment or training and will not immediately take a
university route, but who need support at this vital
time.</div><a name="080701129000122"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080701129000390"></a>Kevin
Brennan:</b> The hon. Lady is as candid as ever in her
charming way on the amendments. I will try to answer in the spirit in
which she has invited me to respond. &#147;Care Matters&#148; set
out an ambitious and wide-ranging programme of work to support the
education and training of looked-after children and to ensure that they
are supported in making a successful transition into adult life.
Ensuring that they are able to pursue their chosen path post-18 depends
on high quality support earlier on. To ensure that they have the best
quality education possible, we have given them the highest priority in
school admissions, we have put the role of the designated
teacher&#151;I am happy to say that again on the record&#151;for
looked-after children on a statutory footing, we have introduced an
annual personal allowance of up to &#163;500 for looked-after
children at risk of not reaching the expected national targets and we
are changing the way that local authorities support the education of
looked-after children by piloting virtual school heads. There are
therefore a lot of initiatives.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column163" />Column number: 163</div><a name="080701129000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">Support to
enable looked-after children and care leavers to thrive in education
goes wider than schools, as the hon. Lady said. That is why we have had
the right to be cared for pilots, which give looked-after children
greater involvement in deciding when they move to independence.
Similarly, as we debated earlier, the &#147;Staying Put&#148;
18-plus family placement pilots give young adults the chance to remain
with their former foster carers post-18 to provide additional
stability.</div><a name="080701129000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
will come to provisions of the Bill that extend the entitlement to a
personal adviser up to the age of 25 for all care leavers in education
or training, or who want to return to education or training. That will
be defined in the widest possible way. Access to a personal adviser
will mean that care leavers have access to a pathway plan to set out
their education and training needs and how they will be met. The
support of the local authority will enable them to meet their
ambitions.</div><a name="080701129000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are committed across the piece to enable all care leavers, not just
those going to university, to make the choices about education and
training that are right for them, as we are for all young people.
Leaving care services should ensure that young people are supported in
the choices that they make and should help them to maximise the
assistance that is available to support their learning, particularly
through the provision of the personal adviser and the maintenance of
the pathway
plan.</div><a name="080701129000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government have also introduced a range of other support to help young
people entering education, including care leavers. It includes fee
remission and help with other costs, such as books and travel, for all
young people. Tuition costs for first level 2 or 3 qualifications will
be met in full for all young people up to the age of 25. Financial help
is available through adult learning grants, and learner support is
offered based on the needs of the individual. Priority is given to the
most disadvantaged, and those in care are identified as one of the
priority groups for that learner support. In addition, where a former
relevant child is in full-time further or higher education, sections
23C and 24B of the Children Act 1989 enable local authorities to
provide suitable accommodation during the vacation or pay the young
person enough to enable them to secure their own
accommodation.</div><a name="080701129000328"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5
pm</div><a name="080701129000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
understand and appreciate the hon. Lady&#146;s concerns and the
sentiment behind the amendments. I hope that the Committee will
understand that the Government are committed to providing support for
care leavers in a range of education and training, but we must also
recognise the situation regarding care leavers&#146; access to higher
education. Only 6 per cent. of care leavers aged 19, as the hon. Lady
said, are in higher education, and that figure has remained largely
unchanged for a number of years. I think that we would all agree that
that is not
acceptable.</div><a name="080701129000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
work undertaken on the &#147;Care Matters&#148; Green and White
Papers revealed clear evidence that looked-after children face
significant additional barriers to higher education. For example, they
finish higher education with an average of &#163;2,000 more debt than
their peers. During the consultation, children and young people said
that many care leavers are put off higher education by the belief that
they will not be able to meet the additional costs involved. Some 83
per cent. of young 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column164" />Column number: 164</div>people at consultation events for the National Children&#146;s Bureau
&#147;What Makes the Difference?&#148; Green Paper thought that the
&#163;2,000 bursary for higher education was a very good idea, and I
am sure that Committee members agree. Some 73 per cent. thought that it
would encourage more young people in care to go on to higher
education.</div><a name="080701129000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although
I understand the hon. Lady&#146;s motivation, I hope that she will
accept my reassurance that we are committed to supporting care leavers
in further education and training, including apprenticeships; and that
that she will recognise that the clause acknowledges the unique
position of care leavers who enter higher education. The evidence is
clear about the specific support that they need to encourage them to
take up higher education without incurring additional debt. I hope that
she will agree to withdraw her amendment and support the
clause.</div><a name="080701129000130"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080701129000391"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> I certainly support the clause. It is important. I
am, of course, rather disappointed by the Minister&#146;s reply,
because it is important to identify additional areas where care leavers
need support. I appreciate the point about the personal adviser. We
hope that the many measures to support young people as they go through
school will help to improve the situation, and that the percentage of
looked-after children who are not in education, employment or training
will be monitored. With that comment, I beg to ask leave to withdraw
the
amendment.</div><a name="080701129000131"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080701129000392"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b><b class="B"> </b>I wish to ask the Minister a few questions
about the clause. In previous discussions, some of us have voiced our
concern that kinship care is not always given enough cash support when
it is most needed. The clause is important because it opens the door to
more payments. The problem is that I can see that there will be great
variation in local authorities&#146; use of the removal from section
17(6) of the 1989 Act of &#147;in exceptional circumstances&#148;.
I would be worried if there were to be no regulations and guidance on
the provision, to ensure that we are truly promoting kinship
care.</div><a name="080701129000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
seem to hear more and more from professionals that there are barriers
to kinship care because money is not available at the vital time.
Although I appreciate that the clause offers more, I would like an
assurance that it will make a difference and will support what
everybody wants, which is that that where kinship care is appropriate,
it is given every support and encouragement
possible.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080701129000393"></a>The
Minister for Children, Young People and Families (Beverley
Hughes):</b> I thank the hon. Lady for that question. She is
right: the intention in clarifying the provision is to alleviate local
authorities&#146; confusion about how much flexibility they have in
providing financial 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column165" />Column number: 165</div>support to promote children&#146;s welfare and
their upbringing by members of their family or friends. It is important
to say that that does not mean that local authorities can be expected
to provide income maintenance for families&#151;I made that point
earlier in our discussions. It is important that the lines are clear on
where families need to go for that sort of income maintenance and on
whom the additional costs for taking in a child, who is perhaps a
member of the family, lie. It is important that it is clear that those
costs are appropriate for local authorities to consider
meeting.</div>
<a name="080701129000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">We will
produce guidance, which will make it plain that families are expected
to take full advantage of the sources of financial support available to
them. The guidance will also set out examples of additional costs that
families will incur. Obviously we expect families to apply for child
benefit and other state benefits that relate to caring for children,
but the clause will enable local authorities to meet the transitional
costs of taking in children.</div>
<a name="080701129000139"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080701129000394"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> I am going for belt and braces here, because I am
sure that there will be consultation on that guidance, but may I have
assurances that there will be consultation on that guidance, because I
think that the input of bodies that have made representations to us
would be helpful in ensuring that we have coverage. I appreciate the
point made in our previous debate about not supporting general family
costs.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080701129000395"></a>Beverley

produce, so we will consult on that as well. We want to remove local

families and kinship carers in a way that they have felt constrained
from doing in the past. I hope that the hon. Lady is happy with my

25</h4><a name="080701129000010"></a><div class="hs_7SmCapsHdg">Breaks
from caring for disabled
children</div><a name="080701129000143"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080701129000396"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 20, in
clause 25, page 19, line 38, at
end insert
&#145;appropriate&#146;.</div><a name="080701129000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment is probing and is intended to give the Committee the
opportunity to ask questions about the clause. We welcome the clause
and the work that has gone into it. The measure originated with the
Secretary of State who, when he was a Back Bencher, did some good work
on the role of carers for disabled children and the need to give better
support for carers, who are often parents or other family members, and
who do a remarkable job caring for disabled children day in, day out.
Many of them do so in challenging conditions, with little recognition
and not nearly enough support from the state.</div>
<a name="080701129000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">Without the
work of those carers, the bill that would fall on the state would be
considerable, let alone the additional hardship for the disabled
children themselves. We owe an enormous debt of gratitude to carers,
who take upon themselves, often unasked and without demurring from the
challenge, the enormous role of looking after 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column166" />Column number: 166</div>disabled children and giving them as much love and attention as they
possibly can within a home environment. That is to be applauded, and we
should be putting every service at their disposal, rather than putting
obstacles in their way, which happens too often. It is always a great
frustration to me when I am told about yet another piece of bureaucracy
or yet more form filling that a carer will have to go through to get a
basic entitlement for the person for whom they care.</div>
<a name="080701129000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
welcome that the Bill includes a provision for carers to take breaks
from their duties, that it recognises them in that way, and that the
Government have given a sum of money for that purpose. We hope that
that is only the first instalment, because this is a huge enterprise
and we are talking about a large number of children and their carers. I
have seen carers in my constituency for whom the odd bit of
respite&#151;it could be a weekend off or a week away, just to regain
their sanity and to spend time with their partners, husbands, wives or
whatever&#151;can make all the difference. It can help them to
recharge their batteries and allow them to get on with what would
otherwise be the 365-day-a-year job of looking after somebody with a
disability. That could provide an enormous boost and would be great for
allowing people to recharge their batteries to enable them physically
to be able to do the job. It is also a positive recognition that the
job that they do is greatly appreciated. We should be doing more to
make it easier for them to carry out their
job.</div><a name="080701129000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Opposition welcome the extra provisions that will enable carers to have
breaks. Subsection (3) is about assisting</div>
<a name="080701129000310"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;individuals
who provide care for such children to continue to do so, or to do so
more effectively, by giving them breaks from caring&#148;.</div>
<a name="080701129000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment would
simply add a rider that the breaks should be
&#147;appropriate&#148;. Usually, people do not ask for much, but
they ask for breaks at appropriate times&#151;when pressure has built
up, for example, or when they can take a whole week off. We are not
talking about a couple of hours here and a couple of hours there,
although some carers need such breaks. Carers simply want to know that
they are entitled to breaks and that they can rely on the provision, so
that they can take every Friday evening off or one Friday evening a
month or whatever it might be. In any case, it must be
&#147;appropriate&#148;. It is no good the local authority saying,
&#147;We can provide respite care for you between 2 o&#146;clock
and 6 o&#146;clock on a Wednesday afternoon every fifth week,&#148;
or such like if that does not fit in with what the carer needs and can
use.</div>
<a name="080701129000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">Inserting
the word &#147;appropriate&#148;, subject to definitions within
regulations, would give that extra bit of strength to the clause.
Carers would not simply get a token bit of respite, for which they are
meant to be grateful, but &#147;appropriate&#148; respite, as far
as practicably possible, so that it really makes a difference and they
are in a better position to resume and continue their very important
role as carers for disabled
children.</div><a name="080701129000329"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.15

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080701129000397"></a>Angela
Watkinson:</b> I welcome the clause, which is a valuable part
of the Bill, but I also support my hon. Friend in wishing to add the
word &#147;appropriate&#148; towards the end of subsection (3). A
break from caring for a child with special needs has to be free from
worry; 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column167" />Column number: 167</div>otherwise, it does not have the desired effect. That is especially
important when the child has special needs that relate to behaviour or
the way in which they respond to people and their surroundings.
Children on the autistic disorder spectrum, in particular, are a good
example: they do not respond well to change in either their environment
or the people around them. They like things to be familiar and they
enjoy their routine. They are also accomplished escapers, so it is very
important that the provision for them is in a safe environment and that
highly trained and appropriately trained people are looking after
them.</div>
<a name="080701129000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">&#147;Appropriate&#148;
provision means provision of a safe environment and specially trained
staff who understand the challenges that such children face. Most
children&#146;s services know very well what is needed and are highly
sympathetic to the families caring for a child with profound needs, but
often they do not have the funding to provide that very specific,
appropriate
accommodation.</div><a name="080701129000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is an organisation in my constituency called RAGS&#151;Romford
Autistic Group Support. It is a group of parents who have children on
the autistic spectrum. I happen to be patron of that charity, and when
I meet the parents they tell me stories about their everyday lives that
illustrate how difficult their lives are. They do not experience
normality as we accept it. Lack of sleep is a recurring theme. One
mother told me that her child can stay awake for a week and the only
time she can get to sleep is when he is at school and she puts a
&#147;Do not disturb&#148; notice on her front door. It is
difficult to socialise. It is difficult to invite people to the home or
to go out, even to the supermarket, because of the unpredictability of
the children&#146;s behaviour. There is great pressure on siblings,
who are not able to invite friends
home.</div><a name="080701129000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
mother told me last week at the organisation&#146;s annual dinner
that she has no off-street parking, and if there is no parking space
outside her home when she gets back, the child will not get out of the
car. If she stops outside an unfamiliar house, he will not get out
because it is not his home, so she has to drive round for a while and
then come back to their home and wait and hope that there will be a
parking space outside it. Such things are taken for granted by those
parents as part of their everyday life, but to us they seem an
horrendous mountain to
climb.</div><a name="080701129000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
challenge of coping with school holidays, when parents do not have that
break when the child is at school, compounds the difficulties of
everyday life. The challenge of just coping is enormous, and that is
what makes respite care extremely important. I welcome the clause, but
I think that the word &#147;appropriate&#148; is especially
important when we are discussing provision for children with profound
needs. The situation is unlike that of a child with, for example,
mobility problems. It is relatively easy to make adaptations to
buildings with ramps and low switches, so that children using
wheelchairs can be accommodated. For children who have behavioural
problems or who do not understand their surroundings, it is much more
difficult to make proper provision and to have the staff who understand
what they need, and there is a huge cost involved in that. I hope that
the Minister will give some thought to how local authorities, with the
best will in the world, will be able to provide what the Bill requires
them to.</div>

Brooke:</b> I would like to place it on the record that the
Liberal Democrats strongly support the clause. We are pleased that it

whether it was necessary to place such a duty on the local authority. I

should be in the Bill.</div>

considerable financial resources into short breaks. It is very welcome,
but it is such a huge area that almost unlimited demands could be
placed upon that relatively small pot. As I understand it, for the most
part that money will go to children with the most severe disabilities.
I find it difficult to believe that a local authority would go out of
its way to offer inappropriate respite care. I realise that the
Minister may have more to say about that. There is no suggestion that I
do not want disabled children to have appropriate care, but I am not
convinced about this
amendment.</div><a name="080701129000157"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080701129000399"></a>Kevin
Brennan:</b> I am sorry to be so disappointing. It is part of
the job sometimes. We all welcome the clause. The hon. Member for East
Worthing and Shoreham was right to single out the Secretary of State
for the work that he has done. Many other hon. Members, including my
hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood
(Mrs. Humble) and my right hon. Friend the Member for
Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill (Mr. Clarke), had
parliamentary hearings on this matter.</div>
<a name="080701129000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the hon.
Member for Upminster said, we all come across examples in our
constituencies of parents who have these sorts of caring
responsibilities, looking after children who are often severely
disabled. One of my constituents, Nia Wyn, wrote a bestseller on the
subject called &#147;Blue Sky July&#148;, which was the book of the
week on Radio 4 and book of the month on Radio 5. It was published by
my wife, incidentally, and I recommend it to all members of the
Committee. That is not a plug; the book is very pertinent to this
subject.</div>
<a name="080701129000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is very
serious matter and everybody welcomes this initiative. Without respite
services, parents often have no relief from their caring
responsibilities. I am in no doubt that without short-break provision,
the care population would grow considerably. That would be a cost to
the state and to society as a whole. We should not forget either the
wider benefits of short-break provision beyond relieving parents. Any
parent can testify that it is beneficial and healthy for children to
gain positive experiences away from home, to develop wider social
networks and be exposed to new influences, be that with another trusted
adult or in leisure or youth work based activities, where disabled
children and young people can mix with their peers. Such opportunities
for children&#146;s personal and social development are
vital.</div><a name="080701129000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">Members
of the Committee will know that the Government are committed to
transforming short-break services and have set aside, as the hon.
Gentleman mentioned, significant additional funding for short-break
services over the next three years: &#163;359 million is to be
provided to local authorities, alongside further funding to health care
bodies to enable a combined approach. Clause 25 will ensure that
short-break provision becomes a recognised part of local authority
essential services, reflecting the importance that is attached to these
services by families.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column169" />Column number: 169</div><a name="080701129000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">When
I spoke to the young carers at Fairbourne manor last weekend, one of
the things that they greatly welcomed was respite provision, because
about a third of young carers look after a sibling rather than a
parent. They welcomed the additional funds, as well as the broader
measures in the carers strategy. The clause adds the provision of short
breaks for parents and others caring for disabled children to the range
of services that local authorities must provide for families, and in so
doing puts the services on a statutory footing.
</div><a name="080701129000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
new duty makes it clear that breaks should be provided not just for
those carers who are struggling to maintain their caring role, but to
those for whom a break would improve the quality of the care that they
can offer. Short breaks should not only be used as crisis intervention,
but should also help carers to maintain and improve the quality of care
that they naturally wish to provide. I saw good examples of that in
Cardiff a few months ago, when I visited an NCH home where respite care
was provided for children. The children I saw there were at the severe
end of the autistic spectrum. We cannot take a one-size-fits-all
approach.</div>
<a name="080701129000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are
taking steps to ensure that the significant investment that the
Government will be making over the next three years will result in
transformed services that are responsive to individual needs. It will
include the appointment of a national support body to assist local
authorities and primary care trusts in delivering change. We will also
use a combination of regulation and guidance to ensure that local
authorities design and deliver a range and variety of short-break
provision capable of fitting the often complex lives of disabled
children and their carers.</div>
<a name="080701129000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">Now for the
disappointing bit. The hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham may
not be surprised to hear that we believe that the amendment is
unnecessary. Clause 25 adds provision for short breaks for parents and
others caring for disabled children to the range of services that local
authorities must provide. Part 1 of schedule 2 to the Children Act
1989, which the clause amends, provides for some of the specific
services that the local authority must provide under its general duties
under section 17 of that Act. The general duty is</div>
<a name="080701129000311"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to safeguard
and promote the welfare of children within their area who are in
need&#148;</div>
<a name="080701129000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">and
to</div><a name="080701129000312"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;promote
the upbringing...by their families, by providing a range and level
of services appropriate to those children&#146;s
needs.&#148;</div>
<a name="080701129000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">I thank hon.
Members for their kind support for the clause and for their indulgence
on the legal and technical point of substance. I hope that the hon.
Gentleman will agree that the amendment is unnecessary, and I therefore
ask him to withdraw
it.</div><a name="080701129000167"></a>

Loughton:</b> It is a disappointment, but not a great
surprise. It was a probing amendment. The Minister and all members of
the Committee have the same intention. The proof of the pudding will be
in the eating, particularly the extra &#163;359 million that is being
made available, and whether the provision will provide the sort of
appropriate breaks that we know from our constituents are
needed.</div>
<a name="080701129000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon.
Friend the Member for Upminster was right to mention the carers of
children with autistic spectrum disorder-type challenges. I would
surmise that we all 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column170" />Column number: 170</div>know of difficult constituency cases where
particular requirements are involved. As with children with physical
disabilities, breaks may often involve carers looking after the child
in the home. It is not necessarily a question of the child being
shipped off, leading to the problems caused by a lack of familiarity
with the surroundings, because the facilities that are needed are often
already to be found in the home. It is a question of getting someone to
come to the house in place of the carers, while they go away for a few
days.</div>

Southworth</b> (Warrington, South) (Lab): I was motivated to
table the new clauses because of concerns among a number of colleagues
about evidence on the outcomes for some young people in care in
children&#146;s homes, and the difference between those outcomes and
the inspection reports for those homes. We were motivated particularly
by the concept, which is becoming commonly held, that parents share
responsibility with their children for much of the children&#146;s
behaviour, and that parents should be held accountable to a degree when
children engage in antisocial or criminal activities. That is because
parents have a responsibility to guide and support their children and
to ensure that they are aware of different ways of behaving and given
chances to learn new and better ways of behaving. Most of all, children
should be supported by their parents so that they do not travel down
the paths that, unfortunately, far too many children have taken, which
lead to criminal records and custodial
sentences.</div>
<a name="080701129000330"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.30
pm</div><a name="080701129000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
purpose of the three new clauses is to get a virtuous circle, rather
than a downward spiral, so that the different participants who support
a child or young person in a children&#146;s home work together
effectively to ensure that the young person gets the support and
intervention they need to achieve the sorts of successes that meet
their potential.</div>
<a name="080701129000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause
37 would require children&#146;s homes to keep records of specific
activities that any good and responsible parent would notice, such as
incidents of children going missing from the home. The current system
of recording the reporting of a child going missing resulted in 23
children&#146;s services departments being unable to tell the
parliamentary all-party group for children who run away or go missing
how many children in their own care had been reported missing to the
police in 2005. Also, a significant number of children&#146;s
services departments that could give a response to that question gave a
radically different response when asked the same question by their
local police force. In many instances, the police forces had recorded a
different number of young people who had been reported missing while in
the care of the local authority than that local authority
had.</div>
<a name="080701129000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">When one
looks at the pattern of who is responsible within a children&#146;s
services department, one will see that it is eminently possible for
that sort of information not to be recorded effectively and passed to
those who could do something about it. Indeed, one might say that some
people have a vested interest in not recording it effectively, because
it can draw attention to the fact that they are not parenting
particularly effectively.</div>
<a name="080701129000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">We need a
proper, rigorous system for ensuring that those who are responsible for
caring for children, ensuring that they have a safe and comfortable
place to go and supporting them in that process are required to record
instances when their children are reported missing to the police and
make that information available on inspection so that they can be held
accountable for it.</div>
<a name="080701129000181"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="080701129000403"></a><b class="B">Mr.
David Kidney</b> (Stafford) (Lab): Does my hon. Friend take
the view that, in order to have the full picture, it should be a
requirement to record young 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column172" />Column number: 172</div>persons absconding or committing an offence? Is she
aware that it used to be best practice for inspectors to ask for that
information and that Ofsted, now that it is responsible, has told
inspectors that they do not need to ask for it and that the home does
not need to record it because that is no longer required by regulation?
Does that not show the importance of what she is putting forward
today?</div><a name="080701129000182"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080701129000404"></a>Helen
Southworth:</b> Absolutely. We have had a number of
discussions with the Commission for Social Care Inspection, when it was
responsible, and with Ofsted, because in 2002 the Department of
Health&#146;s guidance made that an indicator. However, reports have
consistently not used it when inspections of the home have been made.
In fact, a degree of frustration has been expressed by inspectors
because, although they have a duty to do that, they could not do so
because people were not required to keep that information and make it
available to
them.</div><a name="080701129000183"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080701129000405"></a>Angela
Watkinson:</b> I am listening carefully to what the hon. Lady
is saying and I am very supportive of it. She will know that most
children who find themselves in care have experienced feckless
parenting or disorganised households. They will not have learned all of
the standards that we would expect children to experience during their
childhood. Is it not quite shocking that on going into care they do not
experience a far greater level of care and have greater values put in
front of them? If they are absconding from the home, it indicates that
things are failing very badly. That nobody is even recording their
disappearance is quite shocking and is something that we must act
on.</div><a name="080701129000184"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080701129000406"></a>Helen
Southworth:</b> The hon. Lady raises something that has caused
me a great deal of concern, especially when I tabled new clause 37. I
felt that it was an unambitious new clause. I would have been far
happier tabling a new clause requiring children&#146;s homes to
record and make available for inspection occasions of positive
achievement by young people. It could have included how many young
people are achieving high-quality GCSEs and A-levels and how many
children are participating in school theatres of
bands.</div><a name="080701129000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
found it very disappointing to put forward a requirement to record
instances of children going missing, instances of antisocial or violent
behaviour by children and acts of criminal damage perpetrated by
children. That should not be what we are talking about. That is not
what we expect for our children and these are our children. However,
there comes a time when a baseline must be put down. We must say that
these children have the right to expect minimum standards. These things
should be included in those minimum
standards.</div><a name="080701129000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
all-party group on runaway and missing children held evidence sessions
towards the end of last year. Some very effective evidence was given to
us by the police forces for Lancashire and Leicester, which had been
doing intensive work in tracking why reports of missing children had
been made to them. They looked at what had happened to the children and
what the outcomes were. They used a very child-centred approach which
was very
effective.</div><a name="080701129000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">Lancashire
identified more than 300 children who went missing on at least three
occasions in one year. Between them, they accounted for almost 3,200 of
Lancashire&#146;s missing persons investigations. The majority 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column173" />Column number: 173</div>of those cases involved children in care, particularly those in
residential care. Many of those children were prolific runaways. One
child had been the subject of 78 missing person investigations
in a single year. The police worked out that the cost of police
services in investigating those reports was on average &#163;1,000
each time. In one year, &#163;78,000 was spent in addressing the
problems of that young
person.</div><a name="080701129000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
information is quite shocking when we consider our ambitions for
supporting young people going into higher education and whether we can
extend that to children who are going into apprenticeships or further
education. Through failure, we can spend &#163;78,000 in police time
on not supporting effectively a young person in a local authority home.
Local authority care homes should have to record these things and be
accountable for the management of them. They must be open to
intervention and support so that they can be more effective parents,
rather than wait until the young people face the negative outcomes of
being out on the street where they are subject to certain predators and
likely to get involved in certain
activities.</div><a name="080701129000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">Leicester
police said that the top 10 missing people for 2005 were responsible
for 6 per cent. of the missing person reports for their police force.
All of them were missing more than 10 times up to a maximum of 53. The
top 10 had been the victims of 20 offences that were reported to the
police and a total of 82 offences were linked to them, including 28
assaults and a variety of offences including burglary, theft and
damage. They also commented that 70 per cent. of those offences were
committed in the care home. They speculated whether, if those children
had been in their homes rather than care homes, the police would have
been involved, or whether proper intervention and decent parenting
would have ensured that the children understood their actions and did
not offend again. The purpose of new clause 37 is to ensure not that we
record a downward spiral for young people but that we identify where
early interventions are necessary in children&#146;s homes to ensure
effective support to give children in care a better outcome, not a
worse
one.</div><a name="080701129000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
virtuous circle involved in new clause 38 would ensure that the
stakeholders responsible for the best interest of the child or young
person placed in a children&#146;s home are consulted and involved
when an inspection report is being prepared. The designated teacher in
the young person&#146;s school, for example, would be able to give
input on whether the relevant person from the home was attending
parent-teacher meetings, whether the young person was getting help with
their homework and bringing it in on time and whether they were
attending school and participating effectively in school activities.
Those are the kinds of thing that depend on parental support, or, in
this case, the support of the person acting in loco parentis. Children
and young people should not be expected to manage their own schooling,
homework and
environment.</div><a name="080701129000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
purpose of new clause 39 is to ensure that inspection reports return to
the person with the most interest in ensuring that the child or young
person has positive outcomes from their experience as a looked-after
child. At the moment, Ofsted has no duty to provide reports to key
stakeholders such as schools and agencies 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column174" />Column number: 174</div>responsible for tackling crime and disorder. Reports are always sent to
the registered individual as well as the registered manager, but that
is it.</div>
<a name="080701129000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">A placing
authority, particularly if it is out of area, will not have the
information that it needs to know whether a child or young person is
having a positive experience in the home or whether they have absconded
or run away&#151;whatever word one wants to use; I do not like
&#147;absconding&#148; very much&#151;78 times in a year. That is
absolutely essential information. None of us would allow our children
to leave home if we did not know where they were going, what the
reputation of the place was or how it was performing. We need to ensure
that those reports are made available to the one person with that young
person&#146;s best interest at heart and the determining power over
whether that young person remains in the placement or is given
something more
effective.</div><a name="080701129000193"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080701129000407"></a>Mr.
Kidney:</b> I agree with all that my hon. Friend has said, but
I want to ask her a question. In Staffordshire, the county council, the
police and the Crown Prosecution Service have an inter-agency protocol
designed to reduce the number of looked-after children who become
involved in the criminal justice system. The partners have said to me
that they are concerned that when children arrive in Staffordshire from
another authority and are placed in the independent sector, the
partners do not necessarily receive sufficient information to be able
to work their protocol and give the same level of service to those
children. Would anything in the new clause help those partners in the
work that they want to
do?</div><a name="080701129000194"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.45
pm</div><a name="080701129000195"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080701129000408"></a>Helen
Southworth:</b> There are two things that I can say to that.
One is that my own children&#146;s services department has said
something similar to me: &#147;We don&#146;t know what we
don&#146;t know.&#148; That is crucial. We must ensure that they
have the necessary information to carry out their roles, particularly
when they are trying to do so
effectively.</div><a name="080701129000331"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">The
new clauses do not directly affect that requirement, but they place a
requirement on Ofsted to contact a placing authority if it is different
from the authority in which the home is situated, and to give feedback
to the placing authority whether the child is placed in it or not. If
it were effectively followed through, that process should be able to
identify children placed out of area in children&#146;s homes, but
not those who are fostered out of area. However, I am sure that the
Minister in his response will address how he will consider the minimum
care standards review, and what it will contain. Along with my hon.
Friend the Member for Stafford, I have heard some sad cases&#151;a
couple have been tragic&#151;of young people who have been placed out
of area, and the local authorities within which they have been placed
have discovered them only when dreadful events have brought them to the
attention of the accident and emergency department or the police. I
agree that that perhaps should have been addressed in new clause 37,
and we need to hear from the Minister how he will resolve that issue,
with the support of his
Department.</div><a name="080701129000196"></a>

a big influence?</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080701129000410"></a>Helen
Southworth:</b> One of the problems that has been mentioned
consistently by some of the excellent social workers and voluntary
organisations working in this field, and by the police, are the push
and pull factors. Young people can leave something that that they do
not like, but they can also be enticed away by people with a vested
interested. Young people in residential homes are particularly subject
to such enticement. That is one of the reasons why there are so many
young people coming into the criminal justice system, and there are
some shocking examples of young women involved in
prostitution&#151;through people who have sought them out and groomed
them&#151;who have not had effective support in the residential
homes.</div><a name="080701129000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
purpose of the new clauses is clear. It is to ensure that there is an
underpinning framework that enables the purpose of the main
clause&#151;clause 26&#151;to be achieved. Enforcement can then
happen, but on an evidence base that is drawn from all the stakeholders
involved in the young person&#146;s
well-being.</div><a name="080701129000199"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080701129000411"></a>Kevin
Brennan:</b> I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Warrington,
South for sparking an interesting debate, and I pay tribute&#151;as I
have done before&#151;to her diligence in and around this subject. I
also thank other hon. Members who participated. The debate has been
useful for teasing out some of the issues on inspection&#151;of
children&#146;s homes in particular&#151;and what should and should
not be reported. I replied not so long ago to an Adjournment debate on
the subject, and I am aware of many of the issues that my hon. Friend
raised.</div><a name="080701129000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
new clause 39, the Government agree very much that it is important that
reports from Her Majesty&#146;s chief inspector are available. We
entirely agree that local authorities considering placing a child
should consider all the available information in making such a
decision, including recent inspection reports. As the hon. Lady said,
the law currently provides that such reports should be made available.
The chief inspector must send a copy of the report to each person who
has registered in respect of the establishment, make copies of the
report available for inspection at its offices by any person at any
reasonable time and take other steps that she considers appropriate for
publicising a report. Any person who asks Ofsted for a copy of a report
is entitled to one. I know that hon. Members have encountered teething
problems with
that.</div><a name="080701129000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">Ofsted
is currently consulting on whether to publish its reports. That
consultation, which runs until 16 September, seeks the views of the
children and young people who live in children&#146;s homes. That is
important. Of course, it should also seek the views of hon. Members and
I hope that they will give their views to it. The publication of
inspection reports on children&#146;s homes is sensitive, as I am
sure that my hon. Friend the Member for Warrington, South will
acknowledge. Ofsted has not to date published such reports on its
website for that reason. While reports do not name individual children,
a significant number of homes care only for a small number of children
and, in those circumstances, it may be harder to protect children if
the reports are widely
publicised.</div><a name="080701129000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is essential that in seeking to improve communication between providers
and commissioners, which I think is the purpose of her amendment, we do
not place children at risk. While I strongly sympathise with my hon.
Friend&#146;s point and believe that should be taken onboard in the
Ofsted&#146;s consultation, we are not convinced that the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column176" />Column number: 176</div>requirement for Her Majesty&#146;s chief inspector
to circulate copies of inspections of children&#146;s homes to every
local authority placing children at such homes is the best way forward.
Inspection reports on children&#146;s homes are currently available
on request by local authorities and local safeguarding children boards,
and it would be inefficient to require Ofsted to create and maintain a
new register of individual children at children&#146;s homes or to
collect that information on each individual inspection of a
children&#146;s home.</div>
<a name="080701129000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government are committed to ensuring that inspection is a fully rounded
process, which takes account of all the relevant evidence, including
the views of children and others with an interest, such as local
authorities placing children in the home and the designated teacher at
a school attended by children from the home. Primary legislation is too
unwieldy to make that happen. It is essential that the inspectorate is
able to tailor its approach within a broad framework to take account of
individual and changing
circumstances.</div><a name="080701129000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">Ofsted&#146;s
current guidance on inspecting children&#146;s homes is set out in
its April 2007 document &#147;Are you ready for your inspection? A
guide to inspections of children&#146;s services conducted by
Ofsted.&#148; That guidance explains to managers of establishments
that they may sometimes be asked to help distribute surveys to
stakeholders of their service, for example, to parents, teachers,
social workers or health professionals. That is to ensure that as many
people as possible linked to the service have the opportunity to
express their views and to let Ofsted know what the service does well
or could
improve.</div><a name="080701129000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
practice, of course, Ofsted plans each inspection individually
according to the circumstances in each children&#146;s home using,
among other sources, the children&#146;s homes self-assessment and
the inspection of children&#146;s homes questionnaire, both of which
the children&#146;s home complete. They help the Ofsted inspectors to
decide which partners should be consulted.</div>
<a name="080701129000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">Regarding,
for example, the designated teacher at the school attended by the
children, we fully agree that it is vital that children&#146;s homes
support the education of children in their care effectively. Building
strong links with the child&#146;s school is an important part of
that. Standard 14 of the &#147;National Minimum Standards for
children&#146;s homes&#148; says that the home should
have</div>
<a name="080701129000313"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;an education
policy that shows how the home intends to promote and support the
education of children throughout the time that they live
there&#148;</div>
<a name="080701129000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">and, as part of this,
the child or young person&#146;s personal education plan
should</div>
<a name="080701129000314"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;set out which
staff in the children's home have responsibility for liaising with
schools.&#148;</div>
<a name="080701129000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">Ofsted&#146;s
practice means that a questionnaire on the children&#146;s home may
be sent to the designated person at the school, which would be taken
into account when preparing an inspection report on the home. In
addition, section 32(5) of the Care Standards Act provides that Her
Majesty&#146;s Chief Inspector must send a copy of the report to the
registered person for an establishment without delay. Prompt reporting
of inspection findings is of vital importance to
maximise their value and impact.</div>
<a name="080701129000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause
38 may, by placing other formal duties on Her Majesty&#146;s Chief
Inspector before preparing every inspection report, inadvertently cause
delay in reporting. In practice, Her Majesty&#146;s Chief Inspector
would need 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column177" />Column number: 177</div>to request contact details from the children&#146;s home, request
views from the specified organisation and person or persons, and take
reasonable steps to seek such views. The current law allows for the
seeking of views, and this is Ofsted&#146;s general practice, but it
also allows flexibility to balance seeking such views with the need for
urgency.</div><a name="080701129000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clause 38 would require Her Majesty&#146;s Chief Inspector to inform
local authorities placing children at a children&#146;s home that she
was preparing a report, but would not require her to seek their views.
We are not persuaded of the value of such a provision. It would require
Ofsted either to create and maintain a list of the placing authority
for every child in every children&#146;s home, or to seek this
information in respect of each individual inspection, either of which
would be administratively cumbersome. Every children&#146;s home is
inspected twice a year. Notifying local authorities twice a year before
this happens would not serve any clear
purpose.</div><a name="080701129000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government agree that inspections of children&#146;s homes should
seek and take account of the views of those with an interest in the
effectiveness of the home, and believe that Ofsted takes steps to
achieve this. Ofsted has made significant progress in terms of
consulting children, parents, local authorities, providers and other
key stakeholders. However, the details of how this is done in practice
should not be for primary legislation. Within the broad framework set
by the legislation, Her Majesty&#146;s Chief Inspector is best placed
to ensure a flexible and appropriate balance between seeking views and
reporting promptly.</div>
<a name="080701129000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause
37 requires children&#146;s home providers to collate their
statistics on the number of children who go missing from
children&#146;s homes and incidences of antisocial and criminal
behaviour, and to make that information available on request to the
inspectorate. I entirely understand the point that my hon. Friend is
making because she raises an important issue. Notwithstanding her point
about reporting positive things as well in relation to young people in
children&#146;s homes, I am very sympathetic to her reasons for
tabling this amendment.</div>
<a name="080701129000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">In making
placement decisions, local authorities should take all necessary steps
to satisfy themselves that the placement is appropriate and is able to
meet the assessed needs of the individual child. At an earlier sitting
we discussed the factors that may give rise to antisocial and even
criminal behaviour by a small minority of children placed in
children&#146;s homes. We considered, for example, the effects of
inappropriate placements, a long distance from home, and of children
feeling &#147;dumped&#148;, as the hon. Member for East Worthing
and Shoreham put it. Clearly, we hope that these sorts of placements
will become increasingly rare as a direct result of the Bill. While it
is of course important for placing authorities to take account of a
wide range of information in making placement decisions, that
information must be meaningful and useful. It must obviously help local
authorities to make the right placement
decisions.</div>
<a name="080701129000332"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6
pm</div><a name="080701129000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">What
matters most is that children&#146;s homes take appropriate action to
address the behaviour of the children placed there through well trained
staff providing 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column178" />Column number: 178</div>the right support and care. As we have discussed,
there are steps that should be taken, and the
Government are taking them to ensure that that
happens.</div><a name="080701129000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
know that my hon. Friend the Member for Warrington, South will be aware
that provisions are in place to enable the chief inspector to consider
the information sought by the amendment. The Care Standards Act 2000,
which provides the legislative framework for the registration and
regulation of children&#146;s homes, includes a general power to make
regulations requiring the keeping of records and the notification of
events occurring in establishments and agencies. The Act also contains
the power for the registration authority to require an establishment or
agency to provide any information that it considers necessary when
carrying out an inspection.</div>
<a name="080701129000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">Regulations
provide that the procedure for dealing with any unauthorised absence of
a child from a children&#146;s home must be supplied to Ofsted as
part of the initial application to register the home. The national
minimum standards for children&#146;s homes also refer
specifically to the need for the registered person to have such
a procedure in place. In addition, there is a regulatory requirement
that all incidents of absconding&#151;or whatever term we
use&#151;must be noted on the child&#146;s record, and the placing
authority must be notified of the incident.</div>
<a name="080701129000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">Where there
are instances of criminal behaviour, the regulations and national
minimum standards are also clear about procedures for making the
consequences of unacceptable behaviour clear to staff and children. Any
disciplinary measures taken must be appropriate to the incident. The
home is required to notify specific serious incidents to Ofsted and to
the placing
authority.</div><a name="080701129000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
hon. Friend has raised some important issues relating to statistics,
but for the reasons that I have given, I think that requiring collation
from individual records in the way that she suggests is not the best
solution. Those are matters for professional judgment in light of the
regulatory requirements, the national minimum standards and guidance,
rather than for primary legislation. The national minimum standards for
children&#146;s homes are to be reviewed this year as part of a
review of all sets of national minimum standards for children, and I
assure my hon. Friend that the review will consider how to strengthen
existing requirements and expectations in the areas that she
outlined.</div><a name="080701129000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
that basis, I ask my hon. Friend not to press her new clauses, with the
assurance that as part of the review of national minimum standards, we
will consider closely how we can strengthen existing requirements
through those
standards.</div><a name="080701129000220"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080701129000412"></a>Helen
Southworth:</b> I am of course disappointed in some ways by
the Minister&#146;s response, but I hope that it is only a temporary
disappointment and that the review of minimum standards and the various
regulations attached to the Bill will relieve my concerns and those of
other Members. I am sure that both he and Ofsted have taken note of the
fact that there is considerable interest in the House in the
performance of inspectors, the transparency of inspection reports and,
accepting absolutely what he said about respecting young
people&#146;s privacy in the process, the need to ensure that people
making a decision about those young people have the evidence that they
need to make a full and proper decision.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080701129000413"></a>Annette

can answer by speaking to the clause. Not having served on the

I have served on most Committees considering that sort of Bill, I am
not sure of the clause&#146;s full
significance.</div><a name="080701129000226"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080701129000414"></a>Kevin
Brennan:</b> The amendments made by clause 34 are minor and
are being made so that the review mechanisms for adoption and fostering
are in line with each other. Subsection (2) clarifies that applications
for a review of a qualifying determination are to be made to the
appropriate Minister, not to the review panel. On receipt of an
application, the appropriate Minister will constitute a review panel to
review the qualifying determination. Subsections (3) to (7) remove from
review panels the power to recover the cost of a review from the
adoption agency that made the qualifying determination under review.
Instead, it will be for the appropriate Minister to determine the sum
that must be paid by the adoption agency. That will be based on the
cost to the appropriate Minister of performing his independent review
functions. In anticipation of this question, it will not and must not
include any element of
profit.</div><a name="080701129000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
only practical change for adoption agencies is that the review panel
will not include in its written recommendations an order for payment of
costs. Prospective adopters will not be affected by any of these
changes and there will be no additional work for adoption
agencies.</div><a name="080701129000228"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080701129000416"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> In rising to speak to the clause and the new
clause that I tabled, a deep sense of d(c)j  vu descends on
me. With various hon. Members, I have debated the private fostering
registration scheme on countless occasions over the past seven or eight
years.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column180" />Column number: 180</div><a name="080701129000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before I
state the reasons behind new clause 15, I wish to explain that we
originally tabled amendment No. 22, which is one of those amendments
that seeks to strike out the whole of the clause and which never get
selected. Instead, it has become an adaptation new clause. Essentially,
we do not want to give the Government the power to extend the sunset
clause provisions relating to a possible private fostering registration
scheme that were inserted into the Children Act 2004, and which expire
or set in November this year. We felt that striking out the clause
would have done the job, but apparently that must be put in the form of
a new
clause.</div><a name="080701129000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
do not want to go into vast detail. I simply refer the Committee to
countless speeches that various hon. Members have made over the last
few years on the need for a private fostering registration scheme. I
refer the Committee to the 1997 Utting report, &#147;People Like
Us&#148;, which made recommendations for a private fostering
registration scheme. I refer hon. Members to the work of the joint
working party on foster care in 1999, which revealed the high potential
for abuse and neglect and urged regulation of private fostering in a
public awareness campaign. I refer hon. Members to the Laming report in
the wake of the Victoria Climbi(c) tragedy, which recommended a
review of the private fostering system. I refer hon. Members to my
modest ten-minute Bill, introduced on 19 March 2003, which contained
three provisions, one of which was to institute a private fostering
registration
scheme.</div><a name="080701129000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is inexplicable to many of us that the Government have avoided
supporting a measure that a broad consensus of people involved in
children&#146;s issues and adoption and fostering have been saying
for some time is necessary. We are confounded as to why the Government
have still not gone along with it. Throughout all the years of calling
for such a scheme, we have seen extensive regulation of child
minding&#151;the registration scheme has enjoyed a degree of
success&#151;and all sorts of care standards for inspection of care
homes and fostering agencies, some of which we have discussed today.
Numerous new adoption rights and requirements have been introduced, and
hundreds of thousands of people who deal with young people have been
subjected to Criminal Records Bureau checks, including me. After
enormous hassle, I managed to get myself CRB checked&#151;it is no
easy feat. Nobody wants to take responsibility for that, but I thought
it appropriate that the shadow Minister for Children got a CRB check,
which I eventually did. We have even had legislation to clamp down on
puppy farming, but still we have not had a registration scheme for
private fostering.</div>
<a name="080701129000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">Incredibly,
people who offer their services as private foster carers, often as
complete strangers, have no real compunction about not registering
their services, although there are local authority registers and the
notification scheme was supposedly bolstered in the 2004 Act. I shall
come back in a moment to some of the words of the then Minister for
Children, Young People and Families, the right hon. Member for Barking
(Margaret Hodge), and some of the undertakings that she gave us when
the 2004 Act was being passed. For people who are unknown to local
social services departments, there can be no guarantees of quality of
care or that they are accessing appropriate training, support and
benefits, and no control over the number of different placements that
the child will experience, which all have ramifications for the safety,
welfare and well-being of children in private fostering
arrangements.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column181" />Column number: 181</div><a name="080701129000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have no
accurate measure of the extent of such arrangements, although some
years ago, it was estimated that there are in excess of 10,000 private
foster care arrangements in this country, disproportionately involving
children coming from west Africa, particularly Nigeria, Sierra Leone
and the Ivory Coast&#151;Victoria Climbi(c) came from the latter
via France. I am sure that a large majority of private foster carers do
a good job and pose no threat to their charges, but we simply do not
know. We have no idea of the extent of the problem because the
Department of Health stopped collecting data back in 1991, so
inaccurate were the figures. Since 1991, regulations have brought in
local registers of foster carers, but there is no real legal penalty
for not registering, and many people are ignorant of the
requirements.</div>
<a name="080701129000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">We could
look at some of the undertakings that the then Minister gave during
some lively debates on the 2004 Act. The hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and
North Poole was present, and the then hon. Member for Lancaster and
Wyre, Hilton Dawson, who was a great advocate of a private registration
scheme, voted with the Opposition in defiance of the Government to
introduce it. It was pointed out that</div>
<a name="080701129000315"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;every report
that the Government have commissioned over the past five years confirms

<a name="080701129000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">The sunset

extend it without a good reason just goes to prove that it was a sop.
It is a sop to mention the issue when one has no real inclination to do
something about it, as I charged the then Children&#146;s Minister
with doing in 2004, and quite honestly I do not think that anything has
changed to negate the charge that I made
then.</div><a name="080701129000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">In

agreed with that. She went on to say, in support of the sunset

clause is in the Bill because we want to strengthen the scheme and give

Standing Committee B,</i> 21 October 2004; c.
288.]</div><a name="080701129000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">That,
in 2004, was the last chance, but now, apparently, there is another
last chance. The Government need to make a case and justify why this is
proving to be a very long sunset indeed. Will we ever see the dawn of a
private fostering registration scheme, which so many of us have wanted
for so many
years?</div><a name="080701129000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am at a loss to see how the notification scheme can have been deemed a
success. As at 31 March 2007&#151;the last year for which we have
figures&#151;1,250 children were reported as being cared for and
accommodated in private fostering arrangements in England, and 1,010
private fostering arrangements ended during the previous year, so we
are still well short of the 10,000 private fostering arrangements that
are estimated to exist. We still do not know who is involved in those
arrangements.</div><a name="080701129000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another
reason for beefing up the provision in 2004 was to publicise the
existence of notification schemes and the legal requirement to register
with them. A survey was carried out back in 2005 by <i class="I">The Voice
</i>newspaper; it was particularly focused on black private fostering
arrangements in London, where we know there has been a problem, of
which the Victoria Climbi(c) case was just one example. That
survey found that of the respondents, about 35 per cent.&#151;just
one third&#151;knew about private fostering. Twenty-one per cent. of
the respondents were from Africa and of those, although 31 per
cent. said that they knew about private fostering, only half of them
actually knew what it meant. Thirty-five per cent. of respondents said
that they knew about private fostering, but when probed further, it was
found that only 15 per cent. actually did know what it was about. There
was a pretty low recognition level, particularly among a key target
client group.</div>
<a name="080701129000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">Part of the
raison d&#146;tre behind the changes made by the Minister in
charge of the Children Bill in 2004 was to promote better awareness.
Local authorities were charged with making potential or existing
private fosterers in their area aware of the requirement to register
under the scheme. However, three or four years on, in January this
year, the British Association for Adoption and Fostering carried out a
further survey of Londoners and came up with an even worse result,
showing that few professionals working with children understand what
private fostering is. In a YouGov survey, using an even bigger sample
than the original survey, adults living in London were asked what they
thought it meant for a child to be privately fostered and they were
offered a series of possible answers. Only 18 per cent. picked the
correct definition. Furthermore, only 16 per cent. knew that the parent
and carer, when making private fostering arrangements, must notify the
local authority in the area where the child will live and that failure
to do so is an offence. Two hundred professionals who come into regular
contact with children were surveyed, including teachers, teaching
assistants, doctors and nurses, and what is really worrying is that
only 18 per cent. of them knew the correct definition of private
fostering, despite the fact that professionals working with children
obviously play a vital role in identifying privately fostered children.
It would appear from that evidence that the publicity and promotion of
the existing notification process has 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column183" />Column number: 183</div>been an abysmal failure. How much money was spent on it and what results
do the Government think have been gained? The surveying of key target
audiences has shown that if it has had any impact, it has been a
negative one.</div>
<a name="080701129000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also asked
at that time how many people have been prosecuted for not registering
with the notification scheme. The Minister did not know the figure but
admitted that it was probably very low. I would like to know how many
have now been prosecuted for failing to register. I hazard a guess that
the number remains very low. That scheme was supposedly beefed up and
bolstered by the Children Act 2004 and the intention was to initiate a
promotion and awareness campaign. That campaign has singularly failed
to promote awareness, to attract the sizeable number of those likely to
be involved in private fostering arrangements in this country to
register, or to bring any increase in the number of prosecutions of
those not complying with the supposedly beefed-up
legislation.</div><a name="080701129000251"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="080701129000417"></a><b class="B">Kerry

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080701129000418"></a>Kerry
McCarthy:</b> As I was saying, I wonder whether the hon.
Gentleman agrees that children whose parents are serving custodial
sentences could be at risk if they were placed with friends or family
for the duration of those sentences. Does he think that we should have
better local monitoring and recording of children who fall into that
category, particularly as it would allow schools to keep an eye on
their
welfare?</div><a name="080701129000255"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080701129000419"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> The hon. Lady makes an interesting point. She
may not realise it, but that is the subject of a campaign being run by
the Catholic diocese of Liverpool on the vulnerability of children
whose parents find themselves in the custody system. It is a fair
point, but I shall not let it take us down a completely separate byway.
However, it is another aspect of the issue that requires
attention.</div>
<a name="080701129000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have
slightly forgotten where I was before the Division and before the hon.
Lady&#146;s intervention. Rather than start again, I shall begin my
conclusion. The point that I have been trying to make&#151;I am sure
that other Opposition Members concur&#151;is that the time has surely
come for a proper, formal registration scheme for private fostering
arrangements. I do not claim that it will be a universal panacea. It
will not be easy to police, and it will not be foolproof. I certainly
do not want to play the nanny state card, having the state interfere
with children who legitimately attend boarding schools or language
schools, or children on holiday exchanges and so on, who have often
been set up as the problem.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080701129000420"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> I said when I started speaking to the new clause
that I had a sense of d(c)j  vu&#151;this is the third
wave of d(c)j  vu this sitting. I will try to bring my
comments to a speedy conclusion before the House divides again and I
again have to try to pick up where I left
off.</div><a name="080701129000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
point is that we need a private fostering registration scheme, which
the un-sunsetted clause would provide. That national register of
private foster carers would be available to birth parents who wished to
pursue a private fostering arrangement, and it would enable local
authorities to ensure that standards of care were suitable and
appropriate help and support was offered. Such a scheme could also
deter private foster carers who had fallen foul of local authority or
authorised foster agency inspections, but had not committed offences
sufficiently serious for them to be put on the Department for Children,
Schools and Families watch
list.</div><a name="080701129000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
conclusion, the Government have not made the case for why the scheme
should not now come into force. In our deliberations on the Children
Bill in 2004, the then Minister for Children, Young People and Families
said
that</div><a name="080701129000320"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;we
will require the local safeguarding boards to have regard to how well
or otherwise private fostering arrangements are being
implemented.&#148;</div>
<a name="080701129000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would very much like
to hear whether the findings of the local safeguarding children boards
have coloured the Government&#146;s thinking regarding not going
ahead with the scheme. The then Children&#146;s Minister clearly said
that</div><a name="080701129000321"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
notification scheme has not worked&#151;there has not been compliance
with the regulatory
framework.&#148;</div><a name="080701129000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">She
went on to say
that</div><a name="080701129000322"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;if
this final attempt to get the notification scheme to work is not
successful, we would have to examine an alternative, despite the many
concerns that we have about the alternatives.&#148;</div>
<a name="080701129000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">She described the
positive disincentive of the scheme as it then stood. Finally, she said
that</div><a name="080701129000323"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;if
we fail in our endeavours to make the notification scheme work, we will
not need to return to the House with primary legislation and we will
implement the registration scheme, despite our concerns about whether
it will work as well as everyone would like it
to.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, Standing Committee B,</i> 21
October 2004; c.
289-91.]</div><a name="080701129000265"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
was quite clear four years ago that unless there was overwhelming
evidence to show that the notification scheme was working, this section
of the Children Act 2004 would come into force. Why are the Government
seeking to extend the sunset clause again? When is a sunset not a
sunset? How many more chances will they give to show that the
notification scheme works, or as we think, that it simply does not
work, before we have the private fostering registration scheme for
which a wide cross-section of people have been calling for many years?
On that basis, I commend new clause 15 to the
Committee.</div><a name="080701129000266"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080701129000421"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> I support the new clause wholeheartedly. We have
discussed this issue on many occasions. The speeches were getting more
and more polished, but I will be brief tonight.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column185" />Column number: 185</div><a name="080701129000267"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
discussed this issue under the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act 2006
because we were concerned that if we did not know about private
fostering arrangements, there were children who effectively were not
being safeguarded. That is quite a serious point. We are talking about
potentially vulnerable children, perhaps with limited or no contact
with their parents. There is a real need to prevent such vulnerable
children from slipping through the
net.</div><a name="080701129000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am staggered at how low the notifications are. Have the Government have
made their own assessment of numbers in private fostering? It would be
interesting to hear that. We work on the basis of the estimate of
10,000. How do the Government intend to do better than they have done
over the last four years? In other words, what more are they going to
do to increase the level of notifications? The Government indicated
when discussing the Children Act 2004 that there would be monitoring
and reporting back from local authorities. Do we have any idea if some
local authorities are progressing with the notifications better than
others?</div><a name="080701129000269"></a><div class="hs_Para">Thirdly,
what will be the criteria for assessing whether voluntary schemes are
working? All we know is that there is a judgment that two years is not
long enough. I am not convinced that we need another three years. There
is no movement of any significance in the numbers of notifications. It
could be dangerous to allow this process to hang on for another three
years. I agree with the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham that
this is something that we should just get on and
do.</div><a name="080701129000270"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080701129000422"></a>Kevin
Brennan:</b> The new clause would require the Secretary of
State to make regulations within one year to establish a registration
scheme for private foster carers. It does not specify when that year
would begin, but I presume that it would be the date on which the Bill
is passed. It does not make any provision regarding the establishment
of a registration scheme in Wales. We have heard that the intention in
tabling the new clause was based on the concern over how well children
are protected under the current private fostering arrangements as well
as to press for an early implementation of the registration
scheme.</div><a name="080701129000338"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">7
pm</div><a name="080701129000271"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having
sat on the Committee for the Adoption and Children Act 2002 and
discussed the matter on the other occasions that the hon. Gentleman
mentioned, I understand the point that he is making. We have a common
aim of trying to ensure that the right safeguards are in place to
protect privately fostered children and help place them on a more equal
footing with other children, and a number of things have been achieved.
I want to make it absolutely clear to the Committee that we have not
abandoned the idea of a registration scheme. Because of the progress of
the notification scheme so far, we feel that we simply do not have the
evidence to justify the move right now.</div>
<a name="080701129000272"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to be
clear about the progress that has been achieved over the past three
years. To develop our evidence base, we have successfully established
mechanisms for the collection of more robust baseline data. We have
also instituted a three year inspection process, which began in April
2006 when the CSCI had responsibility for inspecting local
authorities&#146; procedures for checking 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column186" />Column number: 186</div>and monitoring private fostering arrangements. That
responsibility was passed to Ofsted in April 2007. At the same time,
the local authorities had been working hard to raise awareness of the
notification requirements, implement them more effectively and build
more trust in the relationships with local communities.</div>
<a name="080701129000273"></a><div class="hs_Para">Raising
awareness cannot simply be achieved through disseminating leaflets and
other publicity material, important though that is. It requires
building stronger relationships with communities, and it will take time
to embed the practice of notification in all areas. Next January, the
Department for Children, Schools and Families is making available
&#163;50,000 for the British Association of Adoption and Fostering to
fund a national awareness-raising week in January 2009 on the
notification arrangements.</div>
<a name="080701129000274"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
acknowledge hon. Members&#146; concerns, and clearly it will take
time for the practice of notification in all areas to improve, even
with the measures that we have taken. It is perhaps fair to say that it
was over-optimistic to predict when we were passing the 2004 Act that
we would have got as far by now as the hon. Gentleman would like, but I
make no apology for wanting to get that right. Our evidence so far
tells us that there is scope to improve the implementation of the
current arrangements and points to some good examples of good practice.
The first year&#146;s inspection evidence revealed that 50 local
authorities showed some very good and improving practice as well as
some other areas where there was a lot of room for
improvement.</div><a name="080701129000275"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="080701129000423"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Andrew Turner</b> (Isle of Wight) (Con): Why is the Minister
prepared to go so slowly in the case of private fostering arrangements
when others were happy to be in favour of fast legislation, such as
that relating to fox
hunting?</div><a name="080701129000276"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080701129000424"></a>Kevin
Brennan:</b> Because in acknowledging that the Government have
by no means abandoned the idea of a registration scheme, we also
acknowledge that there are also difficulties with a registration
scheme&#151;I think that the hon. Member for East Worthing and
Shoreham went some way towards acknowledging that in his remarks. It is
right to first gather further evidence on the notification scheme
before proceeding to a registration scheme that could and would catch
many families&#151;the hon. Gentleman often raises the point of the
state intrusion in family life. We do not necessarily want to insist on
a registration scheme, and yet we have not abandoned it. We want to
give the changes that have been made the correct amount of time so that
we can collect the evidence that is necessary to make that
judgment.</div>
<a name="080701129000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">Therefore,
we are not yet convinced of the need to move into a registration
scheme, and how best to safeguard children in private fostering is
simply not that clear cut. The hon. Gentleman acknowledged that a
registration scheme might not be a panacea for all the difficulties
with private fostering and that a rushed and heavy-handed
implementation of the scheme might deter some people from private
fostering who might otherwise be able to offer support in difficult
family
situations.</div><a name="080701129000278"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080701129000425"></a>Mr.
Timpson:</b> Will the Minister give us an assurance that he
supports the principle that private fostering arrangements are there to
protect vulnerable children? Is the only barrier to moving to that
scheme a lack of the evidence that he requires to bring that principle
to bear?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column187" />Column number: 187</div><a name="080701129000279"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080701129000426"></a>Kevin
Brennan:</b> I think that the hon. Gentleman meant the
principle of a registration scheme for private fostering. That is how I
interpreted his remarks. I have made it clear that the Government are
not yet convinced that that is the best way to deal with private
fostering. On the other hand, we have not abandoned the idea that
registration might be the best way. We simply want to ensure that the
evidence on the notification scheme is full and clear.</div>
<a name="080701129000280"></a><div class="hs_Para">I stress
that we are supported in that view by the British Agencies for Adoption
and Fostering, which works extensively on private fostering. The BAAF
agrees that we should seek to ensure that the current arrangements
operate effectively and evaluate them more fully before deciding
whether to introduce a registration scheme. In my view, it would not be
in the interest of children or those who work with them to do
otherwise.</div><a name="080701129000281"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
intended effect of the new clause seems to be that within the next
year, the Secretary of State would have to make regulations in respect
of England to establish a registration scheme for private foster
carers. We believe that before moving to that scheme, we need to
evaluate the existing notification scheme, having taken the measures
that I outlined to make it more effective. Then we need to consider
whether such a regime would be more effective than what we have at
present and what its added value would be.</div>
<a name="080701129000282"></a><div class="hs_Para">If we then
decide to move to registration, we will have to draft and consult on
the regulations. All of that would take more than the year proposed in
the new clause anyway. We must ensure enough time to gather the
necessary evidence, analyse it and make a sound, evidence-based
decision. The key problem is that we have only one full year&#146;s
data on the number of private fostering arrangements under the
strengthened notification scheme. By 2010, we will have three full
years of data as well as the results of three years of inspection by
Ofsted, and we will know the impact of further activity to raise
notification
levels.</div><a name="080701129000283"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are determined to improve the current arrangements and explore to what
extent they might be improved. We are writing to local authorities to
remind them of their duties in relation to private fostering, and
Government offices are working with local authorities, particularly
poor performers, to improve notification rates. We are also exploring
links with other related policies, such as those concerning missing
children, to ensure that information about private fostering is
included in the relevant
guidance.</div><a name="080701129000284"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
mentioned BAAF&#146;s awareness-raising week in January 2009. It is
right to retain the option to introduce a registration scheme for the
further years envisaged in the Bill so that we can ensure that if the
case for it is compelling, a registration scheme can be introduced at
the right time, after the assessment of the strengthened notification
scheme.</div><a name="080701129000285"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
know that the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham does not want
us to go any further on our journey down Sunset Boulevard in relation
to the clause, but it is appropriate, having strengthened the
notification scheme, to give it an opportunity to provide evidence
whether it can work. That is a practical and pragmatic way forward, and
I propose that he should withdraw his
amendment.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080701129000427"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> The Minister has succeeded in driving
disappointment to new heights. That was pretty weak. I am a big fan of
sunset clauses in legislation, but the point of sunset clauses is that
the sun must set some time, and this is proving to be a long,
protracted
sunset.</div><a name="080701129000287"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister prayed in aid BAAF, for which another &#163;50,000 will be
made available for an awareness scheme. BAAF&#146;s position when we
last discussed the matter was
this:</div><a name="080701129000324"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
British Association for Adoption and Fostering (BAAF) believes the best
way to protect and safeguard privately fostered children is by
implementing a registration and approval system for the most vulnerable
children&#148;.</div><a name="080701129000288"></a><div class="hs_Para">BAAF,
along with so many other agencies and organisations involved with
vulnerable children, thinks that a private fostering registration
scheme is the way ahead. I do not get why the Government want to
prevaricate on this one.</div>
<a name="080701129000289"></a><div class="hs_Para">I quote from
the closing comments of the then Minister for Children, Young People
and Families, the right hon. Member for
Barking:</div><a name="080701129000325"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;if

Minister also used the language, &#147;We haven&#146;t abandoned it
yet.&#148;</div>
<a name="080701129000291"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
has produced absolutely no evidence why the Government should have gone
lukewarm on the scheme after all our considerations in 2004. I asked
him for evidence from the local safeguarding children boards, as he did
not mention them once. Where did that evidence come from? There is
anecdotal evidence of a few examples of best practice. Great. But it
still produced only a small number of adherents to the existing
notification scheme. He said that there is no evidence right now after
a further three years. What further evidence will it take? He
said&#151;another get-out&#151;that they had just established a
mechanism for the collection of more robust data. How long does it take
before they have the systems to collect sufficiently robust
data?</div><a name="080701129000292"></a><div class="hs_Para">He
said&#151;yet another get-out&#151;that it is about building
stronger relationships with communities. It has always been about
building stronger relationships with communities but they have
singularly failed to get that message across to those highest target
communities. He then said that it was perhaps an over-optimistic
prediction. This really is very weak. He also said that there would be
difficulties setting up a scheme. I acknowledge that, but it does not
mean that those difficulties are insurmountable. They have had 11 years
since Sir William Utting first mentioned this whole registration
scheme. That is 11 years to get round those difficulties and still they
need more
time.</div><a name="080701129000293"></a><div class="hs_Para">They
are not going to have much more time. The sun is about to set on the
Government. They will not be in a position to do anything about this
sunset clause. So I offer the Minister a deal: will he reconsider his
comments so we can re-examine this on Report in the light of what
Opposition Members have said? We have urged him just to get on and do
it. We will table a more comprehensive amendment on Report which will
take in Wales and make it clear that a registration scheme will be
